Accordingly , in order to add conceptual and technical rigour to determination of fair value of annual guarantee fee , the Group recommends a conceptually rigorous and technically robust methodology for computing fair value of annual guarantee fee which simulates/models the dynamically evolving distribution of claims settled such that if the model-generated fair value guarantee fee per annum is charged , there will be , at 99.9 one-tailed confi dence interval , only 0.1 probability that the claims settled will exceed the guarantee fees collected.

Periodically , the then-current referenced rate is compared to a base referenced rate defined at the establishment of the guarantee period. If the referenced rate has increased , the interest rate that will be credited to the annuity account value will increase by an amount that is based on the amount of increase in the referenced rate. If the referenced rate has not changed or has decreased , the interest rate that will be credited to the annuity account value will be the guaranteed base interest rate . </guarantee.n.141><guarantee.n.142>This rationale applies with equal force to low-interest NOW accounts ( with interest rates no higher than 0.50 percent through December 31 , 2009 ) .

This means that the interest rate after the sweep must be no higher than the interest rate before the sweep. Assuming the satisfaction of this requirement , the swept funds will continue to be protected under the transaction account guarantee program.

The risk weight assigned to an off-balance sheet item is determined by a two-step process. First , the face amount of the off-balance sheet item is multiplied by the appropriate credit conversion factor specified in this section. This calculation translates the face amount of an off-balance sheet item into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. Second , the resulting credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the proper risk category using the criteria regarding obligors , guarantors , and collateral listed in section 3 ( a ) of this appendix A. Collateral and guarantees are applied to the face amount of an off-balance sheet item; however , with respect to derivative contracts unders section 3 ( b ) ( 5 ) of this appendix A , collateral and guarantees are applied to the credit equivalent amounts of such derivative contracts. The following are the credit conversion factors and the off-balance sheet items to which they apply.

See ante , at 730 731. Under the standard the Court articulates , however , the Clause was violated. Each of the three States has a statute setting an interest rate that is different from the FPC rate , and the Supreme Court of Kansas offered no valid reason whatsoever for ignoring those statutory rates. Neither has this Court suggested a colorable argument that could support the Kansas court 's decision , and its affirmance of that decision effectively converts an important constitutional guarantee into a precatory admonition . </guarantee.n.192><guarantee.n.193>20.

The specification has been faulted by many authors as being ambiguous and incorrect. One major criticism raised by Abadi and Stata [ 1998 ] concerns jsr/ret instructions , which are used to implement the Java try/catch/finally construct. As the criticism goes , because jsr and ret are asymmetric -- -jsr pushes a return address on the stack , ret returns to a return address in a local variable -- -there is no guarantee that jsr subroutines exhibit LIFO ( last-in-first-out ) behavior; in other words , there is no guarantee that a ret instruction returns to the most recent call site. The analysis is further complicated by the polymorphism of jsr subroutines over untouched local variables. Abadi and Stata [ 1998 ] ( see also O'Callahan [ 1999 ] ) devise a fairly involved type system and show that it guarantees LIFO behavior. However , they avoid issue of whether the original worklist algorithm is correct . </guarantee.n.211><guarantee.n.212>Marathon Bank has elected to participate in the FDIC 's Transaction Account Guarantee Program.

Municipal bond insurers insure about 50 of all new money bond issues. In the event the issuer fails to meet a scheduled principal or interest payment , the insurer , acting as a third-party guarantor , will make that debt service payment to the bondholder on time and in full. The bond insurer receives an upfront insurance premium for the guarantee , the amount of which is determined primarily by the perceived risk associated with the financing. Bond insurance premiums are typically charged based on a percentage , such as .2-2 , times the principal and interest paid over the life or maturity of an issue. Unlike bank letters of credit that must typically be renewed every 3-5 years , bond insurance remains in place for the entire term of the bonds.

These requirements might not be satisfied in the case of a NOW account with a tiered-rate structure or a NOW account with a fluctuating interest rate. For example , the deposit contract might provide that 0.30 percent shall be paid on funds up to a designated dollar amount while 0.60 percent shall be paid on funds above that amount. If the account is structured in this manner , the entire NOW account product will not be covered under the transaction account guarantee program even if the balance of an individual account is less than the designated dollar amount.

UkrSib Bank makes loans to CSEs for improvements on municipal infrastructure such as water supply , wastewater disposal and district heating. Under the facility , the U.S. government will issue a guarantee on 50 of the net principal loss. The guarantee covers principal only for the loans issued. USAID ' s experience with municipal finance indicates that a mid-sized Ukrainian city ( population of 200 , 000-400 , 000 ) should be able to service ( amortization plus interest ) a larger loan from current cash flows than the $ 100 , 000 - $ 200 , 000 projected for individual credits. Because this is a new market , however , the facility adopts a conservative borrowing strategy until the CSEs establish a track record of successful municipal borrowings. The activity is expected to replicate itself as banks and CSEs reap mutual benefits from loans made under the facility; in time , it is expected that lending volumes will increase on their own , in the absence of U.S. Government guarantees . </guarantee.n.798><guarantee.n.799>A direct loan is a disbursement of funds by the Federal government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract that requires repayment of such funds with or without interest.

Similarly , if the creditor materially changes the contract with the debtor ( eg giving more time to pay ) , the surety is discharged ( at least to the extent that the surety is harmed ) .

The consequence of the doctrine is that these obligations have less risk in the market than the true risk generated by the activities of the covered firms.

Market commentary repeatedly cites an implicit government guarantee of GSE debt as the rationale for the narrow spread.

Banks generally insist on secondary collateral , particularly in the form of immovable property as also third party guarantee , in order to hedge against default in the small loan segment. As availability of timely and adequate bank credit without the hassles of collateral and third party guarantees is of essence to small fi rst generation entrepreneurs to realise their dream of setting up their own MSEs , the Reserve Bank of India had enjoined upon banks not to take secondary collateral from MSE units with credit limits upto Rs. 5 lakh . </guarantee.n.1003><guarantee.n.1004>Our Institution has elected to participate in the FDIC ' s Transaction Account Guarantee Program.

Both components of the program will be paid for by direct user fees. Institutions participating in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program provide customers full coverage on non-interest-bearing transaction accounts for an annual fee of 10 basis points. Fees for participation in the Debt Guarantee Program depend on the maturity of debt issued. The cost of the guarantee to insured depository institutions is 50 basis points for maturities of 180 days or less , 75 basis points for maturities of 181 days to 364 days , and 100 basis points for maturities 365 days or greater. Bank holding companies and participating affiliates are required to pay an additional 10 basis points if , as of September 30 , 2008 , the combined assets of all insured depository institutions affiliated with such entity constitute less than 50 percent of consolidated holding company assets . </guarantee.n.1005><guarantee.n.1006>A form of loan collateral similar to a guarantee but not expressly regulated by law. Loans can be secured by assigning claims and other rights of the borrower to the lending bank. In addition , a claim the borrower has on a third party can be assigned to the bank through a deed. This deed of assignment is made between the creditor of this claim , known as the assignor , and the bank or another secured party , known as the assignee , without the participation of the debtor of the claim. The deed is valid in informal form. In addition to this silent assignment , there is an open assignment in which the third party debtor is informed about the assignment. A distinction is also made between the assignment of individual claims and a blanket or global assignment. While , in the case of a blanket assignment , the borrower assigns different outstanding debts , yet future claims are only deemed to be assigned once these claims have been submitted to the bank , in the case of global assignments , all current and future claims on specific third party debtors are assigned , and thus deemed to be assigned as soon as they arise . </guarantee.n.1006><guarantee.n.1007>[ Footnote ] issued more than three years ago , which remanded a same sex marriage claim back to a Hawaii trial court for a determination of whether denial of a marriage license was a violation of the Hawaii Constitution 's equal protection guarantee based on gender.

Thus , while H.R. 3396 is characterized as a response to an imminent ' threat of same sex marriage being forced on the nation by several judges of the Hawaii Supreme Court ( and to the rest of the nation through the claimed legal compulsion of the of the Full Faith and Credit clause ) , in fact there is nothing imminent.

This problem can get magnified in a collaborative environment where distributed , heterogeneous and autonomous organizations interoperate with each other. Collaboration in such a diverse environment requires integration of local policies to compose a global security policy for controlling information accesses across multiple domain. Integration of security policies , local to the collaborating domains , entails various challenges regarding reconciliation of semantic differences , secure interoperability , containment of risk propagation , and policy management etc. An access control model that can be used to uniformly represent policies of the individual domains is desirable. Such a model should allow interoperation and information sharing among multiple domains and at the same time guarantee that such inter-domain data accesses do not violate the underlying policies of constituent domains . </guarantee.n.1021><guarantee.n.1022>If Majestic Trees does not plant the tree ( s ) , the only warranty offered is a guarantee that the stock was supplied structurally sound , had a good root system , was in good health , and true-to-type.

Transfer of insurance risks to non-insurance companies is very limited [ 6 ] . </guarantee.n.1086><guarantee.n.1087>Conversely , for banks , small business loans are on the risky side of the spectrum.

The possible reasons for that behavior were many : regulators were unprepared and overwhelmed by the large number of insolvencies , they thought the insurance funds were inadequate to resolve all insolvencies , they were concerned about calling additional attention to the problem and igniting widespread public fear and runs , they bowed to political pressures from the banking industry or Congress , and they feared stains on their own records. Insolvent banks continued to operate by implicitly substituting public capital ( the perceived government guarantee ) for private capital. But as the magnitude of the problem increased , the cost of continued regulatory delay became more widely visible. The government ' s large implicit and hidden liability , equal to much , if not all , of the negative net worth at insolvent insured institutions , became clearer to the public. Increased transparency and public concern forced the regulators to accelerate the process of formally recognizing and resolving insolvencies. The high cost of the debacle also strengthened attempts to reform the insurance structure , so as to decrease the potential for future moral hazard behavior by banks and poor agency behavior by regulators . </guarantee.n.1144><guarantee.n.1145>Internet Planners has a 30-day money back guarantee for hosting in all but a few situations.

It may therefore be available in support of a defence to an action , and money paid under it can not be recovered. An indemnity is not a guarantee within the statute , unless it contemplates the primary liability of a third person. It need not , therefore , be in writing when it is a mere promise to become liable for a debt , whenever the person to whom the promise is made should become liable ( Wildes v. Dudlow , L.R. 19 Eq. 198; per Vaughan Williams , L.J. in Harburg India-Rubber Co. v. Martin , 1902 , 1 K.B. p. 786; Guild v. Conrad , 1894 , 2 Q.B. 885 C.A. ) . Neither does the statute apply to the promise of a del credere agent , which binds him , in consideration of the higher commission he receives , to make no sales on behalf of his principal except to persons who are absolutely solvent , and renders him liable for any loss that may result from the non-fulfilment of his promise.

How serious is this problem of collateralism ? Under such a system , companies with otherwise promising futures can not raise funds necessary for their business simply because they have no real estate collateral to pledge. Indeed , this is exactly why it is necessary to create new flows of money that are not dependant on real estate collateral. In this regard , however , considerable efforts have been made by individual financial institutions and the regulatory authorities. For instance , the size of " business loans " - uncollateralized bank loans to small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) - has been expanding rapidly; business loans are emerging as an increasingly important method of financing for companies without collateralizable assets.

For the uninitiated , an AAA rated bundle of high risk mortgages sounds like an oxymoron. There are two levels to the answer : First , if you take a bundle of 10 such high risk mortgages the chances of the whole bundle going belly up are pretty slim. Bundling is a real risk mitigation device. That in itself , however , still would not seem to justify AAA ratings , because the risk of some failures-as has been demonstrated at the subprime level-is substantially greater than zero. Second though , as seen by the mortgage backed security buyer , the risk of failure was rendered minimal , because _Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guaranteed payment of the interest and principal on all mortgages in the bundle , even if individual mortgage holders defaulted_. The AAA rating flowed from this guarantee , not from the intrinsic security of any mortgage bundle . </guarantee.n.1386><guarantee.n.1387>An applicant or licensee may provide reasonable assurance of the availability of funds for decommissioning based on furnishing its own guarantee that funds will be available for decommissioning costs and on a demonstration that the company passes the financial test of Section II of this appendix.

When financing a vehicle , the calculation of a possible loss for the bank can follow this scenario : if , for example , the balance of the loan is 10 , 000 and its value is 8 , 000 , then , in the event that the client would stop paying his loan , the financial institution would record a loss of 2 , 000 with the vehicle as guaranty as opposed to 10 , 000 without guaranty.

Shared Interest maintains this reserve fund at the level of at least 5 of its outstanding guarantees. However , it increases the level of coverage in response to risk ratings that Thembani conducts and reports quarterly on outstanding guarantees. Should a potential guarantee require protection that exceeds the level Shared Interest is able to provide , the guarantee is not issued. In the event that the Shared Interest reserve fund is exhausted , Shared Interest will draw on a pool of subordinated loans before utilizing investors ' principal.

If you find yourself in this situation we suggest that you contact the solicitors who acted for you previously and discuss the matter with them . </guarantee.n.1964><guarantee.n.1965>" There is no guarantee that interest rates will remain low beyond this year , " adds Bien.

Internet deposit services are defined broadly to include not only deposit taking , but any activity related to a deposit account , such as the ability to pay bills , transfer funds , view account balances , or obtain any account specific information. " Internet deposit services , " " on-line banking services , " and " internet banking services " are used interchangeably in these questions and answers . </guarantee.n.1969><guarantee.n.1970>( 3 ) The administration of this program is totally separate from the loan programs administered by colleges and universities throughout the State whose lending and collection experiences are quite dissimilar. For fiscal year 1989 , the authority 's default rate was one and seven-tenths percent. Student loans made by the corporation from the revenue bond proceeds of the authority are one hundred percent guaranteed by the authority against the death , disability , or default of the student borrower. This guarantee does not in any way represent a pledge of the state 's full faith and credit. The guarantee is limited to monies available in a reserve fund maintained by the authority funded through an insurance premium of three-fourths percent which is deducted from the loan made to each student borrower. On June 30 , 1989 , there was approximately one and six-tenths million dollars in the reserve fund . </guarantee.n.1970><guarantee.n.1971>To obtain the full benefit of the approach suggested above , the amount of guarantees permitted under Section 102 of the Act should to be increased. The no cost strategy suggested in the discussion might be persuasive in achieving that increase. Furthermore , care must be taken to assure that an applicant institution ' s performing subprime loans are included in the guarantee and that loans that are not performing prior to the guarantee are not included except if it is determined that they can reasonably be expected to be viable pursuant to the lower interest rate or subsidy program. The enforcement of those requirements with appropriate penalty provisions would appear to be in order . </guarantee.n.1971><guarantee.n.1972>Presidential Life 's Liberty Series SPDA offers a 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4-year current interest crediting rate guarantee. Subsequent renewal interest rates are subject to the contract lifetime minimum interest rate guarantee****.

The owner of Liberty Series SPDA has the right to take a 10 surrender charge-free withdrawal in the first contract year calculated on the paid premium and in subsequent years , calculated on the beginning year contract value. The owner may also make complete withdrawal of the contract 's accumulation value if the renewal interest rate , following any interest rate guarantee period , falls more than 2.00 below their current interest rate. This is the bailout feature and it must be elected within a 60 calendar day period following the renewal interest rate date . </guarantee.n.1972><guarantee.n.1973>Here the guarantee reduces the interest expense from £ 60 to £ 50 , with a corresponding increase in risk for the guarantor.

One dilemma could be whether bonus reserves should be used to meet the guarantees made to " old " clients in future , or whether they should be used to support new clients ' bonus expectations ( at times , pension companies ' competition for new customers has pushed up the prevailing deposit interest rate considerably ) .

However , findings from our analysis show that the deepening of the lender-borrower relationship results in lower lending rates , that is , other lending conditions - except for collateral and personal guarantees - are more favorable to borrowing companies.

The Group observed that there were few entities which provided factoring services without recourse to the MSE sector. Such service providers were not lenders and did not come under the defi nition of MLIs. The Group discussed the issue of bringing the factoring companies within the purview of CGS as these institutions provide liquidity to MSE sector against the receivables of the latter. After deliberations , the Group felt that as most buyers of the goods from MSE units are large corporates , extending guarantee to factors will effectively lead to guaranteeing the defaults of large corporates and CGS of CGTMSE is not meant for that purpose. There may be few cases where both the sellers and buyers are MSE units. However , as the loans extended to both the MSE units are covered under CGS , the Group does not recommend bringing factors under the guarantee scheme of CGTMSE as it would encourage another level of intermediation and resultant additional costs to MSEs . </guarantee.n.2447><guarantee.n.2448>We would be pleased to assist you in getting your unit operating to your absolute satisfaction.

That language , which preceded the FDICIA reforms , is not by itself a full faith and credit guarantee of insured deposits; at most , it creates a moral obligation of the federal government.

A republican form of government is distinguished from a pure democracy , which the Founding Fathers wanted to avoid; as James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 10 , " Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.

A shorter , related article about the deal that created Vivendi Universal Entertainment mischaracterized details of a guarantee that provided Mr. Diller with a 1.5 percent VUE stake that was worth no less than $ 275 million. Mr. Diller never asked InterActive shareholders to provide the guarantee. That article also misstated the timing of a $ 245 million charge recorded by InterActive to reflect the reduced value of its stake in Vivendi Universal Entertainment. The charge was taken in the first quarter of 2003 , not the second quarter. That article also referred incorrectly to a recommendation made this year by Institutional Shareholder Services , an investor advisory firm , that InterActive shareholders withhold votes for three directors.

This guarantee agreement a basic guaranty agreement that may be used by a Creditor to cause a person or entity to guarantee the debt or performance of another. A Guaranty may be limited to a stated amount or particular performance. It may also be continuing if it covers ongoing transactions.

The credit guarantee schemes serve the larger public policy objectives of promoting entrepreneurship in the country and to provide credit to the SMEs which commonly lack the kind of collaterals required by the banks and simultaneously reducing the credit risk of the lenders. According to ADB ( 2007 ) , it is also argued that well-designed , well-funded and well-implemented credit guarantee schemes can improve SME access to credit and their integration into formal fi nancial markets , assist SMEs to obtain fi nance for working capital , fi xed assets and investment at reasonable conditions , and enable smaller fi rms to improve their competitiveness and extend their economic activity. This will ultimately translate into improved business performance and job creation . In some countries , a high proportion of SMEs are serviced by guaranteed loans e.g. Japan 38 , South Korea 20 , and Taiwan 20 .

Warranty existed before it was subsumed into tenurial relationships and a guarantee of land; its origins seem to have been in Anglo-Saxon chattel warranty ( at least as early as the 10th century ) , so that warranty as such originally guaranteed that the chattels sold were owned by the seller.

Whilst higher EALs involve more detailed documentation , analysis and testing than lower ones , ( and is also more costly ) , a product with a higher EAL certification is not necessarily more secure than one with a lower EAL. This is because to achieve a particular EAL products must meet specific " assurance requirements " , but do not need to fulfil the same functional requirements - this is dependent on the Security Target document tailored for each product 's evaluation. So whilst Xerox has certified its products at EAL2 level , it claims to be the only manufacturer to have certified complete products , rather than just kits of subsets of functionality.

The indemnity has been mentioned; in addition , there are contracts of insurance , comfort letters and performance guarantees. Performance guarantees will be dealt with separately at the end of this Section. An insurance contract is really an indemnity. A comfort letter is an amorphous obligation and is typically given in a situation where a parent company is unwilling to give a guarantee in respect of a subsidiary ' s liability. Instead , it gives a letter to the creditor and in that letter acknowledges awareness of the proposed financing to the subsidiary and adds a ( hopefully ) harmless statement such as that ' it is our policy to ensure that our subsidiary is in a position to perform its obligations ' . Depending on the actual words used and the circumstances of the case , a comfort letter may be either a legal undertaking ( equivalent to a guarantee ) or simply a placebo which carries no legal obligation . </guarantee.n.2684><guarantee.n.2685>Each account is credited with the corresponding base interest rate for an initial pre-defined period , which is some portion of the guarantee period.

Now that the FDIC has announced that it is insolvent -- i.e. , its net worth is negative -- naturally it has become a hot topic.

The transaction would still be in full compliance with the interest rates provisions of the Arrangement.

The use of the initiative , referendum , and recall are all tools of " direct democracy , " that allow the electorate to exercise legislative power independently from their republican representatives. The Supreme Court faced a challenge to the use of statewide initiatives in Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Oregon , 223 U.S. 118 ( 1912 ) . In that case , the Court held that challenges to a state 's republican character are non-justiciable political questions , and that the decision of whether a state is " republican " in conformance with the guarantee clause may be decided only by Congress.

As a result , interest will not give rise to a current tax deduction in the U.S. What 's more , it appears that the potential $ 800 tax savings discussed in the Journal is overstated and , in fact , the deal may not , after factoring in tax savings , produce a return that equals or exceeds Anheuser-Busch 's cost of capital . </guarantee.n.2954><guarantee.n.2955>World Council for the Cedars Revolution - " Junblatt : Syria Proposes to Guarantee Israel Security in return for Leb ...

Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market , interest-rate , issuer , credit , and inflation risk. High-yield , lower-rated , securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations , and economic and political risks , which may be enhanced in emerging markets. Government securities are backed by the full faith of the issuing government; portfolios that invest in them are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates , subject to early repayment risk , and while generally backed by a government , government-agency or private guarantor there is no assurance that the guarantor will meet its obligations. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity , interest rate , market , credit , management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested.

Warrantee is a rare legal term that means the person to whom a warrant is made. Although guarantee can be a verb ( we guarantee your satisfaction ) , warranty is not. The rarely used verb form is to warrant. </guarantee.n.2961><guarantee.n.2962>* To return a product based upon BVS ' replacement/return guarantee , you must obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization ( " RMA " ) number within the guarantee return period for the product ( described above ) .

Generally , the average period of cover is about 5 years and , therefore , the per annum guarantee fee for say , credit facility above Rs. 5 lakh , works out to 0.30 ( 1.5 divided by 5 ) which gives a composite all-in-fee of roughly 1.05 per annum ( 0.30 plus 0.75 ) . This is very close to the more rigorously worked out annual guarantee fee of 1.14 p.a. The Group , therefore , recommends that the CGTMSE may charge composite , all-in guarantee fee of 1 p.a. which is almost the same as the composite annual fee now being charged by CGTMSE and appropriately realign downwards the guarantee fees chargeable to women entrepreneurs , Micro enterprises and units located in NE Region including Sikkim.

Traditionally , the Vietnamese state-owned commercial banks have directed their lending to big state-owned enterprises as a target group of clients , leaving most SMEs to the private banks. For their part , private banks have followed a policy of collateral-based lending that requires the borrower to pledge substantial collateral in return for a loan.

The firm also said its credit-related expenses reached $ 193 million in the quarter , more than triple the $ 60 million a year earlier.

John 6 : 29 ) . Exhortations in the bible to true believers to lead faithful lives indicate by their existence and context that there is no guarantee that true believers will lead lives faithful to their beliefs. The very existence of these letters in the New Testament indicates that there is no guarantee that true believers who are truly saved and truly secure in their salvation will truly lead faithful lives. Hence not being faithful to any degree is not a true indicator that one is not truly saved.

I am convinced that they have for years recognized that the required bailout would be just too big to take on.

There are two main reasons for such an approach. Firstly , the surety is entering into liability not for himself but for a third person; it is therefore the duty of the creditor to see that the obligation is couched in clear terms so that the surety understands the liability he is undertaking. Secondly , the surety often receives no benefit for his onerous obligation. An opposing view is that a guarantee should be construed no differently from other contracts.

In this case if the loan defaults the courts would pursue the individual for repayment. This of course can be dangerous if the guarantee was not specifically tied to a particular amount or asset purchase because it can leave the guarantor up for company wide losses not just their loan.
