In some instances , the homeowner is able to catch up with the back payments and to continue to own their property. There are several approaches to obtaining a pre-foreclosure property. They include but are not limited to owner negotiation , short sale , and mortgage " catch-up " coupled with a buy/sell agreement. The basic premise is that in an effort to avoid the damaging effects of foreclosure on the homeowner 's personal financial credit a negotiated out might be a viable exit strategy. The owner sells the home for what is owed on the note and is given a dollar amount for relocation plus a portion of their equity. Pre-foreclosure offers a very clean transition of ownership with very little risk as inspections may be conducted before closing.

Losses resulting from the position are automatically deducted from the initial margin by the end of each trading day and then a top up would be needed as determined by the maintenance margin when the initial margin runs low. This is totally different from options margin as no deductions from the cash held is made at the end of each day even if the position is in a loss . </margin.n.370><margin.n.371>Net interest margin : The difference between a bank ' s interest income ( from loans ) and its interest expense ( on deposits ) .

To calculate it only to financial figure is needed; the net income and the net sales for a specific period of time , usually for a full fiscal period. Net sales of a company is the sales minus all sales tax , product returns and discounts. The actual meaning of the after-tax profit margin is how much taxed profit each sales dollar is making. To expand this thought , after-tax profit margin tells investors how much money the company is making per each sold product or service. In other words , this means that how much cash the company is receiving for each product or service , or how much each revenue dollar is worth to the company. Obviously the higher this number is the better , financially speaking , because the company makes more money on each sales.

As the reader 's eye crosses the page , it is hard not to slip off the page and back into reality. In Promethea , Moore and Williams use bleeds for pretty much every page , which can be read as another iteration of the series ' theme of the blurring of boundaries between imagination and reality. Or take the case of Carla Speed McNeil 's Finder : Dream Sequence. She shifts between the conventional margin and the bleed , often in a way that highlights the protagonist 's shifting consciousness between reality and the virtual world he inhabits , which is a primary theme of the book. In a way this relates back to something Groensteen wrote about margins and the page : " In autonomizing the work , in the isolation of the exterior reality , it [ the margin ] accomplishes its closure and constitutes it [ the page ] as an object of contemplation; in the case of comics , an object of reading.

A firm 's house requirements can be higher - but not lower - than the legal minimums. For example , a firm could have a minimum margin requirement of 30 . In this example , if the market value of the securities declines , brining your equity below 30 , you 'd be required to deposit enough funds or securities to restore your equity to at least 30 . Some firms set higher margin requirements for certain stocks , such as volatile Internet stocks. A firm can change its margin requirements on a stock immediately and without advance notice , resulting in the issuance of a margin call.

More recently , intensity maps with increased intensity near the edge of the tumour ( edge enhancements ) have been studied to evaluate their ability to offset similar effects that affect tumour coverage. In this paper , we present a mathematical methodology to derive margin and edge-enhanced intensity maps that aim to provide tumour coverage while delivering minimum total dose. We show that if the tumour is at most about twice as large as the standard deviation of the blurring distribution , the optimal intensity map is a pure scaling increase of the static intensity map without any margins or edge enhancements. Otherwise , if the tumour size is roughly twice ( or more ) the standard deviation of motion , then margins and edge enhancements are preferred , and we present formulae to calculate the exact dimensions of these intensity maps. Furthermore , we extend our analysis to include scenarios where the parameters of the motion distribution are not known with certainty , but rather can take any value in some range. In these cases , we derive a similar threshold to determine the structure of an optimal margin intensity map . </margin.n.475><margin.n.476>Mechanical binding , using coils , spirals or loops , requires that the cover and pages be punched with holes near the binding edge , so that metal or plastic wires or bands can be woven through the holes.

He gives us the example of a page with black margins. The black margins act not only to evoke mood , but also , by making black the color of the negative space , to activate white as a color and a presence. This is opposed to the conventional margin which , in its " blank " whiteness , leaves the white in the panel as the absence of color. Other colored margins could also emphasize certain color combinations in the panels or act as an emotional expresser. Lynda Barry uses a different colored margin for each story section of her book One Hundred Demons , which not only gives each story a collective identity , but also interacts with the color scheme of each.

For example , if you place an order to buy 100 shares of Reliance , 100 of the order value is blocked from your limit and if you place an order to sell 100 shares of Reliance , 100 securities of Reliance are blocked in your Demat Account. On the other hand , in a margin order , only a specified of the order value is blocked from your limit. A sell order in the margin segment can be placed even without having any stock in demat account. However , unlike the sell order in the cash segment which can be placed without having any limit , a sell order in margin can be placed only if sufficient limit is available. The most important thing to understand is that though you can leverage on your trading limit with margin trading , the risk profile of your transactions goes up substantially . </margin.n.544><margin.n.545>Gross Margin Pre-tax net sales minus cost of sales.

I find evidence that an average relation between output price and exporter capability nets out highly disparate patterns of specialization : productive exporters simultaneously set high prices in quality differentiated industries and low prices in more homogeneous industries. This relationship between productivity , quality and price also emerges in the time series of average prices. Index number techniques identify firm entry and exit along the extensive margin after a change in the real exchange rate and the relative quality of marginal firms.

Dependent upon the composition of the trading account , Portfolio Margin may require a lower margin than that required under Reg T rules , which translates to greater leverage. Trading with greater leverage involves greater risk of loss. There is also the possibility that , given a specific portfolio composed of positions considered as having higher risk , the requirement under Portfolio Margin may be higher than the requirement under Reg T. Part of the reasoning behind the creation of Portfolio Margin is that the margin requirements would more accurately reflect the actual risk of the positions in an account. Thus , it is possible that , in a highly concentrated account , a Portfolio Margin approach may result in higher margin requirements than under Reg T. One of the main goals of Portfolio Margin is to reflect the lower risk inherent in a balanced portfolio of hedged positions. Conversely , Portfolio Margin must assess proportionately larger margin for accounts with positions which represent a concentration in a relatively small number of stocks.

The lithosphere beneath passive margins is known as transitional lithosphere. The lithosphere thins seaward as it transitions seaward to oceanic crust. Different kinds of transitional crust form , depending on how fast rifting occurs and how hot the underlying mantle was at the time of rifting. Volcanic passive margins represent one endmember transitional crust type , the other endmember ( amagmatic ) type is the rifted passive margin. Volcanic passive margins they also are marked by numerous dykes and igneous intrusions within the subsided continental crust.

In her famous essay Marginality as a Site of Resistance , the writer bell hooks maintains that the margin gave her a keener perception of her world. To be marginalised was to be able to look at the world both from the outside-in and the inside-out. In this sense , marginality becomes a metaphor for various systemic problems faced by people. In sexuality politics , however , the margin-as-threshold always comes in the company of the margin-as-border. But at that point , the metaphor becomes a little less of a metaphor : this imaginary line does not simply mark people who have state benefits from those who do not , or mark those who are considered criminal from those who are not.

Following full deregulation of petroleum prices in 1981 , refining profitability in the United States reached its lowest point in 1984. The U.S. refining industry was plagued by a falloff in demand and massive amounts of excess crude oil distillation capacity. The net margin on the FRS companies ' U.S. refining and marketing operations was only 1 penny per barrel in 1984. However , the gross margin changed little from the previous peak profitability year of 1979. What did change was demand ( down 19 percent ) , capacity utilization ( down 9 percentage points ) , and operating costs ( up $ 1.80 ( $ 1995 ) per barrel ) . Moving to the peak profitability year of 1988 , most of the factors that devastated the bottom line in 1984 turned around : demand was up 17 percent , capacity utilization noticeably improved , and operating costs declined by more than $ 2 per barrel. Again , the gross margin changed little . </margin.n.680><margin.n.681>This is a collection of statistics and numbers to show the potential impact of Margin Changing , as well as some general stats I 've come across in my research about paper usage , the paper industry and the environment.

The I factor is introduced into the base shear as a modifier on the response modification coefficient , R , such that an effective response modification coefficient ( R/I ) is used to determine design force levels. The value of I varies from 1 for ordinary structures to 1.5 for essential structures. This has the effect of increasing the minimum presumed margin of 1.5 for ordinary structures to a value of ( 1.5 ) squared , or 2.25 , for essential structures. In addition to increasing the inherent safety margin in essential structures , the I factor also has the effect of increasing the load level at which elastic behavior can occur and therefore results in a raising of the threshold level at which damage is expected to initiate , consistent with the design goals of providing reduced damage and improved safety in important structures . </margin.n.791><margin.n.792>For an individual product , profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost of production.

Many strategies who use stock index futures can also use stock index options , which are similar in many ways.

This portion of the purchase price that investors deposit is known as the initial margin. Investors are not required , of course , to margin all the way up to the 50 and can certainly borrow less.

There is virtually no historical correlation between changes in year-over-year earnings and stock prices. The main problem is that the prospect for long-term returns hinges on whether the earnings and profit margins used by investors to value stocks are normal and sustainable , or unsustainable. Unless current profit margins can be sustained indefinitely , P/E multiples may turn out to be very unreliable measures of value. In addition , most meaningful profit recessions have been preceded by stock market declines. Lower prices led both of the earnings declines beginning in 1991 and 2001. While the earnings slowdown in 1998 was mild , it was also preceded by a drop of almost 20 percent in the market . </margin.n.913><margin.n.914>Gross margin pricing is a simple method that has been used for decades.

Graham demonstrated that this could be done by analyzing a company 's assets and business model and forecasting its future earnings. However , there are many ways to do this , and virtually all methods of calculating intrinsic value involve making predictions that may eventually prove to be inaccurate and/or could be influenced by unpredictable factors down the road. Decisions based on these methods therefore involve some degree of risk. For this reason , value-oriented investors generally try to incorporate a margin of safety that allows for these possibilities . </margin.n.933><margin.n.934>Markup : While we ' re at it , let ' s figure out your markup as well because your banker will want to know this number too. Like your gross profit margin , your markup is also expressed as a percentage : Sales Price minus Cost to Produce divided by Cost to Produce. In the case of the childcare center it would look like this : $ 8 , 000 ( sales price ) minus $ 5 , 000 ( cost to produce ) equals $ 3 , 000. $ 3 , 000 divided by $ 5 , 000 equals 60 percent.

Coastal plains are often dominated by fluvial processes , while the continental shelf is dominated by deltaic and longshore current processes. The great rivers ( Amazon. Orinoco , Congo , Nile , Ganges , Yellow , Yangtze , and Mackenzie rivers ) drain across passive margins. Extensive estuaries are common on mature passive margins. Although there are many kinds of passive margins , the morphologies of most passive margins are remarkably similar. Typically they consist of a continental shelf , continental slope , continental rise , and abyssal plain. The morphological expression of these features are largely defined by the underlying transitional crust and the sedimentation above it. Passive margins defined by a large fluvial sediment budget and those dominated by coral and other biogenous processes generally have a similar morphology. In addition , the shelf break seems to mark the maximum Neogene lowstand , defined by the glacial maxima. The outer continental shelf and slope may be cut by great submarine canyons , which mark the offshore continuation of rivers . </margin.n.984><margin.n.985>* Cuts dividend by 26 percent * Core profit slightly above analysts ' forecast * Expects net interest margin to rise in second-half SYDNEY , April 9 - Australian regional lender Bank of Queensland Ltd &lt; BOQ.AX &gt; ( BOQ ) ... </margin.n.985><margin.n.986>( A ) Determine to what extent ( if any ) each of its customer accounts fails to meet the maintenance margin requirements of the applicable board ( s ) of trade as of the close of business on the capital computation date.

Margin maximization is desirable for constant bit rate applications and provides protection against various non-stationary and bursty noise sources. Most single-user margin maximization algorithms rely on a fixed crosstalk assumption , which does not hold in DSM. Thus with direct extension of single-user algorithms in DSM scenarios , one user ' s margin maximization can lead to the failure of other users in meeting their target rates. In this paper , we explore the favorable monotonicity and fairness properties in multiuser margin and use them to formulate a box-constrained non-linear least squares ( NLSQ ) problem that can be solved by using a scaled gradient trust region approach with Broyden Jacobian update. This algorithm efficiently converges to a solution providing the best common equal margin to all users while explicitly guaranteeing that each user ' s target rate requirement is satisfied. The algorithm can be implemented in practical DSL-DSM scenarios with only Level-1 coordination . </margin.n.993><margin.n.994>One of the most common measures of financial strength.

Since many individuals did not have the equity to cover their margin positions , their shares were sold , causing further market declines and further margin calls. This was one of the major contributing factors which led to the Stock Market Crash of 1929 , which in turn contributed to the Great Depression [ 1 ] , a troubling financial time in the 1930s.

This refers to the range of conditions within which the building or machine will operate without breakage or failure. Triple redundancy is a term used in maritime , military and space applications. Each system has two additional , complete copies of itself in case of failure. Testing is a third term used in relation to margin of safety. Playground equipment , toys , child car safety seats , elevators , boats and exercise equipment are tested to a rating beyond their expected use. For example , a toy intended to be used by children 65 pounds and under will typically be tested to 300 or even 500 pounds. Elevators are tested to between 2000 and 5000 pounds. Overweight switches can stop the elevator if the weight limit is reached. Regularly operating a piece of equipment at either extreme of the margin of safety is not recommended . </margin.n.1201><margin.n.1202>... compare 2009 profits with the year before , when the recession was at its worst ... .

The pool surface , however , must be disturbed enough by the fall so as to set off the alarm. Since these alarms do work off a disturbance to the surface of the pool; your child could quietly walk down the steps , go under , drown , and never disturb the alarm or set it off ! ! ! They are quite inexpensive ( around $ 100 ) and better than nothing at all since they do detect some accidental falls if adjusted and placed properly. Alarm batteries and function should be checked often to increase the safety margin and effectiveness of this type of device. If this is your choice of protection; be sure the model you purchase has a remote alarm that will sound in the house and a local alarm that will also alert someone near the pool area . </margin.n.1203><margin.n.1204>When we read or print a PDF file , we will find that the file is n't always satisfying us.

The chapters on contentment and balance were especially helpful to me , partly because they probe deeper than behavioral issues into the motivations of the heart. Other positives in the book include Swenson 's extensive quotations from sociological and cultural researchers , his personal anecdotes , and his meditation on Scripture. Some weaknesses are an occasionally corny writing style , some weak interpretations of Scripture , and perhaps assuming too much from less than scientific research.

Otherwise known as the down payment , it 's the plain vanilla loan , popular all around. Typically , margin money is about 15 per cent of the value of the asset; lenders generally finance 85 per cent of the value. But how much margin money you pay depends on what the lender considers the safety of the underlying asset. For instance , some lenders are willing to lend up to 100 per of the value of a home , which effectively means that you do n't have to shell out any margin money. For vehicle loans , the amount depends on the lender 's comfort level. For instance , he may ask for a 15 per cent down payment if you buy a Maruti 800 , and 25 per cent on the cost of a Maruti Esteem . </margin.n.1211><margin.n.1212>Margins define the space surrounding an element.

Specimens were fixed and serially sectioned in their entirety , in numbered slices every 2 3 mm. Each slice was put in as many numbered separate cassettes as necessary and embedded in paraffin. The median number of blocks was 13 ( range : 3 47 ) . Each block was examined on one HES ( hematoxylin eosin safran ) -stained slide. Where there was suspicion of microinvasion , the blocks were examined on multiple levels. Microinvasion was defined as the presence of foci of invasive cells measuring less than 1 mm.19 In this study , only cases with up to two foci of invasion were included. The histological grade of DCIS was evaluated according to the European classification.20 The presence and amount of necrosis was recorded. The estimated pathologic size was calculated by multiplying the number of blocks ( slides ) with tumor by the thickness of the block ( 3 mm was used as a rule ) . The distance used to define the margin width was the narrowest distance between the tumor and any inked margin. In case of an immediate complementary excision , the margin of the second specimen was considered as the final margin . </margin.n.1218><margin.n.1219>Leverage is only one component of the overall risk picture. Limiting leverage by itself does not mitigate risk. Only stops or draw down limits can control risk. The maximum leverage determines the margin requirement of the trade.

All the toxicological end points that are relevant to the conditions in which the product is used must have been adequately addressed. In the best case , the risk assessment indicates that the ingredient or the product is ready to continue its journey towards the store shelves.

It is this very risk that drives the use of CFDs , either to speculate on movements in financial markets or to hedge existing positions elsewhere.

A cash accounting system records expenses as they are paid and revenues as they are received. Most organizations use accrual accounting , in which revenues and expenses are charged against the fiscal year to which they apply , rather than the year in which they are incurred. Thus , a payment for insurance made in 1 fiscal year that covers periods of 2 fiscal years will be allocated between the years. Revenues that will be received from Medicare , Medicaid , or other third-party payers will be estimated based on current charges and projected contractual adjustments pending final settlement with the payer , and bad debt and charity write-offs will likewise be estimated , if final payment has not been received. Once a fiscal year is closed , if the revenues or expenses differ from projection , the difference will often be recorded in the current fiscal year rather than restating the earlier year report . </margin.n.1301><margin.n.1302>Answer : Margins , also known as " margins of resection , " refer to the distance between a tumor and the edge of the surrounding tissue that 's removed along with it.

Margin requirements established by SPAN are based on the overall risk of positions held by a clearing member in both the clearing member 's house and customer accounts. SPAN then determines the overall risk of entire portfolios as calculated through options pricing models. SPAN-based margining requirements treat futures and options uniformly. The factors that affect option values in options pricing models include futures price , volatility , and time to expiration. As factors change , futures and options either gain or lose value. SPAN uses these factors to calculate the worst possible scenario and margins an entire portfolio on this basis.

Trading utilizing high leveraged accounts can potentially increase profits , but it increases your risk of potential losses. Most brokers have a standard leverage level of 100 : 1. Remember , the higher the leverage , the higher the risk. Traders in the FOREX market are subject to the margin rules set by their chosen brokers. In order to protect themselves and their traders , brokers in the FOREX market set margin requirements and levels at which traders are subject to margin calls. A margin call would occur when a trader is utilizing too much of their available margin ( cash deposit towards an open position ) . Spread across too many loosing trades , an over margined account can give a broker the right to close a trader ' s open positions . </margin.n.1340><margin.n.1341>In the below exhibit , you will see the supporting quarterly data for the last two years by business segment.

Let ' s say you want to buy one corn contract , so you place $ 675 in your brand new account. Corn prices fall seven cents , resulting in a loss of $ 350. Your account value now stands at $ 325 ( $ 675- $ 350 ) . The next day , the price of corn drops another two cents , causing you to lose $ 100 additional dollars. Your account value now stands at $ 225 , or $ 75 dollars below the maintenance margin. You will be required to deposit $ 450 dollars to bring your account back to the initial margin level of $ 675 ( $ 225 + $ 450 ) , although your most recent loss was only $ 75 , before which you didn ' t receive a margin call. The rule is that once your account falls below maintenance level , you must deposit enough funds to bring it back to the initial margin level . </margin.n.1343><margin.n.1344>The margin is the edge of the tumor where it meets the surrounding bone. To keep things simple , we 'll say a margin can be narrow , broad , or poorly defined. You want to visually assess how much distance there is at the edge of the tumor between the area that is clearly tumor , and the area that is clearly normal , undamaged , uninvolved bone. If the tumor and the surrounding normal bone are literally right next to each other and touching , and you see a very small distance between them , you are looking at a narrow margin. A narrow margin is as narrow as pencil line , perhaps 0.1 to 1.0 millimeters. If the tumor has a narrow margin , you can usually take a pencil and draw a line around the exact outline of the lesion - it 's that distinct . </margin.n.1344><margin.n.1345>It is also important to look at how a company ' s profit margin has changed over time ( say over a period of 5-6 years ) .

With this decrease in sales the contribution margin will decrease from $ 1950 to $ 1560. The break-even units will increase from 11 to 15. Lava Rocks will need to make $ 54 , 000 in order to break-even . </margin.n.1346><margin.n.1347>The width needs to be big enough so that the margin is n't repeated within the browser window. For example , if the margin part is 120 pixels wide and you make the white part 120 pixels wide as well , then the margin will appear every 240 pixels , which is not what you want.

Then the margin reflection layers 30 are arranged along the free edges of the respective peripheral edge reflection layers 31 so that the margin reflectionlayers 30 are inwardly directed and parallel with the rear surface reflection layer 29. Further , the edge of the rear surface reflection layer 29 which is juxtaposed with the primary light source 35 , or is free of the peripheral edge reflection layers31 and the margin reflection layers 30 , is extended outwardly and rounded inwardly , toward the liquid crystal display panel 6 , in order to form a semicircular cross section and define a primary light source reflection layer 32 . </margin.n.1348><margin.n.1349>Profit margin is Net Income divided by Gross Revenue ( or sales ) .

Apple mostly earns from hardware and less from services , so the margin between cost of hardware and price of the product plays a critical role in Apple 's balance sheets. But the cost of electronics components continues to reduce so the cost of manufacturing on the iPhone will also come down. So it is expected that the initial cost of the iPhone will come down , if Apple does n't add new hardware to it. There are slim chances of that , as the next iPhone 3G may also feature a 160GB hard drive -- thus giving Apple another hype tool to say the iPhone 3G is 160GB now ! </margin.n.1352><margin.n.1353>Before starting the Analysis you should review the options in Recipe Setup-Options.

For the sake of argument , we assume ideal conditions : that no other factors impart error into the poll. If the margin of error is 3 ( as in the example above ) , then the support Candidate A 's would receive in the same poll , we repeated , could be anywhere between 42 and 48 . Similarly , Candidate B 's support , in a repeated poll , lies between 48 and 54 . The margin of error is actually smaller for percentages that are not close to 50 , so the percentage of undecided voters is between about 3 and 5 ( see The Mathematics of Polling to how to compute these errors ) .

Further , from a planning perspective , planning reserve margin trends identify whether capacity additions are keeping up with demand growth. As this is a capacity based metric , it does not provide an accurate assessment of performance in energy limited systems , e.g. , hydro capacity with limited water resources.

Normal sedimentation results from the transport and deposition of sand , silt , and clay by rivers via deltas and redistribution of these sediments by longshore currents. The nature of sediments can change remarkably along a passive margin , due to interactions between carbonate sediment production , clastic input from rivers , and alongshore transport. Where clastic sediment inputs are small , biogenic sedimentation can dominate especially nearshore sedimentation. The Gulf of Mexico passive margin along the southern United States is an excellent example of this , with muddy and sandy coastal environments down current ( west ) from the Mississippi River Delta and beaches of carbonate sand to the east. The thick layers of sediment gradually thin with increasing distance offshore , depending on subsidence of the passive margin and the efficacy of offshore transport mechanisms such as turbidity currents and submarine channels . </margin.n.1433><margin.n.1434>View Larger Image 12-digit commercial desktop calculator features a large , bright fluorescent display with automatic three-digit punctuation.

The margin requirement may be as low as 20 . In the example just used , assume the contract price rises from $ 50 to $ 52 ( a $ 200 increase in the nominal value ) . This represents a $ 200 profit to the buyer of the security futures contract , and a 20 return on the $ 1 , 000 deposited as margin. The reverse would be true if the contract price decreased from $ 50 to $ 48. This represents a $ 200 loss to the buyer , or 20 of the $ 1 , 000 deposited as margin. Thus , leverage can either benefit or harm an investor . </margin.n.1472><margin.n.1473>Chosen Risk Margin - this page assesses whether the risk on your positions is greatest on the downside or upside , and then choses the appropriate risk direction for the portfolio.

Congress realized the effect that unrestricted margin borrowing might have on the entire economy in the 1930s. In fact , excessive and unrestricted borrowing to buy securities was identified by Congress as one of the causes contributing to the stock market crash of 1929. Therefore , under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 , Congress authorized the Federal Reserve Board to set initial margin requirements for client accounts. Currently , initial margin requirements are set at 50 percent of the equity 's value when purchasing securities. That means that you would have to deposit 50 cents for every $ 1 borrowed from the brokerage firm. The Fed 's Regulation T also sets the maximum amount of time granted to clients to deposit cash or equities to meet the initial margin requirements ( typically the trade date plus 3 days , or a maximum of 5 business days after the trade date ) . The Fed is not alone in its authority to set initial and maintenance requirements for margin accounts. Brokerage firms may have requirements higher than those of the Federal Reserve Board . </margin.n.1476><margin.n.1477>If you make the " Fully Indexed " payment/ " Principal and Interest " payment ( Index + Margin ) or " Scheduled payment " ( Index + Margin X outstanding loan balance ) option every month , your loan balance will always decline regardless of the movement of the Index.

Hence , the yearly 7.5 Payment Cap will never be enforced or " come into play " , because your outstanding loan balance will always be declining even if the Index is increasing , as the computer will readjust your next Principal and Interest ( Scheduled payment ) higher to compensate for the higher Index . </margin.n.1477><margin.n.1478>You can determine company and industry gross margins by exploring a plethora of financial Web sites.

Trading with margin is akin to trading with borrowed money so it is very important that you place appropriate stop loss orders to protect you from losing too much ( this is why some providers insist on mandatory stop loss orders ) . But at the same time you do n't really want to place your stop loss level too close to the current price because the market can very well dip down slightly and then all of a sudden shoot back up in price , and you would have lost out on that profit just because of that little dip . </margin.n.1553><margin.n.1554>These standards for financial resources are consistent with the customer protection function of Rule 15c3-3 and are necessary because of the unsecured nature of the debits. Requiring the highest investment-grade rating from an NRSRO provides the strongest protection against losses to margin deposited at a Clearing Agency or DCO , regardless of changing market conditions. With a lower credit rating , a Clearing Agency or DCO may not have the financial ability to meet is obligations to broker-dealers during times of market stress , which may compromise investor protection. Similarly , setting the security deposit level at $ 500 million and the assessment power at $ 1.5 billion should help to ensure that a Clearing Agency or DCO maintains liquidity and financial resources sufficient to protect customer margin on deposit. The Commission set the rating requirement , the amount of the security deposit and the assessment power at these levels based upon the Commission staff 's experience and their discussions with the industry . </margin.n.1554><margin.n.1555>Forwards entail both market risk and credit risk. A counterparty may fail to perform on a forward. With futures , there is only market risk. This is because exchanges employ a system whereby counterparties exchange daily payments of profits or losses on the days they occur. Through these margin payments , a futures contract 's market value is effectively reset to zero at the end of each trading day. This all but eliminates credit risk . </margin.n.1555><margin.n.1556>Once the margin of victory power ratings are established , all external ( non-local ) games ( such as games played out of state ) are computed.

In the first case , if the entire capital stock for a particular firm or industry is completely used up during one production cycle , then the profit margin would be exactly the same as the profit rate. In the case of turnover , if a firm succeeds in doubling the amount of times the production process repeats itself in the same period , then twice as much profit would be made on the same capital invested , even though the profit margin might not change. More formally , the rate of return profit margin sales / average assets , where average assets is the total capital stock divided by the number of times the production process turns over. Thus , the rate of return can be increased by increasing the profit margin or by shortening the production cycle. Of course , this will largely depend on the conditions of production in particular industries or firms . </margin.n.1591><margin.n.1592>The margin property identifies the margins for the sides of the box.

This measure equals the difference between total net revenues and total expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. It is the most direct indicator of whether the hospital is able to cover its overall expenses with its overall revenues. Hospitals with very low total margins ( including many safety net hospitals ) find themselves without sufficient funds to pay off debt , increase capital assets , expand services , or finance social missions. A hospital 's total margin includes its current subsidies for serving low- income populations. Since a critical question for targeting DSH payments is whether the hospital would be financially viable in the absence of those payments , the hospital 's total margin net of DSH payments is a better measure of financial viability for purposes of identifying financially vulnerable safety net hospitals. Comparing total margin net of DSH to total margin including DSH subsidies under alternative DSH allocation methodologies provides an indication of how the hospital 's financial viability would be affected assuming no behavioral changes occur in the services it provides or in the revenues it receives from Medicaid and other payers . </margin.n.1614><margin.n.1615>When Bank of America Corp. released its second-quarter earnings in July , one number that jumped out at Wall Street analysts was the company 's decline in net interest margin.

Surgical resection remains the common and central modality in the care of the sarcoma patient. Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy , radiotherapy or newly devised bio-targeting , the primary tumor , and often metastatic sites , must be resected in order to achieve a cure.

In the case of high G.M.R.O.I. but less effective use of space , we need to look at the causal factors. For example , products with very low cover and high gross margin will probably have experienced stock outs and fragmentation of ranges , and were therefore not fully exploited in terms of their ability to generate profit. This combination is characteristic of products with a relatively high G.M.R.O.I. , and it might make sense to increase the stock support for this area. This of course may further reduce the display density , so it would also make sense to review packaging and display methods in these areas at the same time to maximise the utilisation of space. Given that space is a finite resource , any increase in space would have to be at the expense of the low G.M.R.O.I. and low Display Density product areas . </margin.n.1696><margin.n.1697>Patient service margin - Financial results from our organization 's core business , patient care services.

The safety of a glucanase preparation was assessed in a series of toxicological tests to document its safety in use. Oral administration to rats of up to 10 mL/kg bw/day ( equivalent to a total organic solids dosage of 1258 mg/kg bw/day or a glucanase dosage of 1882 BGXU/kg bw/day ) for 13 weeks did not cause any adverse effect. The test substance was not found to be mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay , nor did it cause chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes. The safety margin for exposure is estimated to be in the range of 2100-72 , 000 depending on the estimate for daily wine consumption. The results of these studies demonstrate that an enzyme preparation containing glucanase may be considered safe when employed in wine processing.

This option is completely allowed by the Lender without hurting your credit rating , or charging any type of late fees. Hence , If your monthly Minimum payment is not sufficient to pay the full amount of interest due , the Lender adds this accrued but unpaid interest to the unpaid principal balance of the loan. Until repaid , deferred interest bears interest at the fully indexed rate of the loan. Eventually ( because of the " forced " yearly 7.5 payment Cap adjustments ) , the Minimum payment is more than sufficient to pay the full amount of interest due , ( this usually takes between 6-8 years depending upon your initial " Starting Rate " , Margin , and the movement of the Index ) , and the Lender will subtract the amount that exceeds the interest due ( negative amortization ) from the principal balance , resulting in a principal reduction. Eventually , because of the 7.5 yearly payment cap , your Minimum payments will become a full Principal and Interest payment or Scheduled payments . </margin.n.1765><margin.n.1766>On an opposing variation from the bleed is the use of enlarged margins. Like the bleed , these large margins can have an effect on time , expression , and the reading experience. I recall first noticing this in Chester Brown 's I Never Liked You and The Playboy. In both books , the panels float within the page surrounded by large black margins. The expansive margins isolate the pages from each other and from the world. Brown 's books are looking back into his past and , in their enclosed panels , isolated from the page edge , they evoke a sense of distance. The larger the margins , the more each page seems to read as an isolated unit , slowing down the reading process as the reader focuses in on the panels , which look more like individual paintings hung on a wall than the usual tight blocks of panels in a conventional page. Similarly , Anders Nilsen 's " The Event " ( from Mome ) uses large white margins to isolate each image/text combination as a distinct focus for interpretation. By slowing down the reading process in this way , Nilsen increases the opportunity for readers to draw out the abstract differences from one page to next . </margin.n.1766><margin.n.1767>At a value of $ 10 per pip , the EUR/USD would have to fall 48 pips before margin would be called and all positions closed out automatically.

In financial markets , it refers to the cash or securities contributed by a purchaser in part payment for the securities held in a margin account. The remainder is normally loaned by the brokerage house through which the trade is made. Securities bought , in part , with money loaned by a broker are said to have been bought 'on margin'. When a trade is first made , the purchaser pays an initial margin.

A low-cost producer in an industry would generally have a higher profit margin. This is because firms tend to sell the same product at roughly the same price ( adjusted for quality differences ); therefore , lower costs would be reflected in a higher profit margin. Lower-cost firms also have a potentially deadly strategic advantage in a competitive price war because they have the leverage to undercut their competitors by cutting prices in order to gain market share and potentially drive higher-cost ( and hence lower margin ) firms out of business . </margin.n.1801><margin.n.1802>Trading on Margin ( Trading with Leverage* ) is a common attraction of the forex market.

For example , the correlation between the FRS companies ' annual U.S. refining/marketing profitability and a somewhat broader definition of the gross refining margin 92 is not significant by the usual statistical conventions.93 The reason for this weak relationship is that the gross margin excludes operating costs such as refinery energy expense and maintenance of marketing networks. Operating costs may not typically vary much from quarter to quarter , but in a longer term context they are a key component of profit change. Of particular importance is the strong relationship between U.S. refining/marketing profitability and the net refining margin based on FRS data ( i.e. , the gross margin less out-of-pocket operating costs ) ( Figure 104 ) .94 Thus , examination of the components of the net refining margin should provide insights as to the level and volatility of U.S. refining profitability.

In this equation , which generates the same answer as dividing dollar net profit by dollar net worth , all five financial measures are of equal importance in determining profitability.

Bad debt experience also waxes and wanes with economic conditions and management performance. When bad debt expense is increasing , efforts to reduce the experience result in operating margin improvement. Although of value , the effects can mask other performance indicators that are more important , such as operating and market threats. Is a sudden earnings " pop " a result of one time bad debt cleanup or sustainable operating improvements ? Although bad debt management is important , earnings growth driven by improvements in this regard should be weighed together with other areas of earnings performance contributions. In economic down cycles , bad debt estimates become more challenging , volatile , and relevant to financial performance analysis.

Their losses generally exceeded non-cash expenses like depreciation so their operations would generally produce a negative amount of cash flow for the year as well. These institutions will have decreased any margin against adversity they had before the losses. Continued losses or deficits will negatively impact institutions ' financial health because existing resources must be spent to cover those losses. Institutions incurring losses fail to add to their wealth and are not even funding capital replacement costs. With a negative strength factor between -1.00 and -.10 , an institution must demonstrate strength in another ratio to increase its overall score.

After all , this is Congress 's main concern in mandating margin requirements in the first place. One way to address this is to conduct a statistical test -- called a Granger-causality test -- to examine the time-series dynamics between the growth in margin credit and the growth in market capitalization using monthly data from 1971 to 1999. The results find that the growth in stock market capitalization precedes the growth in margin credit , not vice versa. Specifically , both the one- and two-month lagged growth rates in stock market value are significant in explaining the growth in margin credit; the lagged growth rates in margin credit have no explanatory power for the growth in stock market value. While the Granger-causality test does not identify economic causation and only depicts a statistical association , the data do not suggest that , in general , the growth in margin credit fuels the stock market gains. Rather , the data are consistent with investors reacting to a rise in stock prices by borrowing more against stocks and , likewise , reacting to a fall in stock prices by borrowing less . </margin.n.2204><margin.n.2205>How to Set a Bleed For your convenience we have produced a set of pre-designed templates where resolution , bleed and trim margins have been set.

Despite jumps in distillate and gasoline prices in 1996 , U.S. refining operations fared only slightly better in terms of financial performance than they did in 1995. For example , major petroleum companies that separately disclosed quarterly financial results for their U.S. refining and marketing operations reported that income from these operations in 1996 was 15 percent above the comparable total in 1995. 95 </margin.n.2366><margin.n.2367>Deputy Ker was given a copy of the General Instructions for 1831 under which his 1837 survey was undertaken in addition to the requirements of the Court. These instructions are vague on any margin of error and actually assume the surveyors will run their lines very exactly so that , " the excesses and deficiencies alluded to by the law , except to a trifling extent , will be a rare occurrence. " By the 1845 General Instructions issued by GLO , the acceptable margin for a section line was anything less than 50 links. If such differences were allowed at these stated times , it is very likely that the tolerances allowed could account for the differing corners found by the modern surveyor. It is a fascinating question and fun to research even when no definite answer can be given . </margin.n.2367><margin.n.2368>Cost of goods sold ( COGS ) as a percentage of net sales has firmed up to 45.4 from 44.2 last year , and the staff cost to sales ratio has risen marginally to 8.5 .

Instead of ending in a continental rise , the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench , which may be filled with sediment. Earthquake and volcanic activity are prominent here. Since active continental margins occur along many coasts of the Pacific Ocean , these types of margins are also known as " Pacific-type " margins . </margin.n.2371><margin.n.2372>In the first quarter of 2007 , we recorded a $ 221 million pre-tax impairment charge related to aircraft and a $ 68 million pre-tax charge related to cash payouts and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits for employees who accepted a voluntary separation opportunity. Additionally , we recorded a $ 46 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2007 related to the restructuring and disposal of certain operations in France within the Supply Chain &amp;Freight segment. We presented third quarter and year-to-date 2007 operating profit , operating margin , pre-tax income , net income and earnings per share excluding the impact of these items as we believe these adjusted measures better enable shareowners to focus on period-over-period operating performance. The underlying matters that produced the impairment charge and the charge related to the voluntary separation opportunity were unique , and we do not believe they are reflective of the types of charges that will affect future anticipated results. Additionally , the restructuring charge reflected our exit of certain non-core lines of business in our Supply Chain &amp;Freight operations , and we do not believe this charge is indicative of future operating results of our core forwarding , logistics and freight operations . </margin.n.2372><margin.n.2373>Once a margin account is established , customers must maintain a minimum equity percentage , generally 30 percent. Equity is the market value of the portfolio less margin debt. But when the equity in the account falls below 30 percent , investors must put up more cash , add more collateral or sell part of their holdings. For example , if a $ 100 , 000 portfolio had a margin debt of $ 50 , 000 , no additional collateral is needed as long as the value of the purchased securities remains above $ 65 , 000 . </margin.n.2373><margin.n.2374>ETX Capital : Dependant on what account you have with ETX Capital we may margin you in different ways.

And we all know that the better you know someone the better you can anticipate what they may do in a certain situation . </margin.n.2377><margin.n.2378>Most margin loans calculate interest daily and charge it monthly. The interest capitalizes onto the loan , so if you do nothing you loan will gradually grow over time. Worse still , if you do n't pay your interest , next month you will be paying interest on interest , and the compounding effect will act to quickly raise the loan value. So just pay your interest each month . </margin.n.2378><margin.n.2379>What remains from sales after a company pays out the cost of goods sold. To obtain gross profit margin , divide gross profit by sales. Gross profit margin is expressed as a percentage.For example , if a company receives $ 25 , 000 in sales and its cost of goods sold were $ 20 , 000 , the gross profit margin would be equal to $ 25 , 000 minus $ 20 , 000 , divided by $ 25 , 000 , or 20 .

The two basic LRFD levels , serviceability and collapse are sufficient for this purpose. For relatively more important structures , the design margin against the collapse state for maximum expected loads should be increased relative to ordinary structures.

However , because the Life Safety performance level is relatively poorly defined in terms of the margin against failure provided , this performance evaluation has little technical meaning. As our future codes move towards a more closely performance-based concept it would be preferable to abandon the so-called Life Safety basis for design and adopt an approach that is truer to LRFD methods. Specifically , as with all LRFD design methods , two performance states should be considered - a serviceability state , similar to the Operational level of the NEHRP Guidelines , and a failure , or collapse state. Structures should be proportioned such that they provide an appropriate margin against the collapse state under maximum expected , or considered , levels of load and such that they not exceed the serviceability state under frequent levels of load . </margin.n.2490><margin.n.2491>The profit margin ratio can be calculated in several different ways.

Once the company has determined exactly how much it costs to produce one unit of this good or service , it is possible to set a price for the unit. The difference between the sales price and the cost of producing that one unit is the profit margin on that particular unit . </margin.n.2491><margin.n.2492>This was n't a problem until the market crashed , causing stock prices to fall.

Higher ratio values also indicate greater flexibility on the part of the farmer to withstand and adjust to temporary adverse economic conditions.

You should also have gained insights as to how important employee benefits and overhead costs are in the determination of billing rates and the resulting profit margins. You should also understand the various common contract-types and what advantages and disadvantages are associated with each one. For each contract type , you should also be aware of the common pitfalls and potential financial exposure you may face if the project is not managed properly. Finally , by working through the case study , you should become sensitized to how seemingly minor problems or unforeseen events may severely impact your ability to protect your profit margin especially if the Project Manager is not attentive , proactive and willing to engage and communicate with the client.

Unfortunately , if you use a royalty-bearing real time operating system , your royalty wo n't decline. When your product first comes to market with a high price and a high profit margin , the cost of royalties may not be significant.

A health care provider will insist that an episode type generate at least enough revenue to cover its associated variable costs. Any revenues in excess of variable costs then " contribute " to paying the care provider 's fixed costs.

While cost can not be the primary determinant of price , it is important to understand true costs in order to make better pricing decisions. Gross margin calculates the obvious costs of a product or service , while net margin reveals the actual costs. When combined with the price index ? the price that a customer actually paid divided by the price that a company wanted to achieve ? true price performance emerges. Based on our experience , companies that have not improved price management have a price index of roughly 55 to 65 percent , while leading companies achieve a price index of 95 to 100 percent . </margin.n.2659><margin.n.2660>The " Capital Replacement Margin " is the amount of money remaining after all operating expenses , taxes , family living and scheduled debt payments have been made.

We often hear that leverage is a double-edged sword. Risk disclosures routinely warn that although high leverage may produce significant returns , it could also lead to large losses.

Also , companies have to change their behaviour in a way that we might regard as being beneficial to the planet as a whole. What role does the international community have in altering these incentives and what form might they take ?

It compares the intrinsic value of a security with the current market price of the security. If the market price lies sufficiently below its true value , the intrinsic value , then there is a large margin of safety. It means that your analysis can allow for several errors without losing your invested capital. Every single investor should always require a large margin of safety for every single security , they purchase. If a security trades sufficiently above the intrinsic value , there is no margin of safety , only a margin of downside and should therefore be sold or avoided by the true value investor. The use of a margin of safety was first utilized by Benjamin Graham and Chris Dodd in Security Analysis.Furthermore , the use of it has also been used by legendary investor Warren Buffet and Seth Klarman , who even called his famed value investing book after this principle . </margin.n.2702><margin.n.2703>1 In the money markets and banking , an adjustment , given in basis points , which is added to or subtracted from a reference rate to provide the floating rate or short-term rate for a security or loan.

The focus on controllable variances forms the basis for developing a responsibility reporting system in which information is tailored to the needs of the responsible person. For example , the volume variance represents a responsibility of physicians , and a report that focuses on the role of volume on organizational performance might be prepared for the medical staff. Similarly , the variance in variable costs also influences the contribution margin and the related information might be conveyed to line managers or directors of the responsibility centers. Hence , tailoring the reporting system to satisfy the informational needs of the manager might enhance the process of problem identification and development of remedial policies or practices. The existing financial and clinical reporting systems of the organization can be integrated with contribution margin variance data that are made accessible to administrators and other decision makers. A robust capability to produce reports that depict historical , current and projected variances would help promote the effective use of timely financial and statistical information.

Common non-operating expenses include interest expenses on loans , depreciation , amortization and taxes. Depreciation is simply the reduction of the value of company assets due to time or use. Like a car , with each passing year and with additional use , assets of a company become less and less valuable. Amortization is the gradual payment of a balance over time. A company may decide to pay down a loan or credit facility in equal installments each month over 50 years. Companies usually include a line item called EBIT , which are earnings before interest expenses and taxes; this sometimes also includes a line item called EBITDA , or earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization. Both EBIT and EBITDA are used when evaluating a company and are an important financial metric to understand. After all non-operating expenses and taxes are accounted for , the net earnings or profit can be calculated. This number is closely related but not identical to FCF ( free cash flow ) found in the statement of cash flows . </margin.n.2779><margin.n.2780>The result is that any gain or loss in margins resulting from exchange rate fluctuations is offset by gains or losses in U.S. dollar assets and liabilities.

In our experiment , the lack of radiation coverage is associated with a 2.3-fold increase in neointimal formation compared with the maximal radiation coverage of 14.5 mm. By definition , the coverage of the edge segment is adequate when IA and lumen area at the edge segment do not differ from measurements within the body of the stent. This optimal coverage is obtained with a 14.5-mm margin beyond the stent edge , whereas a slight gradient between edge and body segments is still observed with 10-mm margin with either 15 or 22 Gy. This suggests that 14.5-mm margin is superior in eliminating the edge effect. However , because the effect on the IA was minimal between 10 and 14.5 mm with 22 Gy , it is possible that a higher dose minimizes the radiation margins . </margin.n.2794><margin.n.2795>Profitability.

Concurrently , the same trader took a short position in August Light Crude Oil ( CLQ ) and September Brent Crude Oil ( CSU ) . Present SPAN methodology would spread CLN and CLQ together and also CSQ and CSU together , resulting in two inter-month spreads. The actual risk , however , entails both inter-month and inter-commodity spreads.

One very common form of pricing is the cost-plus method in which the cost is incremented by some percentage ( sometimes known as mark-up ) or dollar amount. In this method , the price is the by-product of a profit margin strategy which is , in turn , guided by the need to cover overhead , taxes and return to owners. There are many variations of the cost-plus method of pricing. In many practical circumstances , managers entering a particular market for the first time find it most reasonable to use the profit margin of competitors as an appropriate return for the firm. For instance , in retailing , the mark up in different stores is similar. This is often dictated by competition : stores that would overprice by even a few pennies items available everywhere , will see their sales tumble. This also means that the technology leader sets the highest price. As indicated earlier , other firms use pricing strategies that align their own prices proportionately under that of the technology leader . </margin.n.2799><margin.n.2800>Profit margin - This is a number every business owner should know by heart.

One was Johann Gutenberg 's invention of moveable type , which allowed printers to plan paragraph justification and line indentation. This meant it was no longer a technical problem to end a paragraph early on a line , and indent the next paragraph , or to space the words out so that the margins were no longer messy , uneven and distracting. The other major development was the invention of more efficient techniques for manufacturing paper. This meant it was also no longer an economic problem to indent and align. This development led to the creation of a book standard of justified paragraphs with indented first lines , the standard still used in almost any paper publication. The use of paper is still a concern , so lines are single spaced and there is only a single hard return between paragraphs , but there is enough white space between words and in paragraph indentations to be able to read for extended periods without getting sick.* </margin.n.2811><margin.n.2812>When the musician becomes popular they are able to gain ever more momentum through access to quality market forces.

Knowledge of the absorption , distribution , metabolism and excretion ( ADME ) properties of the drug and its metabolites in humans as compared to animals used in toxicology assessments , is crucial to understanding differences in effect among species and for optimizing the drug. For orally administered drugs , adequate absorption and bioavailability must be achieved. Absorption refers to the amount of total drug-derived material that crosses the gastrointestinal epithelium , whereas bioavailability addresses the amount of biologically active drug that reaches the systemic circulation. Duration of drug action is often dependent on how rapidly the body eliminates the active molecules , either through chemical modification ( metabolism ) by the action of drug-metabolizing enzymes or by protein-binding and transportation away from the biologically active sites in tissues and excretion from the body. Where appropriate ( e.g. determination of safety margins ) , these aspects of the overall nonclinical safety assessments will be discussed . </margin.n.2951><margin.n.2952>It is difficult to explain why patients with positive margins do not display local recurrence in a more predictable manner.

When determining that a plurality of areas have not been specified , i.e. , only a single area has been specified ( S7 : NO ) , the CPU 11 determines whether or not the margin area 54 has been specified ( S9 ) . On the other hand , when determining that a plurality of areas have been specified ( S7 : YES ) , the CPU 11 divides the main scan image data based on the specified areas ( S8 ) . Concretely , the CPU 11 performs a process of cutting data for the specified areas from the main can image data , while comparing coordinates of the specified area designation frame 53 and coordinates of the main scan image data. Thus , the CPU 11 divides the main scan image data by the number of specified areas.

This is where the economic concept fallacy of composition ( what is true for part may not be true for the whole ) kicks into high gear. Though technological investment may help the first adapter to cut costs and get a leg up on the competition , competitors won ' t watch their economic pie being eaten by a more efficient company. Those who do sit still will be driven out of business.

Although the incidence of these types of discussions may be due to traders psychology where it is hard to internalise a losing trade and instead they try to find external source to blame. This is also something that the Australian Securities Exchange , promoting their Australian exchange traded CFD and some of the CFD providers , promoting Direct Market Access product , have used to support their particular offering.

Basis values have been largely flat as well , although are beginning to show slight improvement. Most of the strength in futures prices has been tied to short covering , although it is interesting to note that open interest has been very steady through this rally. It appears that a transfer of ownership has taken place which has allowed open interest to remain steady. Last week ' s selloff was tied to concerns that U.S. wheat is becoming uncompetitive in the world marketplace , which will limit profit margin opportunities on the 2009 crop. On a positive note , new-crop margins continue to look very attractive for producers who have been able to plant this fall , and flexible price strategies that protect a range of lower prices and obligate a sale at higher levels look particularly attractive for 2010 wheat.

Under purchase accounting rules , some portion of an acquisition purchase price is generally allocated to intangibles , such as core and developed technology and customer contracts , which are then amortized over various periods of time.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets expense is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our various acquisitions. Further , the amortization expense on acquired intangibles does not result in ongoing cash expenditures , and , in our view , does not otherwise have a material impact on our ongoing business operations.

Comparing net margin across the companies in an industry is also a good way to get a quick handle on the quality of management.

Most of the hog market strength has been focused on nearby contracts where margins are still negative; however , optimism appears to be improving with China lifting their U.S. pork import restrictions. Meanwhile , although the corn &amp;soybean harvests remain delayed and quality issues have arisen with the extremely wet autumn , there isn ' t much historical evidence to suggest that yields will be sharply reduced from current forecasts. For most operations , it is still possible to protect a breakeven margin from Q2 2010 through the end of next year with flexible price strategies that will allow for an improvement in that margin should hog prices continue to recover and feed costs decline. These strategies generally feature protecting a range of higher feed prices and lower hog values.

However , padding differs from margins in that padding adds space inside the rectangular area of an element , as opposed to around it. For this reason , padding actually imposes on the amount of content area available within an element. As an example , if you create a style rule for an element that establishes a width of 50 pixels and a height of 30 pixels and then sets the padding of the rule to 5 pixels , the remaining content area will be 40 pixels by 20 pixels. Also , because the padding of an element appears within the element 's content area , it will assume the same style as the content of the element , such as the background color . </margin.n.3165><margin.n.3166>Each HTML element actually has four different margins : top , right , bottom , and left.

For a first novel this is a beautiful piece of work and I think that the author , Isabelle Rowan , is incredibly talented and should be justifiably proud. It 's obvious she did a great deal of research on the topic of homelessness and some of its root causes. While the book is not what I would call upbeat and at times it 's downright depressing , it was also funny in parts , tender , perceptive and an all round terrific story which gives us hope when things are at their worst.

Determining a risk rating includes an analysis of customer concentration and the risk profile of each individual client. The client risk profile includes a rating of the financial strength of the client , the risk inherent to the client 's industry and country/sovereign risk. Reserves are also determined based on the internal controls of the bank which includes the frequency of reviewing customers ' risk profile , collateral management and documentation analysis. As a result of the increased sensitivity to counterparty exposure , the FCM community continues to improve and refine this function of risk management for both counterparties and customers. It seems logical that an FCM that relies on both margin risk management and strong internal controls , resulting in a lower probability of customer losses , should require less capital than an FCM that relies solely on margin as a protection against losses . </margin.n.3179><margin.n.3180>However , just because sales are increasing does n't necessarily mean that profits are too.

The buoyant rates of return in U.S. refining during the latter half of the 1980 's were short lived. In the 1990 's , lower margins , due in part to the narrowing of the crude oil price-quality differential , eroded U.S. refining and marketing profits. The adverse effects on profitability were exacerbated by a renewed rise in capital intensity beginning in 1990. Refinery upgrading , in part undertaken to satisfy mandates for reformulated fuels , was the major source of this most recent upswing in capital intensity.

As defined by the author , " margin is the amount allowed beyond that which is needed. It is something held in reserve for contingencies or unanticipated situations. Margin is the gap between rest and exhaustion , the space between breathing freely and suffocating. It is the leeway we once had between ourselves and our limits.

This value can be used to gauge the efficiency of a company , and the higher the profit margin , the more efficient the company. To maximize profit margins companies must find the maximum price they can charge for their products/services without hurting their revenues ( e.g. , turning off customers ) , and they must minimize expenses without compromising their operation ( e.g. , hurting product quality ) .

The process involved is no different to buying ANZ CFDs , in terms of leverage and executing the order ( it is different in terms of financing , but more on this later ) . This is all possible because the CFD provider will have-in the case of equities-stock lending agreements with third party institutions , known as Prime Brokers.

While the futures market rallied sharply in the first half of the month , there is concern that prices have become overbought with the possibility that demand from China may be slowing down. Although the harvest remains severely delayed across the Midwest , most of the attention has been focused on collecting soybeans as the crop would be more vulnerable to damage if left in the field while nearby premiums have remained very firm due to the weather issues in the Delta. The relatively strong profit margins available for the 2010 crop should not be overlooked given the fast start to planting that both Brazil and Argentina are off to with expectations of record crops in South America this growing season.

To keep the graphs reasonalbly sized , I put the first 15 regular season games in the first graph , the other 15 regular season games in the second graph , and the nine post-season games ( three Big East Tournament , six NCAA Tournament ) in the third graph. The results are striking. In many cases , UConn managed to win by a margin very close to that indicated by the rating measure. A series of seven games , starting with the Ball State game ( first graph below ) , were almost all exactly as predicted. The one major exception in the first 15 games is the Pittsburgh game expected to be a fairly easy win , but ended up being a blowout . </margin.n.3614><margin.n.3615>For example , if I want to invest $ 100 , 000 into blue chip shares and , although each share has a loan to value ratio ( LVR ) of 70 per cent , I choose to gear at 50 per cent , one of the potential risks is I might receive a margin call. I can manage this risk by diversifying my portfolio into five shares instead of one , my gearing level of 50 per cent says I need a 33 per cent fall in my portfolio before I receive a margin call , and if I do , I might choose to add more security , pay down the loan or sell a portion of my portfolio . </margin.n.3615><margin.n.3616>In a plurality voting system , it is important to know who is ahead. The terms " statistical tie " and " statistical dead heat " are sometimes used to describe reported percentages that differ by less than a margin of error , but these terms can be misleading. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] For one thing , the margin of error as generally calculated is applicable to an individual percentage and not the difference between percentages , so the difference between two percentage estimates may not be statistically significant even when they differ by more than the reported margin of error. The survey results also often provide strong information even when there is not a statistically significant difference . </margin.n.3616><margin.n.3617>Gross profit jumped to USD 5.1 million , a 63 growth.

In the absence of that presumption , taxable value for a school district is the state value for the school district determined by the comptroller under Subsections ( a ) and ( b ) unless the local value exceeds the state value , in which case the taxable value for the school district is the district 's local value. In determining whether the local value for a school district is valid , the comptroller shall use a margin of error that does not exceed five percent unless the comptroller determines that the size of the sample of properties necessary to make the determination makes the use of such a margin of error not feasible , in which case the comptroller may use a larger margin of error . </margin.n.3623><margin.n.3624>Margin buying has changed since the 1920s , when it had relatively loose regulations and minimum margin requirements were very low. This situation led to a lot of weak investment positions , which in turn helped usher in the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Since then , brokers tend to require higher minimum margins in cases of margin buying , asking investors to put up more initial capital to help protect them against fluctuations in the market. The Federal Reserve Board now has a number of rules handling margin buying , and organizations which self-regulate , such as the NASD and NYSE , have their own rules. These include such things as a mandatory minimum margin -- the New York Stock Exchange requires at least a US $ 2000 deposit with the brokerage and a cap on leverage , limiting you from borrowing more than 50 of the total investment value . </margin.n.3624><margin.n.3625>It is considered that the conduct of the dealership in a manner which benefits the Manufacturer constitutes a supply.

Accordingly , surgical experience matters. Surgeons that do not regularly remove these rare and deadly cancers are therefore more likely to execute a well-intended , but less than optimal , cancer operation. In such circumstances , local recurrence is more likely. This risk is further compounded when sarcoma surgery is performed outside recognized sarcoma centers by a surgical team that is not familiar with tissue handling protocols necessary to perform the latest molecular tests on the removed tumor. Furthermore , an inexperienced pathologist may also have a very difficult time establishing the correct diagnosis and margin status . </margin.n.3628><margin.n.3629>Build a larger margin of safety if you are valuing a shakier company or if there is uncertainty about its future earnings.

Assuming that the value of the portfolio falls to Rs 60 , the amount of equity reduces to Rs 10 ( Rs 60 minus Rs 50 ) . As per the terms with the broker , the value of maintenance margin was 25 i.e. Rs 15 ( Rs 60 multiplied by 15 ) . Since the value of the portfolio has declined , the broker calls for additional margin. If the margin call is not obliged , the broker is authorised to sell the securities without the prior information of the investor. In some cases , where the value of the portfolio becomes nil , the broker sells the entire lot of stocks without informing the investor . </margin.n.3631><margin.n.3632>Costco Wholesale ( COST ) , the largest discount warehouse retailer in the nation , reported fiscal first quarter results that showed steady improvement from a year ago.

While the erotic moments range in heat John and David 's passionate moments are full of love and devotion. Words spoken as only true lovers can speak , when their bodies know the phrases their mouths are unable to say. David is a man who knows pain. He has built walls necessary to survive in his environment. David knows even the minuscule help is never without a price. His mind finds it difficult to accept someone willing to look past his grimy exterior to see the gem hidden within. John is a survivor , and has come a long way from a lad who grew up in his grandparents ' care. The connection to David baffles him , but John 's heart wo n't allow him to walk away.

Under most circumstances , salespeople would rather sell a product with a 24 percent margin than an item with a 20 percent margin. Why ? Because many salespeople are paid based on gross margin. But does the company get a better return on investment on the product with a 24 percent margin ? Maybe , maybe not. It depends on the average value of inventory the company must maintain to generate the sales of the item . </margin.n.3638><margin.n.3639>While the capital reserves of an FCM are also calculated based on deposit levels , the purpose of these reserves are analogous to bank reserves for loans , they are collected to fund a payment default by a customer. This reserve is not analogous to a bank 's deposit reserves. In terms of loan reserves , banks are not required to set aside reserves for loans that are fully secured by cash or cash equivalents ( marketable securities ) . When an FCM collects margin in excess of exchange minimums , which are calculated with a risk-based formula , the FCM is better securing itself very much like a lender does when it accepts cash or cash equivalents as collateral. Through the above mentioned discussion of balance reserves , the FCM would still need to provide for liquidity for any mismatch in maturity it may have between its depository assets and customer liabilities. Not requiring a capital reserve against excess balances would eliminate the existing disincentive for an FCM to pursue good credit practices through the collection of excess margin . </margin.n.3639><margin.n.3640>Otherwise , the large urban hospitals that dominate close to 84 percent of the market realized the greatest financial gains , while the smaller rural hospitals continued to struggle.

Traditional accounting is time-period based and encased in definitions such as assets and liabilities. It does n't amend itself well to marketing- and sales-based definitions of segments , customers and transactions. Also , the distribution industry is a thin-margin , aggressive step-cost business where operating costs rise in step with sales volume.

This is because your initial monthly payment and starting interest rate may be below the interest rate called for by the index plus the margin on your ARM as of the date of loan closing. In addition , you may elect to pay a fee to reduce the initial interest rate. For this reason , it is unlikely that the index will fall enough to prevent interest rate increases and corresponding increases in your monthly payments in the early years of your ARM loan. Only when the amount of your monthly payment is increased on the first and possibly subsequent change dates up to the amount equal to the monthly payment required by the index and the margin will subsequent adjustments in the amount of your monthly payment , based upon the new interest rate , begin to correspond with the movement , up or down , on the index of subsequent change dates . </margin.n.3713><margin.n.3714>Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.

The payer mix of the organization , and hence gross prices per unit of service and discounted rates , are a reflection of the contractual and regulatory relationships of the organization. As a consequence , partial responsibility for approving the price structure and developing the data required to assess the adequacy of compensation rates resides with the senior leadership of the fiscal services division. However , the responsibility for negotiating and approving contractual and regulatory relations that influence the payer mix usually resides with the senior leadership of the overall organization. Conversely , it also is possible to argue that the payer mix and set of prices are both largely a reflection of the local market or service area. For example , if those residing in the market or service area are elderly and indigent , both the payer mix and price structure will likely be dominated by public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid . </margin.n.3717><margin.n.3718>Variation in the change in the ultimate does not adequately encapsulate the risk horizon - the risk margin must also be included.

Coverage will begin one full month after the sales closing date , provided the premium for the policy has been paid in full. No cattle sales are insurable during the first month of any insurance period. For example , if a producer purchased a policy on the sales closing date of Jan. 31 , no cattle marketings will be insurable until March 1. Producers can purchase one policy to cover the entire insurance period or obtain multiple policies with sales closing dates in different months. For example , producers wanting to insure cattle from March to December could insure all 10 months with one policy ( purchased at the end of January ) . Alternatively , they could purchase coverage for each month separately , buying March coverage in January or before , April coverage in February or before , and so on. Any combination of these two transactions also could be purchased.

Those principles involve : ( 1 ) agreeing on a fixed margin; ( 2 ) pushing decision-making responsibility down the organization; and ( 3 ) providing real incentives for department managers and employees -- allowing them , for example , to keep a portion of the incremental revenues they generate.

The same arrangement to some extent can be achieved with securities , particularly with common stocks. This process is know as margin , or " buying on margin.

But the Group ' s operating result ( ebit ) was down from 70.4 million in 2007 to 52.0 million , because of a one-time charge related to the cancellation of a major systems order from a North American automotive supplier. Excluding this one-time charge of 20.8 million , the operating result ( ebit ) would have been 72.8 million , and therefore higher than last year. The adjusted ebit margin was 5.7 percent , which compares to last year ' s 5.5 percent. The 5.5 percent earnings target for the current financial year would therefore have been exceeded. Overall , the kuka Group ' s earnings for the 2008 financial year , including the one-time charge , were satisfactory . </margin.n.3893><margin.n.3894>Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were $ 804 , 000 , or 31 of sales , an increase of $ 68 , 000 from the comparable period of the prior fiscal year ( $ 736 , 000 and 22 of sales ) .

On the other hand , if a company can maintain the same level of sales while cutting cost of goods sold , SG &amp;A expense , or taxes , it can increase its profit margin and raise total earnings as well.

Since the advent of CFDs , many traders have moved from margin lending to CFD trading. The main benefits of CFD versus margin lending are that there are more underlying products , the margin rates are lower , and it is easy to go short. It can be difficult and expensive to short sell using physical shares and may not be possible at all , however it is just as easy to go short as to go long with a CFD. Even with the recent bans on short selling CFD providers , that have been able to hedge their book in other ways , have allowed clients to continue to short selling those stocks . </margin.n.3972><margin.n.3973>The ability to create notes in the margin ( also referred to as " margin notes " or " marginal notes " ) is a really nice/cool feature in LaTeX.

So back to our survey example. If in a survey 45 of respondents say they will vote for Smith and 39 say they will vote for Jones and the margin of error is 3 , then we predict that somewhere between 42 and 48 of the voting population will vote for Smith and between 36 and 43 will vote for Jones. Since the two ranges overlap from 42 to 43 , the two numbers ( 45 and 39 ) are not statistically significant in their difference. What is not mentioned is the level of probability of error. In most public survey that probability is 95 , or 5 chances out of 100 that we will make a mistake or error is we conclude that the numbers are different when they occur outside the margin of error . </margin.n.3975><margin.n.3976>Profit Margin : Banking Alternatives April 5 : There are a wide range of funding options available for small business owners in this economic downturn.

The futures exchange , acting through a clearing organization , must ensure that participants have sufficient funds to handle losses. In order to protect market participants and the integrity of the market , futures exchanges establish margin requirements at sufficiently high levels to adequately guard against the risks associated with changing market conditions. Futures exchanges establish specific margin requirements for the exchanges institutional customers , known as clearing members , and separate minimum margin requirements for customers of the clearing members , which may be calculated , for example , at 110 greater for member accounts and 135 greater for all other customers. As used herein , the term " clearing member " refers to any entity associated with a performance bond requirement , including , but not limited to traditional clearing members authorized to hold over night their own or their customers ' positions on products traded , cleared or settled on an exchange , clearing organizations or houses authorized to clear positions on behalf of an exchange , or individual or institutional entities or members of an exchange holding or trading products on an exchange that are subject to a margin requirement . </margin.n.3986><margin.n.3987>Many investors query how one can sell something one does not already own. In terms of equities , this is true , and one can only do it through margin lenders who borrow the stocks from brokers and hence , pass the stock on to clients to allow them to sell. But with CFDs , since you are simply opening a contract and not selling a physical instrument as such , there is no problem associated with short selling , and hence taking the view that the price of your chosen instrument will go down and you will close ( buy back ) the contract at a lower price ( hopefully ) . </margin.n.3987><margin.n.3988>Liquidating Securities : If you can not bring in the required funds , or do not want to , you may liquidate enough shares in your account to bring your equity up to minimum requirements. Please note that the amount of stock you must sell is greater than if you were to send in funds. If you do this , however , you are not guaranteed to avoid a sell out. If you liquidate out of the margin call , your equity continues to decrease , or you do not sell enough to meet the call , you may be issued another call , or you may be subject to a sell out by our Margin Department . </margin.n.3988><margin.n.3989>In an August 12 , 1985 , interpretative statement , the General Counsel of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission opined that " clearing organization rules and by-laws awarding clearing organizations the right to apply all customer margin funds within their custody to satisfy nonprietary obligations of defaulting clearing firms are not inconsistent with section 4d ( 2 ) of the Act or the Commission 's regulations. " ( Interpretative Statement No. 85-3 ) ( emphasis added ) . In other words , if FCM XYZ defaults on its obligation to the clearing organization because of Customer A 's default on his obligation to the FCM , the clearing organization may use all of XYZ 's margin deposits , including the margin deposits of nondefaulting customers , in order to discharge XYZ 's obligations. The General Counsel 's conclusion rests primarily on the view that section 4d ( 2 ) " requires only that the clearing organization use such funds as the property of the clearing firm 's customers collectively , but does not require the clearing organization to treat such funds as the property of the particular customers who deposited them or to whose positions they have accrued.

Between life and death , urban and rural , public and private. The place of death is found in a space-between , a margin. So , for example , the M ller Pier is designed as a margin where extremes come together. The living , by moving , penetrate the world of the dead. This movement is not found in open space as it would be in the city but in the mass formed by two walls. There , openings ensure contact with the void beyond. Repeating these openings creates a sense of movement , of life. Small towers standing at the end of the pier evoke longing. Upon reaching the towers these are found to house the urns and bones of the dead. The view from there is phenomenal. The emptiness of the expanse of water symbolizes death , its undulating surface continuing as 'frozen moments ' in the burial plots. Relief ensues between the masses. The walls offer protection to the private ritual enacted there among the plots. Otherwise there is an endless void , at times close by , at others infinitely distant . </margin.n.4008><margin.n.4009>The computation of the real safety margin is based on to the ( expected ) cash flows of health insurance premiums referred to in section 68 Bpr , i.e. the basic insurance as meant in the Zvw. This means that when the required real safety margin is determined , the expected cash flows relating to supplementary insurance may not be taken into account. It must be kept in mind that such a form of 'netting ' would bring about an undesirable link between the activities relating to the basic insurance and those relating to supplementary insurance. Contrary to basic insurance , supplementary health insurances are not managed in the same way as life insurances , and therefore qualify as regular non-life insurances , while basic insurance is financed ( partly publicly and partly privately ) in a fundamentally different way than supplementary insurances ( fully privately ) . In addition , the real safety margin is intended to be a buffer to absorb uncertainties in the realisation of the expected receipts from basic insurance during the financial year. It would be incongruous if the computation of this real safety margin were to make allowance for uncertain receipts from supplementary insurances during the same financial year . </margin.n.4009><margin.n.4010>Operating income and margin let you know how much of a company 's sales are left over for owners , taxes , and preferred stock dividends.

T1 and T2 form a current switch. In a conventional current switch T2 would have a fixed base voltage. The base voltage of T2 represents the threshold of the receiver circuit. In the disclosed circuit the base of T2 is connected to the collector of T1 which results in feedback. This feedback causes the circuit threshold to vary with the input level. The Down level noise margin is defined as the voltage difference between the maximum Down level and the threshold. Similarly , the Up level noise margin is defined as the voltage difference between the minimum Up level and the threshold voltage. Thus , it can be seen that the variable threshold of the disclosed circuit provides increased noise margin . </margin.n.4076><margin.n.4077>A further issue which was not discussed in either the Full Court decision or in the Decision Impact Statement is the timing of entry into agreements to use the margin scheme.

Instead of having to maintain base year cost records or invest resources in developing their own cost indexes , taxpayers could use the BLS 's monthly price indexes. But they then had to convert the relevant price index into a company-specific cost index by using their own gross margin experience to develop the cost complement ( 1 minus gross margin percentage ) of the published index. Small businesses ( those with average annual gross receipts of $ 5 million or less for the three preceding tax years ) are allowed to rise 100 of the reported price change. All others are restricted to using 80 of the reported change.

Similarly , House Report 95-294 ( accompanying legislation that became the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 ) , after quoting the National Academy of Sciences about the " smaller than usual " safety factor in NAAQS and about the lack of evidence for thresholds , suggested " greater not lesser control of emissions are likely to be needed.

This will usually be a percentage increase. A Fruiterer who buys an apple in bulk for $ 0.20 may sell them individually with a markup of 50 . 20c marked up by 50 gives the selling price of 30c. Later when looking at the sales data she will commonly calculate a gross margin. This is the percentage of the sales resulting from the markup ( 10c per apple divided by the 30c selling price gives a gross margin of 33.33 ) . After the fruiterer has sold all of her apples she can expect that she will be able to keep one third of the money and the remainder will be paid to the wholesaler.

Adding a margin of safety also means that the process can be sloppy or out of control. The process might be used on multiple products , or it could set precedence for all processes. Finally , a process that ' s out of control will tend over time to become even more out of control.

If the aircraft 's approach had positioned the aircraft at 50 feet above the threshold , with all other factors remaining the same , the aircraft would have used 6625 feet to stop. This value still exceeds the maximum value as defined by the AFM; however , the aircraft would have remained on the runway. Conversely , if the braking profile had matched that of previous flights , even with a threshold crossing height of 75 feet , the aircraft would have required 6700 feet from threshold to full stop.

Colchicine is a drug which , when not properly dosed , can produce harmful or fatal effects including abdominal pain , vomiting , seizures , lack of blood cell production , and organ failure. Because injectable colchicine is a toxic drug , and also a drug with a narrow margin between an effective dose and a toxic dose , proper manufacturing and dosing recommendations are essential. These can only be assured by making certain that the products are held to the rigorous safety and efficacy standards of the FDA approval process.

Another way to express the difference is that a markup percentage of 50 only yields a margin percentage of 33.33 . Markup , defined as the percentage added to cost to arrive at a selling price , is commonly used to price materials. If you want to mark up an item 20 , you add 20 of the item 's cost to the cost.

Ideally , you would want net profit margin to go up or stay steady. A declining profit margin is not good unless there are some unusual circumstances that caused it. For example , when a company closes a manufacturing plant , there are usually some extra expenses associated with giving the workers severance pay money workers are paid when they are fired or laid off. In the year these workers are fired or laid off , the company 's expenses will increase by the severance pay. But these expenses will not show up on the company 's income statement in the next year so there is no reason for alarm when the decrease in profit margin is because of an unusual expense item . </margin.n.4527><margin.n.4528>After the both sides cavity hole separation finished , pulls the hook the S shape after the areola margin insertion cavity hole to the nipple plane , mentions upwardly , causes cavity Ministry of Public Security to expose fully , pushes in cavity Song Bing the breast phantom to place the good position , observes two piece of shapes to be good , after position symmetry , sutures the myo- level separately , subcutaneous tissue areola margin.

It may be that the design is poor or that the manufacturing process has not been debugged.

This situation is further exacerbated by accounting principles that encourage low margin products to be first in line for transfer to the offshore location. At the end of the year , it doesn ' t matter if the bottom line is increased by making the high margin product more profitable or by making the low margin line more profitable. One hundred jobs transferred to a low cost center will result in a $ 2 , 000 , 000 savings either way.

That is , if based on the nominal schedule of charges ( which , as noted above , virtually no one actually pays ) , Medicaid patients were billed for 10 percent of the total charges , then 10 percent of the patient care expenses would be allocated to Medicaid. Within the hospital , this estimate can be made at the department level , with Medicaid or other payers ' share of charges in departments such as laboratory , radiology , and intensive care units being used to allocate the expenses of those departments.

For example , in the case where a large margin needs to be set with respect to the pre-scan image , the size of the pre-scan image area 58 is reduced relative to the pre-scan image display area 52 on which the pre-scan image area 58 is displayed , thereby-widening an area ( area 58a ) other than the pre-scan image area 58 as shown in FIG. 6. Thus , the area designation for adding a large margin can easily be performed. Further , in the case where a margin needs to be added to a part of the pre-scan image , the size of the pre-scan image area 58 is increased relative to the pre-scan image display area 52 , thereby displaying the pre-scan image such that a detailed portion of the pre-scan image can be confirmed.

To do this , you still must know the confidence level you desire , the sample size and the population size , as you do for calculating margin of error with proportional or percentage data. But you also must know the standard deviation for your data set.

This can be easily accomplished by taking a glass of seawater and then chemically analyzing the proportion of salt in that sample. The amount of salt and water in this glass is far smaller than the amount of salt and water in the ocean under study. Nevertheless , the sample is likely to give a very accurate measurement of the ocean 's salinity , provided of course that the salt is evenly distributed across the ocean ( this hypothesis is the analogue of the hypothesis that the poll sample is being randomly chosen ) . In fact , one could already obtain a crude but reasonable estimate of salinity by testing just a single drop of seawater , though of course the larger sample in the glass would provide a more accurate measurement. This analogy may help explain why it is the sample size , rather than the population size , that determines the margin of error in a poll . </margin.n.4795><margin.n.4796>The profitability of a company after taxes are paid.

Both buyer and seller have to deposit margins. The initial margin is deposited before the opening of the day of the Futures transaction. Normally this margin is calculated on the basis of variance observed in daily price of the underlying ( say the index ) over a specified historical period ( say immediately preceding 1 year ) . The margin is kept in a way that it covers price movements more than 99 of the time. Usually three sigma ( standard deviation ) is used for this measurement. This technique is also called value at risk ( or VAR ) . </margin.n.4850><margin.n.4851>There is less disagreement regarding the benefits of margin space , but no firm recommendations regarding the best width. Morris &amp;Hinrich ( 1996 ) imply that wide margins tend to add the visual contrast necessary to make reading easier , while placing text close to the margins makes for heavier reading. Siegel ( 1997 ) claims that type that extends all the way to the edge of a margin makes it more likely that the eye returns to the current line or skips ahead two lines.

To the left of this intersection , the vertical difference between the total revenue and total cost functions represents a net loss. To the right of the break-even point , the vertical difference between the two functions represents net income before taxes. The lower part of the graph shows that the break-even point can also be found by plotting the before tax profit function. When the number of units produced and sold equals zero , the loss is equal to total fixed costs. When the firm produces a positive number of units , the loss is reduced by an amount equal to the contribution margin per unit multiplied by the number of units produced and sold. The slope of NIBT is contribution margin per unit. When enough units are produced and sold to cover the fixed costs , the company reaches the break-even point. This is the point on the graph where the profit function intersects the horizontal axis and it is directly below the point where the total revenue and total cost functions intersect . </margin.n.4853><margin.n.4854>" Our measurement agrees 99 percent with what is predicted by general relativity , which is within our margin of error of plus or minus five percent , " said Pavlis.

When purchasing a safety surface , it is important to consider a system that provides ASTM F1292-04 test results that are a minimum of 20 better than the upper limit. By ensuring that your system performs 20 better , you are , in effect , building in a safety margin to compensate for future wear and tear on the surface. A surface producing results close to the upper limit , is unlikely to remain in compliance over the long term. Every manufacturer should be able to provide you with a certified test report listing the ASTM F1292 results for their surfacing product. Looking for HIC results of 800 or lower and Gmax results of 150 or lower will provide some additional assurance that your surface will continue to provide impact attenuation over the long term . </margin.n.4862><margin.n.4863>You add logical markers to a line with MarkerAdd.

There are many linear classifiers that might satisfy this property. However , we are additionally interested in finding out if we can achieve maximum separation ( margin ) between the two classes. By this we mean that we pick the hyperplane so that the distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data point is maximized. That is to say that the nearest distance between a point in one separated hyperplane and a point in the other separated hyperplane is maximized.

Factors seemingly affecting this bug include the actual values of the margin and padding properties , whether the properties are specified or inherited , and ( very importantly ) the units used in specifying these properties. In other words , if you see that Explorer fails to lay out your block elements correctly by collapsing margins with padding , try using a different unit. Or different syntax. Or explicit values when inherited ones should normally do fine.

We have excluded the effect of our restructuring expense from our calculation of the following : non-GAAP operating expense , non-GAAP operating income , non-GAAP operating margin , non-GAAP net income ( loss ) , non-GAAP net income ( loss ) per share and Adjusted EBITDA. These expenses are primarily associated with the restructuring actions commenced in June and October 2008 , and January and June 2009.

As with any other type of loan , the brokerage firm charges a margin rate , which is interest that must be paid on the amount you have borrowed. The " margin " in the account is the amount of money or securities you must deposit in order to create a loan against securities held in the account. When you buy on margin , you essentially buy the securities with borrowed money , using the shares as collateral. As such , if the value of the shares drops sufficiently , you will be required to either deposit more cash into the account or sell a portion of the stock in order to maintain the margin requirements of the account. This is known as a " margin call.

Many companies show this computation prominently in their statement , but in some instances you may want to compute it on your own. This figure is important , as it is used to determine how much excess cash a business has to fund current expenses. Working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. Since a company 's sources to pay its current debt come partly from current assets , a business with a comfortable margin should be able to pay its bills and operate successfully. How much working capital is enough depends on the proportion of current assets to current liabilities rather than on the dollar amount of working capital.

Thus , while the profit margin measures the amount of profit per unit of sales , the rate of profit on total assets indicates the efficiency of the total investment. Or , put another way , while the profit margin measures the amount of profit per unit of capital ( labor , working capital , and depreciation of plant and equipment ) consumed over a particular period , the profit rate measures the amount of profit per unit of capital advanced ( the entire stock of capital required for the production of the good ) . </margin.n.5300><margin.n.5301>Several advantages of calculating gross margin exist for both the company and its investors. Investors want to put their money in a company that has the highest gross margin , meaning it made the most money. The business can also use gross margin to monitor its progress and see what areas need to be controlled. For example , a company may realize the cost of manufacturing a certain project costs more than it 's worth. The company can then find a cheaper way to manufacture the product or stop selling the product . </margin.n.5301><margin.n.5302>To open an account , a minimum margin deposit of $ 2 , 500 for a standard account or a minimum margin deposit of $ 250 for a mini account is required by wire transfer , bank check , money order , certified check , or personal check.

The strategy was pioneered by Benjamin Graham , the dean of value investing and the founder of modern security analysis. Margin of safety investing involves the systematic comparison of values and prices. Value is the sum of future profits earned by a company during its lifetime , discounted back to establish a present value. The margin of safety investor searches for gaps , ideally chasms , between this intrinsic value of a business and the extrinsic , fluctuating price of shares of that business. Price matters. The margin of safety investor tries to buy only when the company is selling at a substantial discount to the underlying value of the business. When the investor correctly identifies a discount , and when the market comes to properly value the business , the investment appreciates . </margin.n.5303><margin.n.5304>Two or more adjoining vertical margins of block boxes in the normal flow collapse.

Under purchase accounting rules , some portion of an acquisition purchase price is generally allocated to intangibles , such as core and developed technology and customer contracts , which are then amortized over various periods of time. Our GAAP presentations include amortization on certain acquired intangibles from prior consummated transactions. We have excluded the effect of amortization of acquired intangibles from our calculation of the following : non-GAAP gross margin , non-GAAP gross profit , non-GAAP operating income , non-GAAP operating margin , non-GAAP net income ( loss ) , non-GAAP net income ( loss ) per share and Adjusted EBITDA. Amortization of acquired intangible assets expense is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our various acquisitions. Further , the amortization expense on acquired intangibles does not result in ongoing cash expenditures , and , in our view , does not otherwise have a material impact on our ongoing business operations. Investors should note that the use of acquired intangible assets contributed to revenues earned during the periods presented and will continue to contribute to future period revenues.

On occasion , however , you might want to venture beyond basic word processing and into the realm of desktop publishing. You might want to precisely position and format blocks of text in your document , or you might want to customize the overall " look " of your document by applying a uniform color scheme. Although Word does n't offer all the bells and whistles incorporated in high-end desktop publishing applications , it does include a nice collection of desktop publishing tools that can serve the majority of your workaday desktop publishing needs.The desktop publishing capabilities in Word let you control text layout by using text boxes , AutoShapes formatted to serve as text containers , and frames. And you can add pizzazz to your page layouts by including backgrounds and themes in on-screen documents and watermarks in printed documents.

Structures are not specifically designed for failure level loads , however , they are proportioned such that under expected loading , the structure will provide an acceptable margin against the failure state.

First , we must realize that when the Securities Exchange Act was passed in 1934 , direct buying and selling of stocks were the only ways to profit from stock price movements. Since then , innovations in the marketplace have led to the creation of financial products that allow investors to speculate on stock price movements without actually owning any stocks. For example , significant exposure to specific stocks may be obtained through fully paid for derivative securities , such as options , which by design are highly leveraged. Also , investors can use stock index futures contracts to speculate on broad stock market movements. The margin in futures is set by the futures exchanges and is considered not an extension of credit but rather a performance bond to provide assurance to meet the participant 's future obligations. As an illustration , the initial margin for each Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) index futures contract is $ 6 , 750 , which is about 6.75 of the contract value ( each contract is $ 10 times the DJIA index , or about $ 100 , 000 ) .

While other factors -- such as competition and demand -- may play into pricing decisions , a gross profit margin is a good starting point for product pricing. For example , if a product costs $ 8 to produce , and your gross profit margin is 20 percent , you can calculate your pricing by dividing your cost by ( 1-.0.2 ) . In this case , $ 8 divided by .8 would yield a price of $ 10 . </margin.n.5586><margin.n.5587>Summary : Use this profitability ratio analysis to determine gross profit margin , operating profit margin , net profit margin , return on assets , return on equity , price to earning ( P/E ) ratio , and earnings per share ( EPS ) easily based on information taken directly from a company 's financial statements.

Milk prices have been firm in nearby months and are now trading at their highest levels since June on optimism surrounding the latest CWT herd retirement program. Recent strength in cheese , NDM and butter prices have all helped support ideas that demand is improving as well which has allowed futures prices to maintain their strength over the past two months. Meanwhile , a clearer weather forecast to harvest corn and soybean crops during the first week of November and sentiments that the market has become overbought is putting pressure on feed values which is also welcome relief to dairy producers.

For example , there is a strong positive relationship between second-quarter U.S. refining/marketing income and the second-quarter gross refining margin.98 Although the gross refining margin in Q196 was low in comparison with the general level of margins in the 1990 's , it was well above the first-quarter margin of the year before ( Table 19 ) . In Q195 , the refining margin fell to a 6-year low , squeezed by a combination of a slight rise in crude oil input costs and downward pressures on gasoline and distillate prices. The modest recovery in the overall refining margin largely reflected the effects of an especially cold winter in 1995-1996 , particularly in March. Distillate prices were up 17 percent and the price of propane rose 22 percent between Q195 and Q196.

Water washing of the fruits or decocting is not a satisfactory detoxification method; stir-frying with retention of most of the fruit spikes is not as effective in eliminating the toxic component as when spikes are removed. There is no evidence that the residual amounts of CAT or other compounds are a threat to human health. Still , as a further precaution , the dosage of xanthium should be limited to the range ( 3-10 grams/day ) normally recommended in Materia Medica guides whenever there is prolonged use of the herb , thus allowing a 10-fold margin of safety compared to the dose reported to have caused a significant reaction in a human ( 100 grams ) . By the combination of correct processing and limiting the dose , the risk ( as observed in animals grazing on the plants ) should be eliminated.

The proposed method involves several preprocessing steps , including a Radon-based rotation estimation for the microarray image , as well as spot detection and selection. The distance between rows and columns of spots is then estimated and the positions of the selected spots are used to train a set of linear soft-margin Support Vector Machine classifiers. The use of soft-margin SVMs allows high tolerance to outliers that result from artefacts and noise , whereas the use of redundant vectors in the SVM training set and the automatic determination of the operating parameters facilitate a substantial increase in gridding accuracy. Overall , the proposed method achieves successful automatic gridding of cDNA microarray images in the presence of irregular spots , noise and artefacts , as well as image rotation . </margin.n.5884><margin.n.5885>The other work that was done at the same was the ability to record a budget ( and a revised budget ) against a case and there is a simplistic little tool that helps you do this eg. enter a staff member or staff class and a number of hours plus disbursements and it calculates the total budget.

One party pays fixed , the other an agreed variable rate. Maturities are generally out to two years and are priced off the underlying yield curve. The transaction is done on a nominal amount and only the difference between contracted and actual rates is paid. If rates have risen by the time of the agreement ' s maturity , the purchaser receives the difference in rates from the seller and vice versa. A swap is therefore a strip of FRAs. FRAs are off-balance sheet there are no up-front or margin payments and the credit risk is limited to the mark-to-market value of the transactions. Unlike interest rate swaps , FRAs settle at the beginning of the interest period , two business days after the calculation date . </margin.n.6030><margin.n.6031>Your Interest Rate will be equal to the Index ( the 1 Year Constant Maturity Treasury rate , or CMT ) plus our Margin , unless your Interest Rate Caps limit the amount of the change in the Interest Rate.

Products produced for mass channel retailers appeared to be the most profitable products from a gross margin perspective. Additional special products for these customers were created to drive more volume , and prices were increased. Then , a new CFO joined the company and began measuring net margin. Initial reports showed that the special products were losing money , even though gross margin numbers still looked good. Further analysis revealed that two important costs had been left out of the gross margin calculation. First , the special products required distinct , expensive packaging , the cost of which was captured in supply chain expenses. Second , account representatives increased trade dollars to offset the price increases , a cost that was allocated to the marketing department 's trade promotion budget. When net margin became the primary metric used to determine the performance of these special products , trade-dollar loopholes were closed and the full promotion-to-retirement cost structure was calculated. As a result , the company was able to increase net margin of the special products by 4 percent without a negative impact on volume . </margin.n.6042><margin.n.6043>Let ' s take a stab at the CSS we are going to need to pull this off.

As a result , the customer ' s equity in the margin account is $ 50 , 000 , and the customer has received a margin loan of $ 50 , 000 from the firm. Assume that on Day 2 the market value of the securities falls to $ 60 , 000. Under this scenario , the customer ' s margin loan from the firm would remain at $ 50 , 000 , and the customer ' s account equity would fall to $ 10 , 000 ( $ 60 , 000 market value less $ 50 , 000 loan amount ) . However , the minimum maintenance margin requirement for the account is 25 , meaning that the customer ' s equity must not fall below $ 15 , 000 ( $ 60 , 000 market value multiplied by 25 ) . Since the required equity is $ 15 , 000 , the customer would receive a maintenance margin call for $ 5 , 000 ( $ 15 , 000 less existing equity of $ 10 , 000 ) .

However , different brokerage houses have different rules , and some of them may permit cash withdrawals provided maintenance margin limits are met. Conversely , other brokerage houses do not actually permit excess funds to be withdrawn in cash , but will allow them to be used for other transactions. Finally , some brokerage houses will set aside any funds that exceed initial margin requirements , and will allow them to be withdrawn , even if subsequently actual margin drops below the initial margin level . </margin.n.6165><margin.n.6166>Changes in future operating profit margins can have a significant impact on shareholder value.

In the next decade , uniform standards of resolution , trackline density , processing parameters , etc. should be established and applied to seismic surveys for at least several select margin transects around Antarctica. Along these transects , all current acoustic systems should be used to image the full suite ( small to large ) of acoustic features. These transects would define type sections to be drilled/cored and compared in detail to derive a high-resolution seismic stratigraphic process-model for the Antarctic margin , like that of the Vail et al.

A more consistent example is found in Gary Panter 's Jimbo in Purgatory , where each page is framed in a thick decorative border. These types of marginal framing devices tend to increase the view of a page as an individuated entity of combined panels. If , in reading most comics , we slip easily from page to page , in a work such as Panter 's each page is much more a stopping point. Like an individual panel , the margin-frame provides an extra element of focus for our attention. The Jimbo pages are often designed with this sense of parts and the whole , such as the frequent pages where the foreground of each panel is different , part of a sequence , but the background is a continuous pattern or image . </margin.n.6189><margin.n.6190>If you have taken a Safety Class recently , you name has been added to the distribution list for the Safety Notes Newsletter.

This is what makes them an appealing investment , and also a risky one. Leverage means that the traders need only commit a little money to control a lot of product. Since a futures contract is based on deferred delivery , no money is exchanged at the time a trader buy or sell the futures contract. Therefore , not a lot of money is needed to buy or sell a futures contract.

If that short position ( s ) is closed the same day , a day trade charge will be assessed using the naked margin requirement as required by the NYSE. This charge will not reflect in your intraday buying power figures and can consequently result in a day trade margin call that will be issued against the account the following day . </margin.n.6312><margin.n.6313>If the equity in your account drops below the margin required to maintain your open positions , we may close all open positions.

The more efficient the company , the greater is its profitability. It is useful to compare a company 's profitability against that of its major competitors in its industry. Such a comparison tells whether the company is operating more or less efficiently than its rivals. In addition , the change in a company 's profit ratios over time tells whether its performance is improving or declining. A number of different profit ratios can be used , and each of them measures a different aspect of a company 's performance. The most commonly used profit ratios are gross profit margin , net profit margin , return on total assets , and return on stockholders ' equity . </margin.n.6321><margin.n.6322>Short selling , naked call writing and other risk-unlimited strategies generally require a large initial deposit and maintenance requirement.

Currently , on their audited statements , hospitals will add bad debt and charity care to their expenses and not report charges for this care as part of their gross patient care revenue. In the past , and in many current State reporting systems , the charges for charity and bad debt were included in gross patient care revenue , and then explicit write-offs were reported for bad debt and charity. This change in accounting does not change margins where the denominator is net revenues , since these charges would be netted out in any case. However , it can bury estimates of charity care and bad debt in footnotes to the accounting statement.

Certainly , we 've emphasized the opportunity to lose money faster , but you can also make money faster using these tools. If half of your equity comes from margin , you can gain money twice as fast. As stocks go up , your profits are compounded , because you own twice as many shares as you could normally afford. Thusly , when the market drops , you lose twice as fast . </margin.n.6395><margin.n.6396>The company also performed well in the gross profit area. Gross profits increased because the gross profit margins increased quite significantly. It appears that the company may have found a way to cut the costs of sales ( direct costs ) significantly as a percentage of sales. The cost of sales is now fewer pennies per sales dollar than last period. From a more practical view , even though sales fell , gross profits rose because of savings in direct costs . </margin.n.6396><margin.n.6397>The margin of desolation however , has not been maintained for years.

But for the low margin company , the impact of a similar three-point change in margins only produced a Lifo expense adjustment of $ 375 ( 3.8 ) of inventory. In the following year , the margins are assumed to revert back to where they were at the outset. The high margin company shows over twice as much income created by the Lifo adjustment as does the low margin company. These year-to-year swings in the Lifo adjustment are generally unwelcome. Keeping a watchful eye on the monthly price index would most likely have lulled a taxpayer into thinking there would be no Lifo effect at all because there was no visible sign of either inflation or deflation. But if there was a resulting change in gross profit margins , taxpayers could have quite a surprise on their hands. As exhibit 2 shows , the surprise could go either way , and would affect high margin companies more than low margin companies . </margin.n.6400><margin.n.6401>Strangely enough , we find that although these calculations are basically simple , they do catch out more students than they ought to do.

To avoid a situation in which an actual primary pressure can not be secured due to loss and the like in a hydraulic circuit , thereby making it impossible to achieve a target gear ratio , a primary pressure required for calculation is topped up by a margin.

We have excluded the effect of our share-based compensation expense from our calculation of the following : non-GAAP operating expense , non-GAAP operating income , non-GAAP operating margin , non-GAAP net income ( loss ) , non-GAAP net income ( loss ) per share and Adjusted EBITDA , as this provides our management with an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. Because of varying available valuation methodologies , subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies may use , as well as the impact of non-operational factors such as our share price and events such as tender offers on the magnitude of this expense. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense allows investors and analysts to make meaningful comparisons between our ongoing core business operating results and those of other companies.

Absolutely. More and more in today ' s environment , these two terms are being used interchangeably to mean gross margin , but that misunderstanding may be the menace of the bottom line. Markup and profit are not the same ! Also , the accounting for margin and mark-up are different ! A clear understanding and application of the two within a pricing model can have a drastic impact on the bottom line.

The margin required is a percentage of the value of the contract , as determined each day , and usually , but not always , ranges between 5 and 15 . The percentage can range between 0 and 100 ; 0 and 90 ; 0 and 80 ; 0 and 70 ; 0 and 60 ; 0 and 50 ; 0 and 40 ; 0 and 30 ; 0 and 20 ; or 0 and 10 . The percentage varies for each product according to the product 's price and volatility. Futures traders do n't exchange the full value of the underlying commodity -- the " notional value " -- of any futures contract. They need only ensure there is enough margin , or performance bond capital , in their account as they monitor the daily price changes of each contract they are trading. At the end of each day , and at some exchanges at periodic intervals during the trading day , the futures exchange identifies the current price for each contract or open position held by a trader and then debits or credits each trader 's account according to that price . </margin.n.6472><margin.n.6473>A similar set of results accompanies an improvement in the organization 's collection experience.

The design procedure used in the provisions still relies on linear structural analysis techniques , which inherently is based on an incorrect behavioral model for the structure at the failure state , and consequently incorporates large amounts of uncertainty.

For example , lets assume that the new product proposed by Marketing in our story above is a purchased finished good produced by a TQM manufacturer. Non-value added activities such as " Inspect Receipt " , " Expedite Order " , and " Return Product " will not be consumed by this new product. By excluding these activity costs from the ABC price calculation , it is possible to sell the new product for less than $ 38.50 and still achieve the desired 5 profit.

For instance , looking at the row for Stock ( original order ) transactions , we see that the average sale is $ 300; margin is 26 percent; cost is $ 63; and profit per transaction is $ 15. When the total transaction profits for stock orders are taken as a percent of sales ( $ 3 , 661 , 665/ ( $ 244 , 111 300 ) ) the resulting product is that they are approximately five percent of sales. However , looking at the Transaction Profits column , 32.67 percent of total transaction profits ( $ 3 , 661 , 665/ $ 11 , 207 , 688 ) of Big Time Electric are in stock orders.

Another reason it is important to separate these costs is because variable costs are used to determine the contribution margin , and the contribution margin is used to determine the break-even point. The contribution margin is the difference between the per-unit variable cost and the selling price per unit. For example , if the per-unit variable cost is $ 15 and selling price per unit is $ 20 , then the contribution margin is equal to $ 5. The contribution margin may provide a $ 5 contribution toward the reduction of fixed costs or a $ 5 contribution to profits. If the business is operating at a volume above the break-even point volume ( above point F ) , then the $ 5 is a contribution ( on a per-unit basis ) to additional profits. If the business is operating at a volume below the break-even point ( below point F ) , then the $ 5 provides for a reduction in fixed costs and continues to do so until the break-even point is passed . </margin.n.6555><margin.n.6556>I 've never had a problem with copyright notices being chopped off.

Most of our foods , particularly processed convenience foods , are not inherently safe , but rather safety is engineered into the product through processing , packaging , prudent use of additives , storage and handling conditions ( temperature ) , or combinations of these.

Design criteria that meet the needs of both hover lift problems and forward flight snag problems , however , are all essentially mutually exclusive.

An additional difficulty is that the release force needs to be adjustable for different empty helicopter weights , available engine power , different consumables on board at the time of lift , and different density altitudes. Without some form of automatic control that has these inputs , a satisfactory device can not be developed for the hover lifting scenarios.

Unlike the 1980 's when gross margins held fairly steady , weak demand squeezed the spread between product prices and the prices of crude oil inputs.

The increase in marketing costs was widespread , with 16 of 18 FRS refiners reporting higher unit marketing costs between 1988 and 1992. The reasons for higher marketing costs are not altogether clear. Advertising outlays were up , reflecting a resurgence of growth in gasoline marketing in the wake of the oil price collapse of 1986.

Sadly , they will not find it on Wall Street or in the financial media. Investors will only find it by returning to sound investment principles that have stood the test of time. Benjamin Graham 's concept of " Margin of Safety " is as relevant today as it was yesterday , especially given the amount of leverage in the financial markets. Graham 's " Margin of Safety " became the central tenet of his investment philosophy. Graham took the concept from the bond market and applied it to stocks. Fixed income investors understand the importance of a company earning enough income to meet its interest and principal payments. The margin of safety for bond investors lies in a company 's ability to earn in excess of what is required to meet its debt obligations. The greater the earnings , and the excess above required debt payments , the greater the safety to bondholders. It is this surplus , above what is required to meet interest obligations , that provides bond investors a level of comfort if future corporate earnings decline . </margin.n.6637><margin.n.6638>A commonsense approach to prepare for future increase in your home loan interest rate is to evaluate the worst-case scenario , and then build a margin of safety. If you examine how interest rates have moved over the past decade , you will notice that the maximum level of home loan interest rates during this period was around 14 per cent p.a. So it may be reasonable to assume that the worst-case scenario is home loan rates climbing back to 14 per cent p.a. during the next decade. If it does , you would have two options : make higher EMI payments or settle for extending the tenure of your loan. Although the bank earns more interest income if you choose the latter , for the customer , the former option is any day better. After all , why would you want to pay interest charges to the bank for extra years ? And who knows , may be you want to take an early retirement , in which case you would be unable to extend the loan tenure . </margin.n.6638><margin.n.6639>It may be noted elsewhere on this blog , but the Tru Tone Wide Margin Reference Bible LACKS a wide inside ( gutter ) margin.

But , in the advance EMI plan , you pay six EMIs upfront and the remaining 30 instalments over the next two-and-a-half years. Do n't let the phraseology confound you : advance EMI actually works like the margin money scheme , where the upfront EMIs work as the down payment.

Since these elements will vary by individual distributor , the most appropriate advice for a quick solution would be to use your current pricing methodology ( i.e. typical examples include bundling in the gross margin or a cost plus approach ) . However , this pricing approach must be adapted to permit a tiered service offering ( Basic and Extended Value ) as discussed earlier in Step 2. While there are no absolutes when it comes to establishing " the right way " to price distributor value contributions , the absolutely wrong solution is to ignore the issue ! </margin.n.6756><margin.n.6757>As these dynamics suggest , however , comparing profit margins of different companies is most meaningful when the companies are in the same line of business or when there is reason to believe one 's cost structure is analogous to another's. For instance , as Table I illustrates , companies in the pharmaceutical industry bring in , on average , a profit margin four times that of paper manufacturers. Thus , to expect a paper company to perform in the range of a pharmaceutical company would in most cases be unrealistic . </margin.n.6757><margin.n.6758>Proposed amended Note B , new Item 14 and new Note G are designed to help a broker-dealer that clears and carries SFPs in securities accounts on behalf of customers to calculate the appropriate customer reserve requirement under the Reserve Formula. Without amended Note B , a broker-dealer 's Reserve Formula computation would not include a credit to reflect the firm 's use of customer assets to secure a letter of credit , which is then used as customer SFP margin deposit with a Clearing Agency or DCO. Similarly , without proposed Item 14 and Note G , a broker-dealer 's Reserve Formula computation would not include a debit to reflect the firm 's use of assets for customer purposes to meet its customer SFP margin deposit requirements.

What the chart tells you is that each dollar of investment which brings in a margin of .6667 in two weeks and , when reinvested , does it again in another two weeks , and so on - that particular one dollar will earn a margin of $ 17.34 in the course of one year . </margin.n.6767><margin.n.6768>Through variable pricing we are increasingly able to produce predictably better results in many departments and to raise margin overall. Our department managers have studied the contribution to margin of groups of products within each department. Cheese , for example , has a few leaders with low margin , a midmargin area , and a high margin area ( imports ) . By determining the volume in the low , mid , and high margin segments , we have played with pricing and pushed margin up overall , while maintaining some very impressive low prices on key items.

When you 're setting the margins for a spread , notice that you can set the right-hand margin to 1/2 " if you wish , since on a spread , the right-hand margin of the left page combines with the left-hand margin of the right page. If each of these margins are 1/2 " , they will combine to form a gutter margin of 1 " .

Additionally , it is useful to determine if the toxicity is due to inhibition of the target ( on-target or pharmacological-based toxicity ) or a chemically mediated compound liability ( off-target/Chemical toxicity ) or due to lack of target selectivity ( off-target/secondary pharmacology ) . It is important to note that all substances are toxic at some dose , but what is most important in drug development is that there is acceptable safety as determined by the degree of separation between the targeted pharmacological dose and the doses ( or exposures ) in animals where toxic effects are observed. This separation is known as the safety margin which is critical for determining an acceptable risk-to-benefit ratio for a particular therapeutic indication. For longer term therapies prescribed for serious , but not life threatening indications , this safety margin must be relatively high so as not to produce unnecessary harm to patients in the form of adverse side effects. For more serious or life-threatening indications , such as cancer , a safety margin may be much lower , allowing for more serious side effects if they can be monitored for and/or managed . </margin.n.6903><margin.n.6904>Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees equality to all citizens. In so doing , it splits these citizens according to what it terms reasonable classification . Additionally , it advises a test for judging the reasonability of any classification. To pass this test , it says , the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group. It is foregone that equality proceeds only with an intelligible differentia. So what exactly is this intelligible differentia between the homosexual and the heterosexual ? How does it become ' reasonable ' ? And what is the history of such discernment , of the margins that were drawn and the people that were grouped on its either side ? In sexuality politics , to be marginalised is also to be relegated to a particular kind of difference , one that first makes place for and then adjudicates one ' s inner truth. For instance the right to employment says nothing about one ' s self or personhood , unlike the right to one ' s own sexuality , which is hooked directly onto a definition of the self . </margin.n.6904><margin.n.6905>When you look at the scoring margins of 5v12 and 6v11 matchups , it 's no wonder those are the key games to spot Cinderellas.

Patrick Hourigan RET 261 2-10-08 Chapter 6 Questions 5. I would expect Wal-Mart to have a higher asset turnover. This is because Wal-Mart targets customers looking for a low price and not a high assortment of inventory. Neiman Marcus focuses on people interested in fashionable goods so they need to invest in more merchandise inventory , thus creating a lower asset turnover. Also , I believe that Wal-Mart and Neiman Marcus will have net profit margin s that are very similar. Both of these stores generate large numbers of net profit and net sales; however Neiman Marcus is more profitable with the goods that they sell. Although fewer goods may be sold here , at their higher prices the net profit margin may turn out to be a little higher than Wal-Mart. 8. Lowe 's asset turnover is equal to net sales divided by total assets , so Lowe 's asset turnover for 2005 was 1.72.

In order that the market value of the securities does not fall too low , the broker requires that the ratio of market value to the loan always exceed a certain proportion. Alternatively , the customer 's equity in the securities as a proportion of the total value of the securities can not fall below a specified proportion. This proportion is termed the margin requirement. Currently , the legal margin requirement on all stocks is 50 ; i.e. at least 50 of the price of the securities should be financed by the customer himself. However , the broker can demand a higher margin level. This margin requirement at the time of initial purchase , which is termed the initial margin is larger than the margin requirement at a later time . </margin.n.6927><margin.n.6928>Making a profit in multiple retailing is the result of effectively managing constraints such as space , and controlling variable elements such as Cost of Goods Sold.

These clients often maintain minimum exchange margins and do not maintain any meaningful excess margin with their FCMs. These corporate clients typically have sophisticated treasury management capabilities and can generate greater returns on margin assets than an FCM is capable of or allowed to provide. This treasury management capability is also accompanied by a formalized counterparty risk management policy requiring that little margin excess be held with trading counterparties. These clients will also maintain multiple FCM relationships and have unpredictable trading patterns and as such , have margin assets that flow quickly in and out of an FCM. These margin flows cause significant daily changes in both margin and regulatory capital requirements.

Once this entry is credited to the SMA , it remains there until used. It does not disappear even if the account loses the excess equity that created the SMA in the first place.

No effect is seen on the bridging margin with different segment lengths of center pull back at the serif line end. Bridging margin can be improved dramatically ( 6 ) by adding SRAF , due to the increase of aerial image intensity in the line end space.

Basis was largely flat , although the forecast appears favorable for the first week of November which should allow more supply availability to hit the cash market near-term. While the extremely slow pace of harvest has raised fears of crop losses and compromised quality , there is no historical evidence suggesting that final yield will be significantly below current assumptions. Meanwhile , the sharp rally since the beginning of October appears to have compromised export demand which is also a concern given the large supply. Unlike the middle of October , the market now appears to be encouraging storage given current futures spreads , and weak basis quotes in the cash market may likewise discourage a spot sale. Strategies to protect a range of lower prices would look attractive for the 2009 crop , while the stronger profit margin indicative in the 2010 crop is likewise presenting a good opportunity to secure protection there with a similar strategy . </margin.n.6983><margin.n.6984>The proprietary attributes also set the bottom margin to zero.

In other words , trading on margin increases your risk. If you trade on margin , you need to understand that just as easily as your profits can be magnified using leverage , so too can losses during unfavorable market conditions. Margin accounts are more sensitive than cash accounts to the day-to-day swings in the market because of the leverage and maintenance requirements , which means you can lose more funds than you deposit into your margin account.

In addition to this growth , they also lowered their churn rate to 3.9 from 4.2 , which suggests people are generally pleased to continue paying for their service and was a nice change from previous quarters. Netflix was able to expand its gross margin nicely as well as it came in at 38 compared to just 35.2 a year ago. Part of this margin expansion is due to the ability for customers to stream content online versus actually needing a physical disk mailed to their home.

In the case of turnover , if a firm succeeds in , for example , doubling the amount of times the production process repeats itself in the same period , then twice as much profit would be made on the same capital invested even though the profit margin might not change.

The maintenance margin , which determines the leverage on a continuing basis , is set by the exchanges and brokers. Currently , the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) and the National Association of Securities Dealers ( NASD ) generally require member firms to impose a minimum 25 maintenance margin requirement on their customers. In practice , the house margins set by individual brokerage firms are higher , and some brokerage firms further differentiate their margin requirements by individual stocks and the trading behavior of their customers. To the extent that the maintenance margin is less than the initial margin , the price of a stock can fall substantially before investors are required to furnish additional funds. In the earlier example , at a 25 maintenance margin , the value of ABC stock can fall to $ 66.66 before the investor must provide additional funds to the broker. At $ 66.66 per share , the amount of borrowing , $ 50 , represents 75 of the value of the stock . </margin.n.7295><margin.n.7296>1.

Operating profit also gives investors an opportunity to do profit-margin comparisons between companies that do not issue a separate disclosure of their cost of goods sold figures ( which are needed to do gross margin analysis ) . Operating profit measures how much cash the business throws off , and some consider it a more reliable measure of profitability since it is harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than net earnings.

This makes it a common and important metric. Operating profit margin ratio analysis measures a company ' s operating efficiency and pricing efficiency with its successful cost controlling. The higher the ratio , the better a company is. A higher operating profit margin means that a company has lower fixed cost and a better gross margin or increasing sales faster than costs , which gives management more flexibility in determining prices. It also provides useful information for investors to determine the quality of a company when looking at the trend in operating margin over time and to compare with industry peers. There are many ways for a company to artificially enhance this ratio by excluding certain expenses or improperly recording inventory. Revenues may also be falsified by recording unshipped products , recording sales into a different period than they actually occurred , or more. Usually , it serves more as a general measurement than a concrete value . </margin.n.7350><margin.n.7351>NARROW margins with a top and bottom margin of 0.75 inch and a left and right margin of 0.25 inch , and 0.3 inch separating the header and footer from the top and bottom margin , respectively . </margin.n.7351><margin.n.7352>Boosting your company 's net profit is n't always about selling more products or services.

What we need to do here is to establish a relationship between space and the average value of Inventory at Cost. We use the Average Inventory at Cost as the key measure here because it is the " investment " referred to in the preceding G.M.R.O.I. calculation.

It is not necessary that a company have a very high net profit margin; in fact , in some industries it is better not to. With companies such as grocery stores , it is important to move a massive amount of volume. To do this , grocery stores must reduce their profit margins to as low as possible. Keep in mind that a high net profit margin does not correlate to large profits. If the company can not move their product , it does not matter what the net profit margin is , they are not making money. Basically , the net profit margin is telling us how much markup , after all costs and expenses , there is in the companies business model.

When premium price is charged firms can enjoy high profit margins , even when their cost structures are comparable to that of their competitors. However , premium prices and market share may not be complimentary. For example , Toyota and Honda despite their reputation of high quality do not charge premium. They are more interested in increasing their market share. Prices of different models of Toyota and Honda cars are average compared to same category cars produced by their competitors ( Power report , the , 2002 ) . There is a possible link , therefore , between quality and profit margins. Thus we compared the profit margins of award winners with those of control groups.

Technology hardware , such as computers , routers and servers sold by the various technology divisions , declined as the Company continued to shift emphasis away from these low margin products. Sales of copier/printer equipment declined in response to ongoing economic and competitive pressures as well as the Company 's strategic focus on moving from low-end , lower margin products to high-end , higher margin products. The Company continued to post year-over-year growth in sales of higher-end products , specifically segments 5 and 6 black &amp;white production equipment and production color.

Under this theory any deposit cost is acceptable so long as it is acquired at a cost that is then , less than the associated wholesale cost. Although one tries to keep that margin as wide as possible , this process is flawed in several manners. The first being that such pricing trains an institution to be rate sensitive as growth is accomplished through the offering of deposit specials resulting in depositors always asking for the off maturity special . This used to work since the deposit was then rolled into a non-special rate. However as depositors have discovered the game , they no longer automatically roll , they call and ask for the special or move to a competitor that has a special that day.

With higher patient volumes , the care provider 's fixed costs will spread across a larger patient population ( all of the former patients , plus the additional new ones ) so that the effective fixed cost per patient falls , producing a larger NOI margin for each patient treated. If a care provider can not increase patient volumes , then it must " manage out " the excess fixed capacity to recover the associated costs an activity that can easily take several years; involve significant transition costs; and involve wrenching human decisions , such as eliminating jobs and releasing long-term employees. These management costs usually make it impossible to recover the entire excess capacity and realize related potential fixed-cost savings . </margin.n.7649><margin.n.7650>Many of the inventors I meet got started because they wanted an outlet for their creativity or sought more freedom in their careers.

Students have played an important role in the past , but for the moment , they 're on the margins. see also profit margin. In finance , the amount by which the value of collateral pledged as security for a loan exceeds the amount of the loan. This excess provides the lender a " margin " of safety over and above the collateral offered and thus makes extending a loan a more attractive proposition. The size of the margin varies with the type of collateral , the stability of its market price , and the credit standing of the borrower. The term margin is also used in reference to securities transactions. When securities are purchased " on margin , " the buyer supplies a percentage of the purchase price in cash , pledges the security as collateral , and borrows the remainder from the broker.

When the corporate pricing team makes strategic pricing decisions , it is very difficult to enforce them when salespeople are given incentives based on volume. Salespeople often become customer advocates because it is easier to sell products and services at the lowest possible price. While companies that are most effective at improving pricing have made major changes to their incentive structures , even those companies that implement small or incremental changes have also achieved benefits. For example , some companies have introduced a " controllable " margin component that equates to 25 percent of the overall commission. Controllable margin comprises the cost elements over which the salesperson has control , for example , service , freight , expediting charges , and payment terms. Net margin , on the other hand , includes elements out of the salesperson 's control , such as manufacturing costs , overhead and labor . </margin.n.7682><margin.n.7683>Using CFDs for their leverage Another benefit of CFDs lies in their leverage.

Just like a margin loan , an interest rate will apply ( on the full $ 50 , 000 exposure , not just the $ 45 , 000 leverage ) and , if the value of the security being used as collateral falls too much , the position might have to be sold down partially or fully to mitigate the potential for unmanageable losses . </margin.n.7683><margin.n.7684>Inaudible impairments of impairments near the threshold of audibility require a new method to assess the quality.

It allows you to respond to market changes and react quickly to new investment opportunities that may arise. In addition , you may be protected against late payments for trades. If we do not receive your payment for the purchase of securities , borrowing against the fully paid and marginable securities in your account may cover payment. And , margin interest rates may be comparable to , or lower than , the prime interest rate , the rate offered by banks to their best business customers. The actual interest rate charged will be determined by the value of cash and securities in your account.

An acceptable preclinical safety margin is essential to selecting the most viable development candidates , and this is best determined by repeat-dose in vivo toxicology studies. Based on nonclinical animal studies , No Observable Effect Levels ( NOEL ) on drugs are established , which are used to determine initial phase 1 clinical trial dosage levels on a mass active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) per mass ( kg ) patient basis. Generally a 1/100 uncertainty factor or " safety margin " is included to account for interspecies ( 1/10 ) and inter-individual ( 1/10 ) differences.

In a margin account , your risk includes the amount of money invested plus the amount that has been loaned to you. As market conditions fluctuate , the value of your marginable securities will also fluctuate , causing a change in your overall account balance and debt ratio. As a result , if the value of the securities held in your margin account depreciates , you will be required to deposit additional cash or make full payment of your margin loan to bring your account back up to maintenance levels.

If the future was predictable , then the margin of safety demanded might be smaller. Therefore with a less predictable future , greater safety is demanded. That safety comes from knowing that a company can easily cover its debt expenses many times over. If a company has interest expense of $ 1 and has earnings of $ 10 , then interest coverage is ten times interest expense , and provides the bond investor with a wide margin of safety. The lower the interest expense coverage , the lower the margin of safety of the bond investment. Since the future is never certain , the need for a higher safety margin to cover a possible future decline in net income is greater. To quote Graham , " ... the function of the margin of safety is , in essence , that of rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future. If the margin is a large one , then it is enough to assume that the future earnings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor to feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time " . 2 </margin.n.8209><margin.n.8210>Initial margin shall be computed on an online real time basis , payable on all open positions of Clearing Members , up to client level , and shall be payable upfront by Clearing Members/Professional Clearing Members in accordance with the margin computation methodology adopted by the MCX-SX Clearing Corporation Ltd. of the Exchange from time to time.

In this case , the purpose is to determine the effect that a difference between the budgeted sales mix and the actual sales mix had on contribution margin and net income. The technique separates the sales volume variance into two parts : 1 ) the sales mix variance , and 2 ) the sales quantity variance. One way to do this is to determine the actual units of each product that would have been sold if the actual sales mix had been the same as the budgeted sales mix. These measurements are referred to as actual units adjusted to the budgeted mix ( AUA ) . The differences between these adjusted units and the actual units sold provides the mix variations in terms of units. Multiplying these differences by the budgeted contribution margin per unit provides the sales mix variance that shows of the effect the sales mix differences had on contribution margin.

Emplacement of mafic material at depth can create local uplift , but will mainly contribute to accelerated subsidence of these areas sometimes already prior to phase 2. During phase 2 these half-grabens can be reworked and incorporated into the rift zone , or , if situated on the rift shoulder , they will be uplifted and eroded. If located outside of the rift zone they will develop as rim-basins. Their sedimentary sequence will record the process of shoulder erosion. After thermal subsidence of the shoulders they will become part of the new continental margin and after a relative phase of sediment starvation they will accommodate prograding sequences coming from the mainland. The rim-basins will trap most of the progradation which might never reach the rift area; in the absence of rim-basins the prograding margin is situated directly on the rift zone . </margin.n.8370><margin.n.8371>The first adjustment was an increase in the solar array output so that Dawn can always operate its ion thrusters even at Ceres aphelion , and with adequate margin ( 15 ) that could allow for unexpected power requirements.

Thus a mortgage loan of $ 20 , 000 on a property appraised at $ 30 , 000 would have a margin of safety of $ 10 , 000 or 50 . The protection afforded this mortgage loan may also be viewed as the amount by which the value of the property could shrink and still leave a sum sufficient to pay off the mortgage.

This figure reveals a company 's profits after it pays its variable costs of production , administration , selling , and operating expenses. This shows the efficiency of the company to manage its business operations to earn profits and its ability to pay for its fixed costs , like interest. Investors want a company with consistently high operating profit margins because it shows more liquidity and that sales are increasing faster than costs , which can mean growth. Since companies have more control over operating expenses than its cost of goods sold , it is important to examine this figure carefully because it is directly affected by management decisions. ( see Resources below ) Our example company has an operating profit margin of 19 percent , which means that the company has medium high variable costs. Further research needs to be done to determine the composition of the operating expenses and if all are necessary . </margin.n.8515><margin.n.8516>*This margin requirement for a standard 100K lot implies that a trader is using the full 100 : 1 leverage option.

Its major competitor , HP , earned about $ 990 million for the year on sales of about $ 19.9 billion. Comparing HP 's net earnings of $ 990 million and Dell 's $ 749 million shows that HP earned more than Dell , but it does n't tell you very much about profitability. If you look at the net profit margin , or the earnings generated from each dollar of sales , you 'll see that Dell produced 6.5 cents on each dollar of sales , while HP returned less than 5 cents. That difference was n't huge , but it was one of the reasons why the market valued Dell more than HP . </margin.n.8517><margin.n.8518>Larter , R. D. , and Barker , P.

Some expenses are incurred within patient care units , but many expenses , including such activities as housekeeping , utilities , insurance , and central administration , are aggregated at levels above revenue centers , sometimes at the hospital level. These operating expenses must be allocated among patient care and other operations. Cost allocation , while subject to extensive accounting rules , involves a substantial degree of discretion. In addition , outside analysts of hospital performance often must rely on imprecise allocations based on aggregate data available in publicly available sources. Operating expenses might , for example , be allocated to patient care based on the proportion of operating revenues derived from patient care.

If appropriate data are available , applying fixed safety factors , systematically varying safety factors or using other methods to identify reasonable limits for safe intakes. A crucial factor in understanding the margin of safety that a particular intake is likely to provide is the adequacy of the data to estimate the likely frequency of the adverse response among persons with that intake. For a few nutrients there are sufficient numbers of reports of adverse effects over a sufficiently wide range of exposures to allow estimation of lowest adverse effect levels; for other nutrients the reports of adverse effects are too infrequent or inconsistent to support estimations that are meaningful . </margin.n.8662><margin.n.8663>The next command enlarges an eps input image to print on a large-media A0 capable device , maintaining 2 inch margins : poster -v -mA0 -w2x2i image.eps &gt; outfile </margin.n.8663><margin.n.8664>For the first time in 62 years , the four-man Olympics bobsled team from the US captured the gold medal , setting a course world record in the process.

The benefit of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is that a homebuyer gets a stable interest rate and builds equity in the property over time. But today most buyers find these attributes unnecessary. Many buyers nationwide and roughly half of the buyer in California are using interest-only , adjustable rate mortgages to be able to afford their purchases. These buyers are essentially working without a net. In addition , buyers across the country are now spending more to buy a house relative to their income than any time in history. In other words , buyers have never in history stretched themselves financially more than they are today. Finally , in the good old days when Mom stayed home , homeowners had an additional safety net.

If the time difference is less than the acceptable margin , the quality of the tested RTC is regarded as good. However , this kind of method may cause low efficiency and errors. Because there are only two records of time ( i.e. , at the beginning and the end ) , if the time difference is more than the acceptable margin between the beginning and the end , this kind of method does not detect the error.

The ABC operational margin is calculated deducting from the revenues the operational cost of activities. The economic profit is calculated deducting from the ABC operational margin the cost of capital. These costs should be tracked for every product , customer , business or the whole company. In the case of business " Z " the operational margin is good , but the economic profit is not. The bottom line really matters . </margin.n.8721><margin.n.8722>The operating profit margin measures the returns to capital per dollar of gross farm revenue. Recall , the two ways a farm has of increasing profits is by increasing the profit per unit produced or by increasing the volume of production while maintaining the per unit profit. The operating profit margin focuses on the per unit produced component of earning profit and the asset turnover ratio ( discussed below ) focuses on the volume of production component of earning a profit . </margin.n.8722><margin.n.8723>It ' s helpful to turn some of the figures into ratios , to make relevant comparisons. For example , in this case , net profit margin before tax in relation to sales was 81 : 250 , or 32.4 . After tax , it was 64.8 : 250 or 25.9 . Other useful ratios might highlight particular expenses.

Compared to a cash account , where the stocks are paid for in full , margin accounts allow you to buy more stock for the same amount of cash or , conversely , the same amount of stock with less cash. For example , in a cash account , you would pay $ 100 for 10 shares of stock that is valued at $ 10 per share. With a margin account , you would pay $ 50 for the same amount of shares , borrowing the other 50 percent of the cost on margin. If the stock price increases from $ 10 to $ 15 a share , the cash account client would realize a 50 percent return. However , the margin account client who borrowed 50 percent of the purchase price would realize a 100 percent gain . </margin.n.8793><margin.n.8794>The margin is always transparent.

These books expand on Graham 's definition of a cheap company , which is based on a principle he calls margin of safety. Margin of safety simply means buying companies that are cheap relative to their intrinsic worth , or what the company would be worth if the entire business were sold. The thinking is that if the company does n't rebound , you can cut your losses with minimal harm. Graham bought businesses that were so cheap , so battered , and so neglected , that they sold for less than the value of their working capital , which is current assets minus current liabilities. Graham 's argument was that even with the best research , investors can never know all there is to know about a company. More importantly , investors ca n't always predict the negative surprises that can zap a stock price. So Graham championed this idea of margin of safety . </margin.n.8827><margin.n.8828>If we choose to spend the time to reduce operating expenses by $ 1 , 000 , we 'll have added $ 1 , 000 to our bottom line or increased our net profit margin by .01 percent . </margin.n.8828><margin.n.8829>The Net Profit Margin Ratio or net margin is used to determine a company 's profitability.

In the situation of a review and reassessment where the presence of an existing duty is likely to have resulted in an increase in export prices , an analysis of the need for a lesser duty based on the level of price undercutting related to the margin of dumping , is not useful. To establish whether a lesser duty should apply , the review team has therefore approached the issue by firstly calculating a NIFOB and secondly calculating a NV ( VFDE ) to check that the NIFOB has not exceeded the margin of dumping. If the NIFOB is less than the NV ( VFDE ) , then the NIFOB amount ( which is a form of lesser duty ) will apply. If the NIFOB is greater than the NV ( VFDE ) then the NV ( VFDE ) will apply , i.e. , duty will be imposed at the full margin of dumping . </margin.n.8953><margin.n.8954>Note that profit margins are not the be-all end-all when it comes to profitability as they do n't consider asset utilization.

In this instance groups of animal are given , progressively increasing increments of drug dosage until a dose is achieved which results in death of all animals. Measurements from this dose-response curve yield the LD50 ( Lethal dose which kills 50 of the population ) , LD1 ( dose lethal for 1 of the population ) , and LD99 ( dose lethal for 99 of the population ) . As you might suspect the critical factor in toxicity for therapeutically useful drugs is related to the probability that a normally effective dose for most of the population will produce a major toxic response in a significant portion of the treatment population.

This emergence of side effects when the drug is taken orally provides a margin of safety that often prevents serious and fatal overdoses. In the case of intravenous administration , side effects are generally not experienced until the patient has already received toxic levels of colchicine.

Likewise , if a team was expected to win by 20 goals but kept the margin of victory to only 10 goals , TGL points are awarded to that team in an amount equal to the MOV loss that the team received for not performing to the predicted 20-goal margin. Any gain an underdog team receives when the victory is held to 10 goals instead of the predicted 20 goal will lose TGL points equal to the unexpected gain from the closer than anticipated game score.
