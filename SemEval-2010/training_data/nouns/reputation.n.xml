Failures to pay claims that are deemed payable legally within the limits of the contract or policy have the potential to damage and destroy the reputation of the insurer. Some countries have experienced more than their share of such troubles. For example the United Kingdom has witnessed repetitive destruction of the public 's faith in insurers. Consider the fact that the business or individual who has failed to receive payment on a claim under the terms of an insurance policy , and who purchased that self-same policy from the insurer who fails to fulfill their policy requirements as stated at the time of the purchase of insurance is disgruntled , has completely lost faith in the company and as well may be financially damaged or even destroyed for all intents and purposes.

From an economic perspective , the premiums that reputable firms earn induce them to perform reliably and well , to maintain their reputations ( Shapiro , 1983 ) . From a sociological perspective , more-reputable actors receive greater rewards than less-reputable actors for identical outcomes ( Podolny , 1993 ) . However , it is important to acknowledge that a young firm 's reputation will not be the only factor influencing the behavior of exchange partners. A young firm 's reputation reflects outsiders ' attitudes about it ( Fischer &amp;Reuber , 2003 ) . Attitudes are most usefully thought of as predispositions to respond favorably or unfavorably , more directly related to behavioral intentions than to actual behaviors ( Ajzen &amp;Fishbein , 1980 ) . Just as other factors besides attitude are expected to influence behavior , factors in addition to reputation are expected to influence exchange decisions involving a young firm . </reputation.n.27><reputation.n.28>It is the general concurrence of a great number of people reflecting the sentiment toward the party whose character is subject to inquiry that is necessary to establish a reputation and to warrant its use as evidence.

Mr Davies submits that not only is this a very grave allegation but it is of quite a different category from the charges against the applicant 's historiography which have been the main issue in the case. Whatever the conclusion upon the applicant 's historiography , Mr Davies submits , the applicant 's reputation is materially injured by the allegation that he agreed to speak at a conference attended by terrorist organisations . </reputation.n.49><reputation.n.50>Of all Roman emperors , none with the possible exception of Nero , surpasses Caligula 's reputation for infamy. But was Caligula really the mad despot and depraved monster of popular legend or the victim of hostile ancient historians ? In this study of Caligula 's life , reign and violent death , Anthony A. Barrett draws on the archaeological and numismatic evidence to supplement the later written record. In Professor Barrett 's view , the mystery of Caligula 's reign is not why he descended into autocracy , but how any intelligent Roman could have expected a different outcome - to grant total power to an inexperienced and arrogant young man was a recipe for disaster. This book , scholarly and accessible , offers a careful reconstruction of Caligula 's life and times , and a shrewd assessment of his historical importance . </reputation.n.50><reputation.n.51>When it comes to any kind of reputation management study , I ' m normally deadly serious.

The law recognises that the defamed person is to be compensated for the harm to their reputation , but the figures often appear out of proportion to the harm. This results in an appeal to a higher court to attempt to overrule the decision , or at least reduce the damages award.

This rule allows inquiry into specific acts of conduct of the primary witness in order to probe the knowledge of a character witness on cross-examination. The conduct inquired into must be reasonably calculated to reflect on the primary witness ' truth-telling capacity. A sound exercise of judicial discretion is required here to insure that cross-examination focuses on credibility , not on the general character of the witness. Determining whether a character witness ' opinion or reputation testimony is based on knowledge of the primary witness ' prior conduct may be very influential in assessing the credibility of the testimony. The leading case on the general issue of testing reputation or character witnesses for knowledge of specific acts is Michelson v.

That writer as well as Casanova 's reputation has summoned Bishop Pucci ( JEREMY IRONS ) from the Vatican who 's determined to squash both heretics.

Such evidence escapes the general proscription against character evidence because it is not offered to prove conformity , but because of the significance of the trait in relation to the crime.

Given the diversity of young firms and the heterogeneity in their growth patterns ( Delmar , Davidsson , &amp;Gartner , 2003 ) , such focused attention could limit the extent to which these findings are generalizable to other industries and exchange partners. Since affiliations are signals which reduce uncertainty , we can better understand the limits to the generalizability of previous research by examining young firms across competitive contexts of varying uncertainty. Many industries do not involve venture capitalists or alliance partners , so to compare across competitive contexts , it is useful to examine the exchange partners that most , if not all , young firms have : customers . </reputation.n.84><reputation.n.85>2 ) Selective personnel.

Mailing to addresses that do not exist can be attributed to a variety of causes from inadequate data capture or bounce management practices to forgery or use of illicit list sources. Receivers and RSPs should seek to distinguish between list management and serious permission problems. For example , the term " spamtrap " should differentiate between addresses that never existed ( " honeypots " ) and email addresses that once existed but have since closed ( " stale " addresses ) .

It is a subject of study in social , management and technological sciences. Its influence ranges from competitive settings , like markets , to cooperative ones , like firms , organisations , institutions and communities. Furthermore , reputation acts on different levels of agency , individual and supra-individual. At the supra-individual level , it concerns groups , communities , collectives and abstract social entities ( such as firms , corporations , organizations , countries , cultures and even civilizations ) . It affects phenomena of different scale , from everyday life to relationships between nations.

Compared to a shared voice , the referents set is now lost in its precise identification and substituted by a less precise group attribution. In comparison to shared evaluation and more generally to image reputation does not take a stand on what is true but just on what is told . </reputation.n.97><reputation.n.98>For higher-end factions , a general strategy exists to make a reputation grind as painless as possible. Take the Argent Dawn for example. There are several ways in which to earn reputation for them : doing standard quests , killing mobs in and around Scholomance and Stratholme , killing bosses , and doing repeatable quests. The problem is that each of these methods will only work to a certain extent. Killing standard mobs will usually only get you to Revered or so. After that , only quests and bosses will give reputation and these are of course harder to do. Therefore , it is in a player 's best interest to go as far as possible on mob kills alone and then use repeatable quests and standard quests to get through revered. Example : for Argent Dawn reputation , run Scholomance and Stratholme to get reputation from kills until you reach Revered status. At this point , reputation gained from killing mobs will stop , but you should have built up quite a collection of Scourgestones and such to turn in in rapid succession to further boost your reputation. Similar tactics can be applied to other factions , simply varying the instances you run . </reputation.n.98><reputation.n.99>The standard DC of a reputation check is 25.

Judging from the following roundtable discussion co-sponsored with Hill and Knowlton , apparently they do care-a lot.

Comfort , safety , love and fun are far away and far from our minds.

On one hand , agents are autonomous if they select partners based on their social evaluations ( images ) . On the other , they need to update evaluations by taking into account others'. Hence , social evaluations must circulate and be represented as " reported evaluations " ( reputation ) , before and in order for agents to decide whether to accept them or not. To represent this level of cognitive detail in artificial agents ' design , there is a need for a specialised subsystem , which we are in the course of developing for the public domain.

It seems to me the bar is set lower for Romance. Romances are a huge percentage of all novels sold , so maybe that 's why there are more Romances that are not well-written.

Results of this study show the direct , main effect a reputational factor can have on a behavioral intention measure , bearing out platitudes about bottom-line importance of reputation management. This direct effect of reputation on purchase intention supports a study by Lyon and Cameron49 that found subjects were generally more likely to invest in and hold more favorable attitudes about companies with a good reputation over companies with a bad reputation. The results of this study , however , help better define the circumstances and conditions under which subjects will use reputation information in a consumer , decision-making scenario.

He shows how therapy and authenticity vitiate honor , because the honorable soul is more responsible than the therapeutic self , and honor 's content more public than authenticity 's self-proclaimed uniqueness. But what about pride requires the self-motivation of responsibility rather than the passivity of therapy , and the acclaim of reputation rather than the daydream of sincerity ? Bowman does not elaborate a view of the soul that clarifies the better and worse expressions of our common human powers.

Specifically , research suggests that in online communities the relationship between reputation and status operates mostly in one direction , with reputation used as input for higher online status. For example , Rheingold ( 1993 ) and Kollock ( 1999 ) , who have studied motivations of online information gift giving , point towards reputation as an important resource for attaining greater prestige. Kollock ( 1999 ) puts it this way : " A possible motivation [ for online gift giving ] is the effect of contributions on one 's reputation.

She recognized that it could be manufactured and stated that there was an " oscillation between the company image being considered an objective reality or entire fabrication " ( Kennedy , 1977 , p. 124 ) . She established the importance of " the company personnel perception of the company " in a global approach that she called " the total corporate image " and which she clearly differentiated from visual identity , although she and other researchers considered it as part of the whole.

This reminds me of some suggestions that I once heard about branding. The main point was that the process of building of a brand , that large organisations might carry out , is far too much for most sole traders and small organisations to manage successfully. The advice was simply to make a list of the values and standards which you believe are important , write them up somewhere visible , read them everyday and try to stick to them; that is likely to do as much to consolidate and grow the character and , therefore , the reputation of a small business as any amount of high powered thinking and writing of mission statements . </reputation.n.404><reputation.n.405>In the past , Fombrun and his colleagues have looked at the stock performance of the companies in the year following the rating.

For example , in the case where the reputation information storage part 202 precedently stores reputation information including a subject and an evaluative expression alone , the individual polarity degree calculating means 1012 can not calculate an individual polarity degree of an attribute expression even if the input reputation information to be evaluated includes an attribute expression.

A sixth expedient is by transferring , or at least endeavouring to transfer , upon one offence , the measure of disrepute that naturally attends upon another. The way in which this is done , is by affecting to regard the obnoxious practice in question as an evidence of another practice , on which men are already in the habit of bestowing a superior degree of disrepute. It is plain that the cases in which this can be attempted with any prospect of success must necessarily be limited. To warrant the inference , some appearance in connexion , however superficial , there must be between the two offences. But any little connexion , however slight , is ordinarily sufficient. In such a case , men in general are not apt to be very difficult with regard to the evidence. The vanity of being thought sagacious , the pride of sitting in judgment and condemning , the hope of earning a certain measure of reputation on the score of virtue at an easy rate , the love of novelty and paradox , and the propensity to exaggeration , especially on the unfavourable side , second the aim of the legislator . </reputation.n.419><reputation.n.420>1530s ( in Anglo-L. from mid-13c. ) , via Fr. and It. , from Arabic hashishiyyin " hashish-users , " pl. of hashishiyy , from hashish ( q.v. ) .

Your readership will not have enough respect for your publication to bother with any kind of syndication because your content will have no actual substance to give it value amongst consumers.

Of the three methods of proving character provided by the rule , evidence of specific instances of conduct is the most convincing. At the same time it poses the greatest capacity to arouse prejudice , to confuse , to surprise , and to consume time. Consequently the Rule confines the use of evidence of this kind to cases in which character is , in the strict sense , in issue and hence deserving of a searching inquiry. When character is used circumstantially and hence occupies a lesser status in the case , proof may be only by reputation and opinion. These latter methods are also available when character is in issue. This treatment is , with respect to specific instances of conduct and reputation , conventional contemporary common law doctrine.

Indeed , Podolny considers the central claim of his book that " the greater market participants ' uncertainty about the underlying quality of a producer and the producer 's product , the more that market participants with rely on the producer 's status to make inferences about that quality. " ( p.18 ) The word " reputation " could replace the word " status , " of course , with absolutely no loss of meaning. At some points , however , Podolny offers and tests hypotheses in which the difference between status ( widely perceived position in the hierarchy of suppliers ) and reputation ( what the experts know about true quality ) is key. For instance , Podolny notes that if one controls for the quality of a good or service , higher status leads to greater sales and higher profits.

Section II eschews the conception of reputation as honour in favour of a more richly rewarding inquiry into honour as a concept. Drawing on historical and anthropological work. It argues that honour can best be understood in terms of the ' moral taxonomies ' that underpin judgments of social and self-worth in a community. The connections between social and self-worth , and between honour , reputation , and dignity , suggest that the idea of a moral taxonomy will also be a useful way to think about honour and dignity , and about reputation and its relationships to defamation law . </reputation.n.523><reputation.n.524>Brutus is the most complex of the characters in this play.

One of the significant themes that Shakespeare uses to enrich the complexity of Brutus involves his attempt to ritualize the assassination of Caesar. He can not justify , to his own satisfaction , the murder of a man who is a friend and who has not excessively misused the powers of his office. Consequently , thinking of the assassination in terms of a quasi-religious ritual instead of cold-blooded murder makes it more acceptable to him. Unfortunately for him , he consistently misjudges the people and the citizens of Rome; he believes that they will be willing to consider the assassination in abstract terms . </reputation.n.524><reputation.n.525>One news correspondent wrote that the appeals court ruling amounted to declaring that , " all Indians were worthy of respect and entitled to a good reputation , regardless of their wealth or social status.

The highest shame was discommendation , an action by the High Council to officially strip a Klingon of his personal or family honor.

However , Gower ' s early readers understood this reputation for morality in rather different ways to many modern critics who have long regarded him as too sober to have had an impact on the development of late medieval British writing. Indeed in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Scotland , successive generations of writers responded to Gower ' s reputation as a moral poet , and the interpretive and ethical complexities of his English poem , the Confessio Amantis ( c. 1390-2 ) , in a range of creative and subtle ways. This is clearly demonstrated in the anonymous Spectacle of Luf ( c. 1492 ) , Gavin Douglas ' s The Palice of Honour ( c. 1501 ) , and John Rolland ' s The Court of Venus ( c. 1560 ) . These texts engage with aspects of the Confessio ' s frame narrative in order to consider the function of literature and its relationship with virtue , and together comprise a distinctive and highly intertextual Scottish tradition of rereading Gower . </reputation.n.626><reputation.n.627>Both as a woman and an artist , Artemesia Gentileschi cuts an intriguing figure.

Born in Rome in 1593 ( she died in Naples in 1652 ) , she was the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi , one of the most gifted of the Italian followers of Caravaggio. She began studying art at a very young age. At the age of nineteen , she was raped by one of her father 's colleagues , who had been hired as an art teacher. Although he consoled her with empty promises of marriage , he was arrested and subjected to a lengthy trial , during which , apparently , the veracity of young Gentileschi 's testimony was tested with a thumbscrew.

To me that suggests that when thought about as ends of a continuum , reputation is an extremely important grounding factor that leads towards the amplification of both positive and negative outcomes arising from either well thought out or defective processes. Therefore , while it is the business process expert 's natural inclination to consider the articulation of process as a way of delivering value or minimizing negative impacts , I suggest this should have as its precursor a business examination of the reputational issues that both drive an organization but which also serve as potential contributors to failure. So for instance , in the assessment of establishing ( say ) a new invoicing process , I would always encourage business process experts to not only consider the way in which GRC issues are impacted by those processes , but I would also suggest that the flip side be considered in what if ? scenarios. That 's because while business processes are the articulation of what management sees as desirable outcomes , they only answer a part of the rationale behind doing things 'right .

Good reputation can also lead to higher credit ratings , faster and more favorable government approvals and stronger community support.

When The House of Fame dramatises Geoffrey 's rereading of part of the Aeneid , Chaucer demonstrates his interpretative freedom by revising Virgil precociously , emphasising Dido 's pathos and diminishing Aeneas ' heroism : " he betrayed hir , allas , / And lefte hir ful unkyndely " ( I.ll.294-5 ) . Mann argues that such bold revisionism implies enduring faith in the historical substance behind the written record : in reshaping the narrative to " retrieve " an alternative historical point of view , Chaucer affirms " that such a retrieval is a permanent possibility the writ of literary authority runs no further than the point at which it meets the reader 's own corrective or confirmatory experience " 14. Cooper notes that this stance cuts both ways : " Chaucer 's own invention is just as likely , or unlikely , to be true as Virgil 's or Ovid 's " 15. Separating the story from its famous teller , Chaucer demonstrates that the transmission of stories actually estranges poets from the famous people they commemorate; the means by which a poet might make his own reputation are placed in doubt . </reputation.n.766><reputation.n.767>The same reasons would lead me to apply the presumption to a statutory function the exercise of which is apt to affect the reputation of an individual.

Herein , an evaluation polarity degree is a numerical value indicating whether it is positive reputation information or negative reputation information. An evaluation polarity degree is , for example , a real number ranging from 1 to 1. In this case , as an evaluation polarity degree is closer to 1 , the reputation information is more positive , and as an evaluation polarity degree is closer to 1 , the reputation information is more negative. Hereinafter , an evaluation polarity degree is sometimes designated simply as a polarity degree. It is noted that these numerical values are merely exemplarily mentioned , and other numerical values ranging from , for example , 100 to 0 may be used or discrete numerical values may be used instead of continuous numerical values . </reputation.n.770><reputation.n.771>Using the " Reputation Value Cycle " to your advantage.

A libel plaintiff may also be interested in money damages , which in theory could include not only damages to compensate for injury to reputation or the personal anguish that such loss entails , but also punitive damages to punish the report ' s authors and publishers . </reputation.n.772><reputation.n.773>2 ) BUILD A SCHOOL continues to form partnerships with external organisations that help us achieve our objectives.

What is that standing ? Here there is little room for disagreement : philosophers widely regard aesthetics as a marginal field. Aesthetics is marginal not only in the relatively benign sense that it lies at the edge , or border , of the discipline , but also in the additional , more troubling , sense that it is deemed philosophically unimportant. In this respect , aesthetics contrasts with areas like the philosophy of mathematics , a field which , while marginal in the first sense , is widely regarded as philosophically important. A few years ago Arthur Danto quipped , and he was n't that far off the mark , that the position of aesthetics is about as low on the scale of philosophical undertakings as bugs are in the chain of being . </reputation.n.782><reputation.n.783>In both City of Heroes and City of Villains , your character 's Notoriety ( also known as your Difficulty setting , sometimes referred to as your Reputation ) determines the toughness of the missions you are assigned.

Psalm 15 states " Lord , who may dwell in your sanctuary ? Who may live on your holy hill ? He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous , who speaks the truth from his heart and has no slander on his tongue , who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellowman , who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the Lord , who keeps his oath even when it hurts , who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bride against the innocent.

In the corporate setting , this definition could be extended to say that reputation is ' what owners , staff , stakeholders , media and associated clients and suppliers say and think about a business or organisation ' . SMEs usually spend a lot of time creating a good reputation through their people , client service protocols , mission statements , the media , Web 2.0 , recruitment drives , directory listings , social responsibility projects , investment in people and the other management activities that define them as a business and as a brand. Accordingly , any one of these elements of a business can make or break its reputation.

Thus , they perceived reputational signals to be audience-specific.

The play begins when Othello , a general in the Venetian army has angered Iago ( a member of the army ) by appointing Cassio ( another army officer ) to the lieutenant position. Iago feels that he is more deserving of the promotion than Cassio and decides that he will stop at nothing to get back at both Othello and Cassio. Iago decides that he will get revenge on Othello by using his wife , Desdemona. O beware my lord , of jealousy ! It is a greeneyed monster , which doth mock the meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss who , certain of his fate loves not his wronger; ... yet fondly loves ( 3.3.165 ) . Foolishly Othello believes Iago and accuses Desdemona of being unchaste.

To understand the relationship , we must distinguish between status as a formal property of social , economic , and professional systems and reputation as an informal process that is based on interpretation and attribution. Status seeking as a formal process usually takes place in relationship to a social , economic , or professional system where ranking of individuals is based on criteria that are intrinsic to these systems : For example , election to town council elevates some citizens to a higher status; appearing on the Forbes richest list divides the super rich from those who are just rich; and winning awards for professional achievement is a distinction that divides exceptional talent from solid performers.

One such insight this morning was the famous Dale Carnegie quote; be more concerned with your character than your reputation , because your character is what you really are , while your reputation is merely what others think you are. </reputation.n.1194><reputation.n.1195>Doug Stanard ( AMF Bowling ) : It 's hard to argue with the concept of reputation-it 's a little bit of motherhood and apple pie. But it seems to me we 're all talking about managing the horse , sitting there with our hands on it , and making sure it goes this way or that , faster or slower , and keeping it groomed , etc. But the reputation is something you earn; it flows from all these things. It 's a by-product , the cart behind the horse. How can you manage a reputation other than just running your business ? </reputation.n.1195><reputation.n.1196>On the basis of the aforementioned hypotheses 1 and 2 , an evaluation polarity estimation system according to the present invention includes a reputation information storage part , an evaluative expression storage part and a polarity estimating means. The polarity estimating means receives reputation information as an input and calculates a polarity degree of reputation information with an unknown polarity by referring to polarity degrees of reputation information stored in the reputation information storage part and evaluative expressions and their polarity degrees stored in the evaluative expression storage part . </reputation.n.1196><reputation.n.1197>Companies are rated by consumers in their home country. The Global Pulse is a measure of corporate reputation calculated by averaging perceptions of trust , esteem , admiration , and good feeling obtained from a representative sample of 100 local respondents who were familiar with the company. Reputation Institute overcomes cross-cultural biases by adjusting all Pulse scores against the aggregate distribution. Standardization has the effect of lowering scores in countries that tend to over-rate companies , and has the effect of raising scores for companies in countries that tend to rate companies more harshly. All results are therefore comparable across industries , countries , and over time . </reputation.n.1197><reputation.n.1198>Sometimes i wonder if people agree with me because they believe or trust me or they fear the long discussion i put up if they do n't , or even worse , they might fear that i execute power by vetoing their decisions. So i 'd decided to write about the conflict of power and reputation. They are often found together and seem to be two sides of the same coin. Somebody with a high reputation is very often somebody with influence and power . </reputation.n.1198><reputation.n.1199>Important questions to consider : " Is winning everything ? " We learn that " there is no substitute for victory " in the context of warfare , but does this apply to athletics as well ?

A consultant who had grown tired of having his clients ask him how long he had been making pottery , finally discovered on Google that a namesake was an expert potter.

In each caller ' s tone was a touch of dread. Some wondered what Abdul Mutallab ' s crazed design meant for the future of Nigeria , a country already prostrate. Others were more concerned about how the aborted drama of a bloody bombing would reshape their lives.   One friend , a professor at a top American university , told me about the traveling trials of a colleague of his , a professor of Sudanese nationality. On numerous occasions , the Sudanese scholar has been taken off flights , or prevented from boarding one all on account of the man ' s Islamic name and the Sudan ' s reputation as a grooming ground for al Qaeda terrorists. Another friend , a young executive at a major American financial services company , related the experience of a colleague of his , an Egyptian-American. He said that when he and his colleague traveled together , the Egyptian-American was frequently subjected to exacting , even intrusive , searches and exhaustive questioning . </reputation.n.1204><reputation.n.1205>Players decide how their characters act. Sometimes , however , it 's appropriate for a DM to call for a skill check using an interaction skill affected by reputation. For example , and NPC might use Bluff to lie to player characters who , in turn , use Sense Motive to detect the lie. If an NPC tries to intimidate a player character , the DM can use the NPC 's Intimidate check to determine which characters see the NPC as intimidating and which don't. Similarly , a Diplomacy check tells the DM which characters find the NPC persuasive and which do not. At other times , players may want to know if their characters recognize a particular NPC or monster. A reputation check can help DMs in these situations . </reputation.n.1205><reputation.n.1206>A reputation for telling the truth , even when it hurts yourself , is a sign of integrity usually rewarded with trust. Let 's look at the structure of Trust for just a second. What is it with regards to this situation ? Trust is the extension of credit that what one says or does is the truth. It is the extension of credit without immediate proof. Without a reputation for telling the truth , you forfeit trust and will no longer garner the credit in your word , leaving you to prove everything you say before you will be taken to your word . </reputation.n.1206><reputation.n.1207>During record-breaking droughts throughout Australia , Alliance Water Solutions was presented with an incredible demand for water preservation in rural and urban areas. With the sudden torrent of work , Alliance sought out Koodoz Design to help create a logo that would give their business name and its reputation increased notoriety. Originally an acronym : A.W.S. The brief was to create a typographic logo for an irrigation company. The Alliance font is a customised typeface coloured in green symbolising the lush earth.

Wilkinson , the white owner of the Negro League Kansas City Monarchs , signed the sore-armed pitcher for his second-team barnstorming club the Baby Monarchs. Paige pitched sparingly and served primarily as a gate attraction for the club , but midway through the 1939 season his arm miraculously recovered its former power. Tye suggests that Paige was recovering from a partially torn rotator cuff in his shoulder cased by the repetitive stress of throwing almost every day. The rejuvenated Paige was pitching in Puerto Rico where he became infatuated with the young Luz " Lucy " Maria Figueroa. Paige married Lucy and returned with her to Kansas City , despite the fact that he was already married to Janet Howard Paige. Janet filed divorce proceedings against the athlete , whose attorneys were able to avoid bigamist charges being filed against their client. Meanwhile , Lucy departed for Puerto Rico , and Paige became involved with Lahoma Brown , sixteen years his junior. Paige eventually married Brown , with whom he fathered six children and enjoyed some domestic stability. The pitcher , nevertheless , continued to earn a reputation for promiscuity , which Tye is reluctant to criticize . </reputation.n.1210><reputation.n.1211>When it comes to building your business or your career in a company , how people perceive you is often to the difference between more sales , promotions , and certainly your satisfaction.

These reputations are inevitably constructed on the basis of generalisations , expressed most vividly in the national stereotypes such as the German reputation for efficiency or the English for pragmatism. In Revelation 3 , John told the church at Sardis : ' you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead.

In short , complex purchases involve greater commitment , greater ambiguity and a longer-term perspective than less complex purchases. Consistent with the prior literature , CEOs operating in such contexts believed that having high-status customers would reassure prospective customers that their firm was of high quality and worthy of a long-term commitment. In contrast , CEOs operating in contexts with lower purchase complexity wanted to signal to customers that they could satisfy current , known requirements at a competitive price. Thus , they were more concerned with having large numbers of satisfied , representative customers that signaled reputation in specific domains of activity and to particular audiences. This leads to the following propositions : </reputation.n.1214><reputation.n.1215>Supporting Desdemona 's request that she be allowed to accompany him to Cyprus , Othello assures the Duke that love would never interfere with his business.

Using Ebay to test his ideas , Zeckhauser concluded that buyers are willing to spend 7.6 more for items offered by a seller with a solidly positive eBay reputation , according to the results of a controlled experiment involving sales of vintage post cards. But it was not just traders on eBay who found it necessary to protect their names. Online pundits had to protect their names too.

When purchase complexity was high , the status of the identified customer was important , but , here , with low purchase complexity , the identity of the customer was often unknown and sometimes deliberately withheld. Firms that sold private label products were reluctant to name customers. If they could n't put their own label on a product or a component , CEOs felt that they could n't publicize the fact that they manufactured it. CEOs also felt prohibited from telling a prospective customer that they sold to a competitor : " We sell to all the guys that sell these [ Product As ] . At a trade show last week , all of these guys are in the same building and they 're all next to each other almost.

Was Caligula really the mad despot and depraved monster of popular legend or the victim of hostile ancient historians ? This scholarly and accessible book offers a careful reconstruction of Caligula 's life and times.Of all Roman emperors none , with the possible exception of Nero , surpasses Caligula 's reputation for infamy. But was Caligula really the mad despot and depraved monster of popular legend or the victim of hostile ancient historians ? In this study of Caligula 's life , reign and violent death , Anthony A. Barrett draws on the archaeological and numismatic evidence to supplement the later written record. In Professor Barrett 's view , the mystery of Caligula 's reign is not why he descended into autocracy , but how any intelligent Roman could have expected a different outcome - to grant total power to an inexperienced and arrogant young man was a recipe for disaster. This book , scholarly and accessible , offers a careful reconstruction of Caligula 's life and times , and a shrewd assessment of his historical importance. ( Paperback ) .

Additionally , the fighter 's reputation for honour on the field can not be doubted; a fighter known to be unable to maintain an even temper , unable to accept both defeat and victory gracefully , to take an unfair advantage of their opponent , or to consistently fail to count good blows will not be considered a candidate for the Chivalry . </reputation.n.1231><reputation.n.1232>And , well , it shows a lack of honesty and respect to the " practice " of lifecasting.

In addition , many public relations firms describe their expertise in terms of reputation management. The public relations industry is growing due to the demand for companies to build corporate credibility and hence reputation.

Once the door is broken , though , the secrets held within will reveal themselves , also revealing scandal. The breaking down of the door seems to represent the ruining of a reputation in Utterson ' s mind.

Carefully dissecting the particular benefits and risks associated with each type of " paper war , " Freeman illuminates the intersection of private and public. " Public-minded private letters " facilitated partisan gossip by covering the political intentions of an author with the blanket of supposedly impromptu correspondence between intimates. Pamphlets were more serious forays in that they gave elites the chance to present an extended , legal justification of their actions before a rather exclusive audience of their peers. Broadsides and handbills were emotionally strident appeals to a mass public.

To be more precise , we call reputation transmission a communication of an evaluation without the specification of the evaluator , if not for a group attribution , and only in the default sense discussed before. This covers the case of example 3 above. More precisely , reputation is a believed , social , meta-evaluation; it is built upon three distinct but interrelated objects : ( 1 ) a cognitive representation , or more precisely a believed evaluation - this could be somebody 's image , but is enough that this consist of a communicated evaluation; 2 ) a population object , i.e. , a propagating believed evaluation; and ( 3 ) an objective emergent property at the agent level , i.e. , what the agent is believed to be. In fact , reputation is a highly dynamic phenomenon in two distinct senses : it is subject to change , especially as an effect of corruption , errors , deception , etc.; and it emerges as an effect of a multi-level bidirectional process . </reputation.n.1277><reputation.n.1278>[ 0019 ] Message scores are calculated from updated message and content attribute reputations using a hierarchal method that determines which reputations are included in the calculation. The hierarchal order for determining the message score is sender reputation , IP reputation , network reputation and content attribute reputations. The message and content attribute reputations are tested in the above mentioned order until a first attribute reputation is found with a sufficiently high confidence level meaning it is statistically significant. Confidence levels can be based on the number of samples used to determine the reputation or the numerical value of the reputation. For example , a confidence level might be " for at least 10 samples " or " has a reputation greater than 5/1. " The first attribute reputation with such a high confidence level determines which attribute reputations are used to calculate the message score. The important concept is that the message and content attribute reputations which are used to determine the message score are all derived from ham and spam statistics of the recipients of the email message . </reputation.n.1278><reputation.n.1279>Elements that play role in school management can be split into two as internal and external. Internal elements can be grouped as administrators , students , officers and other staff while external elements are defined as parents , lobby groups and leaders , management structure , business market and central organization ( Bursalioglu 2000 , 39 ) . In this context , we can analyze the reputation of educational organizations in two sections : identity and image. Identity explains how the educational organization is perceived by internal shareholders. In other words , it consists of thoughts of teachers , managers , students and other employees about the school. Image concerns the perception of external shareholders and consists of thoughts of parents , experts , society etc. about the educational organization. Reputation is a collective concept formed by the subjective views of internal and external shareholders about the organization. Identity and image are the most important elements of corporate reputation. A reliable and consistent harmony between these elements will strengthen the corporate reputation. The relationship between the internal and external shareholders of the school and corporate reputation is shown in Figure 1 . </reputation.n.1279><reputation.n.1280>On the other hand , a corporate performance review would not benefit from broader publication.

Or maybe he will have it under his arm , I do n't know ! ) But we do n't take physical things that we make and earn into the kingdom with us. When you die what goes into the kingdom is the character that you have developed. The circumstances amidst which you live determine your reputation. Your reputation is what other people think about you; your character is what you are. Your character is what God thinks about you. Your character is what the angels report back to God and tell Him that you 're up to , whether you 're doing. The truth you believe determines your character. Holy , righteous character , is something that is developed only through experience - does n't happen quickly. It comes through experience. Experience requires time and circumstances , and so you find that God creates time and He gives us a life to live.

Not spared by its reputation for infamy was the Oakland Motor Car Company , which was purchased by General Motors in 1909 and was promptly formed into a rung on GM 's " ladder of consumption " between Chevrolet and Oldsmobile. As the prices of Oaklands grew , the division introduced a new , downmarket marque to bridge the gap between it and Chevy. In homage to where the Oakland Motor Car Company was founded , the new brand was named after the city of Pontiac , Michigan. The first Pontiac , a six-cylinder sedan for the price of a four , was introduced in 1926 , and by 1931 the child division had so successfully upstaged its parent that General Motors axed Oakland outright . </reputation.n.1348><reputation.n.1349>Recovery If your business has gotten a bad reputation for any reason , then the recovery portion of reputation management is for you.

There is plenty to be gained from lying. Why would you tell the truth when doing so hurts ? Well , telling the truth , even when it hurts especially when it hurts creates a reputation for telling the truth. People who have a good reputation are favored by those who know about it , leading to more opportunities for friendship , better and deeper romantic relationships , more fulfilling business relationships , and other transactional benefits.

This large decrease in effect suggests that changing cultural norms may play a key role in determining what counts as an opportunistic act.

It is true that agents do sometimes prefer to stick to their own evaluations , even when disconfirmed by others or by events. However this is always a matter of decision.

In a culture of law there is a body of laws which must be obeyed by all , with punishments for transgressors. This requires a society with the structures required to enact and enforce laws. A culture of law incorporates an unwritten social contract : members of society agree to give up some aspects of their freedom to defend themselves and retaliate for injuries , on the understanding that transgressors will be apprehended and punished by society. From the viewpoint of anthropology , cultures of honour typically appear among nomadic peoples and herdsmen who carry their most valuable property with them and risk having it stolen , without having recourse to law enforcement or government. In this situation , inspiring fear forms a better strategy than promoting friendship; and cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate revenge increases the safety of one 's person and property . </reputation.n.1406><reputation.n.1407>If you think you are getting bad reputation for good posts , talk to the person via PM.

By /afking out , opposing players gain zero honor and rep as they simply concede the battle to these uber guilds and these uber guilds still get honor and rep for free. The battlegrounds are structured in such a way that even if everyone on the other side goes /afk , honor and rep are still awarded.

Another aspect of trust is that it takes a long , long time to build it up in most cases ( although my college roomate was amazing at building trust with people quickly , largely by being open and transparent himself ) but takes only one real screw-up ( not an honest mistake , but the unveiling of lies or deception ) to ruin.

The first is to show it where he thinks that his example is going to be followed , or at least likely to be followed. Many a man is imitated by his family and not by his neighbours , or perhaps by his neighbours and not by those who frequent the marketplace. Showing deeds for others to follow is valid only if done by a person who is in a position to prompt others to imitate his deeds. The second duty is for this person to keep his heart in check , for it may well harbour a love of hidden ostentation. Such a love would induce him to show his action under the pretext of awakening other people ' s desire to follow suit , while his real desire is to brighten his own reputation through displaying his deeds and through being imitated by others. This is the state of all those who disclose their deeds , except for the sincere and strong; and they are very few.

I have experienced this first hand over the last several weeks as I transitioned from one job to another. My goal was to leave my previous job with a good reputation.

Although Christians are not to be obsessed by reputation , they ought to do what they can to deserve a good one , for the sake of the gospel. Jesus commands his followers to seek to have a good reputation for functional reasons , rather than as an end in itself. At times , the desire for ' good PR ' will conflict with other obligations weighing on the Christian , such as the obligation to take a stand for God 's holiness ( cf. John 12 : 42 43 ) or the obligation to reach out to the untouchables in our society. It is at this point that the injunction to seek the praise of God not of man is applicable.

Filled with real-life examples and presented in down-to-earth fashion , this is a business book that 's a pleasure to read. It 's rare that prescriptive lessons imparted to businesspeople can be presented to a wider public without sounding academic or didactic. Mr. Firestein has managed to bring a conversational tone to his consultant 's voice without sacrificing an iota of professionalism.

Such is the extent of this love that were a bondsman to have two valleys of gold he would nevertheless wish for a third.

But many fine reputations of all sorts are the result of clever self-advertising , and this practice is one of the most destructive and degrading to character and true manliness. This is so because , when we seek reputation for its own sake , we are yielding to the temptation of vanity; and vanity is a weakness and disease of the soul. Everybody has temptations to overcome , and it is everybody 's business to know and work against his weaknesses; but , when our chief ambition in life fosters our weakness , and we deceive ourselves by giving the name of " honor " to that which weakens us , we can hardly expect to grow stronger as the years go by . </reputation.n.1871><reputation.n.1872>A scandal is a widely publicized allegation or set of allegations that damages the reputation of an institution , individual or creed.

Two effects follow : those who suffer a bad reputation stay out , at least until they decide to change identity; those who stay in can but enjoy a good reputation : after a good start , they will hardly get negative feedbacks , and even if they do , these will not get to the point of spoiling their good name.

The overall impact of such actions on God 's reputation is difficult to quantify. It would have damaged it with those whose idea of godship was tied to territorial concepts or who thought that God had irrevocably committed himself to protecting certain sacred places. [ 31 ] But for those with a concern for justice and holiness , God 's actions were a vindication of his character , and therefore were , however painful , an enhancement of his reputation.

First , the aim of the study is to refine and extend existing models and insights; testing is a task for future research. We have analyzed the CEOs ' logics of action , but have not tested the extent to which their perceptions are consistent with how prospective customers actually interpret their reputational signals. When perceptions of outsiders differ from the perceptions of insiders , these inaccurate insider perceptions could lead to ineffective signalling decisions. Thus , empirical testing of the propositions should include perceptions of both insiders and outsiders. Second , as with any qualitative investigation , subjective biases and interpretations can not be entirely eliminated. Despite the steps taken to limit these biases , they still affect research methods , and only testing of the theoretical insights developed can address them thoroughly. Finally , all of the firms in our sample sold primarily to other organizations , rather than to consumers. CEOs of young firms selling to consumers might have different perceptions of how current customers signal reputation , and so caution is warranted in generalizing these results . </reputation.n.2037><reputation.n.2038>The third commandment bears directly on this subject.

As known , subjects of management are leaving the boundaries of the business field and being applied to other science fields by being inspired from here. Applicability of a general theory from business field on education organizations has been discussed in this study. In this context , since there are no studies that concern subject of management in direct relation to education , a new reputation management model unique to education organizations has been developed in the framework of studies concerning reputation management. This suggested model is not a rigid mold and should be perceived as a strategy that can be developed with the support of other researches about reputation management in education. Reputation management in educational organizations is a new and original step in the field of educational administration. It is hoped that this study will enlighten subsequent studies and contribute to this field . </reputation.n.2039><reputation.n.2040>Economic Imperialism or Colonialism-whereby the poor third word is enslaved and plundered by a few countries. At the Havana summit of developing countries , the Cuban leader charged the huge plunder by rich countries and financial institutions as an economic crime. The Daily Mirror exposed a the tip of the ice burg of economic colonialism in a case where Japan reportedly punished Sri Lanka for refusing row along with the Japanese proposal to ease the International ban in Whaling. The Sri Lanka government is reported to be concerned about Norway 's reaction to the defeat of the Whale proposal. Japan has a reputation or notoriety as a whale trader. Besides the religious and cultural ties from ancient times , Japan and Sri Lanka have built up a relationship over the past 50 years. In most instances rich countries provide project aid for Sri Lanka , they get far more than they give. All market economies or structural adjustment policies have spawned a monstrous system where by 20 percent comprising rich countries are controlling or manipulating as much as 85 percent of the worlds resources . </reputation.n.2040><reputation.n.2041>The problem is when you get labeled with a bad rep early on.

By publishing not only through many different websites , blogs , and online magazines , but also compiling a large body of content that testifies to their work ethic , an online copywriter will find themselves taken very seriously by readers and , most importantly , clientele and other industry peers. Writing with a degree of frequency can greatly impact how professionally an online copywriter comes across to their clientele , and can easily be the sole foundation of a professional reputation because an online copywriter who can write a considerable volume of content can be an invaluable industry asset themselves.

God 's reputation is associated with that of his people. Therefore , the church should be careful not to appoint leaders with a bad reputation nor should its members conduct themselves in such a way as gives ' the enemy ' any opportunity for slander ( 1 Timothy 5 : 14; 6 : 1 ) . </reputation.n.2046><reputation.n.2047>Once we situate markets in networks of embedded social relations , it becomes feasible to apply the term status ' to firms. It is tempting to equate the status of a firm with its reputation. In an industry where the quality of a good or service can not be contractually specified , a firm might establish a standard of quality in order to expand its clientele or increase its price above the market minimum. Such a " reputation effect " is well-known in economic theory ( Herbert Gintis , " The Power to Switch : On the Political Economy of Consumer Sovereignty , " in Samuel Bowles , Richard Edwards , and William Shepherd ( eds. ) , " Unconventional Wisdom : Essays in Honor of John Kenneth Galbraith ( New York : Houghton-Mifflin : 1989 ) : 65 -- 80 ) . However , Podolny argues that the status of a firm is not equivalent to its reputation for quality , but rather is a more diffuse hierarchical notion in which a firm 's status reflects its social eminence and power. Podolny argues that firms desire high status because customers have a " conspicuous consumption " preference for high-status firms , and are willing to pay accordingly . </reputation.n.2047><reputation.n.2048>There 's another factor that weighs against Exxon Mobil. While stock investors are focused intently on the future , reputation rankers seem to be focused on the past. The 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster still casts a pall over Exxon Mobil 's public image. The three companies at the bottom of this year 's list MCI , Enron , and Adelphia do n't even really exist as independent entities anymore , but they are still hated. Being associated with criminal activity or a scandal is enough to keep a company 's reputation low , even if it primarily involved a company executive and not the company 's operations.

Chaucer subverts this idea; his Fame personifies communication breakdown , threatening the endurance of meaning as history and reputation. In Fame 's house , the immortal poets are surrounded by " mynstralles " and " gestiours that tellen tales " ( III.ll.1197-1200 ) , not to mention the " right gret companye " of the rest of the world , all of whom are appealing for " good renoun " themselves ( III.ll.1528-58 ) .

In a culture of law there is a body of laws which must be obeyed by all , with punishments for transgressors. This requires a society with the structures required to enact and enforce laws. A culture of law incorporates an unwritten social contract : members of society agree to give up most of their rights to defend themselves and retaliate for injuries , on the understanding that transgressors will be apprehended and punished by society. From the viewpoint of anthropology , cultures of honour typically appear among nomadic peoples and herdsmen who carry their most valuable property with them and risk having it stolen , without having recourse to law enforcement or government. In this situation , inspiring fear forms a better strategy than promoting friendship; and cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate revenge increases the safety of one 's person and property. Thinkers ranging from Montesquieu to Steven Pinker have remarked upon the mindset needed for a culture of honour . </reputation.n.2256><reputation.n.2257>I feel certain the reputation list will work similar to factions.

If Characters break social conventions frequently or too obviously there is a price to pay. For example , one of the biggest " sins " a proper citizen could do was " go native " or embrace a colonial culture too completely , wearing local clothing , practicing a local religion , or even worse , marrying a local woman was an egregious violation of all things good and proper can could get anyone banned from polite company. The above examples are all serious violation of Victorian culture with the first two being worth 2 points of infamy and the third a full 4 points. Simpler violations such as too many bizarre and most importantly unfounded stories are only worth 1 point of infamy. The mechanics of infamy are as followed : each point of infamy grants a 1 in 6 of being recognized being as " an odd duck.

In these times , a person who desires to have a good reputation certainly sees the need for godly character , which many in God 's church have sadly discarded or maybe never even had. When we think about various individuals or organizations that are now or once were within the church , what we perceive of their reputations often differs from the opinions we once held. This does not necessarily mean that our perceptions were incorrect , just that we may not have the ability to ascertain all of a person 's strengths and weaknesses , even of those closest to us.

Virginie 's bold pose , provocative dress , and icy pale skin caused an immediate furore. Panned by the critics and abhorred by the public , the painting crippled Sargent 's hopes of a career in Paris. He soon relocated to England , where he established himself as the favourite portrait painter of the wealthy. In this remarkable novel , Diliberto tells Virginie 's story , drawing on the sketchy facts of her life to recreate her personality and the milieu of nineteenth century Paris. Born in New Orleans and raised on her grandmother 's Creole plantation , Virginie fled to France with her mother and sister during the Civil War. After a troubled adolescence , she became a professional beauty and married a prominent French banker. Even before Sargent painted her portrait , Virginie 's reputation for promiscuity and showy self-display made her the subject of Paris gossip . </reputation.n.2320><reputation.n.2321>For the most part , the reputations from Classic WoW and from Burning Crusade are not re-used in the Wrath of the Lich King.

One of the ultimate ironies of the traditional Indian gender roles is that , although they strive to keep chastity on every cherubic mind , they accomplish quite the opposite. The segregation of the sexes is so complete in some parts of the community that every female-male friendship is assumed to be sexual , every interaction is viewed through the filter of gender. And , due to the fear for reputation , rarely do IA men and women become close friends. At IA get-togethers , guests clump along gender lines. IA 's frequently seem emotionally immature , unable to understand and accept platonic friendship between women and men. It 's a perversion of values that these friendships become difficult; it 's a perversion that the platonic part of our lives is defined by the sexual. If chastity were the objective , repression is clearly not the answer . </reputation.n.2323><reputation.n.2324>The consequences of a bad reputation are very far-reaching.

Even the most dishonest people have reason to claim to be honest , they even have reason to be honest most of the time. This is not only because most of the time it would be of no benefit to them to lie , but also because the best way to acquire a reputation for honesty is to tell the truth most of the time. Without a reputation for honesty it is difficult successfully to deceive anyone other than a complete stranger . </reputation.n.2324><reputation.n.2325>Infamy , in common usage , is notoriety gained from a negative incident or reputation ( as opposed to fame ) .

The writer also shows that according to the article , a company needs CRM to meet its strategic and financial objectives , because a company 's reputation is increasingly affecting its ability to sell products and services , to attract investors , to attract employees , and to influence government. The writer concludes that companies that seek better profits are now realizing that they are tied to what they can do for the welfare of its customers and the members of society.

Reputation is divided into a number of different levels for which players must earn reputation points to progress through. Higher reputation levels generally require more points than the previous level to progress. The exception is hated , which spans a very large number of reputation points. Reputation points , just like experience points , are gained through quests and killing various mobs. Unlike experience , it is possible to lose reputation points with some factions , either by killing members of the faction or by assisting rival factions. For rival factions , gaining reputation with one will normally decrease reputation with the other , but at a greater rate. For instance , if you kill a magram centaur , you will gain 20 points of reputation from the gelkis , but will lose 100 points from the magram. Currently there are 5 of these rival-faction pairs : Aldor ( Draenei ) vs. Scryers ( Blood Elves ) , Gelkis vs. Magram ( both Centaur ) , Steamwheedle Cartel ( Goblins ) vs. Bloodsail Buccaneers ( pirates ) , Ravenholdt ( rogues ) vs. Syndicate ( Thugs ) , and The Oracles ( Gorlocs ) vs. Frenzyheart Tribe ( Wolvar ) . </reputation.n.2341><reputation.n.2342>I think , due to this new song , by Mr. Emmerson has done much damage to his reputation as a person and as a musician loved by Sierra Leoneans for what they think he represents as an artist.

Beginning in the spring of that year , the cantankerous octogenarian wrote an extended series of letters -- over three hundred in all -- that appeared biweekly in a local newspaper , the Boston Patriot. The object of the letters was threefold. Responding to the pleas of two young politicians , Adams hoped to shed light on the current diplomatic crisis between the United States , Britain , and France by reviewing various events from his term as president. He also sought to discredit Alexander Hamilton and his attacks against Adams during the election of 1800-01.

In overzealously promoting the careers of his students , Professor X acquired a poor reputation for inflated praising. Most letter writers temper the desire to over-enthusiastically praise in order to remain credible in the eyes of their peers , realizing that this close-knit community assesses the assessors. Without community ties , reputation is generally less useful.

A customer known to be technologically advanced may be perceived as better able to judge a young firm 's technology than a customer seen as having little such expertise.

This could be a netblock , IP addresses with the same reverse domain name , etc. Since spammers use IP address ranges that are often misconfigured , the preferred definition for " the network of an IP address " is the first 24 bits of the IP address. The network reputation is not based on the number of good and bad email messages coming from the network as done in existing systems. It is based on the number of unique good IP addresses and unique bad IP addresses ( using the method described in the previous paragraph ) within this network IP address range and is updated each time an unsolicited email message is received. It is calculated similarly to the method used above for IP addresses. If the IP reputation of the IP address of the current email message has had a state change the network reputation changes accordingly.

One of the greatest fears Indian parents have is of their daughters acquiring a reputation for promiscuity. And that 's why for IA women , unlike IA men , being " bad " is immediately associated with sexuality. Let 's face it -- Indian families are far more concerned with their daughters ' sexual behavior than with their sons'. Sons are frequently allowed to date or to stay out late while daughters from the same households are not.

Your reputation level varies according to city; you may be well-known in Windurst but a nobody in Bastok. Your reputation level determines which quests you can start; NPCs are reluctant to trust a complete stranger with any but the most trivial of tasks. You gain reputation by completing quests , which in turn opens up more quests that you can do to earn more reputation. With a good reputation , the NPCs will feel comfortable asking you to do difficult tasks with correspondingly greater rewards. Also , merchants tend to offer better prices to you when you have a high reputation , in recognition of your services. The formula used to determine prices based on fame is a complex one; in general , the range between the lowest and highest starts at approximately 40 for items below 1000 gil median price , and reduces to approximately 20 for higher priced items.

Izzo 's reputation seems to be hurting his team. Referee 's and opposing coaches seem to be focused in on the Spartans ' physicality. On the road it seems that these factors are too much a focus for the officials. Wisconsin is every bit as physical , tough , and plodding as MSU.

And reputations earned in one context certainly influence reputations in other contexts . </reputation.n.2726><reputation.n.2727>What kind of reputation do you aspire to have ?

" Millions of people around the world trust our well-known brands. I 'm proud of our company 's reputation , especially being cited as a top 10 company in the area of citizenship.

Viable examples include Steve Jobs ' consistent knack for innovation at Apple , Johnson &amp;Johnson 's credo , IBM 's values including respect for the individual , customer service , and commitment to excellence , and HP 's seven corporate objectives including profit , customers , field of interest , growth , people , management , and citizenship. The quantifiable value of reputation capital at an organizational level can manifest itself as preferential access to market opportunities previously deemed improbable , unconditional support in times of business crisis , and lifelines when the bottom falls out of your company . </reputation.n.2729><reputation.n.2730>When we look at the principle , there ' s the story of Noah. Noah had character. God asked him to do something quite large for his age , to build the ark. For his peers , it was kind of insane , for lack of a better word. In Genesis , you recall the scene where Noah is laying there in his birthday suit , and Noah rebukes Ham for making Shem and Japheth shameful. As you recall from the Principle , they focused on reputation , on what other people were thinking of them , instead of what God was intending for that time. So Ham was unable to restore through indemnity that offering and could not fulfill the foundation of substance. So God had to move on . </reputation.n.2730><reputation.n.2731>Finally , be honest with yourself.

It is because of this that self-cert mortgages have gathered a bad reputation over time. This type of mortgage is still relatively new to the mortgage market , so it is not surprising that it has gone through a number of teething problems.

It is something else tho , to call such a good reputation " honor " and to say , for example , that one would be protecting , or fighting for , one 's honor rather than one 's reputation or good reputation. Reputation is etymologically nothing else than a 'reckoning up ' or 'thinking over ' , while good and bad are clearly auxiliary terms. On the other hand , honor ( able ) and dishonor ( able ) are not auxiliary terms and have a number of different meanings and connotations which are anti-egalitarian , extremist and exclusivistic in but too blatant a manner. This need not surprise us , for unlike reputation , honor is a positively unneutral concept which completely lacks the basic meaning of concern , thoughtfulness and consideration inherent in respect . </reputation.n.2736><reputation.n.2737>Write Your Comment on Reputation is Important in a Home Business Online Opportunity Note : We read and moderate all comments before they visible on article page.

This is fundamental to account for ( and to design ) limited autonomous agents as exchange partners.

But specific acts can be used to prove the knowledge of a character witness on cross-examination. According to the great majority of cases , on cross-examination inquiry is allowable as to whether the reputation witness has heard of particular instances of conduct relevant to the trait in question if the crossexaminer has a good faith belief that the conduct actually took place. Michelson v. United States , 335 U.S. 469 , 93 L.Ed. 168 ( 1948 ); Annot. , 47 A.L.R.2d 1258 ( 1956 ) . The theory is that , since the reputation witness relates what he has heard , the inquiry tends to shed light on the accuracy of his hearing and reporting. Accordingly , the opinion witness would be asked whether he knew , as well as whether he had heard. The fact is , of course , that these distinctions are of slight if any practical significance , and the second sentence of subdivision ( a ) eliminates them as a factor in formulating questions. This recognition of the propriety of inquiring into specific instances of conduct does not circumscribe inquiry otherwise into the bases of opinion and reputation testimony . </reputation.n.2885><reputation.n.2886>" I have never thought of writing for reputation and honor.

This is an important concept , because the price of shares does not reflect what a company has done in the past or is doing currently. Stock prices represent a best-guess estimate by the investment community of what lies ahead for a company. Consequently , from analysts down to individual investors , we must rely on the reputation of the company to give us an estimate of how well it will perform and , consequently , whether we should buy or sell its stock . </reputation.n.2890><reputation.n.2891>The value of a reputation is quite apparent in the sponsorship market.

The writer discusses that the case of baseball star Barry Bonds is a worthy example of the fact that scandals , regardless of their factual support , can decisively ruin one 's reputation and image , not only towards the fans , but also in regard to the sponsors and investors. The writer concludes that in the eyes of the world , Bonds is guilty for the simple fact of having cast a doubt on his performances and may end up being labeled as just another player on steroids . </reputation.n.2895><reputation.n.2896>Business reputation of a company is an important factor of efficiency of its business.

Why did it matter to them so much to vindicate their public reputation ?

Their sense of self-worth , their sense of dignity , had become intertwined with the reputation they believed they had created for themselves.

As the names indicate , candidate images and candidate reputations have no sufficient support yet , to become real images and reputations ( either because elements contributing to them are insufficient , or because information is inconsistent ) . There is a specialized detector for each type. Once a candidate image or a candidate reputation reaches a certain level of strength it becomes a full image/reputation. The idea behind the last predicate , Confirmation , is that it mirrors how good previous information was. A communication , the truth-value of which is known to the recipient , feedbacks on the image/candidate image of the information sender as an informer. The Confirmation is similar to an outcome where the contract is the communication provided by the informer and the fulfilment is the image the agent has about the target. What differs from an outcome is the nature of the information. Both pieces of information ( the image and the information provided by the informer ) are far from objective. Therefore , the weight of a Confirmation usually is lower than that of an outcome . </reputation.n.2908><reputation.n.2909>The best system of content creation is to have the key staff members whose reputations are to be built writing the blog content themselves that leads to the most honest , transparent , and bi-directionally informative information exchange.

Such is the strategy of Feinberg 's next argument. He writes : " Because the objects of a person 's interests are usually wanted or aimed at events that occur outside of his immediate experience and at some future time , the area of a person 's good or harm is necessarily wider than his subjective experience and longer than his biological life " ( " Harm , " p. 304 ) .6 Consider , for example , the " interest " in maintaining a good reputation after death.

In Raff 's case the Vielschreiber reputation made this decline sharper and more profound. By the time a generation had passed , Raff somehow had the bad luck ( and can it have been more than just that ? ) to have become a cipher for compositional incompetence at a time when the concert going public quite suddenly stopped listening to modern music. The surviving great works of the romantic era became a " standard " and severely restricted repertoire , almost to the exclusion of all else. Raff 's music was frozen out and remained unperformed.

Chaucer establishes the literary dream wherein Skelton enacts his laureate ambition , but he also infuses this form with scepticism about worldly fame , and Skelton 's practical , political investment in his poetic reputation means that Chaucer 's scepticism becomes a source of anxiety. Geoffrey himself protests indifference to fame in The House of Fame ( his encounter with Fame leads him to prefer " That no wight have my name in hond " ( III.l.1877 ) ); similarly , the issue roles of the exchequer suggest that the real Chaucer had no investment in poetic fame for practical advantage , referring frequently to his " relations with the king " but giving no record of " reward to him as a poet " 13. As we will see , however , Chaucer 's urbane , easy-going bathos in The House of Fame is a source of anxiety for the politically insecure Skelton , and Skelton 's claims to fame come to be shaped by the process of negotiating Chaucerian scepticism . </reputation.n.2961><reputation.n.2962>He added that rankings of corporate reputation consistently put Google near the top.

Where reputation does not mean anything else than the opinion people in general have about a person , group or institution , there is , from a normative perspective , nothing right in having a so-called 'good ' reputation or wrong in having a so-called 'bad ' reputation. Being highly esteemed in a certain subculture for one 's orthodox , exclusivist attitude and behavior , for instance , is nothing valuable. But when a person , group or institution is judged by the values of a particular normative doctrine , and it has a good reputation then , it means that the person or social entity in question wholly conform to the standards of that doctrine , or at least more than the average person or social entity. In the event that good is used in a badness-auxiliary sense , one must indeed conform entirely; in the event that it is used in a goodness-auxiliary sense , then much more often than on the average.

One 's reputation may change with the alteration of private or public approbation of disapproval while one 's character may remain constant or vary irrespective of the judgments of others. Before God we should strive to make our reputation and character the same. God knows what we think , feel , and do -- what we are.

On the one hand Smith tells of the repeated dealings of the merchant and the reputational incentives , based squarely on self-interest , that such dealings generate. On the other hand he talks of merchants bringing probity and punctuality " into fashion. " This looser line of reasoning receives larger elaboration in the Moral Sentiments , where Smith maintains that the yearning for approbation is endowed by Nature ( TMS , 22 , 34 , 37 , 71 , 77 , 85-91 , 116 ) and that the contours of this instinct are influenced by custom and fashion. We wish to depart from Smith 's explicit ontology of norms based on Nature and substitute for it Smith 's own remarks on repeated interaction. We propose that our yearning for approbation can to some extent be viewed as socially learned and developed within the framework of the reputational patchwork. Moral sentiments are in part grounded on an extension of the simple principle of reputation that Smith described for the Dutch merchants . </reputation.n.3294><reputation.n.3295>2479 Detraction and calumny destroy the reputation and honor of one 's neighbor.

If a character is trying to atone ( either for Good or Evil actions ) , he may declare that he is doing so. While atoning for evil deeds , a Hero would sacrifice the Good Reputation awards for his deeds in order to cancel out an equal amount of Evil Reputation.

Stating that the general corporation reputation is " not good or terrible , " the views of the average American consumer are at full play here. From the financial credit market collapse to the housing market scandals to the energy costs that have made gas prices higher than in a generation , the consumer is feeling pummeled. Add that to the ludicrous amount of corporate leadership making millions of dollars during all this while the consumer constantly gets stiffed and it 's easy to see why they 're quite displeased. But all in all , Wal-Mart was geared to help this exact customer contingent by actually controlling inflation in every way it could for them. Yet , the retailer 's reputation did n't grow at all -- but slipped last year . </reputation.n.3584><reputation.n.3585>However small companies and websites can ' t be bothered much about reputation.

Without respect there can be no civility , and without civility there can be no respect for lawyers or the legal system. We are not just another business , rather than a noble profession. Incivility manifests itself in many forms , including bad behavior during discovery , distasteful advertising and rudeness to judicial officers. Our reputation as a profession has fallen so far so fast as reflected in best selling novels , popular TV shows and movies , because of a lack of civility . </reputation.n.3588><reputation.n.3589>While ethical behavior , corporate social responsibility , and CEO reputation are three major determinants of corporate reputation , a company 's on-going reputation is shaped largely by everyday interactions with customers. The crucial and elusive approach to build a good corporate reputation is to foster a reputation-conscious corporate culture that " sweats the small stuff " , attending to all the day-to-day things that affect reputation , with a special focus on product and service quality . </reputation.n.3589><reputation.n.3590>We hear the phrases of having and losing reputation frequently in daily life. The title of reputable is generally used for people loved and respected by the society. In addition , reputation is used for meaning respect , regard shown to a person or an object from outside or the community and expressed as a perception of the public ( Davies et al. 2003 , 37; Marconi 2001 , 20; Sherman 1999 , 11 ) . </reputation.n.3590><reputation.n.3591>The session won ' t solve things overnight , but perhaps it will contribute to improving the reputation issue.

So the reputation becomes everything , much more than the product or what we think we might do. It 's more about , what have you done , how have you treated the people inside the companies you 've already acquired , what have those strategic alliances led to already ? </reputation.n.3592><reputation.n.3593>Sometimes men of character deservedly own a fine reputation among men. This is desirable above great physical wealth ( Proverbs 22 : 1 ) . But a fine reputation is not to be desired above character. False teachers have always enjoyed fine reputations among some segment of the people ( Luke 6 : 26 ) . They , along with other hypocrites of their stripe , have traded character for reputation and have received the only reward they will ever see ( Matthew 6 : 1-21 ) . Only a man of character can " rejoice and be exceedingly glad " when he is wrongly persecuted and when men say all kinds of evil against him falsely because of his practice of Christianity ( Matthew 5 : 10-12 ) . The reputation seeker will fall apart at such times . </reputation.n.3593><reputation.n.3594>For sites large and small , the worst content can be quickly identified and removed by a combination of reputation systems and content moderators.

Corporate reputation in educational institutions can be explained as following. The school ' s reputation consists of two different elements : identity and image.

In this context , school ' s reputation is made up by the combination of perceptions of internal and external shareholders . </reputation.n.3596><reputation.n.3597>Honor and reputation are immortal things and remain after a person ' s death. People want a respectable life and wish a similar kind of death but there are few people who get success in this. Life is full of ups and downs and people have to face the moments of crisis. Sometimes they achieve admiration and sometimes they are let down by the task. Astrology says that the respect and reputation of a person in his life time is because of the influence of planets in his kundli . </reputation.n.3597><reputation.n.3598>Reputation Enhances noncombat interaction between characters by providing bonuses to certain skill checks. Those who recognize a character are more likely to help him or do what he asks , provided the character 's reputation is a positive influence on the NPC or monster that recognizes him. A high reputation bonus makes it difficult for a character to mask his identity , which can be a problem if he 's trying not to be noticed . </reputation.n.3598><reputation.n.3599>Although Christians are careful and charitable with regard to the honour of others , Christians are able to hold lightly to their own honour because they find their identity , their sense of self-worth , in God. Instead of depending on the approbation of the social groups to which they belong , Christians can be secure in their identity as people deliberately and uniquely created by God and loved by God. Our identity is given to us by God not by the media , nor by the public , nor even by our close personal relationships. It is not that having a good reputation is undesirable , far from it. It is rather that chasing after it is unhealthy. ' It is not good to eat too much honey , nor is it honourable to seek one ' s own honour. ' ( Proverbs 25 : 27; 27 : 1 ) . </reputation.n.3599><reputation.n.3600>Rather than determining reputation increases purely by class levels , the DM can enhance characters ' reputations based on the characters ' actual adventures.

However , Page contends that to be useful , the lessons learned from this marketing view of reputation must be expanded to move beyond just the creation of brand equity to increase " share of mind.

So the sales people at the SEO companies are now being taught to throw out the new buzzwords like " reputation management " and " corporate reputation management " in order to sound more like a reputation manger than an SEO salesman. What the typical SEO salesperson ( turned corporate reputation management expert ) will try and sell you is a " fully upgradable " package , sprinkled with really important sounding words like " inoculation " and " exploration " to fool you into thinking they are doing something more than just basic SEO . </reputation.n.3604><reputation.n.3605>Misheard lyrics ( also called mondegreens ) occur when people misunderstand the lyrics in a song.

We as scribes strive for those rare , unforgettable moments when a band puts on a show so perfect it brings tears to one 's eyes; A show of such spectacular character it takes days to fully grasp; A show so otherworldly it 'd be shamed by the mere written words of a review. So , in pondering how best to deliver to you in the confines of a review a gig that will remain imprinted in my memory one of the best , if not the best show of my life , I stumbled across a collection of videos recorded by equally flabbergastered fans gathered there that night to nod in mutual agreement that the reputation , or infamy rather , that precedes The Dillinger Escape Plan is well-earned. I have embedded these videos in this review in order to put you , the reader , there.

Unlike the pre-Issue 16 Notoriety system , there are several ways to adjust the diffuculty of instanced mission , described below. In addition , adjusting Notoriety settings no longer costs a character Influence or Infamy.

One dictionary ' s definition  the quality of being notorious  seems unassailable. So when the writer said it was not in Thomas ' s personality to court notoriety , the passage was open to misunderstanding; other things made it clear that the aim was a compliment , and the word a poor choice. As a synonym for simple fame , notoriety has gained ground. But it ' s still better used to mean a bad reputation ill fame. Less room for misunderstanding . </reputation.n.3608><reputation.n.3609>Men of character are able to say , " I was mistaken " when they are able to discover errors in themselves. They clearly defend what they have said or done when they are accused of errors that they , themselves , can not detect. Reputation seekers , on the other hand , are quick to say that they have been " taken out of context " even when their words clearly mean what they appear to mean when placed in their context. Their " clarifications " are often very imprecise and unclear. Since many approved of them for what they did say they can not retreat from it. Since some disapprove of what they said they can not directly own it. Their fence-straddling seldom wins for them the approval of both sides and it often backfires and causes them to earn the displeasure of both. Honesty and consistency go out the window when reputation is the goal. They are obvious and apparent when character is the objective . </reputation.n.3609><reputation.n.3610>On the evil side , a Villain normally has a Net Reputation below 0 , and a Villainous Scoundrel can have a Net Reputation as high as 30 ( and Scarovese can increase this limit to 45 or 60 as well ) .

We remain the only nationwide provider of consumer motorcycle leasing , in addition to the traditional installment financing we offer. Our portfolio management is outstanding , with minimal delinquencies. We continue to respond quickly to consumer and retail dealer preferences in the marketplace and the dealer relationships we are building bode well for the future. When combined with our ongoing commercial and municipal product lines and the anticipated activation this summer of our new credit line for consumer loans and leases , we expect to quickly expand on our reputation and position in the industry. Indeed , while so many financial services companies are struggling , and may continue to struggle in the months and perhaps years to come , we see a very bright future for Sparta.

First , some terminology : </reputation.n.3612><reputation.n.3613>If in your dream you see a trash can than your dream can be considered to be a symbol of gossip. In other words , very soon , in the near future some gossip about you may appear. The gossip can be either positive or negative so you should probably try to find out what is the talk about you and judge for yourself if it is positive or negative. If it is a negative than it might have a bad influence on your reputation and the respect you get from others so than it will probably be wise for you to deny it in order to prevent loosing your reputation and respect . </reputation.n.3613><reputation.n.3614>The polarity degree referring means 1011 has a function to receive ( as an input ) the reputation information from the input means 300 and to determine through search whether or not an evaluative expression included in the input reputation information is stored in the evaluative expression storage part 201.

Did I really want to be associated with other free blogging sites or online services that I myself didn ' t ( or wouldn ' t ) use ?

From the viewpoint of anthropology , cultures of honor typically appear among nomadic peoples and herdsmen who carry their most valuable property with them and risk having it stolen , without having recourse to law enforcement or government. In this situation , inspiring fear forms a better strategy than promoting friendship; and cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate revenge increases the safety of your person and property. Thinkers ranging from Montesquieu to Steven Pinker have remarked upon the mindset needed for a culture of honor . </reputation.n.3616><reputation.n.3617>Quote : Feedback represents a person 's permanent reputation as a buyer or seller on eBay.

In criminal cases , a defendant might attempt to reduce the possibility that he or she will be convicted of committing the crime as charged by exhibiting his or her good character or propensity for not committing the offense. Ordinarily , this is limited to testimony concerning the particular character trait that is in issue. For example , evidence concerning the defendant 's trustworthiness with property might be relevant in an EMBEZZLEMENT case. The character witness must be a person who is familiar with the defendant 's reputation in the community fairly close to the time the crime was committed . </reputation.n.3618><reputation.n.3619>The definition of reputation services is a product offered by a company or individual to help others maintain their reputation.

This almost always leads to issues of conflict because just as in real life , it is almost impossible for anyone to be objective about the qualities they articulate when trying to explain what 'reputation ' means to them. Also , it seems that there is a very different view of personal reputation compared to that of business reputation. The two can clash , usually with catastrophic results.

In the last presentation of the day , Georg Kolb from Pleon ' s social media unit showed the growing importance of social media networks and online communities for reputation management and the risks occurring from within. Social media monitoring has to be in integral part of issues management as well - the same also M ller explained in the EADS case. The analysis of the web 2.0 environments is crucial to identify new stakeholders and channels , current discussions or potential future topics of the company. So social media could be the best place to manage smaller pieces of the opinion market and with it improving reputation managment , reckoned Kolb . </reputation.n.3625><reputation.n.3626>'While it is easy to get seduced by all the money that can be made out of these new technologies in China , there is a flip side to the coin.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , in some cases there is no other defense against prosecution witnesses who give perjured testimony. You have heard the character witnesses testify that my client is an honorable and good man. His good character , established week by week , month by month , year by year , repels the allegation he suddenly repudiated a lifetime of honesty and became a criminal. Although the witnesses were called character witnesses , they were in fact reputation witnesses whose testimony was restricted to what the witness knew of the general reputation of the defendant. The defendant ' s true character-what it really was-remained known only to the defendant.

Character evidence is usually permitted when a person 's honesty is an issue , such as when a criminal defendant testifies or has been charged with perjury or fraud. It is not permitted when the defendant does not testify and the crime he is charged with does n't involve the defendant 's truthfulness ( for example , the defendant is charged with illegal possession of drugs ) . Although used infrequently in civil cases , character evidence may be given in custody cases where the honesty of a party arguably affects their ability to be a good parent ( for example , in the case of a habitual liar ) , or in cases of fault divorce . </reputation.n.3828><reputation.n.3829>In classic hierarchies that connection is - when in doubt - reinforeced by fear : That person is so powerful , what ever he says will be believed or a least treated with utmost respect.

The last election , we know , signalled a drastic change with the Congress regaining part of the ground it was thought to have irreversibly lost in UP , in which Dalit voters played a big part. In its own interests , and for the sake of a more mature politics , the party must take exemplary action against Joshi. Sonia Gandhi has so far expressed regret over the remarks , while accusing the Mayawati government of political high-handedness; but this is an opportunity for the Congress , as a responsible party , to show that certain utterances carry heavy political costs , that they can wreck individual careers . </reputation.n.3831><reputation.n.3832>Customized report prices are based on the number of comparison companies of interest.

In fall 2003 , just as Pharmacy was closing , Hirst sold more than £ 11 million worth of works at his White Cube show Romance in the Age of Uncertainty. The prices spurred speculation that his market might be peaking. Then he made one of his boldest business moves : buying back a dozen early works from Saatchi. Many of the reports at the time framed the deal in terms of a personal dispute , offering accounts of strained relations between the artist and his best-known collector. But Hirst ' s motivation may have been largely financial after all , the artist had a reputation for saying outrageous things to and about collectors. In retrospect , the deal seems analogous to a public company ' s buying back its stock , both as a signal of confidence to the greater marketplace and as a bet that the prices will go up. That bet certainly seems to have paid off for Hirst. The terms of the Saachi deal were not made public , and Dunphy will not even reveal which works were involved , but there is little doubt that their value has increased dramatically . </reputation.n.3837><reputation.n.3838>Since 1946 , Garnet Electric has maintained a reputation as a company known for meeting or exceeding it customers expectations.

Such affirmation , in connection with a positive self-perception on the part of the individual , was known as honor.

As in Long Day 's Journey , the theatrical stand-in is Jamie Tyrone ( by my tally the only O'Neill character to appear in more than one play ) . Set weeks before his death , in the fall of 1923 , the play offers the profligate Jamie a final shot at redemption -- in the person of one Josie Hogan , the earthy daughter of a hardscrabble Connecticut tenant farmer. According to O'Neill , Josie , at 5'11 " and 180 pounds , is " almost a freak " and " all woman " all at once.

By encouraging trust or distrust , reputation helps in finding new resources by using trusted entities as sources of the search. It is also a powerful tool to incentive correct behavior. A well behaving entity maintains its good reputation score so that entities are interested in interacting with it. On the other hand , reputation can be used as a punishment tool. By lowering reputation score of misbehaving entities , establishment of relationships with other entities is made harder . </reputation.n.3991><reputation.n.3992>So , remember the three aspects of respect and reputation , and their effect on your ability to manage and control a high school soccer game : ( 1 ) mutual respect among the Referee Team , ( 2 ) mutual respect between the Referee Team and participants , and ( 3 ) the fact that your reputation precedes you.

Furthermore , a polarity to be evaluated is not limited to one indicating information to be estimated is positive or negative but may be one used , when a keyword set to be estimated can be classified into one of some two concepts , for indicating which concept the keyword set falls under . </reputation.n.4008><reputation.n.4009>Similarly , fighting in an individual battleground earns you reputation with specific battleground factions.

Instead , we should operate in terms of a complex interrelationship , with fame being , so to speak , spread out in both space and time.

The overall context , though , is a comparison of the present seer 's reputation with the fame of a past rsi Bharadvaja. A similar balance between past and present fame is also evident in Greek passages with euru kleos " wide fame " , such as Pindar , Olympian 10.95 , and we may therefore fairly confidently reconstruct this as an Indo-European pattern . </reputation.n.4083><reputation.n.4084>The definition of irresponsible friend online is a friend or acquaintance who uses bad judgment when putting information on the Internet.

Hardcover. Book Condition : New. 160mm x 19mm x 237mm. Dutch society has enjoyed a reputation , or notoriety , for permissiveness since the sixteenth century. The Dutch Republic in the Golden Age was the only society that tolerated religious dissenters of all persuasions in early modern Europe. Paradoxically , it was committed to a strictly Calvinist public Church and also to the preservation of religious plurality. R. Po-chia Hsia and Henk van Nierop have brought together a group of leading historians from the U.K. , the U.S. and the Netherlands. Their outstanding essays probe the history and myth of Dutch religious toleration. 196 pages.

Men are programmed to react disapprovingly to signs of promiscuity in a potential long term mate ( although they don ' t seem to mind it in a short-term partner ) . Women today don ' t realize the importance many men ( those looking for a serious relationship ) place on a woman 's promiscuity. Many of these men feel that they would be selling themselves short if they end up committing to a woman who has been promiscuous. People are mistaken if they think that the sexual revolution has eliminated the problem of a girl getting a bad reputation if she sleeps around. Yes , the double standard still exists , and to a certain degree will probably always exist.

Such an admission would hardly be radical or , as we have observed , unprecedented. The Court 's confession of error in repudiating its Griswold jurisprudence , far from harming its reputation , would enhance its prestige. We have no doubt that the same good effect would redound to the Court if the justices were candidly to speak the truth : The idea of a generalized right to privacy floating in penumbras formed by emanations was a pure judicial invention one designed to license the judicial usurpation of democratic legislative authority . </reputation.n.4220><reputation.n.4221>Natalie has a national reputation as an extraordinary teacher with students coming from around the world to attend her life-changing workshops.

After Jekyll gives Utterson a letter that he ( Jekyll ) has supposedly received from Hyde stating that Hyde has permanently left him , Utterson brings the note home to have it be evaluated by his clerk , Guest. Before showing the letter to Guest , Utterson plainly feels guilt for sharing such a private document; in fact , he has to talk himself into showing the letter , claiming that there was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Guest and thinking that Guest might possibly misconstrue the meaning of the letter so it would be better to state the meaning outright to prevent him from [ drawing ] conclusions ( 34 ) .

The Federal Rules also give the court discretion to permit cross-examination of a witness about specific instances of conduct in two situations : when the specific instances are probative of the witness ' own character for truthfulness and when they concern the character for truthfulness of another witness and the witness being cross-examined has testified about the truthfulness of that witness . </reputation.n.4284><reputation.n.4285>Firstly I do agree with the quote in that who I KNOW that I am is much more important to me than who other people THINK I am.

Before you decide on a particular reputation strategy , you should evaluate the internal and external conditions for your company. Let me demonstrate this using Siemens as an example : when the corruption affair was uncovered in 2006 , it created a massive reputation problem for Siemens. This could not be fixed through communications alone. Consequently , Siemens decisively opted for a value strategy and began to change corporate structures and employee behaviours. This process was accompanied by internal audits , and a process for changing corporate culture and values . </reputation.n.4286><reputation.n.4287>In 15th century Europe Individualism , Materialism , and Dishonorableness ( e.g. the Seven Deadly Sins ) were esteemed and the people gave the highest respect to those who did evil things in the greatest magnitude and , as a result , came out winners.

A hero may make a Reputation check ( DC 20 ) to attract followers , gaining loyal servants , guards , allies , or disciples. However , since the total number of followers you can have at one time ca n't exceed your Reputation bonus ( with professional characters counting as only one-half their level ) , many players do n't see the point to having them.

Phoolan was stunned and appalled by her father 's passivity. In Indian society , a woman would never dare challenge a man , no matter how offensive his behavior , but Phoolan Devi was fearless , headstrong , and provocative. Though only ten years old , she already had a reputation for promiscuity and was known to bathe naked in the river in broad daylight , unconcerned with who might be watching. She confronted her cousin and demanded that he compensate her father for the Neem tree.

The honor of every person in Homeric culture was important , but to the hero , his honor was paramount. He could not endure insults , and he felt that he had to protect his reputation even unto death. The hero 's duty was to fight , and the only way he had of gaining glory and immortality was through heroic action on the battlefield; thus , he continually prepared his life for the life-and-death risks of battle. The Homeric hero believed that men had to stand together in battle; men had to respect each other; and they had to refrain from excessive cruelty. This last condition was critically important for the Homeric hero. He loathed deliberate acts of cruelty and injustice. If he were ready to kill a victim , he believed that he should do it quickly; he was not to mutilate him , as Achilles does with Hektor 's body. By following this code , a hero gained a sense of dignity and a reputation for honor that would ensure his place in the social memory of his community . </reputation.n.4499><reputation.n.4500>customized or standardized.
