Sailors say that there are only two good duty stations in the navy; the one you just left and the one you are going to. But I toughed it out despite the poor living conditions , dangerous operations , and grueling hours. My tour of duty on the Gato had made me " Fast Attack Tough , " a term submariners use to refer to duty on these hunter-killer denizens of the deep. Duty on all of the other boats I was assigned to after the Gato was easy by comparison. Spending those three years on the Gato is what probably made it possible for me to spend approximately five and a half years of my life underwater in service to my country. From that perspective , she was a damn good boat ! </tour.n.3><tour.n.4>After breakfast , a walking trip around the rich fields will be made in the morning hours. Return to the hotel for lunch.

" What I stress is that you have to know your job , you have to be direct , and you have to stick to procedures. He said he had tour members that when he told them what time they were going to be departing the next day they said , " No , we want to go later. " So he changed the time to just 15 minutes later. He than had the others in the tour very upset because he changed the time just because others wanted it. So you have to know the psychology of the group , too. You make the decision , you stick with the decision , and you never ask for a vote. It 's not a democracy. People take tours because they want to be led , they do n't want to deal with decisions , that 's why they 're on an escorted tour . </tour.n.22><tour.n.23>I really do n't think you know what you 're talking about.

The tour visits Italy 's three most fascinating cities : Rome , Florence and Venice , and works either as a slow-paced holiday or as a whistle-stop taster anticipating longer future visits. Ideally , I 'd recommend flying into one of the two Rome airports ( Fiumicino or Ciampino ) and out of Venice . </tour.n.26><tour.n.27> I started it because of my son ,  Widdifield said Thursday prior to hosting the tour s annual media day event at Sutton Creek.

I am especially interested in the master narratives and the pre-tour narratives provided by travel agencies and/or presented in various media , including brochures , internet journal , etc.. The existence of these pre- tour narratives , and/or master narratives seems to imply that tourists actually , to some extent , have understandings of their destinations and have certain expectation of the tour they are going to take . </tour.n.30><tour.n.31>The most challenging day of the tour !

Her first tour was with Dominico and they sent her to the East Coast. She was to lead a tour from New Jersey to Myrtle Beach. She prepared all the narration and when she arrived , she was told , " Now you 're doing the tour from New Jersey to Niagara Falls ! " And she had tour members from Germany , the United States , and England. She had to translate documents , do the tour in two languages , and prepare the narration until two o'clock in the morning.

Its strong point was its nice set of features and excellent lens , all contained in a very portable body. I took over eighteen thousand pictures with it before it died in its sleep one night in western Argentina. I was never sure of the cause of that failure , but it had something to do with the power system. In terms of keeping it going before that happened , I never had any troubles , and the four batteries I brought with me were twice what I really needed. While I was sad to see it go , and not thrilled about having to spend more cash to replace it , by that time I had become more interested in imaging wildlife and so was intrigued about the recently developed superzoom category of cameras. For some reason Pentax never developed a successor to this now-discontinued camera , which seems perplexing . </tour.n.73><tour.n.74>A tour leader is a guide , babysitter , teacher , and entertainer all rolled into one.

From their arrival at the airport on day one , to checking them in weeks later for their return flight , you will guide them through the tour itinerary , see that the group gels , and ensure that they all return home in one piece , with a bunch of new experiences and an address book full of new friends . </tour.n.74><tour.n.75>Enjoy a good reputation amongst suppliers ( accommodation providers , tour guides etc. ) for being honest , responsive , and fair . </tour.n.75><tour.n.76>Last year my DH and I decided that we wanted to go to South Africa. We had never been on safari before , so we decided to hedge our bets by doing a tour that included Capetown scenery , Swaziland culture , and several safaris in KrugerNP and in Hlluluwe Umfolozi. I asked for guidance on this forum as to when the best time of the year might be to take this trip as I wanted to avoid the extemely hot temperatures and rain , if possible. I was told that the first week of Oct. would probably be good and so we decided on that. Then we had to decide whether to go independently or with a tour company. After doing much research on the itinerary we wanted , we decided to go with Smartours. We had been on several of their tours previously and found them very well run and enjoyable. So we booked with them for Oct.6-Oct.20. Long story short , the tour was excellent , the hotels were good to very good , the breakfasts were very good and the tour escort was good. And as an added bonus , It was fabulous value for the money . </tour.n.76><tour.n.77>Day 3 : Bangkok A vibrant city , today Bangkok is a central economic hub for Southeast Asia. Blending with its modern-day might is a captivating history that more than 10 million inhabitants call their own. A city tour of Bangkok provides you with insight into the fascinating religious composition of this area during visits to two of Bangkok 's famous temples : The Golden Buddha , clad in plaster centuries ago to hide its value from marauders , was rediscovered by a fortunate accident in 1957; The Reclining Buddha is about 150 ' long and is clad in pure gold.

Today breakfast , lunch and dinner are included . </tour.n.77><tour.n.78>If that seems like a lot of effort in an industry that has performance limits placed on its consumer goods like golf does , consider this nugget of promise from Tomita-san : the research and the product development at Bridgestone is often more geared to finding a way average players can hit balls specifically geared to their swing speeds farther than the so-called premium balls designed for tour players. Given that the U.S. Golf Association is considering a rollback on golf ball distance , something Tomita believes is surely coming , the idea that average players might not be affected at all by a rollback is surely intriguing.

Hopefully this gear checklist is relevant to my situation. I ' m planning my first tour and I don ' t know how much storage space I ' m really going to need , so I don ' t want to overbuy ( size of pannier and quantity of panniers/ bags ) . I ' m trying to go ultralight and minimalist and still keep the cost down while using quality goods. The only item I have so far is a Marmot synthetic baselayer , which weighs under 6 oz. I have a wish list for the rest of the gear , but am still flexible on what exactly I ' ll be using. When a pannier is described by its volume in liters , all I can think of is how many 2 liters of Coke will I have in gear ? Is there a better way to figure out how much space you really need without already having the gear or doing crazy measuring ?

This enabled us to drive up to Hellfire Pass , beyond Nam Tok. Building the railway was an enormous logistical challenge , but driving it through the rock and across the ravines in these hills was the most difficult part.

Our journey now heads north through a ' land of wine and honey '; the thriving township of Mudgee. Discover the many attractions unique to the area including the towns buildings and the boyhood home of Henry Lawson. More intriguing history is ours to enjoy a little further up the track at Gulgong - a town whose charm and character has ensured its survival after the gold rush days. The towns unique narrow streets featuring clapboard , verandahs and iron lace ARE revealed on a tour of the village highlights . </tour.n.324><tour.n.325>Deserts are common in modern Gondwana , the most significant being the expansive Sahara , of course. I like to visit them from time to time , but generally prefer to spend only a little time there when on Tour , as I much prefer the verdant green of a thick forest. It is often only a matter of a small difference in rainfall between a desert and more productive grasslands. In Africa , the bleakest desert I rode through on the Tour was the flat , barren Dida Galgalu in northern Kenya. The few nomadic people who lived there are probably faced with the toughest life of any of the traditional peoples I have seen over the years. The very basic huts in which they lived can be seen in the image below , in the distance , just to the left of the swirling dust-devil. The difference of between that area and the nearby grasslands , famous for their large , but ever-decreasing , herds of wildlife , is slight both in terms of distance and climate. Any decrease in rain in the surrounding areas will force many people into a similar life , or cause them to become climatic migrants . </tour.n.325><tour.n.326>Despite this , tourists should still take personal responsibility and chose their tour company carefully. Jen Campbell-Pitt , a trainer who has worked in Soweto for nearly a decade , advises visitors to avoid the larger tour buses where occupants - with their cameras and other signs of wealth on display - can become sitting ducks. Smaller groups are less visible , and the experience is far more rewarding for those taking part as they have plenty of time to chat to the guide. She also highlighted that some areas are best avoided from November until mid-January when the crime rate escalates with people pouring home for Christmas , desperate for extra cash over the festive period . </tour.n.326><tour.n.327>Having fun and going to some place for tour is a good idea. When you are going to an unknown place you do need a tour guide to guide you throughout your tour. But still finding and engaging a tour guide is laborious work to take . </tour.n.327><tour.n.328>Begin the tour with visits to Tohpati 's Batik Industry OR Celuk with its gold and silver produces.

The first part of the tour ( Southern-Western Provinces ) was undertaken from the 4th to the 18th April , 1946 , and the second from the 25th November to the 22nd December , 1946. Chief Mowoe ' s tour , as I have already said , was for a definite purpose , i.e. , to raise funds for what was then known as the Urhobo National Education Scheme. In his letter of appeal for funds issued to braches and Urhobo communities before starting the tour , Chief Mowoe said : </tour.n.329><tour.n.330>Comparing photographs of Lance Armstrong during the Tour de France Prologue to the Oakley eyewear catalog , it appears that Lance was actually wearing Oakley Zeros.

Recently , I wrote a feature round-up article for the travel network Boots n'All where I 've picked out some of my favorite and unusual trails in the world. They range from the black lava-lined vineyards on Pico Island in the Azores to the serpentine Great Wall of China. Some of the trails I chose , such as the one that runs atop the battlement walls in Dubrovnik , are easy to negotiate on your own. Others , such as along the dry stream beds ( or wadis ) in the Negev Desert in Israel , are best tackled with a guide because it 's easy to lose your way.

You 'll be met at the station , and transfer straight to your guesthouse to shower and freshen up. The rest of the day is left free to wander at your own pace and soak up the atmosphere of this lively city. Chiang Mai is the most important of Thailand 's northern cities , with a history dating back to the 13th century and beyond. For 200 years the city was under Burmese control and much evidence of this period remains in both the architectural style of many buildings and in some of the rice and soup dishes found in local restaurants ! Your Group Leader should be able to arrange an optional cycle tour of the backstreets and outlying villages; a gentle pace allows all members of the family to keep up on what is a fascinating glimpse of ordinary Thai life.

We value your input . </tour.n.404><tour.n.405>As I thought about this differentiation between the two writers , I found the key to it ( for my own peace of mind , at least ) , within Bruner 's focus on narrative. He is constantly aware of personal narratives , pre-tour , on-tour , and post-tour ( this is especially expounded upon in his unpublished conference paper , fascinatingly expanding the brief sketch he provides in the introduction to CULTURE ON TOUR ) , both those narratives of the tourists he travels with , those he studies , and , most importantly , those of himself and his constant travel companion , his wife. I am extremely hesitant to invoke " post-modernism " here , but it is the best term I am able to think of right now to use as an admittedly-reductive binary opposition to MacCannell , who invokes narrative but only in the sense of the overarching uber-narratives of modernism ( marxism , structuralism , etc. ) . Bruner is n't looking at narratives of the world and of societies , though , he is looking at individual , fragmented , personal narratives of lived ( or soon-to-be-lived/already-lived ) experiences . </tour.n.405><tour.n.406>Haere Maiwelcome to New Zealand !

In letting it all hang out , in speaking from a frank , personal and importantly , reflexive voice , Bruner makes himself and us aware of the inner workings of money , of control , privileges , biases , and also brick walls and difficulties that arise. He is attempting to understand for himself , from his position on the ground and through him , we gain insight. This varies greatly from MacCannell ' s effort to establish an overarching tourist social structure. Here , questions with no answers are valued , and analyses of specific situations ( over quite an extensive period of time ) are offered not as typical necessarily , not as examples to illustrate a unifying theory , but as a way to develop tourist studies debate . </tour.n.431><tour.n.432>This was an interesting but brief article.

The available tracks lack variety , are uninspired , and sometimes even seem as though they 're designed to work against players rather than encourage them to " be one with the mountain. " Illogical and poorly placed ramps , obstacles , and turns play havoc with On Tour 's suggested trick lines ( e.g. , a grind rail that leads you directly into a large and unfortunately placed rock ) . It 's not that SSX courses all need to contain the spastic excess we saw in Tricky; SSX 3 's mountain still inspired a Zen-like feeling without resorting to a snowpocalypse design. On Tour 's mountain simply lacks soul . </tour.n.496><tour.n.497>THE PRICE OF THIS PRIVATE TOUR OF PAESTUM ( TEMPLES + MUSEUM ) IS NOT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS.

After a record eight victories in 10 college events as a sophomore , Ochoa turned pro , arriving on the LPGA tour in 2003. Sorenstam was coming off an epic season during which she won 11 times. Ochoa became the heir apparent after taking the rookie of the year award in '03 , but she and Sorenstam were as different as fire and ice.

Why would Google maps work on Verizon and not Sprint , just does n't make sense , what makes more sense is Sprint is blocking it with its slightly different RIM OS , the RIM OS made for Sprint. Which leads me to another question why would sprint all of a sudden block the blackberry tour ( 9630 ) and the Blackberry Curve 8330m ( Not the 8330 ) when first off they are bending over backwards to keep customers and second when Verizon is or has been in court for the same reason.

He encouraged us to eat local food and educated us as to what was safe. He was passionate about his culture and history and filled in gaps between the local guides who were also very good. While in such a whistle-stop tour one can never really get into any community , he took us as far 'behind the curtain ' of India as was possible in the time.

After Henk 's last verse the song deviated from the album version. While on the album the Michiel lyrics are continued for a couple of more minutes with a lot of echo , in the live version this was replaced by a Michiel playing a real trumpet over a heavy bass backing and strong drums. A very intense atmosphere was created by the band this way. Henk ended the song with a loud cry of 'Oh ! '. In Rothenburg the song segued out of the equally intense 'hands of the watch ' . </tour.n.720><tour.n.721>Tour operator A person or company which creates and/or markets inclusive tours and subcontracts with suppliers to create a package.

BUT the rewards are huge - the enjoyment factor will be high if you are a people person and the chance to see more amazing places around the world whilst getting paid is almost too good to be true. Skills tour companies look for in tour leaders include : excellent people skills; a second language ( depending on the countries you would visit ); ability to make decisions and operate in pressure situations; travel experience; and relevant job skills such as customer service , organisational , basic accounting. If you meet the criteria and have time to spare then a job as a tour leader is a gap year or career break experience you will never forget . </tour.n.783><tour.n.784>Stoves and Bottles should be distributed among cyclist but cyclist types loosely fall into one of two categories. Those that typically arrive to camp early and those that typically arrive later. It does not take long to learn typical cyclist patterns and most people know their classification before starting a group tour. Wally Werner of Adventure Cycling calls these groups Rabbits and Turtles. I 'm a Turtle [ there is an old bar room joke there ] . Soooo the point is that for good group tour organization purposes , one wants Rabbits to carry the Stoves , as they are usually the first to arrive at camp , so that they may initiate boiling/warming water for the cook ( s ) . </tour.n.784><tour.n.785>Today we travel south to the Monterey Peninsular and the Spanish colonial style town of the same name.

I wanted to see , as best I could given the limitations of a long bike Tour , which parts of the lands that I would visit were most threatened from evolving climates changes , and try to imagine what might happen to the people and the ecosystems that exist there. That was certainly not easy , as the issues are very complex , but , as with other subjects , time and patient observation make such issues appear slightly more clear. Here are my thoughts after sweating across five continents . </tour.n.788><tour.n.789>In the introduction to Culture on Tour , Bruner signals important political themes surrounding the question of narrative and metanarrative. Writing about contested sites he warns against monolithic interpretations that are static and ahistorical , that homogenize meaning ( 12 ) and emphasizes a need for a deconstruction of the official story or version of a site. Bruner asserts that contested sites raise the key narrative question of who has the right to tell the story. ( 12 ) In this regard , it is also crucial not to omit the question of who has the agency or political power to be heard. It is true , as Bruner writes , there are no persons without agency , but it is vital to remember that agencies are not monolithic. Bruner argues against fixed and irreversible slots of tourist and native and contends that local people who are subjected to the tourist gaze may subsequently travel to Europe or America and reverse the gazing process. The notion of reverse mobility is not so simple , however. The emaciated children of Tanzania running after cars full of tourists ( 98 ) have very different agency and are in no position to reverse the tourist gaze . </tour.n.789><tour.n.790>Luang Prabang was the former royal capital of Laos , also had the longest monarch in Southeast Asia with more than 62 kings over 600 years.

For an answer , I turned to an article written after the Stage 4 Team Time Trial by Suzanne Haliburton. Suzanne is a journalist from the Austin American-Statesman whom I met at the Dodge Tour de Georgia. Here 's how Haliburton presented what Riis said : </tour.n.792><tour.n.793>Independent contractor A person contractually retained by another to perform certain specific tasks. The other person has no control over the independent contractor other than as provided in the contract.

If you pay close attention to this tour schedule , you will notice that early-on there are many details that show hour-by-hour what the band will be doing. However , as the schedule continues to unfold , far fewer details of the band 's activities are listed. This is very common because , depending on the success of the marketing plan , there may not be that much interest in a fairly new band in every city of the tour. So , labels leave things open , and can plug in new promotional opportunities as they develop. If the record is a hit , the band will go out for many more weeks and months , and along the way repeat the daily work routines. So , the band 's management company will stay in close contact with the label , and alert the band for any new tour dates or other marketing arrangements that have been setup . </tour.n.850><tour.n.851>The Deluxe Combo Tour ( 4 1/2 hours approx. ) combines the Grand Sunset Tour or Grand Canyon Safari &amp;Rim Walk with the Indian Paintings Tour.

One of our family ' s friends was a survivor of the Bataan Death March.

After years of watching tightly edited versions of band tours on MTV , few developing artists ever get a glimpse of the everyday life of a band on the road.

Unlike many private clubs Monterey Peninsula is a functioning democracy , and the Tour was invited back only after the full membership gave its approval in a vote. The rapturous reception by the pros should help stroke the members ' collective ego , and the Tour players also made a good impression with an unheard-of act of subservience : To ensure that the Monterey Peninsula members could park on-site , the players took shuttles to the club . </tour.n.1075><tour.n.1076>We update the terms and conditions for each tour operator on a quarterly basis.

As well as a huge budget the Planet Earth team had the critical commodity of photography - time. Much better to spend longer in one place than a whistle stop tour around a country.

Whilst in Cardiff , all the groups were able to take tours to the Valleys with included lunches , and some dined at Cardiff Castle with a themed banquet one evening.

The recent history of Wardour has not been entirely happy . </tour.n.1086><tour.n.1087>Another cycling-related person interviewed in the documentary is Antoine Vayer , an exercise physiologist. Several websites describe Vayer as a trainer of the Festina Pro Cycling Team from 1995 to 1998. Vayer compares the performance of Tour riders from year-to-year , apparently looking for dramatic performance improvements that he finds difficult to believe are achieved naturally. The narrator says : </tour.n.1087><tour.n.1088>Join Jana and her companions on a tour of Zanzibar in Africa as they wander the narrow alleyways of the old Stone Town exploring the food art and culture of this fascinating tropical island.

At a time when all hands should be on the PGA Tour 's deck , he 's bailed as fast as possible.

This included BlackBerry Maps. From what I 've read and heard about the Tour and Curve 8330m models this is n't the case on Sprint at all. BlackBerry Maps works the same as on the Curve 8330. Minor OS updates by RIM can cause major failures in software written for a specific OS. ( Take the difference between Windows XP and Windows Vista as an example. ) Somewhere else online is mentions that Poynt did n't work with the new Tour either when it was released and almost the next day Poynt had a revised version of the program that worked. This is n't a carrier being greedy as Sprint seems to be bending over backwards to try and keep customers. Just my two cents . </tour.n.1091><tour.n.1092>It was clear that the tour index had to be vertical. I initially tried the traditional left-hand approach. At 640x480 , the index overwhelmed the tour content . </tour.n.1092><tour.n.1093>You will be escorted by our driver-guide who will take you for a leisure guided ride of Paris.

Kerry 's patience and diplomacy in dealing with a large group of people ensured that everyone got what they needed and Coco 's ability to navigate 'hellish ' traffic made even the longest 'bus days ' comfortable and safe. All this meant that everything was well organised and we all got where we needed to be in one piece - having a few laughs along the way. The longer stays in each city were great with the freedom to do as much , or as little as you liked - with conveniently located hotels and good site-seeing information about each place provided. The included meals were good , often featuring a local 'character ' who provided much laughter &amp;entertainment.

By the time the 1904 Lewis and Clark Exposition and World 's Fair opened there in late April , he was probably back in Sedalia where he spent some time. Joplin was given an opportunity to play at the exposition , but his presence was overshadowed by many larger groups , including the legendary band of John Philip Sousa. He was one of many composers who wrote a work specifically for the exposition , giving the world The Cascades , a musical celebration of the waterfalls that extended out behind the Hall of Music on the fairgrounds. This piece , Tom Turpin 's St. Louis Rag , and the extremely catchy Meet Me In St. Louis by composer Frederick Allen Mills are the three pieces from that event that have endured the longest . </tour.n.1118><tour.n.1119>4.9 Mr C.

After the initial flights in the early sixties demonstrated that there are no immediate life-threatening effects of space flight , NASA 's life-science research has , for the most part , appropriately focused on the problems of longer-duration flights , as would be experienced on a trip to another planet or a tour of duty on a space station.

Not only did we get to see places the show was filmed but also some of the most beautiful spots on the island. The guide was flexible and knowledgeable about both the show and the island. If I had something negative to say I would , but there was nothing negative about the experience. Even when it rained the guide changed the order of the visits so the weather had time to change and it was perfect for specific locations.

In Dubai this takes two routes; red and blue. Red is a city tour and blue , the Jumeirah Beach tour. We decided to combine both as much as possible. Our tour began in Wafi City , where we passed Wonderland , where there is also a huge health complex being built. We proceeded along the creek , which is lined with Dhows and ferries which run between Creek and Deira and along the river. We passed Dubai Museum in the old part of the city. Dubai Museum is a reminder of how Dubai was before they discovered oil. In this area , there are souks , bazaars and local restaurants. Next we passed Sheikh Saeed Al Makhtoum House and Heritage Village before reaching the Gold Souk , onwards past Spice Soukh and Abra station with trading houseboats and where the Dhow river cruise goes from. At Deira City Centre there is a crossover point where we could pick up the blue tour and go to Jumeirah , thereby missing the last two stops but saving half an hour . </tour.n.1214><tour.n.1215>Included Double Decker Bus tours : Uptown , Downtown , Brooklyn and Night Tour ! 48 hours of hop-on and off fun at over 50 stops throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn.

That was one of the main impetuses for my decision to use container ships to make the four ocean crossing needed to reach the various main fragments of Gondwana. There were a few flights that I could not avoid , however , were I to make it to the islands that are smaller pieces of the old supercontinent , and a few others that were required for political reasons. By balancing the emissions I would cause on those flights with the savings I would make by eliminating the use of the various energy-consuming technologies which I normally use at home , albeit at relatively minimal levels , I hoped to be neutral for the Tour as a whole. However , I realized that given the uncertainties of travel on cargo ships , and the general unpredictability of a long tour , all of those ideas could have fallen apart completely . </tour.n.1222><tour.n.1223>tour organizer : person who locates and creates groups for preformed tours.

I was rather confident in the items that I chose to use on the Tour , as I had already evaluated most of them on earlier tours. However , I had never done anything approaching the length of the Tour of Gondwana before , and , consequently , I really had no idea what to expect.

For example , a large petrol storage facility , decorated with the yellow and green logo of British Petroleum , and a small plywood box where an immigration official sat in an immaculate brown suit and gazed with an air of curiosity and unhurried wonder ( like a scholar scanning the pages of a manuscript in the stacks of a library ) at the passports of a line of tourists that began to stretch out of the terminal and onto the edge of the airfield. There was an advertisement for rum above the baggage carousel , a picture of the prime minister in the customs corridor , a bureau de change in the arrivals hall and a confusion of taxi drivers and tour guides outside the terminal building.

While Entwistle and Daltrey slowly faded away , their solo careers losing momentum across the remainder of the decade , Townshend continued recording to relative success. However , the Who still haunted him. The group reunited to play Live Aid in 1985 , and three years later , they played a British music awards program. In 1989 , Townshend agreed to reunite the band , minus Kenney Jones , who was replaced by session drummer Simon Phillips for something billed as a 25th anniversary tour of America. Whatever goodwill the Who had with many fans and critics was squandered on that tour , which was perceived as simply a way to make a lot of money -- which , in all honesty , Daltrey and , especially , Entwistle needed. They ended up with the worst reviews in their history , and followed it up with a live album , Join Together , that was the nadir of their recording history , shapeless , flat , and , worst of all -- and most astonishingly for this band -- dull. The Who reunited again in 1994 for two concerts to celebrate Daltrey 's 50th birthday . </tour.n.1359><tour.n.1360>Aloha and welcome to Hawaii !

It is worth pointing out that as the operator does marketing on behalf of the accommodation establishment , the growth of direct business means that the accommodation establishment has to perform its own marketing activities , driving up its costs.

As opposed to MacCannell ' s idea of authenticity , which investigates tourist sites in terms of various degrees of front stage and back stage ( referring to the existence of an authentic , postulated original culture that tourists strive for but almost always can not achieve ) , Bruner speaks of a constructed tourist realism that is authentic in that it exists in real life but which is depended upon the narratives assigned to it by those participating. This space becomes a tourist border zone where multiple new realities exist at the same time , and the binary of authentic and unauthentic breaks down . </tour.n.1376><tour.n.1377>Christmas day by the wild Atlantic.

Admiral Frank Kelso left office two months before his four years were up , and Admiral Jeremy Boorda died in office after two years. Most recently , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has nominated Admiral Vern Clark for an additional two years in pursuit of the global war on terrorism. If he completes a full six-year term ( 21 July 2000 - 21 July 2006 ) , his tour will have been 16 days longer than that of Admiral Burke ( 17 August 1955 - 1 August 1961 ) . </tour.n.1431><tour.n.1432>The main difference of this flight from our standard flight is that instead of a pre designated take off area , we choose from among the 10 different fields we have all around the region , that will give us the best possible itinerary , depending on the wind conditions of that particular day. To do this , our pilots take a tour of the region way before sunrise time , and check the winds. We collect our passengers from their hotels roughly one hour before sunrise and we bring them to our base , and serve tea , coffee and cookies , as the passengers meet. In the meantime we let go several helium test-balloons to check the last state of the wind , to make a final decision on the most suitable launching site. Then we climb aboard our vehicles and go to the take-off field. Then you will watch the balloon being inflated and heated up , which is quite a sight in itself. In the meantime your pilot will give you a safety briefing. Once everything is ready , and your pilot tells you to do so , you can get into the basket for take off . </tour.n.1432><tour.n.1433>Included Double Decker Bus tours : Uptown , Downtown , Brooklyn and Night Tour !

The Army used a similar model during the peacekeeping deployments of the 1990s -- sending troops to Bosnia , Haiti and Kosovo for six-month stints ( or less ) . When you include pre-deployment training , the tours include even more time away from home and family. But these deployment cycles are sustainable , largely because they give troops roughly twice as much time at home as abroad . </tour.n.1434><tour.n.1435>Our South African tours offer , quite simply , the best of African birding.

We had such a great time doing it in North America and it did many great things for us as a band. It 's fair to say that I ca n't wait to get going with this one. It will be a blast , believe me ! !

Overnight in Puerto Lopez . </tour.n.1586><tour.n.1587>Pannier bag types range from small to large to expedition sized. Most bike stores do not carry large expedition bags in stock. Some bags have many pockets and access points and some have none. Some are water proof , most are water repellent. We have never found this to be an important tour issue but we store our items inside a waterproof storage sack first and set the storage sack in the pannier. Very often , while camping and remote we leave the panniers mounted on the bikes and only bring in the content sacks . </tour.n.1587><tour.n.1588>The fall of 2002 was a tumultuous time for professional bass anglers across the country. Pros who had simultaneously fished both the Wal-Mart FLW Tour and the BASS Tour without incident were suddenly faced with a new reality . </tour.n.1588><tour.n.1589>Created by Amy de Boinville , Patti Odbert , and installed by Applied Advertising , Inc. , loving care was taken to ensure that not one letter of any firefighter 's name was missing. This was achieved through painstaking work of wrapping the design around the many keyholes , vents , hinges and gaskets of the Whistle-Stop Tour bus. The concept also wrapped the names completely around the bus and leaving no space to signify the sincere hope for mitigating firefighter fatalities in the future . </tour.n.1589><tour.n.1590>But as eloquent , smart and unMcCain-like as Obama sounded during the interview , his pre-foreign policy tour paean to U.S. civil society lacked any mention of how of the U.S. government was " working for the people " when its military aid paid for those Indonesian mansions in the late 1960's. Neither did his response to Zakaria mention what the U.S government did to enable one of the worst slaughters of the late 20th century : providing training to 1 , 200 of those generals and other Indonesian military officers and giving them the money , arms , intelligence and political support that caused catastrophic trauma. As a smart and sensitive boy who played soccer on Jakarta 's dusty Haji Ramli Street , Obama surely felt this trauma among his friends and families devastated by state-sponsored terrorism and mass murder . </tour.n.1590><tour.n.1591>Next on our whistle-stop tour of Andalucia has to be the provincial capital of Cordoba and La Mezquita . Once arguably the most important city in Europe , this fact is emphasised by the architectural splendour of La Mezquita , the Grand Mosque. Along the coast we find the historic port of Cadiz , said to be Europe s oldest port and Cadiz still manages to retain some of its aura of mystery . </tour.n.1591><tour.n.1592>BG , thanks for explaining things to me , but I want to ask a follow-up question regarding longer tours and casualty rates : if we assume that the casualties for a given unit are bimodal ( i.e. at mostly at the beginning and the end ) , and at a much lower rate in the middle , then overall we do n't change a given unit 's casualties much over a deployment by making it longer. In other words , a battalion is going to take X casualties during a deployment , on average . </tour.n.1592><tour.n.1593>Deception : Psychological problems among GIs and reservists included perceived deception in recruiting processes , as well as longer and more frequent tours of duty than promised.

The display in FRC has only images of FRC projects. While it 's impossible to know what photos will be up at what time , the photos have been fairly stable for a while , so I 've made a list here with identifying descriptions.

I do n't think so. This is really about AMD and H-P supporting the LiveStrong program in a major way. These notebooks are hitting the stores in time for the Tour de France , and I ca n't think of a better way for a LiveStrong supporter to demonstrate his or her commitment than to use one. This would mean more than putting a " Join Lance ! " sticker from the Lance Armstrong Foundation on the notebook case , as I 've done in the past . </tour.n.1630><tour.n.1631>Atmospheric Laos , a country you will want to float away in and stay forever !

In those series , the male characters are depicted as devoted lovers who , for some irresistible force , have to part with their princess-like girlfriends. Such TV series are especially appealing to the middle-age , married Asian women who play the role as loving mothers , perform their duty as home-makers and devoted wives. Now travel agencies in Asia offer tours on the authentic shooting locations of such TV series to provide the tourists , most of whom are fans of Korean romance TV series , with the romantic settings , within which the tourists can experience the romantic atmosphere. Like any other tours offered by travel agencies , there will be a tour guide introducing the sites to the tourists. However , unlike other tour guides focusing on the cultural and social aspects of tourist attractions , the guides of such TV series tours emphasize the romantic elements of the sites by referring specifically to certain romantic scenes appearing in TV series . </tour.n.1636><tour.n.1637>Yep , Joe the plumber tour is ridiculous because Joe the plumber is a fake. Trying to make him the symbol of the American dream. He is not an idependent ( that would be wanting to get clarification on some information ) he is a registered republican that tried to ask a question to stump Obama but in fact drew more attention onto himself. He made 40 , 000 dollars last year. And deserves all of the scrutiny he is getting. And McCain wants to use him as a symbol of Americans trying to obtain the American dream ? What alternate universe is McCain living in ? Joe is a fake , liar , and coward. He should have asked a real question. How would Obama 's taxes effect his lively hood ( at his correct income level ) . And when he finally has enough money to actually buy his employers business ( which was not anytime previous or in the near future ) , how would the Obama tax plan effect him . </tour.n.1637><tour.n.1638>The client shall provide on the GMT application form information as required by GMT and submit the form together with the necessary reservation deposit.

Aggressively private , Cypress dropped out of sight in the wake of the Shoal Creek controversy , which brought a Tour mandate that its host clubs have diverse memberships. As one Cypress member recounted last week , " At the time we tried to explain that we have a process here for membership , and that there was a seven-year waiting list. We were not going to subvert all of that and shove someone in just to appease the Tour. The media really clobbered Cypress , and it was a very unattractive period in the club 's history. The great irony , of course , is that the club has always been a very egalitarian place. " With a laugh , he added , " Irrespective of income.

A few weeks ago , I approached a major IT infrastructure software developer regarding a fulltime job.

The real stars at last week 's AT &amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am were the golf courses. Spyglass Hill happens to be one of the best tracks on Tour , but it was completely overshadowed by the other courses that make up the tournament 's new heavenly trinity : Pebble Beach Golf Links , which showed off some fancy tweaks for the upcoming U.S. Open , and the revamped Shore course at Monterey Peninsula Country Club , which made a smashing return to the rota after a 33year absence. Throughout the week all three courses were bathed in glorious sunshine and framed by the pounding surf of an angry Pacific , and players were content to be rendered supporting actors on the grandest stages . </tour.n.1651><tour.n.1652>I loved Kumuka when I was on the tour but appreciated it even more after I did my Topdeck tour. Kerry ( Tour Leader ) and Coco ( Driver ) were amazing. I loved everything from the way the tour was structured in that we were taken around the first night we arrived in a city for a thorough orienteering tour then had the time to be free range for our time in that city afterwards. Kerry was always around to ask anything and everything we needed in the mornings. I loved the updates she gave us as we approached each city , everything from the main touristy attractions to the quirky , unusual sites. She knew her stuff extremely well ! I left every city feeling satisfied and like I had a good taste of what it had to offer . </tour.n.1652><tour.n.1653>If you want to make unforgettable afternoon on your holiday in Bali.

His friendships are not normal. He doesn ' t have normal relationships. It ' s not like he ' s got guys that he hangs out with on Friday night. He ' s not one for small talk or casual conversation. If he ' s on a tour bus he may have some conversation that ' s relatively casual , but nine times out of ten even that will be something related to the show or the album or something. Almost everything in the ten years I was with him , save some very specifically allocated leisure time , almost everything else was somehow about music or the show. He ' s so strictly defined by his career that there really hasn ' t been a normal life away from that. I sense that with Mayte and the marriage he ' s trying to find something like that now. Certainly the Prince that I know is not a guy who just picks up the phone and say Hey , how ya doin ? He ' s a very distant personality. </tour.n.1655><tour.n.1656>Pick up the tour keys from Suzanne.

The astonishing Durham Cathedral is a veritable highlight of any Durham coach tour : Since the cathedral 's interior was finished in a relatively short period of 40 years , the cathedral 's Gothic style is rather rarely consistent. As well as an impressive interior housing historic relics and libraries , one of which is the monastic library , visitors can also climb the 325 stairs of the Cathedral 's Tower to admire brilliant panoramic views of the city.

In the loud parts Rob started drumming as the drum computer was turned off. Henk sang the 'different .. ' lyrics very loud , almost shouting them. The keyboards and guitar also were much heavier in these parts. In the instrumental part Robert Jan played some weird synth effects , which we now can recognize as trademark stuff from him.

Most of the multiplayer modes are competitive with some sort of versus in its title - band vs. band , guitar vs. guitar , etc. Coupled with an in-game ranking system that is based on how much money you earn ( that is , how many times you grind a song that ' s easy enough that you get a perfect note streak and earn loads of cash ) instead of based on your actual skill , the incentive to play and improve feels somewhat misguided . </tour.n.2027><tour.n.2028>-- Modest Mouse 's Marr-less winter tour is now bigger and probably better than it was before.

If you pay close attention to this tour schedule , you will notice that early on there are many details that show hour-by-hour what the band will be doing. However , as the schedule continues to unfold , far fewer details of the band 's activities are listed. This is very common because , depending on the success of the marketing plan , there may not be that much interest in a fairly new band in every city of the tour. So , labels leave things open , and can plug in new promotional opportunities as they develop. If the record is a hit , the band will go out for many more weeks and months , and along the way repeat the daily work routines. So , the band 's management company will stay in close contact with the label , and alert the band for any new tour dates or other marketing arrangements that have been setup . </tour.n.2031><tour.n.2032>Starting in Warsaw this tour journeys south to see the Black Madonna in Czestochowa and the former concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau , en route to Krakow.

This leads to a coarsening of the grain size and the possible confusion with intrusive gabbro ( like happened at the Turner-Albright in the mid-1970 's ) . It seems to me that the general lack of pillow forms in many parts of the Josephine Ophiolite indicates a relatively rapid rate of spreading , but there may be other reasons for the general lack of pillow development in the tour area . </tour.n.2088><tour.n.2089>In order to use the The Revolve Tour Message Board forums , users are required to provide a username , password and a VALID e-mail address.

Panoramic - The lower city tour </tour.n.2265><tour.n.2266> The first realization I had was that I was not going to do both , he said. I have been there , done that. I fished both tours , including the EverStart Series and BASS Opens , for several years. I knew what those two-tour guys were getting into. For me , squeezing that many events into a six-month period was ridiculous. I have a little daughter at home , and I am not going to miss her growing up because I am at a tournament every week. </tour.n.2266><tour.n.2267>We include a short sightseeing tour this morning to help you get your bearings and to show you districts and landmarks including Broadway and Fifth Avenue , Chinatown , the Brooklyn Bridge and views of the art deco styled Empire State Building. At the end of the tour , the day is yours to enjoy as you please - perhaps with a trip on the Staten Island ferry past the Statue of Liberty , a horse drawn carriage ride through the greenery of Central Park , or a shop-till-you-drop spree in world-famous stores. New York is awash with bars and eateries so it 's easy to punctuate the activity with refreshment interludes.

You should reach the corner of Merlin-Galice Road and Monument Drive in about a quarter of a mile . </tour.n.2269><tour.n.2270>The tour can be enjoyed in either direction. I 've started with the hubbub of Rome , Italy 's capital , where you can explore archaeological sites , eat long slow meals and get to know Italy at its most characteristic.

All those politics are always with that nasty politic of the " poors " and nobody do nothing for us the worker class. Every body tramp the working class , we are victims of the government and we are victim of the common criminals. All those cities like New Orleans and Misissippi are poor cities because of the high rate of crime that they have , and because most of those peoples not work and lives drom the government lika parasits No body will setup a business in an area where he will be robbed or killed . </tour.n.2274><tour.n.2275>Media behavior surrounding the whole drugs in cycling issue made talking about the end of the Tour less enjoyable for me. The more circumstantial evidence and innuendo brought forward by the anti-Armstrong media faction , the less I pay attention. Will coverage of professional cycling continue to degenerate until it is fundimentally similar to coverage of U.S. politics , where you almost have to choose who you read or watch based on their pre-conceived points-of-view ? </tour.n.2275><tour.n.2276>Little omnivores , while people are sleeping or away , can bite or tear there way into a tent in order to get to the food. At best , the food supply can be contaminated and the food can be replaced , or at worst these food destruction activities cause and end to an otherwise nice bicycle tour . </tour.n.2276><tour.n.2277>The Tour is one of the biggest events on French television each year , but it 's audience is estimated to be only 4 million daily TV viewers. That 's a 46-percent share of the French TV audience , but it 's still a fairly small group of people from a broadcast perspective . </tour.n.2277><tour.n.2278>We reserve the right to change the size or routing of the tour to meet demands for that specific day. The Bay Area is famous for the fog ! Our tours run fog , light rain or shine. We always suggest multiple layers of warm clothing for any outdoor activity. Summer afternoon temperatures can be in the 50's. Rain gear is available for those infrequent rainy days. Segways are designed to run in any weather. If seasonal fog or weather obscures the view , tour routes may be altered. You will not be charged if we cancel a tour . </tour.n.2278><tour.n.2279>In the interest of full disclosure , I must reveal that the seals in the bay are not seals at all , but sea lions ! The SEAL Tour got us close enough to see their little sea lion ears and sea lion flippers. We ' ve been had ! I won ' t hold it against the SEAL Tour , though. If it ' s actual seals you want , you can find them on the stretch of beach in La Jolla known as the Children ' s Pool. This leads to the next logical question : Now what did they do with the children ? </tour.n.2279><tour.n.2280>The training which the exchange officer receives depends , obviously , on his assignment. For example , an Air Force pilot assigned to a Navy attack or fighter squadron will complete aircrew survival training , instrument school , combat crew training ( in aircraft of the type flown by the unit ) , and carrier qualification. Of course not all exchange pilots are assigned to seagoing units; many fill billets in the Training Command or other shore-based units. Though the type and duration of training do not necessarily affect the length of the exchange tour , they do affect the length of time the officer will be in his assigned unit . </tour.n.2280><tour.n.2281>The show included in this tour should be made clear in the tour itinerary , and the cost will usually incorporate the ticket unless stated.

Cross the Channel by ferry and board your motorcoach to Paris. Your 2-night stay includes guided sightseeing that highlights the Arc d ' Triompe , Champs Elys es , and the Eiffel Tower , then free time to see more of the French capital at your own pace.

Stop in Verona to see Juliet ' s balcony , and in beautiful Venice for a canal boat ride to St. Mark ' s Square and free time to maybe try an optional gondola ride. In Florence , Cradle of the Renaissance , enjoy a guided walking tour that introduces you to Santa Croce , Piazza Signoria , Palazzo Vecchio , the Giotto Campanile and Brunelleschi Cupola in Piazza del Duomo. Admire the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa before spending two nights in the Eternal City of Rome , with included guided sightseeing featuring St. Peter ' s Square , the Roman Forum , and the mighty Colosseum . </tour.n.2286><tour.n.2287>Give your group an exclusive and intimate look into one of the Saint Louis Zoo 's oldest exhibits.

You 'll have a front row view as keepers feed several caimans , which are nocturnal crocodilians. Plus , you 'll have a chance to meet other reptiles up close and personal . </tour.n.2287><tour.n.2288>I ve written quite a bit about the fractured relations between the American riders. But as the Tour marches on its merry way to Paris , the schism is widening ... . Floyd Landis can t seem to mention the Discovery Team without dropping an f-bomb before the word " Discovery "; Levi Leipheimer is tight-lipped about the American presence , preferring to say nothing rather than speak his mind; and , Lance Armstrong has precise opinions on each of them. Some of these feelings can be chalked up to gamesmanship. Some of them have to do with being highly competitive individuals competing for the same vaunted crown. But a lot has to do with the intense and personal nature of elite cycling. These guys have spent a lot of time in the saddle together. Sometimes they just get on each other s nerves . </tour.n.2288><tour.n.2289>Each week 101 Holidays meets the boss of one of the UK ' s finest tour operators. This week we speak to Karl Watson , general manager of Inntravel , which specialises in walking , cycling and cross-country skiing holidays in the most beautiful corners of Europe . </tour.n.2289><tour.n.2290>Anyway , the longest of these bass stints was for Dylan Callaghan 's rock band Champion. Dylan somehow found a very special London , Germany vampire robot named Axel to play lead guitar. For a while there -- especially just after they finally fired me -- Champion was among the best bands in Hollywood. Then Dylan fired Axel and it all got pear-shaped , though as these things do it all turned out for the best. One way in which it turned out for the best is that Axel moved on to what he originally came to Hollywood for : Making his own special weird Brit-pop-death-love music , for the past few years in outfit called The Mere Mortals. Did you know the Mortals are going on tour with Frank Black ? Now you do . </tour.n.2290><tour.n.2291>Optional off-train tours are available in both Alice Springs and Katherine.

I do n't sell the tours and I do n't market the tours. I am hired to travel with the tour group. For example if I am doing a tour in Australia and New Zealand I meet the tour group in Los Angeles and we fly together to New Zealand. I return 3 weeks later with the group and go home. I avoid the office. Travel agents have to know computer codes , the computer programs and all that other clerical work , that 's not what we do as tour directors . </tour.n.2293><tour.n.2294>The tour begins in Stonewall , Texas where you will visit the LBJ Ranch located on the Pedernales River. Here , you will see the Texas White House  and hear all the tales of one of Texas  favorite sons , Lyndon Baines Johnson , 36th President of the United States , and former First Lady , Lady Bird Johnson. Trace the history of the Johnson family in the area , beginning with the establishment of the ranch in the 1860  s. You will also see several displays explaining life in the Hill Country and the cattle business. There  s even a chuckwagon and longhorn cattle. The park exhibits two video presentations  one about the Johnson Administration and the other concerning Mrs. Johnson  s life and achievements . </tour.n.2294><tour.n.2295>Amazon Verified Purchase ( What 's this ? ) After having just seen Genesis for the last World Tour , I could n't resist buying this CD and I was not disappointed. It is a nice compilation of the songs that they did in concert although it is not a " live " version of the concert. But as far as I can remember , they did all these songs at the concert ... </tour.n.2295><tour.n.2296>Etiquette on both the part of artists and public is also important. Artists : enjoy your visitors. Chat with them , engage them. Share a few snacks and some wine guests will stay longer and open up more. True , it ' s taxing to spend hours prepping your work and cleaning your space , then be on your feet making polite conversation all day long , but if you ' re holed up in with your art 363 days a year , the least you can do for two of those days is give the public a warm welcome. Visitors : it ' s ok to ask questions , to comment about the artwork. Studio visits are not like museum tours this is your chance to get up close with the source. Cycling and walking are the way to go in the downtown area , not just to take in the great weather , but also because parking at many artists ' studios is not meant to accommodate dozens of visitors , so save yourself the frustration. Finally , don ' t overstay your welcome and masticate all the artists ' refreshments , especially if you haven ' t said a word to your host. And everyone : have fun out there and love your local art scene ! </tour.n.2296><tour.n.2297>Kindly take a few moments to fill up the form below enabling us to give you a detailed feedback on your request.

The seafood dishes were good. We paid $ 55 per person for this trip. However , we found others had paid much less for this trip. Kangaroo Cafe offered this 3day/2night trip for about $ 45 . </tour.n.2299><tour.n.2300>After our morning tour we returned to the hotel. About half of the group wanted to visit the Apartheid Museum in the afternoon. We were told that a taxi from the hotel to the Museum would cost about $ 35USD one way. Since about 20 people from the group wanted to go to the museum , we asked the tour director if he could arrange to hire a van for the group and have the van wait at the museum to take us back to the hotel. He was able to do this for a cost of $ 25 per person . </tour.n.2300><tour.n.2301>As far as matching the multiplayer goodness of Rock Band , World Tour meets the standard a little more than halfway. There are some welcome conveniences like being able to select lefty flip before you start a song and having a four-second resume period after getting out of the pause menu during play. You can also create a bevy of characters and clothes using the sleek creation editor , with a color wheel that ' s much more user-friendly than the color selection in Rock Band , as well as create any of the four instruments and select the intro and outro animations of your characters. Though the depth of these options is only about two stores worth in Rock Band , the breadth of options is superior . </tour.n.2301><tour.n.2302>Digital photos of your Harley Davidson motorcycle tour will be emailed to you after your experience.

There was only the one Santa hat on view as Graeme Smith got into the act , but with England it looked like any other training session.

The experience factor is reflected in I-573 , sections 3-5 , which does allow reelection after a six year sabbatical in another office or station. [ 28 ] Under this provision for restarting the term limits clock at zero after six years of absence from any particular office , both the 1991 and 1992 initiatives permitted legislators to shift from one legislative position to another , eventually returning to their original post. They would simply move around in what might be called a great square route. This four corner grand tour would begin with the lower house in the state legislature , followed by the upper house; thence to the U.S. House followed by the U.S. Senate. Nothing in the law would prevent politicians from a second or third circuit and a permanent if shifting lifetime legislative career. Many steering committee speakers saw this as acceptable , even desirable. [ 29 ] </tour.n.2399><tour.n.2400>The tour spots of the next day include memorials mainly.

They are mostly interested in high-level details , but are usually engineers , so treat them as such.

With only a small group it was personal and friendly , the guide was great , very knowledgeable and friendly and very obliging taking lots of great photos for all of us at the various locations.

A great way to see the best parts of Europe in four weeks. Nice to have everything sorted - transport , accommodation , some meals. But still ample time to sightsee independently. Met lots of great people and had heaps of fun along the way - heaps of wonderful memories. My favourite place on tour was Interlaken. However there were highlights in all the cities visited.

The cluster of volcanoes that surround Myvatn has created one of the world 's most astonishing natural landscapes. Myriad fissures , craters and hot springs make this the perfect spot for a leisurely week of strolling , exploring , camping and whatever else takes your fancy. The lake itself is dotted with over fifty curious-looking islands which were formed when molten lava flowed into the water. Take a bus , bike or car and tour around the water 's edge at whatever pace suits you best then head north to the wonderful Jokulsargljufur National Park. The park is often described as " Iceland 's Grand Canyon " seemingly as a draw for wealthy American tourists but , in truth , the comparison does Jokulsargljufur no justice . </tour.n.2414><tour.n.2415>I bet Edwards flies in a priviate jet while on his poverty tour.

But to do that , they were forced to tour the U.S. as part of a package tour organized under the auspices of DJ-turned-impresario Murray the K. Booked alongside Cream ( also a new act in America ) , folkies Jim &amp;Jean , and Wilson Pickett , doing 15- or 20-minute sets five shows a day , the group got the exposure they needed to push the song onto AM radio , and finally become known to a wider public , even though " Happy Jack " was a totally atypical Who song , with its emphasis on harmony singing and its relatively restrained guitar part -- the band found itself in a situation amazingly similar to that of their mod audience rivals the Small Faces , who broke through in America around the same time with " Itchycoo Park , " a song that was completely unrepresentative of their usual sound . </tour.n.2440><tour.n.2441>I have researched in great detail how other companies perceive the island and I have to say , even though the famous Costa Smeralda and Costa Rei are undoubtedly gorgeous they do n't paint a full picture of what the island is really like. To get the best overall view , you have to explore the island , probably having a three-centre holiday and I was quite lucky to find that our trip was more of a pilgrimage around the island than a whistle-stop tour ! Inland is where I feel you find real Sardinia , especially around the Gennargentu National Park on the Eastern side , as you will find towns that tourism has n't heard of , like Oliena.

However , on the Tour I did manage to encounter a few nice examples , which have not liquefied just yet. This was the most southerly I saw , located at the edge of the Canal Beagle , and flowing down from the Cordillera Darwin , in extreme southern Chile. At that low latitude temperature and precipitation both seem to be adequate to maintain such ice for now. However , with thawing already occurring in Antarctica , even farther south , that is by no means a certainty . </tour.n.2443><tour.n.2444>After wolfing down lunch ( this is tiring you know moving about all of the time ! ) we had the time for a quick tour of what ' s on offer here and I wish we ' d had more . </tour.n.2444><tour.n.2445>Bridge on the River Kwai ( 9 hours ) Fascinating , nostalgic and memorable sums up this full day tour to the Kanchanaburi province , outside of Bangkok.

Is there something inherent to the object itself , or is this definition dependent solely on the gaze of the viewer ? Furthermore , if this is the case , then could one not always be on tour even on her home street ?

Robert Jan already was a well-known keyboard player in the Netherlands , having played in Supersister , the Golden Earring , Sweet d'Buster , Transister and several solo projects.

Daniel Burnham ' s legendary World 's Columbian Exposition of 1893 was dubbed the White City for marvels including the debut of the first Ferris wheel and was reputedly the inspiration for writer Frank L. Baum ' s vision of Oz. Dr. H. H. Holmes , arguably America 's first serial killer , confessed before his execution , " I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer , no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing. " Just blocks from Burnham ' s masterpiece , Holmes , a lifelong swindler and womanizer , designed his own building in Englewood that became a hotel for the fair. Holmes lured young women to the site , known as the Murder Castle , where he tortured and killed them. Holmes ultimately confessed to 28 such crimes but estimates put the death toll as high as 200.

The only guarantee we can give you is that all of the places we visit on this tour are still haunted and they continue to have a lot of paranormal activity ! ! ! </tour.n.2701><tour.n.2702>One question that tour guides are frequently asked is : how do you guys keep up the enthusiasm to keep going back to the same places ? One retort that readily springs to mind is , if you return again and again to a place like Caraj s , about what can one complain ? Lying between the Xingu and the Tocantins rivers , the Serra dos Caraj s sports the largest open-cast mines in the world and one of the richest avian biodiversities on the planet , 590 species and counting ( our trip yielded not one , not two , but seven species new to that list ) .

I can ' t tell whether that ' s a provocative statement or not; just a thought I had during my tour of Petco Park. The home of the Padres was the groundbreaker in downtown San Diego ' s neo-renaissance in the early part of the century ( opening in 2004 ) . It ' s another impressive landmark here in San Diego , and as with many of the attractions here , the closer you look , the more impressive it is . </tour.n.2708><tour.n.2709>But the race remains a compelling spectacle.

The deal guarantees blanket live coverage every day of the Tour as well as associated programming across France , making it an extremely valuable event for French consumer-targeted companies to be associated with . </tour.n.2709><tour.n.2710>Without making any excuses since the Riley Rendezvous Tour in October / November last year life seems to have been a hectic roller coaster ride. Maybe the restoration of my two Sunbeams , a Mk1 Jaguar , a trip to the UK to collect my Brother-in-law ' s Riley TT Sprite , two National and one World Sailing Championship and a young family has something to do with it but mainly it is work that seems to have got in the way ! </tour.n.2710><tour.n.2711>Join us for an Evening of fine food , song and dance along with a guided tour of the Distillery and a complimentary Jameson drink.

I carry all of my " valuables " in the handlebar bag and so keep it with me 100 of the time no matter where I am. This bag , however , is not really designed or built for lengthy tours , and so began to wear out rather quickly. Because of its importance , and the dearth of suitable replacements to be found out in the field , I attempted to keep it going with constant repairs. Those included too many zipper replacements to count , and many fabric/epoxy patches over worn spots in the original fabric. In the latter Stages the worn out appearance of the bag , which by then had essentially more patched areas than original material visible , constantly revealed my status as a long-term traveler , and as such was the initiator of many conversations . </tour.n.2741><tour.n.2742>Unlike most adventure packages , these trips can begin any day of the week allowing travelers to start the trip when it best fits into their schedule.

The BlackBerry Curve 8900 features this display and while larger , the BlackBerry Storm does as well. The Bold seems like an outcast as it ' s the only BlackBerry to utilize a 480 320 resolution LCD. Personal preference aside ( I like the resolution of 480 320 better ) , the BlackBerry Tour ' s screen is nothing short of stunning. It ' s not a huge panel but it packs a punch. Colors are rich , there ' s a great amount of contrast yet not too much , and text and graphics look as sharp as ever. Additionally it looks like there ' s a harder plastic covering the LCD than there is on the Bold and 8900 and this is a good thing , people. It feels solid , not scratch-prone and is a display that we ' re proud RIM has transitioned to as their standard screen for the Tour and other BlackBerry handsets to come. There ' s that pesky black bezel around the LCD but it ' s a minor annoyance and not a big deal . </tour.n.2914><tour.n.2915>Woodrow Wilson House Museum 2340 S St. NW Washington , DC 20008 Phone : ( 202 ) 387-4062 Fax : ( 202 ) 483-1466 Description : Washington 's only presidential museum.

Dee was sound asleep in the back , and Vince was dozing off too. That left Mark and me , beady-eyed , concentrating , him driving , me navigating and trying to stay awake. Any thoughts of drifting off were soon thrown out the window when we almost went off the road after passing a truck. I do n't know how , but Mark kept us on the road somehow ... it was one of those moments when you just feel time stop , you know. The next thing I remember , Vince and Dee are going " what the fuck was that ? " and we 're laughing , Mark and I ... do n't even know why. Apparently The Low 's van also experienced a near-mishap. We were very , very happy to leave Minnesota . </tour.n.2969><tour.n.2970>Retief Goosen took an important step toward rejoining the elite in golf yesterday by closing with a 1-under-par 70 for a one-shot victory in the Transitions Championship in Palm Harbor , Fla. , his first PGA Tour win in nearly four years . </tour.n.2970><tour.n.2971>Kumuka made my European experience an adventure I will never forget.

However , George Hincapie won the prologue and Lance Armstrong finished fifth , so that ca n't hurt . </tour.n.2972><tour.n.2973>No matter how well-crafted these features are , they all boil down to gameplay based on a swinging club - the one thing the game ca n't do. To misquote Twain : " PGA Tour 07 is a good franchise spoilt. " [ Apr 2007 , p.46 ] </tour.n.2973><tour.n.2974>Tour availability is limited , especially during the summer months. Tours are provided on a first-come-first-served basis ... .Click here for more details ... </tour.n.2974><tour.n.2975>Some stoves are designed for high heat output to more or less boil water quickly; these same stoves can not be used or used very well to perform low heat functions , like to keep a cooked meal warm over a period of time , to simmer. On longer tours , good cooks like to start experimenting. If you have a cook that experiments in the kitchen ( first of all , be thankful ) , get a stove with good control at low flame settings; usually propane systems are better at low heat settings . </tour.n.2975><tour.n.2976>All passengers traveling on Kesari 's Tours must be in possession of a valid visa.

Brian &amp;Gordon were also fantastic as our guides . </tour.n.2978><tour.n.2979>Not surprising for a conference conducted online , participants discussed the role of Internet in ecotourism development , particularly in marketing and promotion. Participants agreed that , particularly in this niche market of ecotourism and responsible travel , websites play an important role in developing consumer awareness and environmental education. Several website directors explained their operations. Of note were suggestions of how travelers could review the tour operators on the web , enforcing the standards of the operators. Other sites encourage a regional dialogue among stakeholders. Participants also noted that improved access and training will be necessary to " bridge the digital divide " as many parts of the world are less wired than others . </tour.n.2979><tour.n.2980>We stayed here for one night on a whistle stop tour of Agra , we arrived late in the evening without a booking and were accommodated promptly with a double toom.

As far as equipment was concerned , my nemeses for the Tour were the numerous zippers installed on just about everything. At one point I counted the number I had along , and between my clothes , camping gear and bike bags , there were thirty-six. That would not be such a big deal , except that just about all of the ones that received more that occasional use failed at one point or another along the way. Though I discovered that they could sometimes be rejuvenated by carefully compressing the zipper-pulls with a pair of pliers , that rarely extended their life for very long. The Nobel Prize should be given to anyone who can devise a better device to accomplish the same task . </tour.n.2983><tour.n.2984>Photography on Tour Occasionally , Tauck will use photographs taken by fellow guests or your Tauck Director on your tour for promotional purposes.

Your Tour Director will provide the most up-to-date information while on tour . </tour.n.2988><tour.n.2989>The first and most obvious measure is to better track the productivity of tour series over time in order to obtain a better indication of how existing capacity is used and possibly abused. If a tour series has only delivered 50 per cent of bed nights block booked over two years , there is no significant reason to believe that it will produce higher bookings in a third year . </tour.n.2989><tour.n.2990>All our Tours are escorted by well trained , knowledgeable guides , certified by the Tourism Council of Bhutan.

Our tour guide went above and beyond to provide us with all the information needed to navigate and enjoy all the cities we visited. Only spending a couple of nights in a new city can be difficult , needing time to figure out how to find everything , but our tour guide ensured that all our time was well spent. The optional tours were all reasonably priced and very enjoyable. The atmosphere on the bus was fantastic - I loved hearing our day song each morning as we set off to a new destination !

Once you pass his house and cross the Illinois River , the road starts uphill fairly quickly. It may or may not be passable , and under the best of circumstances is not a trip for the faint of heart in a passenger car. The road to the deposit ( after the bridge ) is about 2 miles long. The actual deposit is on the east flank of the ridge , so you have to go all the way up. When you finally get to the ridge , turn back to the south and continue up the ridge to the deposit. It 's well worth the time , and the walk is n't all that bad.

They are probably the most popular tires with tourists today , and many of the others I met who were using them did not seem to have the issues that I did , so perhaps I just had bad luck. Discussing them is complicated by the fact that the construction of the tires was changed twice recently , so the type I used when the Tour began are not the best available now. The original tires I used were wire-beaded , whereas the newer models are folding. There was also a change in the listed sizes with the newer models which caused me considerable trouble and confusion when I tried to order more . </tour.n.3208><tour.n.3209>Peta - our tour leader - was fantastic.

After that 's done , only 500 points will separate Nos. 1 and 2. In fact , the No. 1 seed is only 1 , 875 points ahead of No. 10 and 7 , 930 points up on the last player who makes the Playoffs. With a Playoff win worth 11 , 000 points for the first three events and 12 , 500 at THE TOUR Championship presented by Coca-Cola , there could be a lot of volatility . </tour.n.3212><tour.n.3213>Traversing the wilds of western China , this spec- tacular overland 1000km+ tour takes you into Sichuan through the mountainous back door from Qinghai.

Another factor is that units realize that they 've spent almost a year , and look back at what they 've done.

Okay , here are most of the groups related to the RI , organized as best as I can do without a three-dimensional graph. I 'm sure I 've missed a few , so just let me know and I 'll add things. I tried to include anything that might come up on a tour ( so , notably , there are very few details regarding the REC or ICES on this list ) , </tour.n.3256><tour.n.3257>It 's too bad , because On Tour is a good first effort , and a lot of the pieces are in place. The loading times are quite tolerable , the game looks very good , and a few hiccups aside , the framerate is rock solid. The only things that prevent it from feeling like a true SSX game are minor control issues and major course design flaws. But as with anyone who starts out snowboarding , the learning process can be tough -- there are high hopes for next season 's snow . </tour.n.3257><tour.n.3258>This tour is a great way to discover Alice Springs at your leisure and choose the attractions you ' d most like to see.

The 70 minute shuttle loop allows enough time for you to get off to visit two attractions.

We drove to Bourg d'Oisans , the nearest town to Alpe d'Huez , from our hotel in Voreppe which is just north of Grenoble. We got up quite early to drive 50 kilometers up the mountain road from Grenoble. When we got to Bourg d'Oisans , we were able to park along the road known as Avenue de la gare , also known as National Route 91 , facing back toward Grenoble for a quick get away after the stage was over . </tour.n.3259><tour.n.3260>The Indian Paintings Tour ( 1 1/2 hour approx. ) journeys through the Kaibab National Forest to an historical site of Native American predecessors.

They must have fantastic communication skills as well as be mature and responsible. Adventure tour leaders should be extremely organized , have a lot of self-confidence , and be skilled at hiking , camping , boating , horseback riding , mountain climbing , bungee jumping , or some other adventurous activity. They also need to be safety-conscious , and know some first aid. A good adventure tour leader will be a logical thinker , who can react to difficult situations calmly and professionally. Some skills with another language is also beneficial . </tour.n.3278><tour.n.3279> Competitive archery requires extended periods of intense concentration , Morehead said. Many times , shoots last four or five hours , and you have to be focused each time you step up to shoot. It is mentally taxing. When that arrow leaves your hand , you know , before it hits the target , whether it was a good shot or not. That same feeling applies to fishing. Like I said earlier , each time my boat left the dock this year , it was like that arrow leaving the bow on a good shot; I just knew I was going to catch fish. Out of 18 tournament days this year ( on the FLW Tour ) , I weighed in 85 bass out of a possible 90. That ' s about 95 percent in the bull ' s-eye. </tour.n.3279><tour.n.3280>Unlike many others , this tour emphasizes more time exploring outside the coach.

Campus tour guides work in the Visitor Center and give daily tours of the campus. Weekend work also required . </tour.n.3281><tour.n.3282>Tour guides are one of the key front-line players in the tourism industry. Tour guides can play a key role in making tourism sustainable. They have the ability to transform the behaviour of tourists. A tour guide can be seen as a mediator or cultural broker between tourists and local people. While travelling in non-Western countries tour guides often face with problems and conflict situations. For example tourists make a lot of pictures of local people and in some cultures it can be experienced as a real shock. Another example might be that tourists break the code of ethics and enter a mosque in shorts and T-shirt. They don ' t take into account the local norms and values. Tourists often don ' t know better , because they have not enough insight in the culture of that country . </tour.n.3282><tour.n.3283>Since Robson has been to see the Tour in Europe this year and returned to the U.S. before it ended , I think the insights he provided are pretty unique . </tour.n.3283><tour.n.3284>There is a $ 3.95 processing fee per order. This is a flat fee regardless of the number of tickets or tours purchased on an order . </tour.n.3284><tour.n.3285>Cycling authorities , who have been criticised and praised in equal measure for their response to the epidemic , believe they have systems in place to weed out the cheats. According to Amaury Sport Organisation ( ASO ) , promoters of the Tour , three positive tests during the race last year represented evidence that the regulatory system is working. Others , however , believe it is continuing evidence that the drugs problem is out of control . </tour.n.3285><tour.n.3286>The claim against Qantas Travel was discontinued before the hearing.The Tribunal found that the accommodation in the French Riviera was too far away from the beaches , being 30 kms away , and that the accommodation in the Dordogne was not close to services promised being in the next valley. Trafalgar Tours was ordered to pay compensation for the equivalent of two days of the tour for each of Mr &amp;Mrs Young , a total of $ 780 because the accommodation provided was not reasonably equivalent and that breach by Trafalgar Tours of the tour contract was not excused by the booking conditions allowing for substitution of reasonably equivalent accommodation . </tour.n.3286><tour.n.3287>His temper has been a topic throughout his 13-plus years on the PGA Tour , particularly his language. Tom Watson sent Woods a letter last summer about his cursing , urging him to knock it off. Watson shared those thoughts earlier this month in Dubai when he said Woods has not carried the same stature as the greats who came before him , such as Jack Nicklaus , Arnold Palmer and Byron Nelson . </tour.n.3287><tour.n.3288>Part of tour managers ' earnings may be commission-based and they may also receive tips. Board and lodgings during the tour are usually provided by the company. Tour operators may pay transport costs for managers to meet and leave tours . </tour.n.3288><tour.n.3289>This enticing 1000km+ overland adventure takes you from south- west China into Tibet through some of China 's most visually spectacular scenery.

All accommodation , transport , sightseeing and entrance fees for sites noted as 'visited ' in the detailed itinerary. Services of a full time Tour Leader and local guide support in some locations . </tour.n.3291><tour.n.3292>While it was great to visit all the LOST sites and see where it all happened , we feel that the guide should have 'set the scene ' a little better at the start and before arriving at each venue with more development of the plot. It would have been good to have had some questions that enthused us to provide our postulates about the happenings in each series. However the venues we visited were great - it was really good to go to each one and share in some of the atmosphere. The tour agenda was well prepared though some more sites on the South shore need to be included too. The van was very comfortable and well appointed , better than some of the other tour vans we experienced too . </tour.n.3292><tour.n.3293>From Sydney , travel to Ayers Rock - the heart of Australia.

The awe-inspiring waterfalls of Khone Phapheng are known as the Niagara of the East ' for being the largest waterfalls in Southeast Asia . </tour.n.3299><tour.n.3300>Many geologists call this volcanic layer of ophiolite stratigraphy the " pillow basalt " layer. This refers to the spherical shapes which are commonly formed as basaltic magma is squeezed onto the seafloor. A thin crust cools as the lava erupts into the water , more lava is pushed out behind , and it kind of blows up like a balloon. This cooled crust is often glassy and brittle , and tends to break off , forming angular fragments which fill in around the bulk of countless individual pillows. These broken fragments are called by one of several different names depending on local conditions ( which we wo n't worry about at this stage of the discussion ) . Names can include epiclastic breccia , hyaloclastite breccia , or the more general term " inter-pillow breccia , " which , in the interest of simplicity , will be used on our tour . </tour.n.3300><tour.n.3301>Awesome tour ! We spent the day with a private guide who took us to many of the LOST filming sights. Tom provided transportation , commentary , raingear , and even sustenance during the day. He offered history and information on Hawaii , LOST background and predictions , juicy gossip about the show and delicious local food. We got to see actual photos from the show , taken in the spots we were standing ! We even found the current filming location. Watching LOST is totally different now -- we 've been there ! We 'd love to do it again and bring our LOST friends . </tour.n.3301><tour.n.3302>Copyright 2000-2010 Robert Broad Travel ( Lichfield ) Ltd. / Broad Horizons Marketing Ltd.

We spent the morning at pier 39 eating lunch at the Crab Hut. In the afternoon we took one of the city tours where we took the first of our dozens of photos of the Golden Gate bridge.

By showing foreign wholesalers and / or retailers that there is comparable accommodation in the vicinity , though possibly less well known , it will make it easier for the local operator to justify alternatives to the foreign entity. Both stand to lose for want of alternatives. This would need to go hand in hand with conformity of category standards and grading . </tour.n.3307><tour.n.3308>Comments : My ability to sleep well when camping really increased when I started using this pad. However , since it is inflatable , thorns , and other sharp objects , were a constant concern. Because it is made with inelastic polyurethane , patches hold very well , so punctures were easy to fix. Patches could also be affected with various types of elastic glues or rubber cements , covered by a piece of thick tape. Those improvised repairs did not last as long as the patches that originally came with the pad , and so towards the end of the Tour , I had a tough time keeping the pad inflated . </tour.n.3308><tour.n.3309>1832 , " surroundings , environment , " picked up by De Quincey from Fr. entourage , from O.Fr. entour " that which surrounds , " from en- " in " + tour " a circuit " ( see tour ) .

It started out with wind sounds. The percussion and bass started out the tune , soon followed by the hawaiian sounds. The melody was played by Michiel on the guitar. The structure of the song was the same as the album version. All in all , a rather weird , but interesting song choice by the band . </tour.n.3312><tour.n.3313>On-site enrolling method through " outdoor office " had been used to enroll examinees since the establishment of the Center.

This hard-hitting memoir by a young veteran of the 2003 Iraq war portrays a failed system of military leadership that exposed infantrymen to pointless risks as their mission became increasingly unclear. Crawford joined the Florida National Guard before 9/11 for the tuition benefits , then found himself unexpectedly shipped to Kuwait. Scarcity of men and materials meant that his unit 's tour of duty was continually being extended , yet they were not given the tools to do the job. Crawford 's writing captures the brusque camaraderie and profanity-laced talk of soldiers , while his literary prose brings these harsh scenes to life . </tour.n.3329><tour.n.3330>Expert in Vietnam travel services , Thailand &amp;Cambodia tours , Chin bike tours , Yantze cruise , Vietnam festivals , Yunnan trekking tour , Vietnam , China , Laos , Cambodia , Thai Minority Ethnic Culture tours.

This year , more than ever. With the whole of Paris to choose from , it feels a poor introduction to the centenary of France 's premier sports event : a building with the scale and ambiance of an aircraft hangar and about as French as Mars and cut off from most of the population.

Phrases like " optimization " , " stabilization " , and " modified Kalman filter " do n't mean anything to these people. Hit only the highest level of details , or you 'll lose them. Beware answering highly detailed questions of one member of the tour , since you can bore the rest of the tour to tears. You can sometimes deal with those questions by telling that person to talk to you after the tour. In order of preference , show them : things that move , things that they can touch , things that you can touch , and videos. Stick to cute anecdotes rather than scientific minutiae. These are often the hardest tours to give , so I 've tried to mention good things for these tours at the various tour stops . </tour.n.3338><tour.n.3339>Support acts Kiss , John Hammond.

I loved having things like transport , accommodation and some meals arranged but also loved the freedom of being able to do our own thing for dinner etc where and when we ended up at the end of the day. The information Susan our Tour Leader gave was valuable and know we would not have gotten this on our own or on other tours ( we know people who have gone on other tours and didnt get half the information we got ) . Kevin our Tour Driver was such a lovely and kind man and at the end of my tour highlighted on my map for me the journey we took.

There are reasons that everyone in Armstrong 's inner circle uses a Blackberry , and you 'll learn some of them by reading this book. One of the key insights into how the team motivates itself is that Armstrong 's perception of the advantage gained by his use of technology is more important than the actual advantage.

The wealthiest aristocrats would have their private wagons for instance shipped to Greece , where they would travel in a slow and sumptuous convoy that included a huge retinue of chefs , slaves , and secretaries. These rich tourists would dine in silk-curtained tents set up each night as dining halls , eat off plates of beaten gold , and sleep in luxurious carrucae dormitoriae ( sleeping carriages ) . The very richest and most powerful of travelers - several Roman emperors enjoyed the Grand Tour - often required years of preparatory work as entire buildings ( notably baths ) would be erected in anticipation of their visit. Whenever an emperor passed through a city it was nearly bankrupted by the massive expenses in entertaining him and his retinue . </tour.n.3510><tour.n.3511>They also wanted a good deal.

" </tour.n.4287><tour.n.4288>Another QWERTY review ? You bet. A true mashup of the BlackBerry Bold and BlackBerry Curve 8900 keys , the BlackBerry Tour offers a great compromise. The keys aren ' t as mushy as the Bold keys , they ' re a little harder and a little clackier , something found on the 8900. As far as size goes , they ' re roughly 20 larger than the 8900 ' s keys and are nicely sculpted. We ' ve found the best and most efficient way to type on the Tour is not to press on an entire key but on the angled area of a key. This let ' s you pound through emails with relative ease and doesn ' t really let your finger hit more than one key a time. The BlackBerry Tour keyboard is a keyboard you ' d come to expect from RIM simple , easy to use , and perfectly laid out. It ' s a winner . </tour.n.4288><tour.n.4289>4 ) With about 3 days left after the Halong bay tour , what other places that do not require much travelling can we visit ?

The 3 x 5 km caldera was formed in several stages about 1500 years ago and during the 18th century; eruptions have also originated from the lengthy East and SW rift zones , which extend to the sea on both sides of the volcano. About 90 of the surface of the basaltic shield volcano is formed of lava flows less than about 1100 years old; 70 of the volcano 's surface is younger than 600 years. A long-term eruption from the East rift zone that began in 1983 has produced lava flows covering more than 100 sq km , destroying nearly 200 houses and adding new coastline to the island of Hawaii , which can be seen from the air on a Maui Air Hawaiian Volcano Air Tour . </tour.n.4482><tour.n.4483>This year 's version of Tiger Woods PGA Tour is as sweet as a 350 yard tee shot down the middle of the fairway.

The extra flights mentioned above brought my total air-distance for the Tour to 23 , 600 km , slightly more than double what I had hoped it would be. My emissions from those extra flights alone added up to at least 1 , 700 kg of CO2. Combined with the other two causes mentioned above , I probably overshot my goal of being carbon neutral for the Tour by a fair amount. The extra emissions will require five to ten new trees to be planted and allowed to reach maturity. It is another goal of mine to one day reforest a previously denuded parcel of land in order to counteract my lifetime emissions , and I must now , unfortunately , add those trees to the count in order to do so. I hope that in any future tours I may undertake I will be able to do better . </tour.n.4487><tour.n.4488>Blokus World Tour also offers a first for Blokus fans : the ability to play in tour mode and take part in 10 different Blokus tournaments around the world , beginning in Japan.

When it comes to customization , you drummers out there are an afterthought -- guitarists can choose their instrument , but not you. Also , when you 're playing drums , the bottom row of keys ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) stand in for the kick-drum , which is represented in the game by a horizontal purple line that floats at you along with the notes. I played several songs in the drummer 's mode , where the kick-drum line helped keep the game interesting . </tour.n.4604><tour.n.4605>The Pentagon conducts two kinds of tours for the general public , walk-in tours and group tours. Both tours are free and are conducted Monday through Friday. Tours are not conducted on weekends or federal holidays . </tour.n.4605><tour.n.4606>The Guitar Grip has an adjustable hand strap too. Strumming is done by simply dragging either the guitar pick stylus that is provided or your usual stylus across the screen with the guitar displayed. The amount of detail included is pretty remarkable , in that each different string of the on-screen guitar will move in correspondence to the fret button that is being held down. Unfortunately , the peripheral DOES become rather painful to use in prolonged sessions of the game , although several health warnings are issued before playing so it ' s really the user ' s fault should they experience cramps. Guitar Hero : On Tour offers several modes of play , all of which are very enjoyable. The first and most obvious is the career mode , in which players can choose a character , customise their look ( after unlocking or purchasing costumes , of course ) and choose a guitar to rock out with. Upon choosing a prospective rock star , players can move through each venue , completing a set of four songs and an encore to progress to the next venue. In Guitar Duels mode , players can play through single player but each song is a battle , similar to the boss battles in the recent Guitar Hero 3 . </tour.n.4606><tour.n.4607>I chose Kumuka after speaking to a travel agent who had just come back from a Kumuka tour.

Also , if you 're planning your first tour , it 's probably best not to opt for a 31-day grand tour of Europe no matter how enticing the itinerary sounds. Start small , with a tour that lasts no more than two weeks and takes in as few destinations as possible.

I only saw this statement shown once as Joe said at the end of the interview ( the last 10 seconds ) I have an older person living with me ( as he pointed toward his house ) and he said " I do n't believe in Social Security ! " Then he was cut off. I have never seen this clip again. Why did n't Obama supporters push this part of the interview ? It has to be somewhere - it was shown either on CNN or MSNBC the first day he was made a person of interest. This would blow McCain 's Plumber Bus Tour off the road ! I thought this plumber business would blow over and did n't point it out sooner. Who could help with this ? ? ? </tour.n.4624><tour.n.4625>Light Work understands that learning , especially in the art world , thrives with the opportunity to step outside of the classroom.

Probably not at its best in the autumn , when it 's too cold to swim in the Pacific but not cold enough to go skiing in the surrounding mountains , I kept myself busy with visiting a couple of cousins I have out there , who were incredulous that I had taken the week off work to watch Canadian Football. Following a couple of days of mooching around , we turned up at BC Place for the game between the BC Lions and the Calgary Stampeders , the closest the Lions get to a local derby. It was n't quite the contest we were hoping for , with the Stampeders never looking back after a couple of early touchdowns and romping away to a 40-point victory . </tour.n.4627><tour.n.4628>Take a morning or afternoon tour of the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel - and jump the queue by booking ahead.

After a few days the grass under the platforms will die and the green will settle into the landscape. If a less then perfect soil setting is chosen a 1 " base of crushed shell followed by a 1/2 " of sand will create a very solid base for the platforms.

The panels are designed to flow over the existing or created contours of the yard but on a flat surface the green will putt dead straight . </tour.n.4789><tour.n.4790>With Glide Tour full-motion narrated virtual tours they can now walk through entire properties as if they were actually on the property walking and listening to an agent.

The afternoon is give over to an ostentatious display of wealth : he shoes Daisy his extensive collection of British antiques and takes her on a tour of his wardrobe; Gatsby himself is dressed in gold and silver. His Gothic mansion is described as looking like the citadel of a feudal lord. Nearly everything in the house is imported from England ( the scene in which Gatsby shows Daisy his piles of English shirts is one of the most famous scenes in American literature ) . Fitzgerald implies that Gatsby is attempting to live the life of a European aristocrat in the New World of America. This , Fitzgerald suggests , is a misguided anachronism : America committed itself to progress and equality in abandoning the old aristocracy. To go back to such rigidly defined class distinctions would be retrograde and barbaric as is implied by the fact that the major proponent of such ideas is Tom Buchanan , who is clearly a cretin and a brute . </tour.n.4800><tour.n.4801>Day 1 Cairo - Free Day.

Nowhere is it writ that PGA TOUR golf must be classic " essential " golf. Why can not the PGA TOUR , if it wishes , promote a new game , with distinctive rules ( much as the American League promotes a game of baseball in which the pitcher 's turn at the plate can be taken by a " designated hitter " ) ? If members of the public do not like the new rules-if they feel that these rules do not truly test the individual 's skill at " real golf " ( or the team 's skill at " real baseball " ) they can withdraw their patronage. But the rules are the rules. They are ( as in all games ) entirely arbitrary , and there is no basis on which anyone-not even the Supreme Court of the United States-can pronounce one or another of them to be " nonessential " if the rulemaker ( here the PGA TOUR ) deems it to be essential . </tour.n.4999><tour.n.5000>... words , there is some way to go.

Had I terminated my duty with the Navy at this point , I would never have experienced the rapport and intimate association with Naval aviation that I now enjoy. I applied for and received per-mission from the Air Force to extend my tour with the Navy for one year. I wanted to make the combat cruise purely for selfish reasons : First , I wanted to complete my Southeast Asia tour. Second , the ship in which we were to embark was the USS Intrepid ( CVS-11 ) . This is a small ship , called a 27 Charley class , and one of the few remaining that still has a wooden deck.

Today he meets the press , in modest mood. 'Hopefullly I will earn the yellow jersey at some point in the next three weeks , ' he admits , which is akin to Muhammad Ali saying how pleasant it would be to spar better than that nice Mr Foreman. Since 2001 , when Armstrong first brought personal bodyguards to the Tour , they have always turned heads : that year 's was a kickboxing expert; 2002 's was rumoured to have worked for George W Bush. In 2003 , reflecting the international situation , but belying the fact that in France the public are usually well disposed towards him , he has six gards de corps : Bush 's ex , and a burly team mechanic , plus a further four provided by the race organisers.

As ever on the tour we were up early ( often by 6 ) and headed over to the desert region of Huacachina. I had not realised that Peru had such a diversity of ecosystems , stretching from the Amazon rainforest over the mighty Andes and then into the desert regions the other side. Here , wind is rare and rain almost non-existent. While much of the region is simply a bare rocky landscape in Huacachina there are proper sand dunes. Once you have passed the first few dunes the area is totally silent and there is no sign of life. What does one do in such a serine environment ? - But of course hire a V8 dune buggy and go on a roller coaster ride over the dunes. This was awesome fun and even better we would stop from time to time and sand board down the dunes. Initially we tried to board properly but this was hard so quickly we all ended up lying face down on the board and seeing how fast we could go - quite fast on the bigger , steeper , dunes it turns out . </tour.n.5052><tour.n.5053>Spend the morning recovering from last night ' s welcome party or begin exploring the streets , shops , and pubs of Belfast.

Out of that sum , £ 54 : 6 : 7d was expended on such items as transport , type-writer , stationery , telegrams , food and drinks , etc. One may reasonably assume that the balance of £ 25 : 13 : 5d was held against the second lap of the tour , i.e. , Northern and eastern Provinces. Unfortunately , there is no record in file showing a statement of expenditure in respect of this part of the tour. In any case , it seems that the total expenditure for the whole tour did not amount to anything near the £ 200 previously earmarked by the Council for the purpose . </tour.n.5056><tour.n.5057>movie ( 333 discussions ) reynaldo ... stephen caffrey terence knox tour of duty tv series ( 935 discussions ) vietnam ( 8 discussions ) war ( 32 discussions ) </tour.n.5057><tour.n.5058>ABC television stations across the country will run local promotions.

They make sure no one gets lost or separated from the group. They also watch clients to make sure they follow tour rules. In museums , for example , guides make sure visitors do not touch the paintings. On the tour , they tell visitors about the sites they are seeing. They answer visitors ' questions and recommend additional sites for them to see.

Such a narrative approach highlights the complexities of conflicting interpretations , agency , and cultural property rights. For example , the history of Elmina Castle in Ghana spans five hundred years. People coming to engage with it bring different narratives. These narratives are not completely compatible in the sense that different people want and need different things from the site. Should the castle be a source of income for Ghanaians , a spiritual marker for diaspora blacks , or a museum of British colonialsm ?

In ancient times Tikal functioned mainly as a ceremonial centre in which the aristocratic elite and their priests ruled , dictated , and directed the activities of the architects , builders , craftsmen , and labourers. All endeavours in the region of Tikal were directed to enhance the city , to glorify the gods , to amass wealth , and to acquire tribute for the ruling upper strata of society.

For each song , an extended guitar neck is shown vertically scrolling down the screen , with specific frets ( that ' s the circle things in the screenshots ) moving towards the player. The colour and position corresponds to a button on your Guitar Grip. The Guitar Grip is entirely unique to the Guitar Hero : On Tour , but more on this accessory later. Notes are played by holding down the correct fret button and " strumming " once the fret hits the bottom of the screen in order to successfully play the note. A successful note will increase the rock meter , while an unsuccessful one will decrease it. Completely decreasing the rock meter from green to orange / yellow to red will result in a fail of the song and the character being booed off the stage . </tour.n.5412><tour.n.5413>Begin this tour in the morning to visit some of Jogja ' s favorites in the town.

I had no idea what their durability would be before I started , but the first set lasted a fairly impressive 63 , 000 km , and its replacement for the remainder of the tour , a result that I was satisfied with. The first pair was worn down to the point of almost disappearing when I finally replaced them , however. The one issue I discovered was the bearing cartridge acting as the only thing holding the pedal body onto the spindle. That is fine when the pedal is new , but as soon as there is even the slightest amount of play in the body , the bearings will fail rather quickly. I overcame this by putting an extra washer on the outboard side of the bearing ( the washer that comes with a set of Shimano Ultegra brake pads is the perfect size. ) The extra thickness of that allowed dirt and water to enter the pedal body , but it did n't seem to matter as , with the added washer , the pedal could still be used even after the bearing cartridge had completely disintegrated . </tour.n.5478><tour.n.5479>Personally , I was shocked when I saw Tyler Hamilton climb into the van. He was able to survive the entire 2003 Tour with a collar bone fractured in two places , yet he could n't climb effectively in this Tour with a lower back injury.

Although it simply isn ' t fair to compare Guitar Hero III ' s 73 songs to On Tour ' s 26 , it ' s a bit disconcerting to see that many of the songs are songs that people wouldn ' t find " guitar centric " nor what fans of the original series would really want to be playing. That being said , On Tour is probably the most diverse of the set lists that the series creators have given us yet. What ' s most surprising though , is the sheer quality of the music for a DS game.

The ultramafic portion of the Josephine Ophiolite is no exception , and has undergone partial to locally complete " serpentinization. " This is a true metamorphic process , with the fundamental mineralogical change converting the olivine and pyroxene into various members of the asbestos family. This process generally involves the addition of water into the mineral lattices , with a corresponding increase in the overall volume of the rock. This enlargement requires some amazing efforts by the serpentine to fit more stuff into the same space , and results in extensive shearing and internal deformation of the rock. We 'll see lots of serpentine on the tour , and I 'm sure that you will grow to have the same deep feeling for it that I have developed over the years . </tour.n.5517><tour.n.5518>A whistle-stop tour is an expression used to refer to political campaigns , especially in the United States after World War II , where candidates covered a vast amount of territory in a train , at a fast pace , in order to bring their message to the public.

While the guides were very helpful and friendly - the tour aspect was a bit weaker , it was not always possible to hear the commentary and the commentary could have been more detailed. if you want a great fun day out trying something new , give the segway tour a whirl , if your priority is learning about dc maybe pick a different tour . </tour.n.5547><tour.n.5548>Larger tour groups can however offer good value for money as the organiser 's fixed costs can be spread amongst a larger number of travellers , and you do get the benefit of a guide to show you around ( as best they can ) .

In this case they were looking for gold. The Monumental was never a big producer , and it is currently inactive. There was some limited exploration during the early 1980 's while the major push was on at the Turner-Albright , and I spent some time here in the early 1990 's , but none of these programs were successful in defining additional reserves. But whatever may be found in the future , any production decision would probably be clouded by the Monumental 's inclusion in the Smith River National Recreation Area . </tour.n.5563><tour.n.5564>I completely agree with you David.

Their only problem , the rain flooding issue , was overcome by my talented mother , who had made some nifty transparent vinyl rain covers for the computer. That solved the problem , as long as I remembered to use them. Unfortunately , on one occasion in Madagascar when I did not , a quick shower cause the unit to go haywire for a while , and in the process it erased the total accumulated distance reading for the whole Tour. I had no real troubles with the altimeter , and after using one for so long , I would now never ride without one.

He insisted that the treaty , and the League of Nations at its heart , be accepted without change. In September , he launched a " whistle-stop " tour to build public support for ratification , against the advice of his doctor. Wilson was a spellbinding speaker , and some people think he might have succeeded , but on October 2 , 1919 , he collapsed from a paralytic stroke.

" According to petitioner , " [ t ] he goal of the highest-level competitive athletics is to assess and compare the performance of different competitors , a task that is meaningful only if the competitors are subject to identical substantive rules. " 45 The waiver of any possibly " outcome-affecting " rule for a contestant would violate this principle and therefore , in petitioner 's view , fundamentally alter the nature of the highest level athletic event.46 The walking rule is one such rule , petitioner submits , because its purpose is " to inject the element of fatigue into the skill of shot-making , " 47 and thus its effect may be the critical loss of a stroke. As a consequence , the reasonable modification Martin seeks would fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner 's highest level tournaments even if he were the only person in the world who has both the talent to compete in those elite events and a disability sufficiently serious that he can not do so without using a cart . </tour.n.5712><tour.n.5713>Some tour operators prefer applicants with a degree , especially for tours that require thorough knowledge of a subject , such as history of art , music or history.

The picture shows the truck that transported us all over Peru. This had tables and suspension that smoothed the harshest of Andean roads. John , our driver , was great and knew all the good cafes and bars of each of the towns and Alan , the Tour Coordinator as he liked to be called , was also a good laugh and knew his stuff. Eleven of us started this trip although it was a combination of a number of options so this varied a little as we progressed.

I am deeply bothered by his categorization of narration , especially the description about the on-tour narration. Bruner ' s description about the en-route narration such as trail stories from other backpackers , the personal diaries or the internet travel journals are all narrations after experiencing the tour. This could be a question related to the definition of tour , personally , I think a major tour is consisted by numerous minor tours . </tour.n.5725><tour.n.5726>TECHNICAL CONSULTANT/IT SUPPORT - TOUR OPERATOR SKIPTON/COLNE AREAA leading tour operator in the Colne area is required to provide input to technical solutions to meet stated business requirementsOther duties will include ... to multi-taskVery strong attention to detailTrack record of working on multiple projects within a programme of work MCSE qualifiedExchange server integration experienceServer management In return the client offers a basic salary </tour.n.5726><tour.n.5727>Collette may periodically offer special deals on certain tours and departure dates.

WWII veterans had the same feeling when the end was finally in sight. From a Marine who recounted his thoughts while assaulting a ridge on Okinawa in June of 1945 , 'We all knew it was the last big fight before the Japanese were wiped out ... having made it that far in the war , I knew my luck would run out ...

A National Geographic magazine circulated during the tour , or the house once occupied by Mead and Bateson , pointed out by an authoritative ethnographer/guide becomes a catalyst by which a shared , homogeneous political consciousness of a tour group is affirmed. Ethnic display of the Maasai at three different locations also exemplify kinds of narratives written for different groups of tourists whose expectations are socio-historically pre-constructed.

First off they are trying to raise money. They have to create a crisis or fear in order to get people to send in money. Secondly , their agenda is to convince people of their Vegan agenda. There are farms that do a poor job and give all of agriculture a bad name , but I guarantee that they represent a very small percentage of modern farms.

Each Hawaiian island is made up of at least one primary dormant volcano , although many islands are composites of more than one. The Big Island of Hawaii , for instance , is constructed of 5 major volcanoes : Kilauea ( which is active and we fly over on our Maui Air - Volcano Air Tours ) , Mauna Loa , Mauna Kea , Hualalai and Kohala. Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on Earth. Kilauea , which you can see on a Maui Air tour , is presently one of the most productive volcanoes on Earth ( in terms of how much lava it erupts each year ) . The primary volcanoes on each of the islands are known as shield volcanoes , which are gently sloping mountains produced from a large number of generally very fluid lava flows. These mountains are best viewed from the air on Volcano Air Tour ' s Big Island Volcano Tour and the Sunset Volcano Tour.

These families began construction of the many mansions on the lake , and Lake Geneva became known as the Newport ( RI ) of the West. Visitors included Mary Todd Lincoln and Generals Sherman and Sheridan. The Chicago Fire of 1871 caused many Chicago families to move to their summer homes on the lake while the city was rebuilt. The construction and maintenance of these mansions , as well as household employment , developed a separate industry in the town adding to the milling , furniture , wagon and typewriter manufacturing enterprises. After arrival of the railroad , thousands of tons of Lake Geneva ice were shipped each year to Chicago until the beginning of World War II.

When molten , basalt produces liquids of relatively high fluidity , compared to volcanoes that erupt more silica rich magma types such as andesite , dacite or rhyolite. The fluidity of molten basalt favors the formation of lava flows , which is why the Hawaiian volcanoes generally have gentle sloping sides , easily visible on our tours. By contrast , lavas with higher silica content are more viscous and commonly produce either thicker , shorter lava flows , thick blocky deposits and/or thick beds of ash that fall from the sky following explosive eruptions. These other types of volcanoes ( common outside of Hawaii ) are typically steeper sided , which you wo n't see on a Maui Air Volcano Tour . </tour.n.5796><tour.n.5797>Our aim is to take travellers OFF THE BEATEN PATH away from the maddening crowds !

Most other frontline intermediaries , both formal and informal , have so far been omitted from research , while they also have their influence on tourists and their experiences. Formal intermediaries are considered to work for the tourism industry , whereas informal mediators are usually not employed in the tourism sector. Informal intermediaries , however , do encounter with tourists. Jennings &amp;Weiler ( 2006 ) suppose that informal intermediaries could have a bigger effect on a qualitative tourist experience than formal intermediaries. They assume that informal intermediaries have better skills to feel what the tourist wants and what he cares about , that they have more in common with tourists than formal mediators. That is why they possibly contribute more to a qualitative tourist experience of the destination. Any person that works in a front office position has the possibility to act as a touristic intermediary , and therefore so do the taxi drivers on Gozo . </tour.n.5855><tour.n.5856>For something completely different , how about China ? we did a whistle-stop tour at Easter in 2002 , including a cruise through the Three Gorges of the Yangtse River , Beijing and Xian.

The tour itself is very dependant on the tides and requires at least half a day to do it justice. It is difficult to tell you much in advance the exact time of day we can take you there because the village can be visited only when the sea tides are low. This information will become available as your tour date approaches , and you will be informed then. It is therefore difficult to confirm an itinerary set in stone when you want to include the fishing village in conjunction with other attractions , but we recommend including the following destinations : </tour.n.5930><tour.n.5931>On May 15 , 1889 , the Eiffel Tower opened its door to the public , a few days after the inauguration of the Universal Exposition , and was the uncontested attraction of the event. 120 years later in 2009 , the Mayor of Paris and the operating company , Soci t d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel , have organized a series of events to celebrate the Tower 's anniversary </tour.n.5931><tour.n.5932>At present , the Galapagos tours make for a perfect location to spend time some in sheer enjoyment with friends away from home.

The new shop allows for extra space for tour buses and groups , as well as providing better visibility for anyone wanting to visit Yoder Popcorn. They opened the retail store in Topeka , IN to take advantage of the tourist season surrounding Shipshewana. The retail store is open from February to December , when their holiday Internet sales peak.

From the moment she met us at our hotel we knew we were in for a fun sightseeing experience. Gabriela was extremely knowledgeable in the history and culture of Austria and really helped us understand and enjoy the unique energy of Vienna. Our 4-hour walking tour offered us the luxury to move at our own pace and provided a wonderful overview of the city. All of Gabriela ' s insider tips from where to get the best pastries to how to use Vienna ' s public transportation system helped us get the most out of our short visit to this magnificent city. And her services didn ' t stop at sightseeing; Gabriela recommended some fabulous local restaurants and helped arrange tickets for a Mozart concert that was the highlight of our visit. We truly enjoyed our time with Gabriela. Not only would we highly recommend her services to others , but we also would work with her again should we have the chance to return to Vienna.

Guitar Hero : On Tour definitely doesn ' t disappoint aurally in terms of quality , but perhaps in quantity , but as mentioned previously , it ' s kind of unfair to compare. There isn ' t a whole lot wrong with Guitar Hero : On Tour. Almost everything that made the original games so fun is kept in tact for this portable iteration. The Guitar Grip is a pretty fun accessory to use ( in short doses ) and is practical and clever considering the platform Vicarious Visions / Activision had to work with.

This ensures quality security , and detailed activity. Guard tour systems consist of three major components; the scanner , an incident booklet , and the radio-frequency identification chips ( RFID ) RFID 's are , simply put , a small electronic device that you can place on walls , in certain objects , underwater , etc. that get scanned to acknowledge that the area has been patrolled. RFID 's can be hidden in discrete locations , and be kept hidden from sight. Even when it 's hidden it can still be scanned. For example : Part of a security guards patrolling area is to check the back entrance of a building. With the RFID chip discretely in place the guard scans it , and it gets logged into the incident booklet . </tour.n.5950><tour.n.5951>The Ulster Branch leg of the Grand Slam Trophy Tour is drawing to a close this weekend.

And if you do n't want to bother with it , you can download songs that other people have created. Though none of the songs will likely sound as good with actual recording equipment or as good as the original song if it 's based off one , the music creator relieves a bit of the lack of official downloadable tracks for World Tour at the moment . </tour.n.6152><tour.n.6153>Planning a trip to a country as vast and culturally unique as China can be daunting for even the most experienced travelers. That 's why Americans typically opt for tour packages that include a guide.

But they come here largely because of our schedule and the depth of competition. If we are going to continue to attract these players to the Tour , we have to have enough prize money to make it worth their while. I think that golf fans look at prize money as a measure of importance. It ' s not defeatist to say we ' re not the PGA TOUR and we never will be. The marketplace here can ' t support multiple multimillion dollar events. However , it is a marketplace that can support $ 250 , 000-500 , 000 tournaments , and that is where this Tour will go.

Then it emerged that the race leader , the Danish rider Michael Rasmussen , had missed a series of tests in the weeks leading up to the Tour.

Discussions on who , which periods , and which versions of history should be performed at the restored castle of Elmina indicate a complexity involved in a production of a tourist narrative. Here , Bruner ' s concept of borderzone is helpful because it transfigures an exploitative gaze and an assimilationist strategy of an ethnic theme park into a potential site of a minoritarian resistance and community maintenance , in which I hear an echo of Richard Hundler ' s notion of self-objectification . The activities centered around the Toba Batak house at Taman Mini , in contrast to two other ethnic theme parks described in Culture on Tour , offer a hopeful possibility . </tour.n.6193><tour.n.6194>Active tour managers who are members of the International Association of Tour Managers ( IATM ) can elect to sit the Certificate of Tour Management ( CTM ) examination.

A little further down the road at a fruit and veggie stall , an old man chats agreeably with us about our tour and relays his adventures fishing for black cod in Prudhoe Bay , Alaska.

I did n't imagine that it would be so easy. As a 50'something woman with a bad back , I had no problems ! We enjoyed the evening tour , but probably would n't do it again. Trying to watch where you 're going ( some places are n't lit all that great ) , constantly adjusting your vision , at a fairly quick pace , is rather distracting. I was grateful that I had already seen most of the sites. Next time , we 'll do the daytime tour , and probably the longer one ( 3-4 hours ) , if they 're not so rushed. Still , a great time !

Before leaving the Pyongyang we had a quick tour of the sports complex but were not taken inside. Few people seemed to be using them. I notice the nearby rundown flats had bars on the ground floor windows so burglary must be a problem. On leaving the capital we drove on a ten lane motorway. Yes , it had ten lanes , no exaggeration. We were about the only vehicle on it and you could tell the people were not used to traffic because they and their oxen were wandering all over it. It was all very laid back. During the whole day we did not pass one filling station . </tour.n.6314><tour.n.6315>This morning our Boer War tour visits the massive granite Voortrekker Monument , raised to commemorate the fathers of the Boer states , and nearby Schanskop fort with its 'Long Tom ' gun.

Like 21st-century sightseers , Roman tourists were hustled in and out of temples by professional tour guides and treated to sideshows by clever priests who charged hefty prices for a glimpse of a Cyclops 's skull or a Gorgon 's hair. They were also subjected to bad food and hard mattresses in roadside inns from Pompeii to Aswan. To prove that little has changed over the centuries , New York Times travel writer Perrottet takes us on a modern-day tour of the Roman Empire. Accompanied by his girlfriend , Perrottet follows the map drawn by Roman war hero Marcus Agrippa , traveling from Rome to Egypt along many of the same routes used by Horace and Pliny. The result is a fascinating and often humorous look at a world long gone and the tourist culture that has grown up around it. Perrottet 's writing sparkles with descriptions of modern and ancient misadventures. The accompanying photographs enhance the narrative and help make this book a good purchase for any library.

( Some paddling experience preferred for 3 to 4 day tours but only necessary for 5 day tours . ) </tour.n.6325><tour.n.6326>The force of petitioner 's argument is , first of all , mitigated by the fact that golf is a game in which it is impossible to guarantee that all competitors will play under exactly the same conditions or that an individual 's ability will be the sole determinant of the outcome. For example , changes in the weather may produce harder greens and more head winds for the tournament leader than for his closest pursuers. A lucky bounce may save a shot or two.48 Whether such happenstance events are more or less probable than the likelihood that a golfer afflicted with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome would one day qualify for the NIKE TOUR and PGA TOUR , they at least demonstrate that pure chance may have a greater impact on the outcome of elite golf tournaments than the fatigue resulting from the enforcement of the walking rule . </tour.n.6326><tour.n.6327>Prices for the Harley Davidson Adelaide Motorcycle Tour - 2 Hours experience can be found on the Australian Explorer website.

He looks at tourist productions as performances although the traditional theatrical space and context of Edensor , with a clearly delineated proscenium , audience , stage managers , etc is replaced by a model of more improvisatory performance. The stage is now located in the borderzone and is inhabited by both tourists and locals as actors , although roles are not distinct , they may change or be mutually held ( as in Bruner himself tourist , ethnographer , tour guide , tourist producer ) . Additionally , Bruner adopts what he sees as a performative method to his analysis , ie , a reflexive and ironic one.

But there is a very definite shift in attitude. Simply by confronting Vinokourov 's offence , knowing what its effect would be , the Tour was making its own declaration. Cycling 's governing body , the UCI , is also talking tougher , as it now has to , and there 's a sense that the Tour has to put itself through this before it can find a way ahead. The gendarmerie has got involved this week , adding to the seriousness of the situation confronting transgressors . </tour.n.6512><tour.n.6513>Are you going to have a 6-8 hour layover in Beijing ?

This time , I feel complete. Mallku was able to bring me to fulfillment while simultaneously caring for the needs of those who were with him for the first time. I do n't think anyone felt a loss , only gain. No one had a feeling of receiving less , rather each one experienced the growth of spiritual values according to their own understanding of those values. My spiritual transformations have to do with knowing truly who I am , how I connect to the world , and what I can do to optimize change on the spiritual level. New attitudes , new perspectives , a new joy that transcends the relative. I do n't want anymore; I simply feel full. I am living the fullness of life. Living in the light of God.

It is important that tour guides make people aware that certain behaviour is harmful. Influencing consumer behaviour by information distribution is not evident.

In 2006 , Townshend and Daltrey released the mini-opera Wire &amp;Glass , their first collaboration as the Who in nearly a quarter century. The full-length Endless Wire , which included the EP , was released later that year to the best reviews that any Who album had gotten since Who Are You , 28 year earlier. The accompanying tour was similarly well-received , and for the first time since the 1980s there seemed to be a point to the group 's continued existence , as something other than a money-making machine. On December 7 , 2008 , at a gala ceremony in Washington , D.C. , Townshend and Daltrey , as the surviving members of the Who , received Kennedy Center Honors for their lifetime contributions to American culture -- and if the late Keith Moon were watching from wherever he is , he would probably have been too flabbergasted to crack a joke. ~ Bruce Eder &amp;Stephen Thomas Erlewine , All Music Guide See Less </tour.n.6559><tour.n.6560>The triumvirate of Collins , Rutherford and Banks that forms the core of the '07 tour made its debut on 1978 's appropriately titled And Then There Were Three - their first gold album - which spun off their first bonafide pop hit ' Follow You Follow Me.

Although the guide books make this out to be a major attraction , I actually thought it was very touristy. I thought the small mining museum was worthwhile seeing , but the rest of the town I could have easily left after 10 minutes.

Instead of having Rock Band ' s white circle gauge which fills up as you match the pitch , the vocals here only tell you how well you performed after each phrase. The comet ( instead of just a plain ol ' flaming circle , I suppose ) which travels across the notes on a highway will send a burst of different colored light depending on well you did. Though it ' s clear whether your pitch is following the notes on the screen or not , how much you ' re off is difficult to discern. The stats at the end of the song will tell you that you got 87 , and the only question you ' ll have is Wha how ? As a person who can gold star most songs in Rock Band on expert vocals , I can say that getting 100 on a song in World Tour is nearly impossible , whether you hum , put the microphone next to the speakers , or get the actual singer of the song to sing it for you . </tour.n.6699><tour.n.6700>Our tour begins in The Fountain Room where the Greek goddess Hebe , cup bearer of the gods , holds court.
