Rooms were laid out so that all rooms were in full view of the teacher. The rooms used benches and tables for study and for woodworking and sewing. Cloakrooms were by the main entrance to prevent inappropriate mingling by the two sexes and to keep them under the watchful eye of the teacher. The entry was small , just large enough for overshoes and rubbers. The inner door often swung both ways. A platform served as a stage and the room doubled for manual training.

James Surowiecki argued , in the book of this title ( Surowiecki , 2004 ) with many interesting examples that groups often make better decisions than even informed individuals. It is important to emphasize that the model requires independence of the individual decisions and also a sort of diversity to assure that different sources of information are at work , so it is to be sharply distinguished from judging the mass opinion of a group that shares information and reaches a consensus in discussion. The obvious method suggested by Surowiecki 's thesis is to consult polls or predictions markets rather than to experiment or sample on one 's own.

The more modest houses normally live one or one and one half stories with low pitched roofs , asymmetrical facades and red tile roofs; only a handful exist in Raleigh of this type , two of which are found alongside one another in Vanguard Park ( SLHD ) at 2204 and 2206 Alexander Road. Both erected in the 1920s , they have stuccoed walls and arched entrances. The second type is a larger and more ornate as seen in the two-story Sears , Roebuck mail order house ( ed : ? ) , " the Alhambra , " at 1601 St. Mary 's Street in Hayes Barton ( SLHD ) . Built in the late 1920s the stuccoed house features curvilinear dormers and roof parapets. The grandest version of the second form of Spanish Colonial Revival in Raleigh is the Clifton B. Cheatham House at 845 Holt Drive in Hayes Barton ( SLHD ) . It is a five bay wide , two story , hip roofed dwelling with red roof tiles , a wrap-around front porch with iron balustrades , lacy cast iron entry gates , and wide roof eaves . </entry.n.132><entry.n.133>The Grand Prize Winners will be notified by telephone or email using the contact information provided on the Registration Form.

While entry terms are closely related to Main Headings they need not be synonymous to the Main Heading or to each other. This practice is justified because it is often impractical and usually undesirable to restrict the entry vocabulary to strictly synonymous terms. Most indexed domains have limited scope , which may have few or no documents about a given group of synonyms. Retrieval in the domain does not require fine granularity for every term. For example , MeSH contains a descriptor for 'Whales ' but the domain of MeSH is biomedicine and not zoology. In the MEDLINE citation database , there are not sufficient citations to create a separate descriptor for each specific whale species. Nevertheless , it is useful to have the species names as entry terms to the descriptor.

However , no evidence was presented that the second offense DWI conviction in circuit court occurred within 5 years of the defendant 's first offense DWI. The problem belying the Commonwealth in this situation was that after a conviction of second offense in general district court , the defendant appealed his case to circuit court. As a result of this de novo appeal , the defendant was entitled to a brand new trial as if nothing had happened in general district court. Consequently , the defendant was also required to be rearraigned by the Court on the charge , meaning the official reading of the charge and entry of a plea.

But , as the clothes are texture layers of the character mesh , we do n't run into the inconvenience of having to be naked. But it worked out even better. Everything attached to the avatar during the stretching process gets enlarged proportionally , too ! Compare my prim boots in the picture at the top of this entry to the house on the left they are almost as high as the complete ground floor. Unfortunately once you detach an item from the avatar it 'snaps back ' to regular size. Hence this ca n't be used as a new way of producing mega-prims . </entry.n.624><entry.n.625>409 Verification of data entry.

A node in the tree is a medical concept and its branching nodes represent its descriptors. An essential principle while constructing a tree is that a concept is represented once , i.e. as a unique node , in the tree. The tree has no 'knowledge ' of what nodes are conceptually the same. This is because a path from top to node represents a concept , not the node itself. Hence 'severity ' of 'cough ' differs from 'severity ' of 'chest pain'. Besides the ordering of nodes in a tree , each node has several properties , which define options and constraints for data entry ( e.g. plausible min. and max. for a value ) . Custom constraints can also be defined ( e.g. systolic blood pressure must be higher than the diastolic blood pressure ) . </entry.n.628><entry.n.629>The current multihull and overall record is held by Triple Jack , a Kelsal 47 trimaran with a time of 3 hours , 33 minutes , 27 seconds.

Raised breeding livestock ' s asset value can be calculated either using the full cost absorption method ( producer accumulates all costs associated with raising breeding livestock and upon entry to the breeding herd , the accumulated costs of raising the animals would then be depreciated over the expected useful life of the animals. Market values of the breeding herd would be separately disclosed ) or the base value method ( a base value is established for various categories of raised breeding stock , and as livestock move through those categories in their normal life cycle , valuation is established for that particular category at the time the valuation is done. Both the change in value of raised breeding livestock -- from either moving into a higher value category or an increased number of raised replacements -- and income or loss from sale of those animals is counted as income. Cost of raising replacement breeding animals is included in expenses. ) Note that the full cost absorption method is rarely used . </entry.n.635><entry.n.636>ii.

This means that the accountant would debit the revenue account thus reducing it to zero and credit the temporary revenue summary account. Then you would close out the various expense accounts. Assume the expenses total up to $ 75 , 000 , the accountant would credit the expense accounts thus reducing the expense accounts to zero and debit the income summary account in the amount of $ 75 , 000.

Armstrong , like Williams and Stove , is a rationalist about induction. There is however a significant difference of emphasis and structure that marks Armstrong 's approach off from that of Williams and Stove : The problem of induction was for the latter couple the topic and focus of their work on the question. Armstrong 's major project on the other hand has for some three decades been the formulation and development of a theory of universals. ( See the entry on properties where Armstrong 's theory is discussed. ) The problem of induction is treated in a brief paper ( Armstrong 1991 ) and an eight-page section in ( Armstrong 1983 ) , which work is itself an application of the theory of universals. Armstrong 's account of the problem of induction thus gains depth and richness , first in the light of his thesis that laws of nature are connections of universals , announced and defended in ( Armstrong 1983 ) and secondly because it is a natural application of the elaborate theory of universals and states of affairs in which this thesis is developed. This theory yields a few essential metaphysical principles that underlie much of Armstrong 's philosophy of science , including his views on induction , and that are usefully kept in mind : </entry.n.997><entry.n.998>Villareal and Real Betis secured their entry to next season 's Champions League after respective must-win games on the final day of action in the Spanish league. . . . more . . . </entry.n.998><entry.n.999>headword - a word placed at the beginning of a line or paragraph ( as in a dictionary entry ) for low familiarity words should contain spelling information which is weaker , that is , harder to access.

An RDBMS is more restrictive than a spreadsheet in that all the data in one column must be of the same type , e.g. , integer , decimal , character string , or date. Another difference between a spreadsheet and an RDBMS is that the rows in an RDBMS are not ordered. You can have a column named row_number and ask the RDBMS to return the rows ordered according to the data in this column , but the row numbering is not implicit as it would be with Visicalc or its derivatives such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel.

It might generate some buzz , convince a few more ticket holders to come to the Palace rather than eat the cost of the ticket. But it does n't change the reality of a Pistons season that 's more about tomorrow 's possibilities than today's. So do n't get frustrated over Wallace 's dwindling offensive production -- only one double-digit scoring performance the past five games -- because the only number that matters now is his $ 14-million salary slot.

Logical implication is transitive : whatever implies a proposition implies all of its logical consequences , for implication corresponds to the transitive subset relation among sets of worlds. But when A implies B and B confirms C , the B worlds in which C is true may ( as in the example ) exclude the A worlds. Inductive reasoning is said to be non-monotonic , for in contrast to deduction , the addition of premises may annul what was a good induction ( the inference from the premise P to the conclusion R be may be inductively strong while the inference from the premises P , Q to the conclusion R may not be ) . ( See the entry on non-monotonic logic , and section 7.1 below for a striking example. ) For this reason induction and confirmation are subject to the principle of total evidence which requires that all relevant evidence be taken into account in every induction.

There are some interesting ramifications for trader performance -- even for discretionary traders. The gist of the argument is that many technical indicators are so highly correlated with price change during strong and weak markets that they offer no new information. A good example would be many oscillators ( RSI , Stochastics , etc. ) , which simply give " overbought " or " oversold " readings for long periods of time during strong or weak markets. During relatively neutral periods of price change , however , many of these indicators are much more weakly correlated with price and offer unique information. It may well be that traders can improve their performance by only focusing on technical indicators during relatively flat periods of market action and relying on price/volume patterns alone during strong and weak markets. I plan to implement this strategy on the TraderFeed site . </entry.n.1323><entry.n.1324>" With any exterior entry you are trying to create a sense of place , " Rossman says.

The sheet is entirely in Lewis 's hand and contains on one side a draft for Lewis 's description of the Platte River , which he later transferred into Codex O as his survey of rivers and creeks. Although there is a date of July 21 ( 1804 ) on the document , the reverse contains lunar observations ( also in Lewis 's hand ) for February 23 , 1805 , while the party was at Fort Mandan. It could be that the draft describing the Platte was also written at Fort Mandan and there copied into Codex O. Because the draft from the Field Notes is an incomplete portion , it is certain that other pages are missing; whether they describe only the Platte or are a full draft of his summary may never be known. If Lewis was keeping thorough topographical notes throughout the first portion of the trip , it helps explain why no daily entry material has been found.

It should be appropriately scaled to its surroundings : Consider the two-story porch on a Southern plantation house , or the simple header and wide trim boards used on a small , vintage Colonial.

" Clark 's brief record of the episode in his Codex C entry for October 13 says that Newman was tried " last night. " Apparently he wrote the codex entry the day after the trial. The paragraph on the trial , comes at the very end of the entry , so it is likely that the whole entry was composed on October 14 , the day after its ostensible date. This is at a time when the Field Notes entries are still continuous and fairly extensive; the Codex C entry , however , includes much information not found in the Field Notes , apparently taken down by Clark at the time he received it. At this time he was obviously copying and expanding his first notes into the notebook journal quite promptly . </entry.n.1458><entry.n.1459>Prior to submitting any order or judgment entry to a court that would order the sale of the residential real estate , the party submitting the order or judgment entry must file with the clerk of the court of common pleas a final judicial report that updates the state of the record title to that real estate from the effective date of the preliminary judicial report through the date of lis pendens and includes a copy of the court 's docket for the case.

The following instance is an example of an instance of an act-of-violence rule : On 11.08.1988 , at 11 am , Lt. Mendoza executed by shooting Juan Pueblo. This act , along with others ( e.g. , Mendoza 's arrest of Pueblo , threats Mendoza previously made against Pueblo , etc. ) might be associated with an event.

The principal doorway to Wing G on the west facade ( room Gg4 ) is also known to have been larger than the average exterior door. No detailed specifications for it are available , although it can be assumed to be at least the size of the west chapel door. It might also have been reasonable to suppose that the doorway to room Ig 28 was larger than average since it was the main entrance to wing I , although neither archaeological evidence nor historical plans have been found to confirm this supposition. Some evidence , based on quantities , indicates a wider opening of 4 ' 4 " for the doorway providing access to the bakery ( wall Sg 20 w ) , presumably the objective being to facilitate the entry of bulky baking supplies. Another exterior door on the ground floor of the west facade led to the council chamber; no manuscript gives its size but archaeology indicates a width of 3 ' . </entry.n.1479><entry.n.1480>Ned Batchelder 's wife writes about the difficulties of buying a decent bathing suit.

In all cases , it is clear that the organizational arrangement and the marketing strategy are interrelated : the less involved the international company , the less likely it is to develop locally customized offers and the more likely it is to follow a replication strategy. In fact , a replication strategy can run counter to the overarching objectives in entering the market in the first place , as much recent experience in the large emerging markets demonstrates . </entry.n.1523><entry.n.1524>- Third Monday in November ( was : 16 November 2009 ) : Dutch Market , your chance to buy uniquely Dutch delicacies fresh from the Netherlands in the centrally located Social Hall of the Dutch Church , Austin Friars , London EC2.

These functions became hereditary , and those engaging in them were inhibited from changing their careers. The repetitious nature of these laws , however , suggests that they were not widely obeyed.

In fact , the whole paragraph occurs verbatim in Lewis 's Codex J entry for March 19 , 1806 over four months after the ostensible date of Clark 's entry. This forces us to conclude that Clark wrote the November 7 , 1805 , entry in Codex H on or after March 19 , 1806. Lacking any indication that the page with the quoted paragraph was inserted later , we must assume that the remainder of Codex H after that date and Clark 's subsequent notebook journals , largely copied from Lewis 's were written on or after March 19 , 1806 an assumption that creates some intriguing problems.

One promising application is with individual stocks and ETFs. Because many individual issues and sectors are highly correlated with the S &amp;P 500 Index , handicapping the odds of reaching pivot levels in ES may also provide clues as to hitting comparable levels for those stocks and sectors. Moreover , it may be possible to use tools such as Market Delta to assess volume at the bid vs. offer for the individual equities and NeoTicker to track TICK measures that are specific to individual stocks and sectors. This could provide unique information that would enable us to handicap the odds of reaching price targets in stocks and ETFs.

The collision symbol KO synchronises both network nodes within the second path. A time delay between two network nodes inthe second path as shown in FIG. 4 , which would be possible in a system without collision symbol KO , can no longer occur. As soon as a network node enters the second path at an earlier time than another network node , it prevents entry of further networknodes into the second path through transmission of the collision symbol KO which causes a new start of the observation time interval for the remaining network nodes in block 17 . </entry.n.1726><entry.n.1727>This field defines the user tags to be handled by the JadeIDE user taglet.

When reading a database entry from freedb , an application supporting the revision system stores the revision of the existing entry. If the user changes the entry ( to correct mistakes ) and re-submits it , the application increases that revision by 1 for the re-submission. So if the server receives an updated database entry with increased revision , it knows , that the user submitting the updated entry really saw the original entry. If the revision is not increased , the server software has to assume , that the user never saw the original entry and is possibly overwriting an entry , that is already perfectly ok . </entry.n.1733><entry.n.1734>The law does not provide for the granting of asylum or refugee status in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 protocol , and the authorities did not grant refugee status or asylum , nor have they established a system for providing protection to refugees. In practice , the authorities did not provide protection against refoulement , the return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. Individuals who requested asylum were supposed to be directed to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . However , the authorities ' cooperation with the UNHCR was uneven due at least in part to complications arising from the unrecognized status of the " TRNC.

Here , the State did not take that precaution and entered a nolle prosequi on the 179th day. As the hearing court found and the State concedes , the State 's purpose in entering a nolle prosequi was to circumvent Judge Beckstead 's ruling denying the motion to amend. Thus , the entry of the nol pros was not a legitimate option for the State. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the State 's purpose in entering the nol pros was not to circumvent the requirements of Hicks , it is quite obvious that by entering the nol pros on the last day prior to the expiration of Hicks , that the necessary effect of entering the nol pros , regardless of motive , circumvented Hicks.

Selection of the OMS-1 targets would be based on whether the abort were caused by a MECO underspeed , a system problem or an OMS/RCS performance problem. Selection of the OMS-2 targets would depend on whether a MECO underspeed existed and its magnitude. ( The AOA OMS-2 burn is really a deorbit burn. ) One set of targets would result in a steeper trajectory than would the other as the vehicle enters the atmosphere ( entry interface ); thus , this trajectory is referred to as a steep AOA. This is a more normal trajectory and stays well within the vehicle 's thermal limits after it penetrates the atmosphere. It would require more delta velocity and consequently more propellant for the deorbit burn. Thus , if the MECO underspeed were severe or if both OMS helium tanks had failed , the shallow AOA targets would be used , resulting in a more shallow trajectory at entry interface and placing the vehicle closer to the skip-out boundary and its thermal limits . </entry.n.1800><entry.n.1801>8.

W. , who had a room next to our entry , separated only by deal boards , so that he had a good chance to hear and to divulge much. This idea made us feel uneasy; but as the brethren from Hanover knew Mr. v. W 's happy talent of drowning his sorrows in the cup , we attacked him on this weak point. After dinner , we paid him , one after another , a visit , and took our turns alternately to fight him glass in hand. Towards evening he was in such a condition that , even sleeping in a hattery , he would not have been awakened. So the thyrsus of Bacchus has done us as great a service as the finger of Harpocrates had hardly been able to do us . </entry.n.1849><entry.n.1850>In the broadest usage , any procedure which ( a ) substitutes non-entry for official entry into the justice process , or ( b ) substitutes the suspension of criminal or juvenile proceedings for continuation , or ( c ) substitutes lesser supervision or referral to a non-justice agency or no supervision status for confinement.

This operation , dubbed " Total Victory , " was presented in Saigon as an attempt to wind up the war and be done with it. In this manner a strategy was defined which confuses the idea of victory with that of extending the conflict outside Vietnam. In the light of the disclosures made two weeks before by a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding American participation in the fighting in Laos , the conclusion is inescapable that on April 30 , 1970 , the United States embarked on what is now the Second Indochina War . </entry.n.1852><entry.n.1853>The America 's Greenest School Contest ( the Contest ) is open only to legal residents of the fifty ( 50 ) United States and the District of Columbia who are enrolled in a public or private school , not a home school , and between the grades of Kindergarten through 12th Grade at the time of entry.

Gone were the ominous shadows of BCCI and Iran-Contra , casting their pall over the credibility of those powerful politicians feeding us their take on a new world order. More than anyone ( this writer included ) , Loftus should have been able to detect a high-level disinformation campaign to set up " the Jews " and " the Zionists " as the main evil conspirators behind 9/11. Yet ironically , here was Loftus casting his lot in with those very neo-conservatives who will one day serve as the showcase exhibits for what is sure to be the latest entry in an updated blood libel. From the Crucifixion , to the Rothschilds , and on to the Twin Towers , the Jews were being set up once more to play their historical role as punch toys to smokescreen a powerful oligarchy . </entry.n.1868><entry.n.1869> Note : If the current entry includes a Table of Contents ( top , right-hand corner ) , the comments section is located on the first page of the entry ( and may indeed be open.

We reject Lockheed 's complaint regarding unequal evaluation of the offerors ' proposals based on the following : Lockheed 's proposal unambiguously provided that Lockheed would not deliver aircraft equipped with GPS with SAASM until 2012 , more than 4 years after first aircraft delivery; in contrast , L3 's and Raytheon 's proposals each stated that they would provide aircraft equipped with GPS with SAASM , beginning at the time of first aircraft delivery. In short , L-3 's and Raytheon 's proposals committed to comply with the mandatory requirement , while Lockheed 's proposal did not. On this record , we find no basis for Lockheed to assert that the agency 's evaluation of the offerors ' proposals to provide GPS with SAASM reflected unequal treatment . </entry.n.1870><entry.n.1871>1.

The different types of exterior doors include , front entry doors , back doors , french doors , sliding glass , and patio doors. These doors may either be paneled , flush , or have glass inserts. Panels are raised inserts that are framed into the door. These are fitted into grooves in the door , which allows the wood to expand and contract without damaging the door. Flush doors are covered or sheathed with a veneer that will provide a smooth , or unbroken exterior cover on the door. This veneer can include inexpensive pine or costly exotic wood. Glass can be inserted into doors to provide style , such as multipaned french doors , or entry doors with smaller windowpanes. The panes of glass that are inserted into doors are often referred to as lights. A door can be identified by how many lights it has. A single large pane of glass placed in a door often classifies the door as an atrium or patio door . </entry.n.1879><entry.n.1880>He continued , " I requested that the matter either go to trial or be terminated.

Normally , the software is set to fly the orbiter around the HAC on the opposite side of the extended runway centerline. This is called the overhead approach. If the orbiter is low on energy , it can be flagged to acquire the HAC on the same side of the runway. This is called the straight-in approach. In TAEM guidance , excess energy is dissipated by an S-turn , and the speed brake can be used to modify drag , lift-to-drag ratio and the flight path angle under high-energy conditions. This increases the ground track range as the orbiter turns away from the nearest HAC until sufficient energy is dissipated to allow a normal approach and landing guidance phase capture , which begins at 10 , 000 feet at the nominal entry point. The orbiter can also be flown near the velocity for maximum lift over drag or wings level for the range stretch case , which moves the approach and landing guidance phase to the minimum entry point . </entry.n.1892><entry.n.1893>4.

This mirrors one of the main motivations for internalism about the contents of other mental states. The general issue is reviewed in the entry on externalism. In the case of experience , philosophers have pursued this debate with respect to Marr 's computational theory of vision , one of the leading empirical theories of visual processing. The debate is over whether Marr 's theory itself posits any externally-individuated contents , or whether the contents it posits are all individuated internalistically. If Marr 's theory is correct and explanatory , and if the representational contents it posits are externally individuated , then it provides a counter-example to individualists ' claims that only internally-determined contents figure in psychological explanation. The debate thus focuses on exactly what commitments Marr 's theory makes about the individuation of perceptual content . </entry.n.1953><entry.n.1954>, Dover NH SALE PENDING.

One-and-a-half story examples are the most common in Wisconsin , but one , two , and two-and-a-half story versions also occur. One-and-a-half story examples frequently have dormers on one or both roof planes. The front-facing principal facades are typically symmetrical and some have small entry porches or an uncovered stoop while others have full-width front porches having shed or hipped roofs. Ornamentation is generally simple , consisting of such details as turned porch posts , decorative shingles , oversize parlor windows sometimes including etched or stained glass transoms , and simply detailed sills and windows. Earlier examples are usually narrow in width and in proportion and have steeply pitched roofs; later versions are broader with more gently sloped roofs. The front gable form is usually a wood frame structure sided with clapboard. Less frequently , these buildings were sided in wood shingles , stucco , or brick.

Consequently , smaller players are not able to compete on financial grounds or production capacity. The biosimilars market is unlike the market for chemical drugs ' generics where the development and manufacturing costs are comparatively much lower. The expected price reduction for a biosimilar is not more than 10 to 30 of the original biologic ( compared to a difference of more than 70 between chemical drugs and their generic counterparts ) . This marked difference between the biosimilars and traditional generic drugs is because biosimilars , unlike traditional generic drugs , require preclinical and clinical studies to prove bioequivalence and safety . </entry.n.1970><entry.n.1971>Continuing law provides that every tract of land and town lot , which , pursuant to the R.C. 323.25 foreclosure proceedings or R.C. 5721.18 foreclosure proceedings , has been advertised and offered for sale on two separate occasions , not less than two weeks apart , and not sold for want of bidders , must be forfeited to the state.

In order to reduce the amount of manual data entry we designed the facility for metadata to be inherited from issue to department and then to item level.

Clearly , the responsibility for excluding serious human rights abusers lies with consular officers abroad and asylum officers at ports of entry. If a serious abuser has gained entry into the United States , whether legally or illegally , the INS , in close cooperation with the Department of State , has the responsibility to take action. But , rather than leaving action to the discretion of the INS , it is important to provide a means for U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to initiate requests for the INS to take action. In light of the political constraints that appear to influence the INS decision-making process in discretionary cases , it seems wise to also try to provide a mechanism for a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident to force the hand of the INS to investigate and to definitively decide whether sufficient evidence exists that an alien has committed serious human rights violations abroad to invoke the provisions of this bill . </entry.n.1995><entry.n.1996>You had also erroneously claimed that the Vietnamese adaptation of Ramayana , ' Ms Sita ' , is woven around the lives of local prince Po Liem , a local version of king Rama and his wife Sita.

The District Court was only permitted to award attorneys ' fees to the plaintiff if the plaintiff prevailed in the litigation.

The natural tendency of competitors in the market is to limit competition in order to raise profits to a maximum. A conflict is inherent.

The problem with this is that the frequency of occurrence in the language may differ from the strength of the lexical entry for a particular person; or , worse , the frequency in the language may differ systematically from how often people generally encounter the word.

A Mori poll conducted in 2002 discovered that , although numbers had increased , the make-up of the typical museumgoer had remained unchanged. What was actually happening was that the same people were going more often. And those people were , as before , the middle-class , the educated , the culturally involved . </entry.n.2393><entry.n.2394>An accrual adjusting entry can involve revenues or expenses. A service company that has earned fees , but has not yet recorded the transaction , will accrue revenue. This is done by entering an accrual adjusting entry such as a debit to the asset Accounts Receivable and a credit to Service Revenues. An adjusting entry to accrue expense is needed when a company has received a service or goods from a vendor , but the expense and the liability are not yet recorded. Gas , electricity , water , telephone , wages , interest , and repairs are examples of expenses that will likely need an accrual adjusting entry. The accrual adjusting entry for these items will include a debit to an expense and a credit to a liability account . </entry.n.2394><entry.n.2395>I.

Birkett ran against her for AG in a terrible year for Illinois Republicans2002and received 47 percent of the vote with a poorly funded campaign. As a prosecutor , Birkett is without peer and it will take a prosecutor to take the case against the entire Chicago-based Democratic ticket. Any thought that Rolando Cruz would be a serious factor against Birkett in 2006 with the preponderance of the Democratic party reeling under scandal is short-sighted. Birkett 's stock will rise with the entrance of Lisa Madigan into the race.

It might also explain the difficulties and or training needed to jump from entering a position to monitoring the position. And the transition from the trading day to the business world or even the difficulties of day trading. In pondering these matters , as invariably happens , an article in Sunday 's New York Times popped up. As with the Buddhist monks who with 10 , 000 hours of meditation have altered the physical structure of the brain to a relaxed consciousness , the trader with 10 , 000 hours of screen time may develop the neural pathways to quickly and smoothly jump from the entry mode to 'ride ' mode. 10 , 000 hours of screen time is 5.7 years of market watching -- and as is the case with many vocational trades , professions , or sports , the approximate time to achieve a master 's ticket.

In 2000 , Tom Slemen revived the story in book form as part of his Haunted Liverpool series of largely unreferenced books. Like many others in this genre , the stories they contain are presented in an entertaining , narrative style which appeals to a mass readership. In his entry on ' The Crying Boy Jinx ' Slemen states as fact that the head of the Yorkshire Fire Brigade had told newspapers that the Crying Boy print had turned up in the rubble of houses that had mysteriously burnt to the ground . According to Slemen , when journalists asked him if he believed the picture was evil , the fire chief refused to comment. </entry.n.2414><entry.n.2415>GM is at the start of what could be a significant product renaissance.

In the third group , which includes 14 processes , the first situation of failure in the first and second group is no longer possible , the filing of a proposal being the mode of entry into the procedure for processes in this group. For the second and third groups , the second and third failure situations in terms of frequency are the same as for the first group , and in relatively similar proportions , i.e. , the rejection of the proposal by the creditors and the non-performance of certain conditions accompanied by a notice of default. Based on these observations , it seems reasonable to maintain that the mode of entry into the procedure does not change the distribution of cases among the different failure scenarios. On the contrary , we are surprised to note the consistency of the distribution regardless of the mode of entry into the procedure , as if the circumstances of failure , for all failed files , could lend themselves to modelling through probability processes.17 </entry.n.2416><entry.n.2417>Burj al-Arab hotel [ 20 ] .

Although not expressly stated in the regulation , we think the second exception necessarily applies only to proposals delivered by other than electronic means. This is so because , under the protester 's alternative interpretation , late electronically transmitted proposals could be considered for award under the second exception whether or not they were received at the initial point of entry by the preceding working day; this would essentially render the first exception a nullity. Since the first exception expressly applies to electronically transmitted proposals , there is no reason to assume that such a result was intended.

One of the outstanding features is our automated Quickbooks adjusting entry technology. An imbalance is created whenever a factoring client creates invoices in offline accounting software , whether Quickbooks or any other accounting package , and then factors the invoices. The reason is that factoring is the sale of the account receivable asset in exchange for some initial cash. To correct the imbalance , adjusting journal entries must be posted to the accounting system. Most factoring clients do n't know how to do this , and their books remain out of balance until their accountant gets around to posting an adjusting journal entry , which is usually once a year.

These licenses commonly prohibited altogether any imports from foreign countries of the good in question , and limited the number of domestic producers to a handful or just one. Economists were well aware of the implications on price and production that accompanied these market interventions.

Instead of remanding the compensatory award and directing the trial court to consider it using all of the factors , the Supreme Court makes that judgment for him , with its entry of final judgment. Note that I said it was " almost " inexplicable; the best explanation I have for this is that the court unanimously felt that the compensatory remittitur motion should have been denied , so it decided to save the litigants and the trial court a step.

Edits and Deletions are available only before posting , while after posting , all corrections must be made through the reversal process. Reversing of General Journal entries will not require you to create a manual reverse transaction to back out a transaction that has already been posted. This is done automatically with the use of the Reverse button. Reversing a transaction , ( for purposes of creating an audit trail ) , effectively changes General Ledger balances back to the totals that existed before the transaction was posted. A reversing entry debits the credit account and credits the debit account of the original transaction , and it is dated the same day as the original transaction. Since it can be assumed that the reverse function is only used in conjunction with posted transactions , it must be noted that the reversal may affect your bank reconciliation.

It also was undeniably up-to-date , a vital argument in a medium-sized city that ached to be big. Odell 's most important initial asset was not in the architecture , but in his own background. Beginning with great-grandfather John Milton Odell in 1877 , A. G. Odell , Jr. 's forebears had been widely respected leaders in the development of the cotton industry in North Carolina , helping found mills in Concord , Salisbury , Durham. as well as the huge Cannon mills headquartered in Kannapolis. 38 In a society where class connection still counted for much , young Odell had automatic entry to the offices of the area 's mill owners and businessmen . </entry.n.2800><entry.n.2801>Nikon have widened the gap over Canon in this mid sector with the D300 , but there is a fair bit of new looking technology , which I hope works and lasts as well as it sounds , and at about £ 1300 quite a leap in price over the D200 's current listing ( I 'm not quibbling at value for money here ) enough almost to get another lens or a second entry level DSLR etc !

The trip round from Philipsburg is short and we arrived with an hour to spare before the bridge into the Lagoon opened , so we dropped anchor in the bay outside a large beach resort. There were several other yachts obviously awaiting entrance also at anchor. With 10 minutes to go we were summoned by the bridge master to be ready for entrance and we formed an orderly queue until a Swedish boat tried to push us out of the channel. Entry was otherwise straightforward with no dropping of fees into an old clog hanging from the end of a stick as in North Holland. Our chosen anchorage was in a reach close to the Dutch French border and we soon found a spot and settled down for the evening.

In the United States the delicate Adamesque trim soon gave way to the more robust Greek Revival , derived directly from Grecian temple architecture , but buildings retained their symmetrical forms. Larger houses in the period were often two stories tall with a gable roof and a central entry , and they were usually painted white to recall the stone structures of Greece . </entry.n.2826><entry.n.2827>Note : An origin server might wish to use a relatively new HTTP cache control feature , such as the private directive , on a network including older caches that do not understand that feature.

He was against the Oslo accords from the beginning , not because he is against peace , but because he is against tyranny he objected to the establishment of a Palestinian dictatorship. Somehow the peace-love-and-brotherhood left supported ( and still supports ) Arafat ' s terrorist dictatorship.

This allows both HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 caches to respond appropriately. An HTTP/1.1 cache , upon receiving a request , MUST use the most restrictive validator when deciding whether the client 's cache entry matches the cache 's own cache entry. This is only an issue when the request contains both an entity tag and a last-modified-date validator ( If-Modified-Since or If-Unmodified-Since ) . A note on rationale : The general principle behind these rules is that HTTP/1.1 servers and clients should transmit as much non- redundant information as is available in their responses and requests. HTTP/1.1 systems receiving this information will make the most conservative assumptions about the validators they receive. HTTP/1.0 clients and caches will ignore entity tags. Generally , last-modified values received or used by these systems will support transparent and efficient caching , and so HTTP/1.1 origin servers should provide Last-Modified values. In those rare cases where the use of a Last-Modified value as a validator by an HTTP/1.0 system could result in a serious problem , then HTTP/1.1 origin servers should not provide one . </entry.n.3073><entry.n.3074>Reply : Freelance Data Entry worker ... ... ... ... ... .I am a data entry worker with an experience of 3 years experience in the field and a very good typing speed of 75 wpm . </entry.n.3074><entry.n.3075>Policy Problem and Magnitude : The 1987 Act limits the Department ' s ability to manage immigration detention to refused entry non-citizens.

Bogost also pointed out that games have been in the news for over a century , and the crossword puzzle continues today to be an entry point to newspapers for many people. Looking to the future of news reporting , Thompson observed that newspapers can learn from games about good uses of incentives and community tools to draw readers in as contributors to news; Bogost introduced a concept he is now exploring , computational journalism , in which the people reporting news should know how to use the tools needed to create news artifacts , such as infographics and games . </entry.n.3129><entry.n.3130>To add a new contribution to the selected committee , press F10 and the contribution type menu is displayed.

These theories agree that behavior change will occur only if there is some internal or external stimulus that disrupts the existing behavior. These theories also all emphasize the importance of assessing the entry point of any audience to best determine the most effective variable to target in order to elicit behavior change . </entry.n.3329><entry.n.3330>ENTRY , commercial law.

Ornamentation is generally simple , consisting of such details as turned porch posts , decorative shingles , oversize parlor windows sometimes including etched or stained glass transoms , and simply detailed sills and windows. Earlier examples are usually narrow in width and in proportion and have steeply pitched roofs; later versions are broader with more gently sloped roofs.

Had there been evidence of such bad faith on the part of the State in its entry of a nol pros against Huntley , application of the Curley exceptions test to its actions and imposition of a Hicks dismissal may have been appropriate.

The authors develop a simple model that shows that the effects of new entry , and import competition on industry price-cost markups , depend on country size. The authors predicted that barriers to domestic entry would have a stronger anti-competitive effect in large countries , while barriers to foreign entry ( imports ) would have a stronger effect in small countries. After estimating markups for manufacturing sectors in forty-one industrial , and developing countries , they test these hypotheses , and find that the hypotheses can not be rejected by the data. For example , although Indonesia , and Italy impose the same number of regulations on the entry of new firms , the effect of the regulations on manufacturing markups is twenty percent greater in Italy because of its larger size. Similarly , while Chile and Zimbabwe have the same import penetration ration , the market discipline effect of imports is thirteen percent greater in Zimbabwe because of its smaller size . </entry.n.3657><entry.n.3658>If a cache receives a 5xx response while attempting to revalidate an entry , it MAY either forward this response to the requesting client , or act as if the server failed to respond.

The Dictionary ' s entries are semantically , not historically structured , and whilst the one might in theory coincide with the other , this will not always be so.

After a standoff between UNITE HERE Local 1 and the city 's hotel owners , the union won a new citywide contract with improved wages and benefits ( see entry on Pioneer Court ) . In the 1990s , the owners of the Congress Hotel had pulled out of the multi-employer association , so when the Congress Hotel workers ' contract expired on December 31 , 2002 , they needed to fight for their own contract. In May 2003 , the Congress Hotel submitted its final contract offer , which included severe wage and benefits cuts. In response , on June 15 , 2003 , the workers at the Congress Hotel went out on strike. As of May 26 , 2006 , the Congress Hotel workers continue to walk the picket line against the unyielding owners. The Congress Hotel picket line is a critical front in a larger struggle for the labor rights of service workers in Chicago 's massive hotel and tourism business.

At the main entrance , the protesters used cement to build a wall around 20 meters long and two meters high. Fish nets foiled those trying to enter at other points. EU fisheries and agriculture ministers had been set to meet at the building , in the European quarter of Brussels , until Wednesday.

The tendency for these more conclusive successes to favour the filing of a proposal as a mode of entry into the procedure is further confirmed by the relative importance of this mode of entry increasing from 21 to 26 , and the proportion of files initiating the procedure with a notice of intention falling below 70 . A higher proportion , among successes , of procedures initiated with the filing of a proposal can give rise to various interpretations. One possibility is that it is indicative of greater foresight or planning on the part of the entrepreneur or management team. Another possibility is a business environment that is subject to fewer chance factors. In terms of the diversity of processes and the analysis that could be carried out , successes are very similar to ongoing proposals . </entry.n.3890><entry.n.3891>33.

Obviously , the principles must serve the purpose of defending the finality of court orders , in particular the finality of the orders of superior courts of record. Moreover , such principles focus the attention both of the parties and the judges upon an understanding that such dispositions are not provisional.

The phenomenology of an experience is what it is like for the subject to have it. At any given waking moment , one normally has experiences in some ( perhaps all ) of the five sense modalities , along with proprioceptive experience of some sort. Like occurrent emotions and background moods , these contribute to one 's overall experience. Each of five sense modalities seems to be accompanied by a distinctive kind of phenomenology. Sometimes the boundaries between them can be hard to draw , for example between olfactory and gustatory phenomenology , kinesthetic experience and haptic-tactile experience ( that is , tactile experiences involving movement rather than just pressure sensation ) , and perhaps , in some cases , between the latter two and visual experience ( on the last point see Press et al. 2004 and Kennett et al. 2001 ) .

For instance , suppose there was a creature , Swampman , who suddenly popped into existence due to random conglomeration of particles , and happened to be an intrinsic molecular duplicate of , say , Jerry Fodor. Pure externalist theories ( that is , theories that hold that the only way mental states can have content is by standing in the right external relations to the subject 's environment ) are committed to denying that Swampman would have any contentful mental states.

Internalism about phenomenology is the thesis that intrinsic duplicates are phenomenal duplicates. Externalism about phenomenology is the denial of this thesis , on the grounds that phenomenology is determined in part by factors outside a subject 's skin. Externalism about phenomenology is sometimes motivated by representationalism about phenomenology combined with externalism about content. If one is externalist about experiential content , and if one holds that the content and the phenomenology of an experience co-vary , then one must also be an externalist about phenomenology. This thesis is defended by Dretske ( 1995 ) and Lycan ( 2001 ) , and criticized by Block ( 1990 ) and ( 1996 ) .

More revealing are the instances of professional and social mobility : only two of the grammarians are said to have left positions at Bordeaux to teach elsewhere , one apparently out of financial necessity , another out of ambition. [ 26 ] None achieved the success of several of the rhetoricians , whose fame made them sought , or drove them to chairs at Rome or Constantinople , bringing reflected glory to Bordeaux. [ 27 ] No doubt such men may have been more talented in their metier than their colleagues among the grammatici . Yet one suspects that beneath the language of fame and compulsion lie the workings of patronage ( which we will have occasion to examine in a later chapter ) and that patronage at the level necessary for such brilliant success was more easily available to the rhetoricians of Bordeaux than to the grammarians. That suspicion is hardly diminished by the other clear distinction between the two groups of teachers , the opportunity for entry into the imperial service : all the professores who rose to the governing class had first been rhetoricians.

For example , suppose that an application needs to prompt for a date. One could do this with a blank text entry box and no hint , expecting the user to type MM/DD/YYYY , e.g. , 09/28/1963 for September 28 , 1963. If the user 's input did not match this pattern or the date did not exist , e.g. , 02/30/2002 , the application returns a page explaining the requirements. A minor improvement would be to add a note next to the box : " MM/DD/YYYY " . If the application logs showed that the number of error pages served was reduced , but not eliminated , perhaps defaulting the text entry box to today 's date in MM/DD/YYYY format would be better.

In the past century , however , economists have widened their focus on barriers to entry to include those that do not prevent new firms from entering a market , but instead raise the costs faced by new firms. This type of barrier allows the already-existing firm some degree of market power to set its price higher than the competitive price , but usually not as high as it could if rival firms were completely prohibited . </entry.n.4111><entry.n.4112>IMMEDIATE DELIVERY ( ID ) : An entry document ( CF-3461 ) filed with Customs by the importer.

It has been characterised as the UK ' Bill of rights , and has affected almost all areas of law and policy. Five years after its implementation and seven years after its introduction to Parliament , the Act is said to have changed the way the UK ' s immigration law is interpreted and applied , while immigration policies are being adapted to be in line with the principles underlying the Act. This essay will critically examine the impact of the Human Rights Act on the country ' s immigration law , outlining how the various rights enshrined in its articles have changed the way foreign nationals are treated by UK public authorities when deciding on issues of deportation , extradition , granting entry and leave to remain.

The suspicion of a Customs agent was alerted because of the manner in which Elvey 's picture had been inserted in substitution of the original picture on the passport. It evidently was skeptical about the reasons given by Elvey for his entry and his statements that he would leave a few days thereafter.

This is the old guy who writes as Sebastian Rasalingam in newspapers and blogs , fixated on the word ' Arasu ' in ITAK; in his mind , Sinhalese treated him better than the way Tamils did; Caste conscious Tamil society had treated him badly as an untouchable in the 1940 s and 50 s. I am sympathetic to the fact that caste in Jaffna was an abomination at that time , even though I wasn t born then , but he gets everything wrong based on his bad experiences. If ITAK wanted separation and not federalism from the beginning , why would they have gone through all the negotiations , and why would they have waited all those years for the Vaddukkoddai resolution ? The truth is that SJV and GG might have played competitive politics , but neither really wanted a separate country in those years; I can speak authoritatively on this as a grand uncle of mine was an MP close to SJV at that time , and GG s close relatives were our neighbors; my grand uncle was somewhat progressive and helped the temple entry movement , etc.; he and his colleagues in ITAK had no real desire for a separate country . </entry.n.4304><entry.n.4305>The act provides that after having been notified as described above in " Continuing law " that the tract of land or town lot has been twice offered for sale and not sold for want of bidder , the court must notify the political subdivision in which the property is located and offer to forfeit the property to the political subdivision , or to an electing subdivision ( see COMMENT 4 ) , upon a petition from the political subdivision.

In a decree of 92 B.C. the censors attempted to close the schools of Latin rhetoric on the grounds that they contradicted the " habit and custom of the elders " ( consuetudo ac mos maiorum ) : [ 78 ] the mos , we can infer , was the novitiate of the forum ( tirocinium fori ) , the traditional form of apprenticeship for public life , through which the prospective man of affairs attached himself as a youth to an established figure , learning how to act and speak as he followed his model and watched him go about his business. By its nature the tirocinium was part of a closed and rigid system that monopolized entry to a civic career. Access depended heavily on the ascribed status of the participants and the connections of family and friendship , and its methods were informal , based upon the personal relationship between the younger and the older man.

However , when true inventory carrying costs are factored into the operating strategy , the way managers approach the strategy changes. The manufacturing function begins to see that the best operating strategy mirrors the demand stream. Long production cycles are replaced by weekly cycles. The best companies move from weekly to daily cycles where every product is produced every day. This often requires significant changes to the manufacturing process , but the cost savings can be substantial. The combination of continuous replenishment and a highly responsive supply chain can become a barrier to entry for competitors. Establishing tight communications and low inventories creates the " integrated , seamless pipeline " that is very difficult for other suppliers to compete against . </entry.n.4494><entry.n.4495>The team should reach consensus on whether a potential defect is , in fact , a real defect.

These are considered defects as well and must be logged as such , even though resolution steps outside the bounds of the author ' s work. During this process the recorder will note down every defect , its reproduction criteria or location as appropriate , and classify the defect. Ideally , if defect tracking software is readily available and defect entry is efficient enough that it will not slow down the inspection meeting , direct entry into the system is favorable.

Using the example of his current work on women who become designers through playing The Sims , Gee suggested that passion , although treated as a trivial factor in schools , is the key to deep learning. Gee and Jenkins also agreed that the communities surrounding games play a critical role in creating space for discussion and mentorship that cultivates learning. Although these best features of learning in game communities are hard to replicate in schools , both Gee and Jenkins suggested that the institution of school is in need and on the verge of a paradigm shift. Responding to a question from the audience , Jenkins observed that the term serious games may displace fun , a key entry point into gaming in the first place , and instead suggested that we need to harness the power of play . </entry.n.4623><entry.n.4624>You hereby acknowledge that you have read , understand and agree to the terms and conditions of the Submission Agreement including , without limitation , the license you granted to the Sponsor pursuant to Section 1 of the Submission Agreement.

Traditionally , entry vocabulary has been thought of as synonyms and quasi-synonyms of the main heading ( quasi-synonyms are nonsynonymous terms which are otherwise indicative of the same concept , e.g. , " dryness " would be a quasi-synonym of " wetness. " ) ( National Information Standards Organization , 1994 ) . Soergel ( 1985 , p.. 219 ) refers to these relationships as " equivalency " , though we would prefer to reserve that term as describing , in a mathematical sense , the essential relationship of synonymy. Moreover , these equivalence relationships are not the only ones appropriate in entry vocabulary. In MeSH , the presence of an entry term can be interpreted as an indicator that the Main Heading is the appropriate method of representing that specific meaning for the purpose of organizing literature. In an environment in which MeSH is used , the Main Heading could be used as an appropriate substitute for the entry term. This type of relationship can thus be thought of as substitutionary . </entry.n.4633><entry.n.4634>The entry thermal control phase is designed to keep the thermal protection system 's bond line within design limits.

In Pennsylvania for example , the proposed merger of Highmark and Independence Blue Cross would have combined the dominant insurers in two large distinct geographic regions of the state. Evidence provided to the State indicated that numerous attempts by regional and national firms such as Aetna and Coventry to enter both markets had proved unsuccessful over the years. Expert studies suggested that a variety of factors including brand loyalty , difficulties in securing physician and hospital network contracts , regulatory and information gathering costs , and obstacles created by the contracting practices of incumbent providers , thwarted entry.

The ring of the walls visible today , already present in the 6th cent. BC , is over 3200 m long : it is generally a solid ring of wall , protected on the outside by a moat and inside by an embankment , atop which runs the patrol walkway. Twelve towers to the north , where the flat ground made Pompeii most vulnerable , also ensured its defense.

But , the asset has value only if the firm expects to pay taxes in the future. For example , an NOL carryforward is worthless if the firm does not expect to have positive taxable income for the next 20 years. Since accounting is conservative , firms must reduce the value of their deferred tax assets by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This is a contra-asset account ( CR balance on the B/S - just like accumulated depreciation or the allowance for uncollectible accounts ) that reduces the deferred tax asset to its expected realizable value.

This chapter will explore the relationships represented in MeSH in the light of that understanding. Every term that occurs may be thought of as representing a concept. One or more terms , comprising one or more concepts , grouped together for important reasons , form a descriptor class. The descriptor class is the basic building block of the thesaurus. Relationships among concepts can be represented explicitly in the thesaurus , most notably as relationships within the descriptor class. Hierarchical relationships are at the level of the descriptor class. The hierarchies are key in allowing expanded retrievals. The hierarchical relationships , traditionally thought of as broader or narrower ( parent-child ) relationships , are better understood as representing broader and narrower retrieval sets. Nevertheless , these hierarchical relationships often reflect important broader-narrower relationships between preferred concepts in descriptor classes. Other types of relationships present in the thesaurus include associative relationships , such as the Pharmacologic Actions or see-related cross references , as well as forbidden combination expressions , such as the Entry Combination . </entry.n.4922><entry.n.4923>Students may withdraw from open registration and most selective entry courses until the end of the eighth week of a semester.

One must suppose either that Clark wrote both the Field Notes and Codex B simultaneously , with considerable difference in wording , or that he wrote the codex entry later , without taking into account his knowledge that Floyd had died. This journalistic convention persists throughout the journals and , of course , complicates the problem of determining the time of writing of particular entries.

The Boston Public Library ( 1887-1895 ) , designed by the New York architectural firm of McKim , Mead , and White , provided a model for this kind of public grandeur. Inspiration for the library ' s sumptuous entry staircase and voluminous upstairs reading room came from ancient Roman and Italian Renaissance sources. Although McKim , Mead , and White received many commissions for city townhouses and for summerhouses in the country , they specialized in major urban buildings. One of their best was the spacious Pennsylvania Station ( 1902-1910 ) in New York City. The train station ' s soaring public spaces provided a majestic gateway to the city; it was demolished in 1963 , however , to make room for Madison Square Garden. Equally expansive is Union Station ( 1903-1907 ) in Washington , D.C. , designed by Daniel H. Burnham. Both of these vast railway stations used classical Roman elements in their broad exteriors and barrel vaults ( ceilings in the form of a half-cylinder ) or groin vaults ( intersecting barrel vaults , with ridges called groins at the intersections ) for their huge interior spaces . </entry.n.4965><entry.n.4966>1.

Market power can only exist if there are impediments , called " barriers to entry , " that prevent new firms like Sheila 's from entering a market and competing on equal terms with firms , like Chris 's , already in the market.3 The types and sources of these impediments were examined by many early economists , and are the subject of the following sections . </entry.n.5045><entry.n.5046>So Serjeant Salkeld , who comes down to the time of Queen Ann , refers to Beecher 's Case for the law of retraxit , and gives the definition of retraxit in the words of the entry of a nolle prosequi , Title Retraxit , 3 Salk.

The more volatile an institution 's payment activity , the longer the interval that should be selected for analysis. The analysis will need to incorporate all operational areas with access to payment systems. In addition to large dollar funds and book entry securities transfer activity , the review should address check clearing , ACH , currency operations , and other payment activity that results in relatively large value settlement obligations.

In total , 38 non-native terrestrial snail/slug species have become established , originating globally. Numbers on each island do not reflect numbers of survey locations but rather the total numbers established on each island. Species richness and community composition in nurseries differed significantly among islands and among different-sized nurseries. Certain species were more common on Oahu ( main port of entry to Hawaii ) so most of these alien species may have been first introduced to Oahu and then spread to other islands. Some of them cause damage in nurseries. Some may cause shipments of nursery products to be rejected when they are inadvertently exported with them. When they are transported to and become established in new areas they may cause agricultural , horticultural and environmental problems. Greater awareness of these species is necessary in the nursery industry and among quarantine officials . </entry.n.5283><entry.n.5284>STATELY STONE MANOR HOME IN IMPECCABLE CONDITION.

In May and June 2008 , asylum seekers , refugees , and migrants told Human Rights Watch researchers of abuses perpetrated by RELA members and immigration officers during the arrest process and in the immigration detention centers. Such abuses included physical assault , intimidation , threats , humiliating treatment , forced entry into living quarters , extortion , theft , restricted communications with friends or family , and disregard and destruction of identity or residency papers. Several Malaysian officials have excused the abuses suggesting that the number of abusers is insignificant and that reasonable force is sometimes justified.

When you actually decide that a particular debt is not collectable , you would not make an entry to the " bad debt expense " account.

We conclude that the government sustained its burden of justifying the warrantless entry of the premises in which Johnson resided and that the crack cocaine found in the premises was discovered during the course of that search. The District Court 's order denying Johnson 's motion to suppress the crack cocaine was correct and the judgment of conviction will be affirmed. Following Johnson 's failure to appear in Camden County Court and his conviction in absentia for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and 2 attempting to elude the police a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.

Chinese scholars , according to this line , are actually very bullish about everything happening in China and agree very broadly on the measures that have been taken , and so the opinions of foreign worriers should be heavily discounted because clearly they can not know more than the locals . </entry.n.5542><entry.n.5543>The choice of dose ( s ) used in the study should be justified by the subsequent market entry sponsor.

For more information on this process , refer to " MA21 - Menu of A21 Certification Commands " . ) Whenever you change a distribution via the PD command to add a center or centers requiring A21 certification , it will be performed through the window accessed by the PF9 key in PD.

The government will require all Palestinian holders of foreign passports to leave the country every three months in order to obtain a visa , as is the case for any foreigner. Obtaining the visa is dependent on two factors : one is the mood of the soldiers on duty occupying the borders , and the second is what is written in the computer. Many foreigners and Palestinians have inexplicable black-marks next to their names , which makes their entry extremely difficult. Some are required to spend hours with Israeli interrogators before gaining entrance , while others are not allowed entrance at all. Others still breeze through without question . </entry.n.5567><entry.n.5568>Moreover , Mr. Wangrin tells the story about how the Texas schools -- particularly the University of Texas -- insisted upon more stringent entrance requirements for student-athletes in the new Big 12 Conference , which was a key development in the decline of Nebraska 's football powerhouse. For decades , Big Red 's program thrived in the Big 8 Conference on recruiting out-of-state players who did not meet many big school 's entrance requirements , but who were able to meet NU 's lenient entry requirements for football players -- remember Mike Rozier ? . However , the leveling of entrance requirements in the Big 12 has slowed down the flow in the pipeline of out-of-state players to Nebraska , as the 5-6 record from last season ( the worst since 1961 ) reflects. The most recent change in coaching staffs indicates that Nebraska is taking a different approach from the one that had been followed successfully for the past 45 years ( indeed , it appears that arch-rival Oklahoma is the now the model for Nebraska 's program ) , but it is still too early to say whether the Nebraska program can regain its stature among the elite college football programs . </entry.n.5568><entry.n.5569>23 The Editors reserve the right , acting reasonably , to change the rules applicable to any competition or to void any competition at any time and for any reason.
