<legislation.n.train><legislation.n.1>Lord Atkin stated , at p9 : " I find the result to be that the employer is alleged to have committed a breach of a duty owed by him to his servant to take a particular precaution ( namely , support of the roof ) for his servant 's safety whereby the servant was injured. In my opinion that state of facts constitutes negligence of the employer; and I am unable to conceive of any accurate definition of negligence which could exclude it. All that is necessary to show is a duty to take care to avoid injuring; and if the particular care to be taken is prescribed by statute , and the duty to the injured person to take the care is likewise imposed by statute , and the breach is proved , all the essentials of negligence are present. I can not think that the true position is , as appears to be suggested , that in such cases negligence only exists where the tribunal of fact agrees with the Legislature that the precaution is one that ought to be taken. The very object of the legislation is to put that particular precaution beyond controversy.

The Court distinguished the Lochner case , where an employer 's " liberty to contract " outweighed the state 's interest to regulate bakery employees ' hours , from this case , which took into account the physical differences between men and women. The Court took judicial notice ( based upon a famous brief submitted by then-lawyer , Louis D. Brandeis ) of the belief that " women 's physical structure and the function she performs ... justify special legislation restricting the conditions under which she should be permitted to toil.

Equality at the workplace began in the early 1950 's with prohibition of discharging pregnant workers , received a significant impetus in the mid-1970 's with a National Labour Court judgment invalidating a section of a collective agreement which discriminated against women flight attendants and blossomed in the 1980 's and 1990 's with comprehensive legislation . </legislation.n.6><legislation.n.7>List of agricultural legislation - Detailed list of relevant legislation.

With a stable and growing economy , problems of urban unemployment will be less severe , and there will be more resources to help the unemployed and create new jobs. If the government is able , as it is expected , to pass legislation to change the rules of the civil service , the quality of services is likely to improve , and the resources will be used more rationally. Beyond that , the government will need the mobilization and support of society to gather additional resources to provide better living conditions and more opportunities to the poor , and to dislodge the vested interests that are responsible for the enormous distortions in the allocation of resources in the social realm. It must come to a consensus about the proper policies to implement in critical areas such as health , or in attention to special and underprivileged groups such as the black population and the urban poor. It will have to work in close association with state and local governments , which must assume growing responsibilities in the administration and financing of social policies . </legislation.n.9><legislation.n.10>The Republican Party was not so badly split as the Democrats by the civil rights issue. Only one Republican senator participated in the filibuster against the bill. In fact , since 1933 , Republicans had a more positive record on civil rights than the Democrats. In the twenty-six major civil rights votes since 1933 , a majority of Democrats opposed civil rights legislation in over 80 of the votes. By contrast , the Republican majority favored civil rights in over 96 of the votes . </legislation.n.10><legislation.n.11>Correction of weak performance would come about if there were greater opportunities for those affected by legislation to seek redress from regulators when legislation is wrongly implemented. Improved risk assessment on behalf of regulators would mean that , in practice , such compensation should be necessary in very few cases. If risk assessment is working well , then an investigation into a low-risk business will quickly be closed , with minimal cost to both sides. If this does not happen in many cases , the regulator 's risk profiling must be improved. In other words , if the regulator 's risk assessment procedure is functioning properly , it should have nothing to fear from providing appropriate compensation; if it is not functioning properly , it is all the more urgent that such compensation should be available . </legislation.n.11><legislation.n.12>B. constitutional as long as the PTO Commissioner performs some function that support Congress , e.g. , preparing reports on proposed legislation . </legislation.n.12><legislation.n.13>Database of studies of implementation of EU legislation , produced and managed by Dimiter Toshkov of Leiden University with the support of the Institute for European Integration Research at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

Formal consultations should occur very early on in the process when proposals are being formulated , and continue as necessary at further stages thereafter. For complex pieces of legislation , there will need to be many rounds of consultation. If legislation is to be successful , it should not be rushed; imposing strict deadlines for introducing legislation can result in inadequate consultation with stakeholders. There also needs to be a suitable period of time after consultation and before implementation during which those affected by the legislation can take on board any guidance provided to them explaining the policy changes. That guidance must always be clear , accurate and widely published . </legislation.n.23><legislation.n.24>Environmental Law covers the major federal laws and programs for environmental protection. These laws and programs include the National Environmental Policy Act; Clean Water Act; Clean Air Act; Toxic Substances Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; wildlife laws; landform preservation laws; and public resource laws. In this class , federal laws are compared to state and local legislation and common law remedies. Issues of economics and technology , tactics of environmental litigation , legislative lobbying , and administrative agency enforcement are explored . </legislation.n.24><legislation.n.25>The Basic Law : Freedom of Occupation makes freedom of occupation a constitutional right. This has been held by the Supreme Court to restrict unreasonable or not proportionate legislation to limit people from doing certain types of work , such as a real estate agent or importer of non-kosher food. A recent landmark judgment of the National Labour Court held that covenants not to compete were not enforceable unless the worker revealed trade secrets to his new employer. This judgment emphasized the constitutional right of freedom of occupation , freedom of movement for workers and their right to chose their workplace. 1 </legislation.n.25><legislation.n.26>A major emphasis given to the new disability legislation by the DLCG concerns the development of positive and enforceable rights for people with disabilities that go beyond anti-discrimination. A shift to a rights-based approach was first signalled in A Strategy for Equality , the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. In the area of anti-discrimination , disability is also one of the nine grounds covered in the Employment Equality Act ( 1998 ) and the Equal Status Act ( 2000 ) . </legislation.n.26><legislation.n.27>How has the Caribbean access legislation contributed to good governance ? Although there has been discussion in the ambit of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and other international groupings , only a minority of countries in the Englishspeaking Caribbean have passed such legislation. The four countries which have done so Belize , Trinidad and Tobago , Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda have made some progress , and that experience will be relevant to the development of access legislation in those countries where bills are under discussion. Three other countries Guyana , British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands have bills under discussion in Parliament as well as in the media. The other countries of the Caribbean Single Market have not taken any steps towards putting such legislation in place. It is possible that the discussion of the Caribbean Human Rights Treaty will stimulate further progress towards drafting and passage of national access legislation . </legislation.n.27><legislation.n.28>Records held by the external service provider are only disposed of in accordance with an approved records retention and disposal schedule and with the approval , or authorisation , of the responsible originating or controlling government agency , as required by the relevant archival legislation , or other instrument.

Some observers have raised concerns about the potential for money laundering in the free trade zones , and it is unclear if the pending legislation will address this issue.

In 59 per cent of SOCs and GTEs ( Group 2 ) the Minister appointed the CEO. However , the SOC legislation allows for board appointment of the CEO in the case of company SOCs ( there are only two ) . This practice has also been followed for the electricity and rail corporations ( Type Two SOCs ) . With these exceptions , appointment of the CEO in statutory SOCs is made by the Governor on the recommendation of the portfolio Minister and the board. It seems that in some cases , the board has considerable influence in board appointments and , in others , there is little or no influence ( see below ) . </legislation.n.30><legislation.n.31>On August 29 , 2008 , the California Legislature passed A.B. 437 which would amend California law to clarify the applicable statute of limitations in employment discrimination cases. Under this bill , the statute of limiations runs from teh date of each payment of a discriminatory wage or other unlawful act. Similar legislation to amend Title VII has not made its way through the U.S. Congress. It will be interesting to see if Gov. Schwarzenegger signs this bill into law . </legislation.n.31><legislation.n.32>The Money Laundering ( Prevention ) Act ( MLPA ) , in force since 1996 , criminalizes money laundering related to many serious crimes , including drug-trafficking , forgery , terrorism , blackmail , arms trafficking , kidnapping , fraud , illegal deposit taking , false accounting , counterfeiting , extortion , robbery , and theft. The minimum penalty for a money laundering offense as defined by the MLPA is three years imprisonment. Additional legislation has been enacted to discourage individuals from engaging in money laundering , and there have been two arrests for money laundering in 2005. The effectiveness of the anti-money laundering regime in Belize remains unclear . </legislation.n.32><legislation.n.33>If memorials reflected the grassroots work of commercial organizations , their public face throughout the 1890s was a single individual : Jay Torrey. After revising the Lowell bill in the late 1880s , Torrey spent the next decade tirelessly campaigning for the bill in the corridors of Congress. Both supporters and opponents of the legislation made frequent reference to Torrey 's role. In 1893 , Republican congressman Oates of Alabama , the floor manager of the bill , noted that the Judiciary Committee had frequently invited Torrey to come and answer questions about the proposed legislation. Although Democrat William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska opposed the legislation , he had effusive praise for Torrey. " I have never known of any person interested in the passage of a bill , " Bryan said on the floor of the House , " who seems to be so fair in the presentation of a case. " 38 ( The year 1898 proved to be an eventful one for Torrey. In addition to seeing the bankruptcy legislation finally enacted , Torrey achieved a small measure of fame as one of the Rough Riders who was in Cuba when Theodore Roosevelt stormed San Juan Hill . ) </legislation.n.33><legislation.n.34>42.

That is nearly an entire year with no action or any willingness to depart from a federally mandated approach , only an interest in politicizing the issue . </legislation.n.37><legislation.n.38>The politics of civil rights legislation can be viewed from a number of perspectives. In general , the political situation reflected the nation 's social transition in its uncertainty and ambiguity. Although a consensus favoring civil rights legislation eventually emerged , it is difficult to point to specific political trends that dominated the process. Political factors influenced different people in contrasting ways. The impact of politics was complicated and diffuse. One way to understand the role of politics in the enactment of civil rights legislation , however , is to look at the way President John F. Kennedy approached the legislation. In a very important sense , Kennedy came to endorse a civil rights bill because political circumstances allowed him to support what once had been a controversial and unpopular legislative program . </legislation.n.38><legislation.n.39>The Chancellery of the Prime Minister has little sectoral policy expertise. The cabinet agenda division , which reviews incoming draft bills for the prime minister , does not have sufficient resources to analyze the content of proposals , but focuses rather on technical information regarding the legislative process. The government legislation center , which reports to the Chancellery , focuses on monitoring the regulatory impact assessment ( RIA ) done in the line ministries. It examines the formal correctness of RIA , but does not deal with the content of draft bills . </legislation.n.39><legislation.n.40>The aim of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy ( CSME ) is to create a single economic space where people , goods , services and capital move freely. This is expected to take effect in 2008 with the participation of the 14 member states of the Caribbean community. The agreement for the first stage of the CSME , the Single Market was signed in January 2006 and preparation for the final stages of the CSME is now ongoing. The implementation of the CSME will require the harmonization and coordination of social , economic and trade policies , including the Draft Provisions for the Protection of Caribbean [ CARICOM ] Human Rights. Implicit in these provisions is the expectation that those countries which do not yet have national access legislation will be encouraged to develop their own laws compatible with regional provisions . </legislation.n.40><legislation.n.41>To acknowledge that this is the case is not to be cynical , but it is to recognize that democratic politics is inevitably driven by the struggles for advantage among competing interests as well as ideals. What is accepted as legitimate in the use of governmental power depends very much , therefore , on the balance of power in society. Beem is right to think that it is impossible to govern well without engaging in some degree of legislation on sensitive moral issues. But different parties will have different views about which forms of this activity are appropriate , and what actually happens is usually determined more by their electoral fortunes -- and thus the mood of the electorate -- than by any sort of principled understanding of the role and limits of government . </legislation.n.41><legislation.n.42>We heard different views about the sustainable development principles from staff. Many thought the sustainable development principles were well understood and well used. They cited , as illustrations , legislation that referred to sustainable development , such as the Land Transport Management Act 2003 and the Local Government Act 2002; initiatives such as the Govt3 programme; 7 and strategies to manage biodiversity or fisheries. Others thought the sustainable development principles presented staff with challenges and were a struggle to understand . </legislation.n.42><legislation.n.43>Payoff differences may also be related to a firm 's position in the market. When a threat aims to eliminate barriers to entry and make a market more competitive , a dominant firm that enjoys quasi-monopolistic rents will suffer harsher consequences than will a laggard operating on the fringe of the market. Difference in legal status may also produce payoff disparities , as when a threatened legislation ends the valuable SRO status that several firms in the group may presently enjoy.303 Different risk preferences and risk-bearing capabilities may similarly produce payoff variations. Lastly , differences in entities ' investment horizons may also affect their perception of the game 's payoffs . </legislation.n.43><legislation.n.44>Oct. 3 Senate Majority Leader Thomas A.

A new law , The Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act 2005 ( AMLTF ) , has been drafted to replace the MLPA from 2002. The new legislation was to have been presented to the cabinet for approval in mid-December 2005. After Cabinet approval it will be vetted by the Law Ministry and then presented to Parliament. Reportedly , the current draft addresses most of the shortcomings in prior legislation noted in last year ? s INCSR report . </legislation.n.45><legislation.n.46>This is an area involving " the penumbra of express statutory mandates " to be solved " by looking at the policy of the legislation and fashioning a remedy that will effectuate that policy. " Lincoln Mills , supra , at 457. Although there is a general policy favoring arbitration , I do not find that Congress intended to extend that policy here. Application of the " presumption of arbitrability " is not inevitable in every labor dispute. But miners ' determination to act to protect their own safety is as inevitable in labor disputes as elsewhere. Absent any presumption , I can not find that the dispute here was arbitrable or that the union was under any duty not to strike. It follows then , as the Court of Appeals found , that there was no wrong to remedy . </legislation.n.46><legislation.n.47>It is the intention of this work to examine the early development of ancient monument and listed building legislation in England and Wales and the associated official and unofficial policies that are related to it through , as far as possible , the words of those intimately connected with it. This is partly to determine the intentions of the movers and proposers of the Acts themselves , rather than later commentaries and also to set these developments within the framework of other nineteenth century legislation that set the trends and methodology for future legislation. Special attention will be paid to the relationship between buildings and archaeological sites and the problems arising therefrom. It will also be necessary to examine other areas of law such as that relating to the environment and planning and the use of secondary legislation where it directly affects the protection and use of the built historic landscape . </legislation.n.47><legislation.n.48>The International Business Companies Act of 1990 and its 1995 and 1999 amendments govern the operation of IBCs. The 1999 amendment to the Act allows IBCs to operate as banks and insurance companies. The International Financial Services Commission regulates the rest of the offshore sector. All IBCs must be registered. Registered agents of IBCs must satisfy the International Financial Services Commission that they conduct due diligence background checks before IBCs are allowed to register. Although IBCs are allowed to issue bearer shares , the registered agents of such companies , must know the identity of the beneficial owners of the bearer shares. In addition , registered agents must satisfy certain criteria to obtain licenses in order to perform offshore services. Belize ? s legislation on IBCs allows for the appointment of nominee directors. The legislation for trust companies , the Belize Trust Act , 1992 , is not as stringent as the legislation for other offshore financial services and does not preclude the appointment of nominee trustees . </legislation.n.48><legislation.n.49>The Government of Belgium ( GOB ) recognizes the particular importance of the diamond industry , as well as the potential vulnerabilities it presents to the financial sector. As such , the GOB has distributed typologies outlining its experiences in pursuing money laundering cases involving the diamond trade , especially those involving the trafficking of African conflict diamonds. The Belgian financial intelligence unit ( FIU ) , known in French as Cellule de Traitement des Informations Financi ? res and in Flemish as Cel voor Financi ? le Informatieverwerking ( CTIF-CFI ) , is active in this area. It has initiated several meetings with the Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs and the High Council for Diamonds in order to clarify the obligations of diamond traders with respect to anti-money laundering and antiterrorist financing laws. The Belgian FIU also initiated a sector-wide inquiry in order to verify how diamond traders apply this legislation . </legislation.n.49><legislation.n.50>Recreational Fishing Legislation - A summary of legislation applying to recreational fishing.

Taking the legal framework as a foundation to administrative decision-making , the course blends practical considerations such as economic , psychological , philosophical , and sociological factors. For instance , we will pose and advise administrators on consequences of pending legislation in three states that plan to mimic language from Proposal 2 in Michigan , the anti-affirmative action in college admissions referendum. Connecting that discussion , we will debate issues of privilege , bias , and discrimination and question social science research in favor and in opposition to affirmative action. In addition , we will discuss the administrative tensions resulting from the state bills known as the Academic Bill of Rights , which has sparked tension between administrators and state legislators. Infused with that discussion , we will address whether " liberal " indoctrination is pervasive in college classrooms and discuss how far faculty and students can speak freely at various venues and when speech turns into indoctrination and/or harassment/intimidation. Also , we will tackle " new " forms of harassment on-campus in light of Facebook.com and with the presence of other cyber fora as well as discuss various campus safety challenges . </legislation.n.51><legislation.n.52>The second policy route is the traditional approach of legislation and regulation. Governments already have of course numerous legislative instruments that regulate corporate behaviour in areas that are part of the corporate citizenship agenda , such as the environment , health and safety , consumer affairs , competition , and corporate governance. That companies need to observe existing laws in order to be considered socially responsible has always been a key tenet of earlier models of corporate citizenship and is a largely uncontested view. ( 43 ) The more recent regulation debate with respect to corporate citizenship , however , has been about whether governments need to introduce additional forms of legislation to regulate behaviour in areas such as social and environmental reporting , financial investment and human rights. Unfortunately , the debate has tended to become stuck in a 'voluntarism versus regulation ' framework with the relevant parties unable or unwilling to see their respective merits and flaws. ( 44 ) </legislation.n.52><legislation.n.53>The terms DWI and DUI are synonymous and generally refer to the same offense. It is important to remember that a DWI offense is really two cases in one. There is a criminal case where the accused party faces jail time and fines. There is also a civil case which results in a license revocation or cancellation. This civil revocation is also referred to as an Implied Consent violation under the State 's Implied Consent laws. Civil actions may also have additional potential penalties including plate impoundments , and even vehicle forfeitures for repeat offenders. Each part , the civil and criminal cases , have different prosecutors and different court procedures , although the defenses are often very similar. This means that even if you prevail on the criminal part of the case , your driving record may reflect that you have a alcohol related offense that will affect your insurance and/or become an aggravating factor should you have a similar charge in the future. The DWI laws are constantly changing. Each new year brings new legislation and increasingly harsh consequences for DWI offenses. In order to explain why this is significant , a brief overview of the legislature ' s recent history may be in order . </legislation.n.53><legislation.n.54>... the appellant was made by the relevant legislation a governmental body. The responsible Minister was given important powers to control boards ... an appointment of a chief officer or deputy chief officer was subject to the Minister 's approval and he was also given power to control many other matters pertaining to boards ... including budgetary control ... the Minister had power to recommend the dissolution of a board ... Another reflection of the board 's status , as an emanation of government , was that it was given power to make by-laws and to impose penalties for breaches of the by-laws it made.7 </legislation.n.54><legislation.n.55>I failed to mention the family whose efforts initiated the legislation , George III and Maureen Smith and their daughter Bree Smith of Greenwich Connecticut. After George IV disappeared from Royal Caribbean 's Brilliance of the Seas in July 2005 , the Smiths contacted their Congressman , Chris Shays ( R-CT ) , who convened a series of hearings in December 2005 and March 2006.

The Federal OH &amp;S regime relies heavily on the assistance of the States for its enforcement and is largely characterised as having a reactive rather than proactive investigative and enforcement culture. Despite its lack of exposure to significant industries such as mining , Comcare stated in its submission to the review on 22 February 2008 that it has a model in place to expand its coverage and that the Federal OH &amp;S legislation provides an adequate scheme for ensuring safety in all Australian workplaces . </legislation.n.57><legislation.n.58>1 ) No one should pay any attention to any rumors , if any such rumors even exist , that Senator McCain co-sponsored legislation to revoke statehood for Florida and Ohio. McCain , who is from Arizona , did not try to harm millions of Americans living in Florida and Ohio. There is no reason to think that McCain is an enemy of Florida and Ohio. Or Colorado or Virginia . </legislation.n.58><legislation.n.59>( 3 ) The Judiciary. The judicial machinery of the provinces is administered , subject to the laws passed in the provincial legislature , by a member of the cabinet known as the attorney-general. The organization of the higher courts of the province is regulated by provincial legislation; and the judges in these courts are appointed by the Dominion government , as we have seen , and are removable only by the Dominion parliament. But the police magistrates and justices of the peace are appointed by the provincial government , and are removable by it. The province may set up any courts of first instance it likes , such as women 's courts , children 's courts , domestic relations courts , and traffic courts; but an appeal may as a rule be taken from these courts to those higher courts which come more especially under the oversight of the Dominion government. There is thus a guarantee that justice in the various provinces shall be fairly uniform in its character . </legislation.n.59><legislation.n.60>It will be important to ensure that any legislation that is promoted forms part of a logical and cohesive structure. If employment legislation is to be introduced over a period of time , it should not be done in such a way that a confusing jigsaw results but rather as part of a logical and orderly scheme. The effect of the pending Human Rights Law has already been mentioned , but another area actively under review by the Legislation Committee is that of race relations. The ESSC will be consulting closely with the Working Group charged with that research. It is suggested that the States would be well advised to prepare the business community for the introduction of new legislative measures over a period of time. During the transitional period whilst the Minimum Wage policy was being drafted for the States debate the business community had time to accustom itself to the idea.

Terms and conditions of employment were regulated by statutes and the common law. The law of contract in Kenya was originally based on the Contract Act , 1872 , of India , which applied on contracts made or entered into before 1st of January 1961. The Indian Contract Act applied to the three countries Kenya , Tanzania and Uganda . Since then the Kenyan law of contract has been based on the English common law of contract , under the Kenyan Law of Contract Act ( Cap. 23 ) , section 2 ( 1 ) . </legislation.n.64><legislation.n.65>Senator Joe Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , has not endorsed either Senator Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. But on Thursday , February 14 , he is trying to rush Obama 's " Global Poverty Act " ( S.2433 ) through his committee. The legislation would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid , which amounts to a phenomenal 13-year total of $ 845 billion over and above what the U.S. already spends . </legislation.n.65><legislation.n.66>A principles-based approach to decision-making and policy development offers a more flexible , less prescriptive mechanism for carrying out the activities of government , and is being applied more commonly in drawing up legislation and in other areas of public sector activity.

Senator Murray and I are standing up once again to the administration against this rule and will continue to fight for women 's reproductive rights.

Specifically , the legislation would allow the spouse , child or parent of a member of the uniformed services to take up to two weeks of annual leave from his or her job if the service member receives notice of an impending call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation , or is deployed in connection with a contingency operation. This leave could be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. The employee would be entitled to two workweeks of leave for each military family member called to active duty. The employee could elect but the employer could not insist upon the substitution of accrued paid time off for the leave provided for under this legislation. An employer may require , however , that certification to support the family member ' s military situation be provided in a timely manner . </legislation.n.74><legislation.n.75>" Jail sentences for particularly blameworthy health and safety offences committed by individuals , can now be imposed reflecting the severity of such crimes , whereas there were more limited options in the past.

Policy inactivity could well create increased pressure for legislation from the electorate that may inadvertently hinder the longer-term development of genuine corporate citizenship. While there is a role for legislation , governments can do much more via supportive , coordinated and enabling policies and by showing strong political leadership on the issue. Based on a model of non-regulatory activism , options could include following the British example of appointing a Minister for Corporate Citizenship , upgrading the role of the Prime Minister 's Community Business Partnership to support the Minister and commission research to form the basis of legislative review and innovation . </legislation.n.76><legislation.n.77>Incidentally , in the past 20 years Congress has passed several pieces of legislation dealing with whether the executive branch may or should include Social Security in the federal budget.

The legislation will provide 6 weeks of TDI benefits ( two-thirds wage replacement up to maximum of $ 524 in 2008 ) for a worker taking leave. Employees will be subject to an additional payroll deduction to finance the leave. Workers will be able to take paid leave beginning in July 2009 . </legislation.n.78><legislation.n.79>During George W.

The decoded programming message was : poor and unworthy people , like wasteful and lazy blacks , and dirty and ignorant Mexican ( Latino ) immigrants are taking your ( deserving inner whites ' money by creating social welfare burdens that your government is now forced to pay , because of bad give-away legislation foisted on it by wrong-headed liberals ( white snobs and non-white agitators ) . Your undeserved ( because of your inner whiteness ) increasing poverty is directly attributable to the drain on taxes by these unworthy , non-white-centered , strange-language populations. In voting for George W.

Recall that executing a legislative threat does not - and , in fact , can not - ensure the enactment of the threatened legislation. Hence , the legislator can not guarantee that the threatened consequences will actually materialize. Rather , all that exercising the threat means is that the legislator will endeavor to enact the threatened legislation to the best of her political might; enacting the legislation into law is contingent upon factors other than the legislator 's effort and will. For these reasons , the threatened legislation is at best probable but never certain . </legislation.n.81><legislation.n.82>" The right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of every law-abiding citizen of our country , " Perry said.

His bill would mandate a three-business day background check for buyers at gun shows. His bill , which we have endorsed , already has 18 co-sponsors. In addition , Senators John McCain ( R-AZ ) and Joseph Lieberman ( D-CT ) have been negotiating to sponsor a similar , but presumably less restrictive , measure to close the gun show loophole.

Fundamental to any policy decisions will be the need to have a clear understanding of the Island ' s " particular circumstances , " as referred to by the Controller , against the background of which employment legislation will be introduced. But arguably Jersey is , in reality , no different from any other nation state when social rights such as a minimum wage , anti-discrimination , maternity rights and unfair dismissal are in issue. Modern employment laws have evolved as a result of society ' s recognition of basic human rights in the modern workplace. The effects of this recognition are seen throughout the developed world where many countries now have employment legislation providing for such employment rights. They are succinctly described in the following quotation from an American legal encyclopaedia : </legislation.n.86><legislation.n.87>Bullying exists in our workplaces because organisations allow it.

In order for policies to be workable , policy makers and those executing legislation must have an understanding of the sectors and bodies they are regulating. If they do not , further training must be provided. Government departments are also more likely to produce workable legislation and to implement it successfully if those affected by the legislation can seek redress if it is incorrectly implemented. For example , in cases where a regulator 's activity has obliged a regulated firm to give up a disproportionate amount of fee-earning time to deal with the regulator 's enquiries , or where that activity has been handled so badly that the firm has been unable to continue their business while waiting for the regulator to complete its work , compensation must be available automatically for material losses suffered by the firm as a result of the regulator 's activity. This would increase the costs to departments of getting policy implementation wrong , and so act as an incentive upon them to get it right in the first instance . </legislation.n.95><legislation.n.96>In July 1999 the Federal National Council approved new legislation regulating social security benefits. Under the new law people entitled to monthly social benefits include national widows and divorced women , the disabled and handicapped , the elderly , orphans , single daughters , married students , relatives of a jailed dependent , estranged wives and insolvents. Under the law all widowed and divorced national women who were married to foreigners are also eligible for social security benefits.

Since the Constitution had not been amended , there can only be one conclusion. The federal government , acting through its political appointees in the Supreme Court , simply opened the door for a new interpretation of the general welfare provision that deleted words , changed the meaning of the words , and was absent of the basic limitations incorporated into the Constitution by the Founders. In short , the Court re-wrote the Constitution from the bench and handed Congress almost unlimited power to tax and spend so long as it cites the general welfare provision as the constitutional authority for the legislation . </legislation.n.100><legislation.n.101>The titles of bills are written by the bill 's sponsor and are a part of the legislation itself.

Indeed , they are encouraged to turn to guidance to gain an explanation of what legislation requires of them. Sometimes , however , the guidance provided can turn out to be inaccurate , or contradict the legislation. Penalising them for following incorrect guidance is a gross unfairness and a symptom of guidance-led legislation.

In race discrimination cases this position will be established anyway from 19thJuly 2003 under the new Race Relations Act 1976 ( Amendment ) Regulations 2003 ( see above ) so the effect of the House of Lords decision is likely to be relevant mainly in sex and disability discrimination cases . </legislation.n.107><legislation.n.108>Section 15 ( c ) requires that the lawyer not commence or continue a collaborative law process if the lawyer reasonably believes a potential party or party is a victim of domestic violence unless the victim consents and the lawyer reasonably believes that the victim ' s safety can be protected while the process goes on. These conditions are designed to insure that the autonomy and decision making power of the victim of domestic violence are respected in the decision to go forward or not with collaborative law. Many state statutes allow victims of domestic violence to opt out of mediation. See , e.g. , Fla. Stat. 44.102 ( 2 ) ( c ) ( 2005 ); Utah Code Ann. 30-3-22 ( 1 ) ( Supp. 1994 ) .

A frequent low level of draft bills prepared by ministries suggests that it is necessary to enhance substantially the legislative activities of ministries , which requires the strengthening of their legal departments. The responsibility for the legislation could concentrate with one of deputy ministers , who would also be responsible for contacts with the Parliament ( an analogy with the function of the secretary of state in some countries ) . </legislation.n.117><legislation.n.118>The UAE expects to enact a national surveillance system to track foodborne illness and draw all food safety activities under one unified law by the end of the year.According to the local Khaleej Times , the nation 's top food safety body is working on legislation that will boost food safety in all the emirates ... </legislation.n.118><legislation.n.119>LEGISLATION ORIGINATES IN THE SOCIOLOGICAL LABORATORY -- " It must not be supposed that such legislation can be conducted to any considerable extent in the open sessions of legislative bodies.

P. 338 . </legislation.n.119><legislation.n.120>An analysis of the underlying motivations reveals several factors that may affect the legislator 's choice.127 A legislator may avoid exerting an explicit threat so as not to put his reputation to the test. He may fear that failing to pass the threatened legislation will adversely affect his reputational capital , which is necessary in making credible ( i.e. , believable ) political promises and threats.128 Damaging his reputation , a legislator runs the risk of voter dissatisfaction , loss of campaign contributions , 12 and inability to extract future rents130-all of which lower the chance of reelection. Moreover , the legislator knows that an established reputation for credibility is a valuable strategic asset that he can call upon to prompt compliance with future threats , thus further enhancing his reputation.131 This is why implicit threats , which involve no public commitment to legislate and no backlash for failing to enact legislation , are risk-free strategies. 32 Furthermore , a legislator may use an implicit threat in order to avoid the political repercussions that an explicit threat may provoke from fellow lawmakers for what may be regarded as an illegitimate use of legislative power. 133 </legislation.n.120><legislation.n.121>On July 13 , the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Finance Committee unveiled new SCHIP legislation.

The legislation of Jamaica includes broader objectives of achieving government accountability , transparency and public participation , while those of Antigua and Barbuda and Trinidad and Tobago are more specific and cover the right to access information in the possession of public authorities. The Freedom of Information Act of Belize , on the other hand , does not state its objectives . </legislation.n.126><legislation.n.127>Like sister employment standards legislation across Canada , Ontario 's Employment Standards Act sets out minimal rights and entitlements of employees.

L. Rev. 69 ( 2009 ) , I describe and defend a longstanding substantive canon of statutory interpretation , which I dub " the Democracy Canon. " The Canon calls upon courts to liberally construe election statutes under certain circumstances so as to favor enfranchisement of the voter and to maximize voter choice. Professor Christopher S. Elmendorf provides a thoughtful and detailed Response to my Article , forthcoming in the Cornell Law Review. Professor Elmendorf worries that the Canon " could provide a varnish of legality for far-fetched interpretations of the federal election statutes. " Professor Elmendorf attacks my normative defense of the Canon , arguing that the Canon will exacerbate tension in the judiciary , leading to more partisan judicial decisionmaking. He also suggests that application of the Canon on the federal level is likely to lead to less bipartisan election legislation in Congress. Professor Elmendorf then spends more than half of his Response offering three alternative canons of interpretation in statutory election law cases which he claims are " more normatively defensible and less politically treacherous " than the Democracy Canon . </legislation.n.128><legislation.n.129>In existing legislation , we already recognise forms of emergency laws which are somewhat comparable , namely in the Extraordinary Powers of Civilian Authority Act and the War Criminal Code for the Netherlands. The former , when there are systematic and large-scale attacks on national and social authority , makes a distinction between two 'exceptional circumstances ' , namely : ( 1 ) the situation of increased vigilance; ( 2 ) the civilian exceptional situation. The War Code also deals with two exceptional circumstances : ( 1 ) the state of siege; ( 2 ) the state of war . </legislation.n.129><legislation.n.130>The Czech coalition government last week unveiled a package of ambitious tax reforms and spending cuts.

The latter is the result of a 2001 merger of the Government-owned Cook Islands Development Bank and the Post Office Savings Bank. Domestic banks are primarily involved in traditional deposit taking and lending. The BCI operates as a stand-alone institution competing against the two Australian banks and is no longer engaged in development lending. Legislation allows for development lending to be undertaken in the future by a separate company not subject to supervision by the FSC. In addition , non-performing loans made by the Cook Islands Development Bank have been transferred to another affiliated company . </legislation.n.133><legislation.n.134>Australian Law on the Internet - Includes links to legal portals , legislation , cases , reference works , journals , libraries , legal information for the public , and legal publishers.

Part of the reason lies in the values at the core of our unique system of governance -- diversity , religious and ethnic tolerance , acceptance of change , openness to new ideas , constitutional limits on government discretion , reliance on legal proceedings open to public scrutiny. These values make it hard to nurture in the U.S. the ethnic or religious hatred that fuels much terrorism.

During the last election campaigns held in 2003 , all the presidential candidates had to state their policies in relation to curbing corruption. This commitment was put on paper where the candidates and Citizen Control Groups co-signed commitment forms. Several public institutions : ministries , municipalities , departmental governments , signed agreements with Citizen Control Groups for mutual support in the transparent public administration. Civic education materials were disseminated during the last elections in April 2003 to sensitise the general public on the need to support honest candidates.

Richard Durbin ( D-Ill ) reintroduced legislation that uses tax incentives to encourage US employers to create and keep jobs in the United States that meet specific pay and benefits criteria and maintain a policy of neutrality in union organizing campaigns. The Patriot Employers Act ( S. 829 ) , introduced on April 20 , would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide a one-percent tax credit on profits for so-called " Patriot employers " that do not outsource such jobs. To qualify , an employer would have to : show neutrality in union organizing drives; maintain corporate headquarters in the US if the company has been headquartered here; pay at least 60 percent of each employee 's health care premiums; maintain or increase the number of full-time employees in the US relative to the number of full-time workers outside of the US; compensate each employee not less than the federal poverty level; and provide either a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan that fully matches at least 5 percent of worker contributions for every employee.

Policy inactivity could well create increased pressure for legislation from the electorate that may inadvertently hinder the longer-term development of genuine corporate citizenship. While there is a role for legislation , governments can do much more via coordinated , supportive and enabling policies and by showing strong political leadership on the issue.

The political dimension is based on the view that civil society actors such as NGOs are a new , unwelcome , powerful and dangerous presence on the business landscape.

( 34 ) The role that NGOs may play within corporate citizenship varies , and includes entering into partnerships with companies , ensuring that companies comply with legislation as well as rating companies ' performance against social , ethical and environmental score cards. ( 35 ) Any government support for corporate citizenship , especially in the form of legislation aimed at regulating companies ' social impacts ( for example , through disclosure of social reporting ) , only serves to bestow legitimacy on supposedly undemocratic , ill-informed and unaccountable NGOs according to the critics. Furthermore , they claim that corporate citizenship undermines the very basis of parliamentary democracy and any government efforts ( weak or strong ) to support it only enable NGOs to 'gain power at the expense of the electorate through Parliament ' creating a form of 'civil socialism'.

However , a series of scandals in the " mis-selling " of these pension products and the abuse of a prominent company 's pension plan led to legislation to increase government regulation and oversight. In addition , other reforms were enacted to restructure the second tier and tighten regulations and oversight of the pension industry. These reforms have increased participation in personal pensions by low wage workers by providing greater investment options while capping administrative fees. This year , the United Kingdom is continuing its reform effort with significant new legislation to modify and strengthen its social security and pension plans . </legislation.n.156><legislation.n.157>MLSP , as the institution directly responsible for the observation of the labor and social insurance legislation initiates measures for ensuring an environment favorable to the normal development of labor and social insurance relations and this is one of the main tasks of the ministry. Along these lines the new intentions are concerned with focusing public attention on the problems of the informal sector and enhancing the mechanisms for combating it. The sought ways for counteraction are in the direction of increasing the revenue collections in the income tax funds and stricter control over the observation of labor legislation through the establishment of Unified Revenue Agency , registration of employment contracts , starting negotiations for determining the minimum insurance thresholds or minimum ( monthly ) wages by sector/branch and profession/trade.

The result of their failure to uphold the nation ' s constitutional foundations , current law , and the wish of the people , will result in legislation that is not only in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi , but that is as short-sighted as it is discriminatory. It is short-sighted because it fails to acknowledge the reality of what Mori have to offer at the governance table for a greater Auckland region , and it is discriminatory because it denies recognition of the status of Mori as a people a right recognised in every international human rights instrument developed in international law since the end of World War Two . </legislation.n.159><legislation.n.160>For that matter , it is clear that ordinary criminal legislation has not been written for occupation situations and provides totally insufficient sanctions against the abuse and injustice which occur in those situations.

They reflect any gain or loss the players consider relevant to their utility - pecuniary or not. The firm 's payoffs reflect the cost of compliance178 and the negative impact of the threatened legislation.79 A legislator 's payoffs reflect the cost of pursuing the threatened legislation180 and the benefits received if she is successful in inducing a desired change in conduct.181 By issuing the threat and making congressional and public appearances , a legislator can claim credit for achieving policy goals. In addition , by associating himself with the threatened legislation ( e.g. , by adding his name to the bill182 ) , a legislator may guarantee that if the tiireat is exercised and the bill is enacted , any accruing benefits will be internalized . </legislation.n.161><legislation.n.162>In fact , legislative threats may turn credible if - based on public information , existing track record , or due to a legislator 's attempt to strategically change his mind282 - targeted firms believe , correctly or erroneously , that a legislator is driven by emotions ( or motivations ) that will be triggered by a firm 's failure to comply with the legislator 's demands. Such emotions and motivations may guarantee the credibility of a threat , provided that threat recipients actually believe the legislator cares about these preferences or is generally motivated by these emotions. Mindful of the threat 's credibility , firms will realize that if they do not comply the legislator will seek to enact the threatened legislation , notwithstanding its significant costs. Belief in a threat 's credibility thus sets in motion the inducement effect of a legislative threat . </legislation.n.162><legislation.n.163>" The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99- 177 ) , known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act , included several measures that altered the budgetary treatment of Social Security. . . .

The process of function transfer and transfer of relevant financial-economic resources to LSG bodies is protracted. There is no clear mechanism of their transfer.

The most significant difference is that a detailed debate takes place with two distinct functions and accordingly the draft amendments are voted on in two separate phases by the National Assembly prior to the final vote. In the first detailed debate , MPs debate draft amendments that recommend redistributions between the various budgetary chapters. Thereafter , the National Assembly votes on the draft amendments ( by 30 November ) and decides on the principal amounts in individual chapters and in the budget as a whole : revenue , spending and the deficit. In a newly opened detailed debate , only those draft amendments can be submitted that change the provisions within individual chapters and thus these do not have an effect on the approved principal amounts . </legislation.n.167><legislation.n.168>( d ) assist each other , within the scope of their respective legislations , on the application of this Convention.

This measure aims at assessing the impact of the measures to be included in the bill and , usually , identifies the cost and benefits associated with the government 's preferred implementing options. At committee stage , several economic impact studies are tabled usually to enable the legislator to make more informed decisions. These impact studies are usually twofold , measuring both the economic and social repercussions of the proposed legislation and often focusing on a regional basis.

Recent suggestions , however , that the Government might consider a further layer of anti-strike legislation in response to the firefighters claim for fair pay will do nothing to simplify our laws.

Many states including Colorado , Connecticut , Florida , Georgia , Kansas , Missouri , Nevada , Ohio , Oklahoma , Texas , and Virginia use mathematical calculations to cap these awards. Accordingly , the maximum punitive award is limited to some amount that is proportionate to the plaintiff 's actual or compensatory damages. For instance , depending upon the location of the forum , the punitive award may be capped at two , three , or four times the compensatory award.

However , the support for stronger weapons controls has become apparent. [ 135 ] Perhaps the general public has had enough. In the course of one week an unemployed handyman stepped onto a Long Island railroad train and began to randomly shoot suburban commuters; a Chicago teenage girl fired at another teenager in a lunchtime crowd; an Atlanta police officer 's son was shot to death in his driveway; and a teacher was shot while grading papers in his classroom. [ 136 ] The public has begun simultaneously to demand stricter controls while also flocking to buy their own guns for protection. [ 137 ] The courts , also , seem to be favoring restrictions on guns by municipalities through the use of the police power. [ 138 ] And now , after years of debate , national legislation in the weapons control arena has finally been enacted. [ 139 ] All of these factors will have a substantial impact on the future of gun control in general , and assault weapon ordinances specifically.

Many attempts have been made , through the machinery of practical government , to realize ideal social states. Most familiar to us , of those of antiquity , is the Jewish ideal commonwealth , in which lawgivers and priests sought to secure justice and equal rights for all members of the community , not only by establishing social control in public affairs , but by developing a code of laws which should severely regulate the moral life and the social life , to the very minutest details. It was , indeed , a theocratic commonwealth , with religion , politics , and social usage all combined in one system. While this ideal commonwealth , as set forth with special fullness in the later Jewish codes , was far in advance of what was actually realized by the Jews , because the Jewish people were dispersed and the dream of an ideal commonwealth was not realized , yet many of the principles set forth in these writings have had great influence upon legislation among all peoples where the Bible has been taken seriously. Especially good examples of this influence are Calvin 's government of Geneva , Switzerland , and some of the legislation of the English Commonwealth of Cromwell . </legislation.n.200><legislation.n.201>5.3 Skewed land ownership is being addressed through legislation which provides for the restitution of land taken from black South Africans under race-based legislation first introduced in 1913.

In this event , responsibility for the preparation of guidance on de-identification of PSI as outlined in this recommendation should transfer to the Information Commissioner . ) </legislation.n.206><legislation.n.207>Israeli legislation does not deal with collective dismissals. Collective agreements generally require the employer to inform , consult and negotiate with the union prior to making a collective dismissal. The common procedure is that the employer determines the need for a collective dismissal and the number of workers to be dismissed. The employer must then submit a list of the candidates for dismissal to the union , who can suggest an alternative list. If there is no negotiated agreement an arbitrator determines who shall be dismissed. Under some collective agreements the arbitrator also determines the number of workers to be dismissed. Collective dismissals are uncommon and generally involve limited numbers of workers. When an employer decides to make a collective dismissal there are often strikes and petitions to the Labour Courts by the union . </legislation.n.207><legislation.n.208>The President identified the Single Public Service as an area for concerted action in the next eighteen months. Draft legislation has been developed and will be consulted upon during this year. Norms and standards for human resource management will be developed. An investigation into medical aid will be conducted and a remuneration policy for the Single Public Service will be developed. Integrated service delivery infrastructure will continue to be rolled out , in particular Thusong Service Centres and Home Affairs offices and mobile units. A strategy to expand citizens ' access to services will be implemented jointly by an inter-departmental team. Various projects aimed at increasing the use of Information and Communication Technologies ( ICTs ) by government officials and citizens are being implemented , including Home Affairs ' Track and Trace system for tracing documents in the system . </legislation.n.208><legislation.n.209>Other issues of social web services ( third party sites ) hosting government data include challenges in exporting data to comply with records management requirements and uncertainty over information ownership and retention over time. Under the property-based definition of Commonwealth Record in the Archives Act 1983 ( Section 3 of the Archives Act 1983 defines a Commonwealth Record as : ( a ) a record that is the property of the Commonwealth or of a Commonwealth institution; or ( b ) a record that is to be deemed to be a Commonwealth record by virtue of a regulation under subsection ( 6 ) or by virtue of section 22; but does not include a record that is exempt material or is a register or guide maintained in accordance with Part VIII. ) , any information created , managed and stored on third party sites in The Cloud may not be legally regarded as Commonwealth property nor , as such , as a Commonwealth record. In other words the Commonwealth is likely to have no control over , nor ownership of these records. They may be destroyed without warning and without the Commonwealth having any recourse. Legally , the public may have no right of access to these records under freedom of information or Archives legislation . </legislation.n.209><legislation.n.210>A Child Welfare Practice and Legislation Review Committee ( VA 2580 ) was established in 1982.

The Congress attempted to give the President line-item veto authority in 1995; however , the Supreme Court ruled the effort unconstitutional because it transferred legislative authority from the Legislative Branch to the Executive Branch. It had been the hope of the Congress that the President would use the line-item veto to remove or lower excessive spending measures from legislation passed by Congress . </legislation.n.212><legislation.n.213>The views , opinions and range of feelings expressed by those individuals and groups who made submissions both in writing and through the meetings were considered in depth by the DLCG.

Besides this , it is necessary to introduce stimulating grants which will be directly provided to local self-government bodies of the primary level ( Aiyl okmotu ) with execution of tender for capital investments in social-cultural and communal facilities.

The implementing legislation amended the anti-money laundering law to criminalize the financing of terrorism. In November 2004 , MOKAS designated two employees to be responsible for terrorist finance issues. MOKAS routinely asks banks to check their records for any transactions by any person or organization designated by foreign FIUs as a terrorist or a terrorist organization. If a person or entity is so designated by the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee or the EU Clearinghouse , the Central Bank automatically issues a " search and freeze " order to all banks , both domestic and IBUs. As of mid-December 2005 , no bank had reported holding a matching account. The lawyers ? and accountants ? associations cooperate closely with the Central Bank.

Food manufacturers will also have to prove any health claims they make about their products . </legislation.n.219><legislation.n.220>Representatives and senators could not ignore the impact of social protest. In a confidential memorandum , one Republican senator asked in May 1963 that Republicans meet the challenge by proposing a legislative initiative to revise Senate rules to make it easier to pass a civil rights bill which would cut off federal funds to programs that discriminated against African Americans. In suggesting this action , the senator made the link between social conditions and legislation clear when he said that " recent events in racial relations in Birmingham , Alabama and elsewhere , in the North and the South , have demonstrated the critical need for further action by the Congress . . . toward righting the wrongs and ending the disadvantages of the past. " </legislation.n.220><legislation.n.221>By the early 1960s , the nation s congressional history contributed to growing legislative pressures for a comprehensive civil rights law. Although political pressures prevented President John F. Kennedy 's administration from proposing legislation to Congress in 1961 and 1962 , the President took steps to ensure minority rights in voting , employment , housing , transportation , and education by executive action. The stage was set for a new legislative initiative to deal with the problem of federal protection of civil rights . </legislation.n.221><legislation.n.222>Part of the incentive that will allegedly create these jobs is an exemption from the payroll tax for businesses that hire new workers and an extra $ 1 , 000 credit if they employ them for at least a year. So let ' s think about that. If I hire a new employee for , say , $ 40 , 000 a year , I don ' t have to pay the 6.5 payroll tax on their salary and I get a $ 1 , 000 credit from the Feds a year from now. Perhaps my math is fuzzy , but I ' m still out $ 39 , 000. In a down economy the demand for my services isn ' t picking up , so what good will it do me to bring on this extra employee ?

Obligated entities ( including financial institutions , institutions regulated by the Superintendence of Securities and the Superintendence of Notaries , export and import intermediaries , credit unions , wire remitters , exchange houses and public agencies ) are required to file suspicious transaction reports with the UIAF , and are barred from informing their clients of their reports. Most obligated entities are also required to establish " know-your-customer " provisions. Exchange houses must file currency reports for transactions involving $ 700 or more. In 2005 , 8 , 227 SARs were filed; however , financial institutions are believed to underreport transactions . </legislation.n.227><legislation.n.228>In recent years , construction contractors have discovered the importance of having a Construction Environmental Management Plan in order to begin work. The main reason why this has taken place is because society on a global level has become more conscious about the impact of human activities on the natural environment. As a result , governments in most countries have reacted through enacting environmental legislation that obliges contractors and/or companies to detail and assess the impact of a project on the surrounding environment before the green light to go ahead . </legislation.n.228><legislation.n.229>Another of Senator Church 's interests was the elderly. In 1972 , Church became the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging , a committee he was appointed to in 1967.

The board of directors has a particular responsibility for ensuring that the company is organised in an appropriate manner and for ensuring that the company ' s assets are managed responsibly and in accordance with the company ' s and shareholders ' interests. One of the reasons why certain activities are hived off into separate companies , and why the division of roles between shareholders , the board and the general manager laid down in company legislation is followed , is to ensure that the minister concerned can not be held accountable for the company ' s business decisions . </legislation.n.233><legislation.n.234>A glimpse into new death technologies under construction is in legislation introduced by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinch.

This fear of government programs made sense considering the damage the government ' s previous policies had had on the culture and welfare of the Indian peoples. [ 118 ] Roosevelt ' s appointed expert on Indian affairs was John Collier , an anthropologist who earlier in his career had assisted the Pueblo Indians in their fight for their land. Collier was representative of the New Deal reformers; committed to bettering Indian economic and social conditions , he had a strong personal sense of the importance of cultural pluralism and an equally strong belief that the federal government was central to its promulgation. [ 119 ] What he and other Indian New Dealers may have lacked , however , was the understanding that top-down legislation enacted without input from the regulated parties , even if well-meaning , may have unintended and negative consequences . </legislation.n.242><legislation.n.243>That ' s correct. Every cent of that $ 1.5 trillion has been borrowed by the government and spent on other things. The government has treated the surplus Social Security money as if it were general revenue with no restrictions on its use. It has been used to help fund national defense , general operating expenses , pork-barrel legislation , and , under George W. Bush , income tax cuts for the very rich. Borrowed is probably not the right word to use because it implies repayment. The government has made no provisions for repayment of the money and has no means with which to repay it. A better description of what has happened is that the money has been embezzled or stolen by the federal government . </legislation.n.243><legislation.n.244>Many countries have legislation covering most , if not all , of the employment issues such as equal pay , rights to a statement of contract terms , anti-discrimination , leave provisions , minimum wage , grievance procedures and maternity rights.

Sweeping changes have been made recently in the law of workplace discrimination. A large percent of the Supreme Court 's docket in recent terms consisted of employment and labor cases. The world 's first comprehensive declaration of equal treatment for persons with disabilities , the Americans with Disabilities Act , added 43 , 000 , 000 Americans to the groups protected against job discrimination and is profoundly impacting hiring and job assignment. There are differing opinions about what it means to " discriminate " based on factors such as sex , age , and race. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 triggers passionate response from proponents and opponents , and now provides for compensatory and punitive damages. This course addresses such issues arising from legislation forbidding employment discrimination based on race , religion , national origin , sex , pregnancy , age , and physical ability.

Lubbock , for instance , was the most eminent pre-historian of his time and had a desire to demonstrate that there was a higher level of civilisation in the ancient Britons prior to the Roman invasion. Pitt-Rivers on the other hand had wider interests in terms of time span but was principally an excavator who was also concerned with the rights of the owners and occupiers. Part of his estate covered Cranborne Chase , an area justifiably famous for its wide range of archaeological sites. William Morris on the other hand was much more concerned with the visible. An artist and designer heavily influenced by the mediaeval period he was deeply concerned with the " modernisation " or replacement of public buildings.

James </legislation.n.261><legislation.n.262>The adoption of Prohibition , like many of the lobbyists ' victories , rested in part on the votes of southern congressmen. Elizabeth Sanders has made a strong case for the important role southerners played in the expansion of the national government after the Civil War , but most historians have emphasized instead the region 's continued advocacy of states ' rights. Before the Civil War , white southerners had opposed federal moral legislation , fearing it would establish a precedent that could be turned against slavery. When emancipation eliminated their need to defend slavery , and when the politics of race replaced those of slavery , southern attitudes began to change. By the early twentieth century , secure in the racial repression they had imposed on the region , white southerners provided crucial votes and leadership in national legislative campaigns to impose morality. The white South 's support for moral laws helped earn it a reputation as the Bible Belt , an appellation nineteenth-century northerners would hardly have applied to a region they believed tainted by the sin of slavery. Many late-twentieth-century southerners assume that the South had supported moral legislation all along but would be surprised to learn that it advocated the use of federal power.

( Jonathan Gruber 's assessment of the tax credits and deductions the Administration proposed a year ago also suggests that the crowd-out or substitution effects of the Administration 's health tax proposals would be much greater than the effects from the SCHIP legislation . ) </legislation.n.263><legislation.n.264>'Since the activities of some of the large foundations appear to be biased in favor of a particular ideology , in reality they are indulging in propaganda calculated to influence legislation on both domestic and international matters .

Whether by YLS students interning in the office as part of Frank Dineen ' s Legal Assistance Clinic or TRO Project students volunteering daily at the local courthouse , NHLAA ' s program has been energized by the students ' presence while its ability to address the legal needs of local clients has been expanded. These collaborative efforts are also part of a much larger picture. Other YLS graduates are having an impact on legal services throughout Connecticut. For example , Mildred Doody ' 85 is heading up NHLAA ' s new Children and Youth Advocacy Project and Steve Eppler-Epstein ' 83 is the Executive Director of Connecticut Legal Services; Rafie Podolsky ' 72 of the Legal Assistance Resource Center of Connecticut , Inc.

The legislative tensions of the first term ( 1990-94 ) - in addition to other forces within Parliament and without - were manifest in the weaknesses of the inherited Standing Orders. There was not an adequate legislative process in a changed situation in which the legislative activity of the MPs continued to increase dramatically both in proposing laws and in submitting hundreds of draft amendments. The screening role of the committees was lacking or did not work well. There was an uneven division in the burden of preparing the legislation among the standing committees. Due to the obligation on the part of the Constitutional Committee to debate all bills , it bore an almost untenable burden . </legislation.n.266><legislation.n.267>Part II will examine the historical development of " right to bear arms " provisions in state constitutions generally as well as the development of and justification for restrictive ordinances.

Furthermore , it will clarify the court 's use of the police power to justify the assault weapon ordinance. Part IV will examine the future of assault weapon ordinances in Ohio and around the nation.

Preventive enforcement is essential , and should include established licensing procedures ( i.e. screening the proposed item , quantity , end-use and all parties involved in the transaction for any potential export ) and compliance mechanisms ( i.e. working in partnership with industry to educate them on how to monitor and control their own export activity ) .

Though King 's point about lynching illustrates his belief that the criminal law played an essential part in the civil rights debate , he also insisted that the moral dimension of legislation far transcended this limited domain. Protecting the rights and political freedom of African Americans was intimately associated with achieving the broader notion of human equality. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 -- and , importantly , the federal power required to enforce those laws -- were indispensable means by which Americans ' united belief in this moral principle could be realized . </legislation.n.272><legislation.n.273>Illinois Outlaws Pretexting , Adopts New Privacy Safeguards.

A significant amount of updating and replacement has now occurred , particularly by the Safety , Health and Welfare at Work ( Repeals and Revocations ) Order 1995 and by means of the detailed Regulations made under the 1989 Act. This has resulted in many provisions of the Factories Act 1955 and all of the Office Premises Act 1958 being repealed with effect from 21 December 1995. Some specialist legislation , such as the Fire Services Act 1981 as well as a number of provisions in the Factories Act 1955 , remain in place. Failure to comply with these detailed Regulations may lead to a criminal prosecution and may also be relevant in a compensation claim . </legislation.n.276><legislation.n.277>Money laundering in Belgium is illegal through the Law of January 11 , 1993 , " On Preventing Use of the Financial System for Purposes of Money Laundering. " It is criminalized by Article 505 of the Penal Code , which sets penalties of up to five years ? imprisonment. In January 2004 , Belgian domestic legislation implementing Council Directive 2001/97/EC on prevention of the use of the financial system for money laundering ( 2nd EU Money Laundering Directive ) entered into force , broadening the scope of money laundering predicate offenses beyond drug-trafficking to include the financing of terrorist acts or organizations . </legislation.n.277><legislation.n.278>To illustrate these points I consider a threat of lenient legislation with respect to which the firm is perfectly informed. For obvious reasons , the effectiveness condition in this case is relatively high. Viewed from the firm 's perspective , " comply " is inefficient and irrational unless the probability that the threatened legislation passes congressional muster is sufficiently high so as to meet or exceed the effectiveness condition. It follows that if the probability is just a little lower , falling below the effectiveness condition , " do n't comply " becomes the firm 's best response. Hypothetically , this may be the case when the lenient terms of the threatened legislation draw significant opposition , making its passing improbable . </legislation.n.278><legislation.n.279>Abstract : In this article , we analyse the development of new modes of governance in EU employment and social policy over the past two decades. In this field , a number of innovations can be observed. First , with the Maastricht Treaty , the right to draw up legislation was given to European social partners. Second , with the European Employment Strategy and the Open Method of Coordination , new instruments of coordinating national policies were introduced to EU policy-making. Recently , the latter instrument was incorporated into the social dialogue. Hence , we contend that a double voluntarism takes places that not only delegates responsibility for social policy to the social partners but also relies on soft rather than on hard law . </legislation.n.279><legislation.n.280>Minister Debus also mentioned child protection and welfare as areas where attention was necessary to ensure that Norfolk Island measured up to national standards. We were already working on those areas , having identified needs to improve mechanisms to protect the welfare of children and to deal with offences against children. A bill to provide for children ' s welfare has already been drafted , based on similar legislation in Australian jurisdictions. That bill is currently under reconsideration by the legislative draftsman , as we judged that some of its provisions were overly bureaucratic , given Norfolk Island ' s circumstances. Draft legislation has also been prepared to provide for specific children ' s court judicial functions. I expect that both pieces of legislation will be placed before the Assembly by the respective ministers in the near future . </legislation.n.280><legislation.n.281>The original colonial legislation underwent substantial modification in the post-colonial era because independent India called for a clear partnership between labour and capital.

If there were only one bank , as the nationalisers desire , and that subjected to control by the people now controlling the banking system , or similar people , the people would be in an even more intolerable position than they are now. There is no suggestion in the Labor Party 's banking legislation that the people 's credit be administered by the banking system for a maximum charge of a half per cent. interest . </legislation.n.283><legislation.n.284>I believe there are several reasons why this question has not been posed , let alone studied. In principle , Anglo-American legal scholarship focuses disproportionately on the judiciary , driven by the outdated assumption that courts are the prime social control agent in the legal system 's overall design.9 Explaining this disproportionate scholarly focus on the judiciary , Richard Posner notes that it " started with Holmes 's well-known characterization of the judge as an interstitial legislator , which Cardozo echoes in The Nature of the Judicial Process. " 10 Furthermore , even when legislation is the focus of the inquiry , the intellectual enterprise engages issues that lie on " the outer boundaries of the legislative process " 11 ( e.g. , statutory construction , normative constraints on legislative power ) , rather than on how legislation in and of itself serves to control social conduct. Moreover , the landscape of modern civil litigation reinforces the overemphasis of the judiciary 's role : the confluence of large-scale cases and class action lawsuits in which judges and attorneys fashion complex global settlements militates in favor of the view that courts , not legislatures , play a major role in modern social control. Echoing this view , commentators analogize class action settlements to ad hoc administrative agencies , 14 and class action attorneys to lawmakers . </legislation.n.284><legislation.n.285>In one of the most controversial eminent domain decisions ever , the United States Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that a city 's exercise of its eminent domain powers to take private property in furtherance of an economic development plan satisfied the constitutional requirement that such power be used only for a " public use , " even though private developers stood to profit handsomely from the city 's actions. In reaction to that ruling , some state legislatures have been busy crafting legislation to limit the use of condemnation powers in such circumstances. For their part , the owners of property targeted for condemnation have considered how they still might fend off the taking , or , failing that , how to maximize the compensation that the government must pay . </legislation.n.285><legislation.n.286>408. liany delegations of countries affected by desertification reviewed activities and progress achieved in their countries in combating desertification , and indicated their wish to share their experience with others.

Part I reviews the nature of employment contracts and concludes that the Thirteenth Amendment and related legislation prohibit enforcing the nurses ' three-year time commitment through specific performance. Part II examines whether criminal prosecution of the nurses is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act ( NLRA ) [ 12 ] and concludes that criminal prosecution is preempted because it interferes with the free play of economic forces that NLRA aims to protect. Part III explores legal issues surrounding the criminal prosecution of an attorney based on advice he may have given. The Essay concludes by explaining that the liquidated damage provision , which may have sparked this entire controversy , was probably unenforceable as a penalty , that the criminal prosecution was unwarranted , and that the Appellate Division ' s decision was correct . </legislation.n.287><legislation.n.288>Sen.

Unfunded mandates can put tremendous strain on local government 's limited resources and could compromise the delivery of essential services. To minimise the possibility of such difficulties occurring , the White paper proposes that all legislation dealing with the decentralisation or assignment of powers to local government is referred to the Local Government MINMEC ( a joint sitting between the Minister and Provincial MECs ) for discussion and comment. In addition , provincial government is tasked with monitoring the co-ordination of governmental activities and to report to MINMEC in this regard. Other mechanisms , include the stipulation that the delegation of functions to local government can only take place with the approval of cabinet , once provincial and local government have been adequately consulted.

This influence and the ideology of the labour movement resulted in the Knesset adopting a comprehensive system of protective labour legislation. The Histadrut supported labour legislation for all workers , not only its ' members. It also organized most Jewish workers in the pre-state period and both Jewish and Arab workers after the state was founded. As a result about 85 of the workforce was organized in the early period of the state and union density continued high until 1995.

Northeastern Federalists were the leading cheerleaders for federal bankruptcy legislation , and southern and western Jeffersonians were the staunchest opponents . </legislation.n.314><legislation.n.315>The legislation follows the debut of " The Nanny Diaries , " a novel by two former nannies , Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus , that 's been on the best-seller lists since it hit the stores March 7. While the tongue-in-cheek novel exquisitely satirizes vapid employers and vividly portrays a fictional selfish and self-indulgent set of parents , it does little to convey the working conditions of most nannies. Nevertheless , it has brought enormous public attention to the lives of live-in employees . </legislation.n.315><legislation.n.316>This includes two areas highlighted by Minister Debus in his statement. We are in the process of developing new measures to enhance workplace safety in Norfolk Island , particularly in relation to mechanisms to deal with issues raised by employees or complaints of unsafe management practices. I am personally grateful to Minister Debus and the Commonwealth Attorney-General ' s Department for providing specific advice on how to proceed with these matters. Based in part on that advice , drafting instructions have now been issued for changes to legislation and regulations and I look forward to bringing those before the Assembly in the early part of next year . </legislation.n.316><legislation.n.317>Firearms-Forestry. The issue of gun control was important to Idahoans throughout Church 's tenure in the Senate and he consistently op posed legislation which would set unacceptable limits on firearms. This strong conservative stand was one of the reasons for his con tinued popularity with Idaho voters. Forestry files are especially strong on a 1977 Forest Timber Sales Bidding Bill and the National Forest Management Act of 1976 . </legislation.n.317><legislation.n.318>In conclusion , I think AHA has demonstrated its willingness to continue to work with HCFA to improve ways to promulgate the rules and regulations. We know the size and complexity of the Medicare-Medicaid regulations is challenged and we are proud to have been able to help the agency and pledge to do all we can in that process. We believe that the Regulatory Fair Warning Act of 1999 can help achieve this goal and we support this legislation because it recognizes that clarity is a key ingredient in fairness . </legislation.n.318><legislation.n.319>Also reporting from Connecticut is the Connecticut Post. In an article entitled " Greenwich Victim 's Family Heartened by Legislation 's Progress , " the Smith family is quoted : </legislation.n.319><legislation.n.320>I feel that it is essential and wise for the Senate to urge the government to accompany all government bills by a social and economic impact study in order to anticipate the repercussions of these bills on regions and minorities. In this way , the Senate will be equipped to meet its constitutional obligations and play its historic and conventional role of representing and protecting minorities and regions. That is precisely the objective of this motion , which is perfectly reasonable and logical when we consider our role as senators and the impact of legislation on regions and minorities. With this important tool , we could improve our analytical abilities in this chamber and in committees , to truly fulfil the mandates given to us by the Constitution for our respective regions and the minorities concerned . </legislation.n.320><legislation.n.321>In 1948 , in order to gain complete hold on the wage earners organizations the government brought in a Trade Union Labour Officer , to be attached to the Labour Department with the duty to foster " responsible " unionism ( Ananaba 1979 , 3 ) . In 1952 a more detailed piece of legislation was enacted for Trade Unions but again with significant omissions. It lacked necessary provisions for effective operation of trade unions. It did not legalize peaceful picketing or provide immunity against damages as a result of strikes. On the other hand , the government encouraged creation of staff associations and works committees since they fitted in its interests to confining workers ' organization to economic imperative alone and also lacked strike powers . </legislation.n.321><legislation.n.322>Since a state 's legal system affects all the areas of activity in which citizens , institutions and authorities are involved , very few individuals , if any at all , will be able to acquire an adequate knowledge of all the law 's subjects so as to understand all the norms in effect. As in other professions , this situation naturally leads to specialisation among lawyers in the various branches of the law. We must therefore recognise that , in practice , it is not possible to produce legislation that as a whole is comprehensible to everyone , although this is an ideal that , as far as possible , we should attempt to attain . </legislation.n.322><legislation.n.323>The Hawaii plan is modeled after federal legislation enacted last year , cosponsored by Senators Tom Coburn ( R-OK ) and Barack Obama ( D-IL ) . The law has ordered the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to construct an Internet destination for the general public to track the flow of federal grant and contract disbursements . </legislation.n.323><legislation.n.324>In order to become law , it is necessary that a bill should not only pass three readings in the House of Commons , where sit the elected representatives of the people , but that it should also pass three readings in the Senate , where sit legislators appointed for life , and that it must receive also the assent of the representative of the Crown. Nothing could be a better guarantee of the sound and well-considered character of the legislation placed upon the statute books of Canada . </legislation.n.324><legislation.n.325>An in-depth examination of the regulation of toxic and hazardous substances , this course will address major federal legislation regarding the management and disposal of hazardous wastes , and the clean-up of disposal sites ( toxic waste dumps ) contaminated by hazardous substances. In particular , we will discuss in detail the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) , and the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability ACT ( CERCLA ) , otherwise know as Superfund . The course will also address associated disposal and clean-up issues , such as those involving state restrictions on the interstate and international transportation of hazardous wastes , criminal and civil liabilities for illegal activities , and insurance coverage for clean-up liability. This course will also examine the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act ( SARA Title III ) , and pesticide and chemical regulations , risk assessment and management , and the regulation of toxic substances . </legislation.n.325><legislation.n.326>Continuing work on the draft anti-money laundering legislation and becoming a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention are positive steps. Cambodia should pass the draft anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing legislation as soon as possible. Cambodia should also ratify the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. However , the larger questions remain regarding the government ? s ability to implement and enforce the measures once they are in place. Cambodia should also engage fully with the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and take full advantage of its upcoming mutual evaluation and training programs offered by international donors . </legislation.n.326><legislation.n.327>Belize criminalized terrorist financing via amendments to its anti-money laundering legislation ( The Money Laundering ( Prevention ) ( Amendment ) Act , 2002 ) . Belizean authorities have circulated to all banks and financial institutions in Belize the names of suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations listed on the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee ? s consolidated list and the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated by the United States pursuant to E.O. 13224 . </legislation.n.327><legislation.n.328>[ 27 ] The most important national legislation is the Health and Medical Services Act of 1982 which establishes the division of jurisdiction between the national government and county councils. The Act also imposes certain restrictions that apply to both the delivery and financing of health care by county councils. The national legislation does not define basic or essential health care or drug package . </legislation.n.328><legislation.n.329> In light of the recent deregulation of firms in Australia , she said , we introduced legislation that firms appoint at least one practitioner to the board of directors who is obligated to prevent and report misconduct in the practice and all legal practices must have appropriate legal management systems in place to enable the provision of legal services in accordance with professional obligations. Central to Parker ' s paper was the self-assessment of firms who were told to rate ten objective metrics ( including courteous communication and timely delivery , review and follow up of legal services ) of quality on a scale that ran from ' not compliant to fully compliant plus ' . </legislation.n.329><legislation.n.330>For us , the 2006 midterm Congressional elections will be , essentially , irrelevant : whether or not Republicans retain their nominal control over both houses of Congress or Democrats gain more seats ( or perhaps even regain control ) over one or both houses of Congress , the legislation likely to emerge from the next Congress will be more of the same old , to put it bluntly , statist shit. Consider one of the members of the U.S. Senate who 's up for reelection this year , Mike DeWine of Ohio. DeWine is one of the RINOs ( the " Republicans in Name Only " ) who , unfortunately , comprise the ideological center of the Demopublican/Replicrat monopoly. Although nominally a Republican , he has voted , for example , against opening ANWR to oil drilling and against cutting Medicaid and federal student-loan programs. If DeWine is replaced by a Democrat , it will mean little change in how the person occupying that Senate seat votes . </legislation.n.330><legislation.n.331>So therefore the question must be asked what impact has international jurisprudenc and legislation had on UK law and the right to strike ? Turning first to the right of workers contained within the social charter which is set out at Article 6 of the European Social Charter 1961 of the Council of Europe , which has been ratified by the UK. The UK has repeatedly been found to be in breach of Article 6 by the Council of Europe 's Committee of Independent Experts. Yet this can not give rise to any cause of action in UK or European courts , nor will it do so under the EU Charter. Nor could the EU legislature use the Charter as a justification for an EU law on strikes. Charter rights , for which provision is made in other parts of the Constitution , have to be exercised 'under the conditions and within the limits defined by those relevant parts. In the case of the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs , these are expressly excluded from the EU 's competence to legislate under the Social Policy 'chapter ' </legislation.n.331><legislation.n.332>It is apparent that support for stricter controls on guns in general , and on assault weapons specifically , seems to be increasing amongst both the cities of the United States and the federal government. In fact , the 1990s seem to be " 'a historic period on gun control that we have not seen since the 1960s. ' " [ 159 ] Increasingly , cities are adopting expansive crime control bills and weapons restrictions. Until the crime wave begins to abate somewhat , it does not seem that the weapons restriction trend will slow. Indeed , stricter federal legislation will help speed the process by making stricter controls on a uniform national [ Page 982 ] level , as opposed to the sporadic and often inconsistent measures taken within the cities of the United States. But it seems clear , whether on the national or local level , that the time has arrived for legislation which will limit the availability of harmful weapons . </legislation.n.332><legislation.n.333>The involvement of political representatives , however , creates a risk that discussion within the team will result in compromise as a result of the wide variety of views. In these conditions , the result of the work is usually a very general document in which the intentions of the authors can not be clearly discerned. However , this risk is ever-present since legislation in any form is the work of a political authority. Simply put , the influence of partisanship on the clarity of a legislative message can be mitigated if the natural diversity of opinion is taken into account at the beginning of a legislative project . </legislation.n.333><legislation.n.334>John Mahoney co-authored a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States as an attorney of record in a case , which , with the assistance of AFGE , helped lead to legislation treating the Smithsonian Institution as an agency under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , see Dong v.

The parlous state of funding and service provision for many people , and the lack of alternatives or choices for people , act as a major disincentive to acting on complaints about services in particular. This is clearly the case for personal care or other essential services. There is a lack of legislation to protect complainants from retribution by government or non-government service provides. There is also little ability or will to highlight and punish such activity.59 </legislation.n.337><legislation.n.338>Post Office and Civil Service Committee , 1957-1958.

MSA 's are a product of Congress ' 1980 legislation , The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980. 42 U.S.C. Section 1395y comprises the Medicare Secondary Payer Statute. The essence of the law is that Medicare is to be protected as a " secondary payer " for medical treatment relating to an injury when a primary payer exists. Because federal law takes precedence over state laws and private contracts , Medicare will always claim to be the secondary payer , regardless of state law or plan provisions to the contrary , and even where the workers ' compensation insurer or liability insurer denies liability.

One obvious reason is that , like the current Government , future Labor legislative programs would be enhanced by greater Senate control. But there is also a less obvious reason. In the present circumstances , the Labor opposition in the Senate must answer to a much larger constituency , coming under pressure from other interests to oppose legislation , especially from the union movement. The party finds it difficult to satisfy its broad constituency by opposing legislation and keep powerful interests especially big business satisfied. By increasing the relative power of the House of Representatives , Labor no longer is forced to play a delicate Senate game. But a weakened Senate shifts the balance of politcal power away from representing plural interests , so future Labor governments would be under less pressure to limit ' top-down ' politics . </legislation.n.360><legislation.n.361>The Government of Ethiopia should act on the pending terrorist legislation and pass anti-money laundering legislation that adheres to international standards.

Such signals may anse from : collecting relevant data; exchanging information with target entities or industry representatives; officially introducing a bill; and circulating drafts to targeted entities. The interpretation of such signals depends , inter alia , on information publicly available to target entities , which may be used to ascribe practical meaning to observed actions. For instance , a track record that establishes a legislator 's reputation for using threats may render such actions particularly probative.

In 1945 , 1947 , and 1949 , the House of Representatives voted to abolish the poll tax restricting the right to vote.

Senate leaders prevented the Judiciary Committee and the Commerce Committee from formally reporting any of the several civil rights proposals they considered in 1963 , including S.1731 and S.1732 which contained the Justice Department 's proposals. ( For a legislative history , click here. ) If a bill had been reported , it could have been called up for consideration and debate on the Senate floor. The leadership did not want to risk a filibuster they knew would result because it would delay other Senate business.

The preparation of self-government regions , the establishment of which by 2000 is confirmed by constitutional legislation , poses the question of further existence of district authorities and the issue of the nature of regional authorities , i.e. whether there should be separate regional self-government and regional public administration bodies.

Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution a special majority for changes to the constitution will be required , making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process , which can be formed from Members of Parliament ( e.g. the U.K. or Germany ) . But in a presidential system , an executive appoints a cabinet to govern from his or her political allies whether or not they are elected ( e.g. the U.S. or Brazil ) and the legislature 's role is reduced to either ratification or veto . </legislation.n.398><legislation.n.399>In the past decade , LPCs have been the focal point for much of the experimentation occurring in China in reforming legislative processes. This trend is due in part to increasing popular demand. The Chinese public no longer places complete trust in government officials or institutions , and increasingly looks to the law as a tool to limit government powers. As a result , the public has shown a growing interest both in seeing quality legislation produced and in having a role in the legislative process.

Enforcement continues to be a challenge for Colombia. Limited resources for prosecutors and investigators have made financial investigations problematic. Continued difficulties in establishing the base predicate offense further contributes to Colombia ? s limited success in achieving money laundering convictions and successful forfeitures of criminal property. Congestion in the court system , procedural impediments and corruption remain continuing problems. Colombia has not yet criminalized the financing of terrorism , although terrorist financing crimes can be prosecuted under other sections of law. The GOC should move promptly on the legislation , specifically criminalize the financing of terrorism , further eliminate procedural impediments , and take other necessary steps to further strengthen its anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing programs . </legislation.n.402><legislation.n.403>In a 5 - 1 decision the New York Court of Appeals found that the legislature and the executive branches had undermined the independence of the judicial branch by tying judges pay raises to unrelated legislation , including bills to raise legislators own salaries , thereby violating the separation of powers doctrine.

After all , it is the states that will have to identify and enroll these children , and states will then bear a significant share of the costs of insuring them.

Although local autonomy may be inviolable in principle as an organisational form it does not contain any guarantee of existence for an individual municipality. Municipalities can be dissolved by means of an act of parliament , tasks can be taken away from them or assigned to them if special reasons of the public well-being speak for this action. These reasons are deemed to be the case if essential territorial and functional reforms are being carried out provided that the structural principle of local autonomy per se remains unaffected . </legislation.n.409><legislation.n.410>The Banking Act 2003 and the Financial Supervisory Commission Act 2003 ( FSCA 2003 ) established a new framework for licensing and prudential supervision of domestic and offshore financial institutions in the Cook Islands.

Research has proven that no method of manual patient lifting is safe and that mechanical patient-lift equipment prevents injuries. Much of the healthcare industry has not voluntarily provided modern patient-lift equipment and has not developed the workplace climate and culture to support its use.

According to iWAR , the California workers ' compensation apportionment law allows unequal treatment between male and female workers who are permanently injured such that women who break a bone at work , for example , receive less from the insurance company because osteoporosis is considered a women ' s problem , and women of color are told their injuries are caused by genetic pre-disposition , and their compensation is reduced. iWAR seeks to have legislation passed to eliminate this type of discrimination against women in the workplace.

Also on Jan. 20 , 2009 America officially became a Communist country and will become ceremonily acknowledged as so when the American gulags , outlined in House Resolution 645 , become operational with occurance of the next terror attack against America. This legislation is being introduced because in every country the communist ' s overthrew they opened these type of facilities and preceded to conduct population reduction against those that could threaten there ability to rule; in Russia there where the men , women and childeren of the Christian faith that were targeted , over 60 million people were murdered , it ' s only plausible that the communist ' s that occupy our government will attempt to do the same here in America . </legislation.n.415><legislation.n.416>In this article , we try to sort out the greatest hits only and warn the reader that there are exceptions to almost everything in employment standards and as if that were not enough , the legislation changes frequently as it is often the target of political re-expression.

When the threat is credible , the firm 's probability assessment in comparison to the effectiveness condition becomes a decisive factor. In order to choose its best response wisely , the firm must figure out what the effectiveness condition is. But to do so , it must be able to tell the level of severity of the threatened legislation , about which it has no information. Short of this information , the level of severity is mired in uncertainty.230 Absent specific information to the contrary , the firm rationally assumes that the chance of lenient , moderate , or severe legislation is equal. Averaging out these chances , the firm effectively faces a threat of moderate legislation and is able to derive the effectiveness condition accordingly . </legislation.n.417><legislation.n.418>In light of the foregoing predictions , I turn to examine the legislative threat that was directed towards colleges and universities in 2003. In this case , the threatened legislation sought to impose financial penalties on institutions that raised tuition too sharply. Amid the national debate over the threatened legislation , universities and colleges - including Harvard University , George Washington University , and the University of Virginia , among many others announced voluntary plans to freeze tuition , increase financial aid , and remove the burden of loans from some students.222 Consistent with the present analysis , even though the " chances for passage were always questionable , " universities complied with the legislative demands to curb tuition rise because the legislation " has stood out as the most punitive of the federal proposals to contain sharp increases in college prices. " 223 In response , lawmakers announced that they would withdraw the threatened legislation that was " no longer necessary because universities seemed to have gotten the message and were taking steps of their own. " 224 </legislation.n.418><legislation.n.419>One way to understand the Religious Right is to look at the kinds of legislation their lawmakers sponsor. In the U.S. Congress and in state legislatures , bills are proposed that are anti-women , anti-labor , and anti-civil rights. Their legislation opposes finance campaign reform; environmental protection; gun control; social justice for the poor; public education; teaching evolution; human sexuality; and a separation of church and state. Their bills show a disregard for the U.S. Constitution , and finally , Democracy itself. Bills coming from the Religious Right favor the wealthy and large corporations. The ultimate political goal is to make this country a Christian nation . </legislation.n.419><legislation.n.420>But in a climactic endgame , Holding exploited commodity-oriented Forest Service officials in Washington , D.C. , found an eager ally in Republican congressman James V. Hansen of Utah , and took advantage of political pressure on the Clinton White House in the wake of the president ' s designation of Grand Staircase-Escalante as a national monument. Through legislation sponsored by Hansen , promoted by Forest Service leadership and acquiesced to by the White House , Holding obtained 1 , 320 acres of choice National Forest land. To avoid delays from further administrative appeals and lawsuits , the legislation exempted Forest Service actions implementing the Snowbasin land exchange from the National Environmental Policy Act , other environmental laws and judicial review. Additional special-interest legislation provided $ 15 million of federal funds to build a road connecting the Snowbasin resort to the interstate highway after Holding reneged on his promise to finance the road. The only glimmer of victory for the public interest in the whole saga came in 2000 when the Clinton administration finally held firm in refusing to allow Holding to build a tourist tram on lands transferred to the Forest Service as part of the Snowbasin land exchange . </legislation.n.420><legislation.n.421>In New York legislation was proposed in 2005 after the tragic death of Jessica Smith , who was killed when a 9-foot piece of ice dislodged and flew from the top of an 18-wheel truck into the windshield of a truck traveling in the opposite direction.

" With a multifaceted approach we can reduce tobacco use , save lives and save money. " </legislation.n.422><legislation.n.423>I might add however , that for the purposes of these proceedings , the key to legality is whether or not the impugned Statutory Instrument No. 136 of 2002 is within or outwith the Act.

There is a considerable amount of guidance that should be followed and some legislation that must be , but the best approach is just to treat it all as a requirement for us and implement what needs to be done. It is surely not Christian to seek to avoid good advice merely because it comes from a secular source. The Home Office has published a code of practice entitled ' Safe from Harm ' which can be downloaded from their website www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs. There is also a useful book that can be obtained from FIEC called ' Child Protection in the Church ' .

In either case , bearer shares should be immobilized. The deficiencies in the anti-money laundering/terrorist financing regimes in the Comoros , and the GOC ? s inability to implement existing legislation make it vulnerable to traditional money laundering and to the financing of terrorism.

No such model was found but the research demonstrated that employment legislation has evolved in other jurisdictions over a period of time as attitudes have become less tolerant of any perceived unfairness in the workplace. Perhaps many jurisdictions have realised the value of their workforce to their economy and as a result have sought to redress the inequality of bargaining power between employer and employee . </legislation.n.447><legislation.n.448>Since 2000 intergovernmental relations in New Zealand have been evolving rapidly as a result of a significant shift in government policy discourse towards a strong central-local government partnership. New statutory provisions empowering local government to promote social , economic , environmental and cultural wellbeing have significant implications for the range of activities in which local authorities are engaged. In turn , this has consequences for the relationship between local government and central government. The effectiveness of the new empowerment and the prospects for further strengthening of the role of local government are critically examined. Despite some on-going tensions , and an inevitable mismatch in the balance of power between central and local government , it is argued that there is a discernible rebalancing of intergovernmental relations as a result of new legislation and central government policy settings which reflect a ' localist turn ' . On the basis of developments since 2000 it may be argued that the New Zealand system of local government is evolving away from the recognised ' Anglo ' model. However , further consolidation is needed in the transformation of intergovernmental relations and mechanisms that will cement a more genuine central-local government partnership . </legislation.n.448><legislation.n.449>Card Check Deal in the Works ? " Senate Democrats on Friday floated a huge trial balloon announcing a possible compromise deal on the Orwellian-named Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) . Better known as 'card check , ' the compromise that was floated would drop the provision that would ban secret ballots for workers when deciding whether or not to unionize their workplace ... . 'The most onerous provision of the legislation is the binding arbitration , ' McKinnon said. 'This is an absolute nightmare for American business which is already strapped to its capacity. This would be hard to imagine under normal circumstances , but it is impossible to imagine under the current economic climate. This provision really translates into a nationalization of American business. It 's a hostile takeover. ' ... 'Under a binding arbitration provision , employees would not even be able to vote on their own contracts ... . So they 'd be working under conditions over which they have no control ... .. It would all be left in the hands of a federal bureaucrat ... . </legislation.n.449><legislation.n.450>The Model Provisions for Certification of Immunisation Status on School and Child Care Entry are intended to provide a policy blueprint to aid the development of new legislation and reviews of existing legislation.

However , CLB believes that it is the duty of the Hong Kong SAR Government to ensure that all and any legislation passed to fulfill its obligations under Article 23 of the Basic Law minimizes threats to civil society and to freedom of information and expression. To this end , we ask the government to clarify the definitions of restricted information and introduce safeguards that will allow the continuation of Hong Kong 's free media , academic research and civil society . </legislation.n.451><legislation.n.452>Mr. SPARKS. Just to answer a little bit , what happened with HCFA in terms of Operation Bad Bundle is that the regulations that they published made it the responsibility of the intermediary , not the hospitals to combine the tests. There was no responsibility in the legislation or in the regulations for the hospitals to do that. OIG , even in their red book report , indicated that the providers did not have that responsibility , that it was the responsibility of the intermediaries . </legislation.n.452><legislation.n.453>The principles and rules we establish and raise our young under may be embellished and improved on with time. Thirty years ago , the Gun Control Act of 1968 was not supposed to lead to registration of all firearms. The Mc Clure-Voelker Act supposedly guaranteed that. But look where the Brady Bill brings us to in November , 1998. A little-publicized add-on to the legislation provides that ALL sales of all guns are to be recorded. Regulations proposed by the Clinton administration provide for saving these records -- and records of repairs of firearms as well -- at least 18 months by the FBI. Where do such embellishments and improvements end ? </legislation.n.453><legislation.n.454>The municipality implements its legislative activity by issuing bylaws and ordinances; this is regulated in further detail in Articles 23 to 28 of the GO. Whereas the bylaw procedure is laid down in the Local Government Law , the ordinance procedure is defined in corresponding Land criminal and ordinance legislation . </legislation.n.454><legislation.n.455>From the 1830s on , lawmakers ' views were repeatedly splintered among the options we have considered -- Complete Bankruptcy , Voluntary Only , and No Bankrupty -- along with variations on these themes. In the twentieth century , Congress has developed institutional structures that can assure stability even in the face of inconsistent preferences.22 One of these , delegation of gatekeeping authority to a committee , dates back to the early nineteenth century. Because the relevant oversight committee determines whether existing legislation is reconsidered , committees have the power to prevent a new Congress from promptly reversing the enactments of its predecessor. In theory , the Judiciary Committee , which has overseen bankruptcy issues since 1821 , could have served this purpose. But committees played a less prominent role in the nineteenth century , in part because both Congress and congressional committees operated on a part-time basis. Neither the Judiciary Committee nor any stable block of lawmakers in Congress was in a position to act as agenda setter and provide the kind of stable outcome we see in other contexts where lawmakers hold inconsistent preferences . </legislation.n.455><legislation.n.456>Incorporating the threat 's probabilistic property into the analysis justifies a refinement of the model 's predictions. In the case of the credible threat equilibrium , " comply " ceases to be the firm 's clear-cut best response. Determining whether " comply " is indeed a best response depends on the probability that the threatened legislation will be enacted into law. A costbenefit analysis indicates that when the threat is credible , compliance becomes the firm 's best response if and only if the expected negative impact of the threatened legislation - which is equal to the loss in utility multiplied by the probability that the legislation will be enacted - exceeds the cost of compliance with the legislator 's demands. In other words , the firm 's cost-benefit analysis now takes into account these variables : ( i ) the cost of compliance; ( ii ) the probability that the threatened legislation will be enacted into law; and ( iii ) the utility loss brought about by the legislation. Mindful of this uncertainty , the firm 's best response strategy is driven by the negative effect on utility of the legislation as it is discounted by the probability that it will not come to pass . </legislation.n.456><legislation.n.457>This rather haphazard approach was followed throughout the world , until the 1970s , when governments began to review health and safety legislation from first principles. In the United Kingdom , this revision process saw a major royal commission led by Lord Robens , and publication of the landmark 'Robens Report ' in 1972. The report recommended the introduction of a single piece of legislation which applied consistent policies and enforcement procedures across the range of industries. It was implemented , and its approach has since been adopted by numerous Commonwealth countries . </legislation.n.457><legislation.n.458>With the new committee in place , the experts will examine draft laws and regulations at regular meetings.

For social control of education a Constitutional amendment could be introduced </legislation.n.460><legislation.n.461>I should emphasize -- as several readers of this book emphasized to me -- that true cycling only occurs under the restrictive conditions defined in Arrow 's Theorem. If lawmakers agreed that one option belongs on the left , one in the center , and one on the right , for instance , their preferences would not be cyclical even if they sharply disagreed about the best choice.20 In view of this , let me emphasize that the principal point of this section is simply that the multiplicity of views contributed to Congress 's inability to reach a stable outcome on federal bankruptcy legislation throughout the nineteenth century. Whether lawmakers ' inconstancy reflected true cycling , or merely a garden-variety case of shifting legislative outcomes , the point remains the same . </legislation.n.461><legislation.n.462>Clarification of the present legislation on social protection will continue. The system has to be clear and predictable from the point of view of individuals and must provide sufficient security. Means of support and life management must be seen as an entity which comprises work , taxation , social protection and services. Transparency between the charges and benefits of the system must be improved . </legislation.n.462><legislation.n.463>The turning point came with the federal bailout legislation passed in October 2008. At the time , dozens of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac evictions were pending in court , and legal aid attorneys were having a hard time finding a foothold to keep their clients in their apartments. Then an attorney at Greater Hartford Legal Aid found a sentence buried in the Economic Stabilization Act ' s 400 pages , requiring that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac permit bona fide tenants who are current on their rent to remain in their homes under the terms of their lease. </legislation.n.463><legislation.n.464>The EU legislation Ronny Jillings refers to ( Viewpoint January 27 ) , is designed to stop misleading health claims being made about food.

The aim of the SFT Act is to restrict the financial resources available to support the activities of terrorist organizations. This legislation criminalizes terrorist financing and substantially increases the penalties that apply when a person uses or deals with suspected terrorist assets that are subject to freezing. The SFT Act enhances the collection and use of financial intelligence by requiring cash dealers to report suspected terrorist financing transactions to AUSTRAC , and relaxes restrictions on information sharing with relevant authorities regarding the aforementioned transactions. The SFT Act also addresses commitments Australia has made with regard to the UNSCR 1373 and is intended to implement the UN International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Under this Act three accounts related to an entity listed on the UNSCR 1267 Sanction Committee ? s consolidated list , the International Sikh Youth Federation , were frozen in September 2002. There have been no arrests or prosecutions under this legislation.

However , the new law does not have striking impact on most people , because fewer companies provide pensions to their employees today. Even if they do , in many cases it is a 401 ( k ) plan with the financial responsibility resting on individuals ' saving. In spite of mixed views , many experts agree that the new law fails to protect employees ' guaranteed benefits , actually putting pension plans at larger risk of being cut or dumped entirely and shifting the retirement burden to employees . </legislation.n.470><legislation.n.471>The Community &amp;Voluntary sector will also have a role to play in the Government 's new initiative to meet the long-term needs of rent supplement tenants. Under the new measures , the rent supplement scheme will be refocused on short-term income support , while local authorities will assume responsibility for meeting long-term housing needs. The new arrangements will put in place positive solutions for people with long-term housing needs and are being introduced in the context of wider Government action , to reform and develop the private rented housing sector. Central to this wider action is the reform of the landlord and tenant legislation through the Residential Tenancies legislation , which passed all stages on Thursday 8th July and will also help to underpin the new arrangements . </legislation.n.471><legislation.n.472>The theory presented in this Article challenges the validity of the conventional wisdom , piercing the fundamental notion of the legal system as a regulatory mechanism and , more broadly , as a social governance institution. Contrary to this wisdom , this theory demonstrates that the threat of legislation in and of itself , rather than legislation , plays a remarkable role in controlling behavior , in setting underlying incentives , in maintaining social order , and in inducing change and effecting social policy. These theoretical insights subvert the long-standing premises on which modern legal systems rest , concerning , in particular , the role of legal norms in controlling activity across diverse social domains.16 In turn , this Article offers a positive theory of social control that is rooted in reality , rather than idealized premises and bygone truisms , thereby providing explanatory value and predictive power . </legislation.n.472><legislation.n.473>The Federal Government is besieged by problems -- and legislation has proven inadequate to eliminate them.

A review is not a bad chance to reflect on your personnel related systems , particularly at a time when there is so much change. We spoke only recently about some of the new legislation , and codes of practice , but this really is such a fast-moving target. Only very recently , just as an instance , ACAS introduced not only the Code of Practice which we looked at last time , on disciplinary and grievance procedures , but also one on personnel record-keeping systems. This whole area remains one where any employer is subject to the risk of potentially large and uninsured claims , as well as disruption to the business. Having a formal review is a good opportunity to take stock , and make sure that you are as well protected as you can be; and that you have adequate systems in place for making sure you keep abreast of future changes . </legislation.n.476><legislation.n.477>Is Howard right to call the Senate a house of obstruction ? On most of the government ' s major reforms : the Workplace Relations Act , the GST , and the partial privatization of Telstra , the Senate has eventually passed amended legislation. No Senate during the Howard years has ultimately blocked a major piece of legislation in the way conservatives forced Gough Whitlam ' s Labor government to a double dissolution in 1974 so that he could enact Medibank in a joint sitting. We can hardly put the government ' s unfair dismissals legislation in the same league as the Medibank scheme , and the Democrats agreed to the major planks of the Government 's industrial relations legislation during Howard 's first term. Moreover , United States researcher Stanley Bach ' s soon-to-be published research shows that the government increasingly relies on Labor ' s co-operation in the Senate to pass its legislation. As Labor acquiesces , the government ' s potential allies against Senate ' obstruction ' only grow . </legislation.n.477><legislation.n.478>The House of Representatives has voted 237 to 185 to approve the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009 ( H.R. 3269 ) , a measure that would give shareholders of public companies an advisory vote on executive compensation.

ACLU ( 1997 ) . Bamberger treats this result as preordained and the CDA as " a prime example of the impact of recklessly passed legislation , " because of the expense incurred by the public-interest plaintiffs ( and powerful media organizations ) who challenged the law. If this seems a meager price to pay for reckless legislation , Bamberger properly suggests that too often there are not organizations with the means to challenge a law , leaving it on the books as a rogue that could fracture future constitutional jurisprudence . </legislation.n.480><legislation.n.481>The remaining alternative is to tackle the social issues gradually , without massive public expenditures or disruptive income transfers. There is plenty of room for improvements. The federal , state and local administrations can improve their ability to deliver services and reduce waste; society can be mobilized to control and supervise the way public money is being spent , and to bring additional resources and voluntary work in support of the needed; iniquities in resource allocations can be redressed by appropriate legislation . </legislation.n.481><legislation.n.482>AUSTIN Gov.

Whichever threat is employed , however , casual observations confirm that legislative threats - including ones exerted by a single legislator - can induce a change in firm conduct.143 Legislative threats therefore provide a powerful regulatory mechanism. What is more , the impact of threats on behavior is often superior to that achieved by enforcing formal legislative measures , even before taking into account the saving of significant expenditures on law enforcement.144 </legislation.n.483><legislation.n.484>Increasing Access : WRI aims to increase citizen and community access to government decision-making as a way to protect the environment and alleviate poverty.

A narrow majority of the Supreme Court has once again overturned decades of precedent and congressional intent and sided with powerful corporate interests on a workplace discrimination case. He further warned that [ l ] ike with the Lilly Ledbetter case , Congress may be forced to clarify the law ' s intent so we can prevent the damage this decision will have on workers ' civil rights. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which was signed into law in January expressly overturned the Supreme Court ' s 2007 decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp;Rubber Co. , Inc. by extending the time period in which employees can assert pay discrimination claims. Therefore , expect the introduction of legislation aiming to amend the ADEA to effectively nullify the Gross opinion , and make it easier for a plaintiff to bring successful disparate impact age discrimination claims against employers . </legislation.n.485><legislation.n.486>Good.

For example , Nicaragua passed " Law 364 , " which requires foreign defendants in actions in Nicaragua to post a $ 15 million bond and be subject to high levels of liability with little due process. This discriminatory foreign legislation renders the Nicaraguan forum so unfavorable that U.S. defendants are themselves forced to opt for a U.S. trial. Another strategy , used by Guatemala , precludes the use of local courts in tort cases brought against American companies that have been dismissed in U.S. courts on forum non conveniens grounds. This strategy forces U.S. courts to take these cases to ensure that the plaintiffs can bring their case in some legal forum . </legislation.n.487><legislation.n.488>1 ) Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) : This bill has received the most attention of all the potential employment legislation and has been the subject of numerous lobbying efforts and advertising campaigns.

The course covers issues such as landmark legislation and cases; administrative law; enforcement and compliance methodologies; medical device regulation; human drug topics such as prescription and over the counter products , drug approvals , promotion , generic and brand issues; cosmetic regulation; food law topics such as additives , claims and safety and product classification. Other topics that may be explored include policy and political issues , ethical issues and corporate accountability . </legislation.n.505><legislation.n.506>Even a brief overview of the debates that led to the 1841 and 1867 acts gives a flavor of the instability that came from the multiplicity of views. The 1841 act was the brainchild of the Whig party , which had made bankruptcy law a crucial plank in the platform that brought them the presidency and control of the Senate the year before. In the face of strong opposition , the Whigs secured the necessary votes for enactment through a controversial log-rolling campaign that obtained votes for bankruptcy in return for votes on a land distribution bill. ( Logrolling is another possible solution to cyclical preferences. Rather than voting their true preferences , lawmakers permit one bill to pass in return for a favorable vote on other legislation . ) </legislation.n.506><legislation.n.507>Liu : Events such as SARS , bird flu and other public health events as well as incidences like pollution of the Songhua River , coal mine accidents and other accidents and natural disasters.

Some of this material was in expanding files making them easy to extract for a committee meeting or ready reference. Dates on the files are for limited chronological periods further suggesting their immediate utility. See also Issue Books . </legislation.n.508><legislation.n.509>In 1968 , Richard M. Nixon ( Republican Party ) used a Southern Strategy , a law and order play on Southern white racist resentment , to win the presidential election. Johnson likely assumed that Civil Rights legislation would bring a flood of black votes to the Democrats nationally , and perhaps compensate somewhat for the certain loss of Southern white racist votes; but , blacks are only about 12 of the population , and Nixon counted on there being more than 12 white racist resentment within the 75 white population both in the South and nationally. He won by a landslide . </legislation.n.509><legislation.n.510>There is considerable concern about the minimal legal provision for supported decision-making , informed consent and rights. Separate legislation is needed to identify the competence of vulnerable adults and particularly adults unable to make decisions on their own behalf , to provide protection for those who lack competence. The Department of Justice , Equality and Law Reform should make this legislation an urgent priority and specify within the Disability Bill that this should be enacted within 24 months . </legislation.n.510><legislation.n.511>I would like to thank the many individuals and organisations who contributed to this consultative process. I look forward to legislation that comprehensively addresses the needs , aspirations and realities of the lives of people with disabilities in Ireland today . </legislation.n.511><legislation.n.512>China Labour Bulletin has therefore first hand knowledge of what constitutes " subversive " actions on the mainland and is extremely worried at the potential for abuse of fundamental rights that legislation on subversion could entail for Hong Kong. It is further worried therefore at the vagueness of the definitions of subversion contained in the proposed legislation and the subsequent potential for abuse. We urge the Hong Kong Government , as a mater of urgency; to redefine and clarify all proposed amendments to the Crimes Ordinance relating to subversion . </legislation.n.512><legislation.n.513>The OQPC Legislation database also shows Current Queensland Reprints arranged alphabetically under the initial letter of the name of an Act. Thus , the current reprint ( Integrated Planning Act 1997 - Reprint No. 4W ) is dated 1 March 2004 and includes commenced amendments up to Act 74 of 2003 . </legislation.n.513><legislation.n.514>This Essay argues that although the president 's ability to remove agency heads gives him enormous power to influence their decisions , it does not give him the authority to dictate substantive decisions entrusted to them by law. When Congress enacts regulatory legislation vesting decisionmaking authority in agency heads , it generally envisions that decisions will be made by persons who possess expertise in the regulatory matters entrusted to them. Although the president 's ability to appoint agency heads and to fire those who defy him makes public dissent by agency officials extremely rare , this dissent nonetheless can provide a highly valuable check on abuses of presidential power . </legislation.n.514><legislation.n.515>The authors explained that the history of environmental regulation in the US has produced a regulatory system focused on controlling workplace exposures and end-of-pipe/fence line emissions , enacting management standards for hazardous wastes , and requiring increased information disclosure and risk assessment for new chemicals and pesticides. The authors also provided some insight into why they believe nanotechnology may require a different approach : the speed at which it is developing; competitive pressures; limited resources available to government regulators; difficulty in enacting new federal environmental legislation; level of scientific uncertainty and the complex risks involved in nanotechnology; difficulty in monitoring nanoscale releases; and the importance to the industry in maintaining public confidence . </legislation.n.515><legislation.n.516>Another group Kennedy fought for are those in the mining industry , with his MINER Act legislation passed in 2006. Despite the new law being passed , Kennedy felt more needed to be done and he continued to call for safety investigations across the country concerning these workers . </legislation.n.516><legislation.n.517>Without denying the difference between men and women , the language used in legislation should aim to put men and women on an equal footing , eschewing any discrimination based on the idea of male superiority over the female sex. It is accordingly recommended that basic texts such as the Constitution should be reviewed in order to eliminate any terms or wording which tend to suggest sexual stereotypes. In this connection , legislators can play a decisive role by using their right of parliamentary initiative. In some languages it is necessary to have laws drafted using both the masculine and feminine forms . </legislation.n.517><legislation.n.518>If all other procedures fail , appellate review affords additional scrutiny to determine whether an award " is . . . reasonable in [ its ] amount and rational in light of [ its ] purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter its repetition. " ( 378 ) Thus , " bad decisions can be reversed and . . . there is no need for extreme legislation , like the kinds being proposed in Congress to limit awards. " ( 379 ) A significant number of appeals of punitive awards yielded favorable results. Defendants appealed more than fifty percent of punitive awards. Appellate courts reduced or reversed more than half of that fifty percent.

I 'll focus specifically on what has become known as ''Operation Bad Bundle .'' </legislation.n.519><legislation.n.520>In my view , it is at this hurdle that the bill falls , and without substantial amendment I will not be able to support it. I appreciate that taking this stance opens one up to the cheap shot that any position other than complete support for the Government 's law and order agenda means that one is soft on crime. That , unfortunately , is one of the problems with this whole debate. There is no room for anything other than black and white or right and wrong; there is no room for grey in this debate. However , the rights and wrongs of this legislation are by no means clear . </legislation.n.520><legislation.n.521>The Washington Post ' s Nick Anderson reported over the weekend that the White House has written a 41-page blueprint to revise No Child Left Behind. It ' s hard to say how much of this proposal will be enacted into law , but what ' s interesting for now is that Obama has singled out NCLB re-authorization. The president , for example , has not laid out a blueprint for immigration reform , or global warming legislation or a revised Employee Free Choice Act . </legislation.n.521><legislation.n.522>We support privacy legislation that prohibits private parties from discriminating against individuals who refuse to disclose or obtain a Social Security number. We also call for legislation prohibiting all governmental entities from requiring the use of the Social Security number except for Social Security transactions. Additionally , we call for the repeal of all laws , regulations , and statutes that require the use of the Social Security number for any purpose other than Social Security transactions . </legislation.n.522><legislation.n.523>Another one of Senator Kennedy 's major initiatives is targeting immigration. Last year , immigration-reform legislation was passed but , according to Kennedy , fell short of achieving the goals it was intended to address. Kennedy has continued to advocate for revisions to the legislation , focusing on these main points : </legislation.n.523><legislation.n.524>A related provision of the legislation promptly transfers a total of $ 8 billion in excess federal payroll tax revenues held in the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund to the unemployment trust funds of all states. The added funds bolster state trust funds at a crucial time , helping them pay UC benefits without resort to borrowing , cuts in benefit levels , or state payroll tax increases. These funds also may be used to increase or expand benefits and to pay administrative costs of both UC and Job Service programs. As such , they present a range of issues and opportunities related to strengthening state UC systems as part of a broader economic safety net . </legislation.n.524><legislation.n.525>INTELLIGENCE LAW REFORM This seminar traces the development of intelligence law from the creation of CIA in 1947 to the War on Terrorism. It looks at the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the recent effort to strengthen intelligence collection , analysis and dissemination in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the inaccurate intelligence on Iraqi WMD , both administratively and with passage of intelligence reform legislation in December 2005. Students shall answer the question of whether the creation of a Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) and a National Counter-Terrorist Center really strengthen the intelligence community ' s ( IC ) performance against the terrorist target and overcome destructive rivalries within the IC. Finally , students decide whether the threat of international and domestic terrorism is primarily an intelligence problem or a law enforcement/military one. The class also examines the propriety and legality of coercive interrogations , pre-emptive incarcerations , and intrusive surveillance in a constitutional democracy . </legislation.n.525><legislation.n.526>Finally , on 18 March , the campaigners from all 4 areas were together at Sanam Luang and presented about 13 million signatures to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Development and Human Security ( SDHS ) to encourage the government and NLA to adopt the draft alcohol control legislation for its effective enforcement before the traditional Thai NewYear Festival ( 13-15April ) . In addition , they passed a letter from the GlobalAlcohol PolicyAlliance ( GAPA ) supporting the alcohol control bill to Minister Paiboon ( SDHS ) . </legislation.n.526><legislation.n.527>The Employment &amp;Pensions Group advises on all employment and pensions law , covering contentious and non-contentious issues. We run six workshop seminars a year covering topical issues directed at HR specialists , publish a monthly bulletin giving up-to-the-minute reports on new cases , legislation and advance warning of likely developments and also offer on-site bespoke training to clients. We act for employers , senior executives , and pension scheme trustees . </legislation.n.527><legislation.n.528>On 11 June 2002 , the Senate voted 54 43 derailing efforts to win a speedy vote on the legislation ( S 625 ) and send it to the House , which has rejected it twice in recent years. While it takes only a simple majority to pass a bill , motions to end debate require 60 votes. Backers of the bill fell six votes short. Current federal law allows only race , color , religion or national origin to be the basis of a federal hate-crime case , and the covered offenses are limited to crimes committed against a person engaged in one of six federally protected activities , such as voting or going to school [ R1.6 ] . </legislation.n.528><legislation.n.529>Government managers who oppose telework are like the ballroom dancing aficionados in college; we know there are a lot of you , but nobody ' s out on the floor. Telework is certainly not a new craze in government. In fact , Uncle Sam has spent decades trying to move his distributed workforce to the beat. Despite legislation , the $ 4 gallon of gas , bird flu , H1N1 , hurricane planning , green initiatives , cloud enablement , traffic gridlock , and so on , many agencies still have two left feet in telework . </legislation.n.529><legislation.n.530>Differing from Nevada 's recognition of same-sex domestic partnerships , in D.C. , the unions will be called marriages. The legislation reportedly states that " any person ... may marry any other eligible person regardless of gender. " And though it is not expected to face any opposition in council , in order to become law , the bill is subject to review by Congress within 30 days of passage in city council . </legislation.n.530><legislation.n.531>The principal topic is the evolving regulation of companies and corporate governance , with frequent comparison to US rules. The seminar will review the basic structure of French , German and UK companies , together with the public disclosure , capital maintenance , merger and basic accounting rules imposed by EU company law. The recent Court of Justice doctrine on the right of company establishment will be analyzed. Special attention is given to the controversial Takeover Directive and the recent Corporate Governance Action Plan , with its legislation and recommendations concerning boards of directors and the role and independence of auditors , in contrast to Sarbanes-Oxley rules. The European Codes of Conduct and soft law approach will be emphasized . </legislation.n.531><legislation.n.532>U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet on Wednesday declined once again to take a position on a labor-business battle royale over legislation that could make it easier for workers to organize . </legislation.n.532><legislation.n.533>The talk of providing a social safety net for the most vulnerable section of the workers in this country had been in the air ever since the ushering in of the economic liberalisation policies since 1991. Rather , this has been flaunted as a quid pro quo to carrying out of the much-hyped labour market reforms , giving the employers the much sought after flexibility in their handling of labour related maters. The duality in the approach of the successive governments at the centre in relation to these two issues is striking. On the labour market reforms , well-formulated proposals accompanied by concrete amendments and drafts of new legislations are brought out for discussion , some of them already approved by the union cabinet or even introduced in parliament. But , on the issue of welfare of unorganised sector workers , benevolent platitudes are showered aplenty but when it comes to specifics , the outcome is half-hearted and miserly. The UPA government has chosen to pursue the same track , dithering on the issue of comprehensive legislation , which had been the unanimous demand of the trade unions . </legislation.n.533><legislation.n.534>Enter Google. Google brings to the table two now-obvious insights. First , that the internet is not a collection of independent sites , but a vast community of interconnected and interdependent information. Second , that the community understands itself better than any computer could. Roughly , Google determines the relevance of a given site to a given phrase not by the incidence of that phrase on the page , but by the incidence of the phrase in reference to that site. I know much better which websites are relevant to Austrian Economics , because I actually read them. Thus , Google looks at what amounts to price signals on the internet : the ever-important link. Additionally , links from a given page carry weight. We here at Law , Legislation , and Lunacy , add very little to the strength of Glen Whitman 's blog in Google 's eyes because we have a relatively low status on the web. Meanwhile , Volokh linking to him boosts him rather quickly , as they have themselves an immense number of websites linking to them . </legislation.n.534><legislation.n.535>The legislation would require federal agencies to give the regulated community adequate notice of the interpretation of an ambiguous rule. Agencies and courts would be barred from imposing penalties based on rules or policies that are not clearly known to the regulated community. The agencies would be subsequently encouraged to make known what is required or prohibited by their rules . </legislation.n.535><legislation.n.536>Endorsing an evidence-based practice model , it is a puzzle why the nursing community has not demanded that the evidence on prevention of back injury to nurses be put into practice ! Even with the escalating shortage , nursing remains incredibly passive on the disabling and discarding of nurses who want to work ! It appears that legislation will be required to force provision of protection . </legislation.n.536><legislation.n.537>" We are pleased to work with Rep. Conyers on this important piece of legislation , " added Johnson. " Nurses around the country are ready to fight for this measure , which not only protects nurses but helps patients get the care they need by making hospital nursing jobs more attractive . </legislation.n.537><legislation.n.538>An important determinant of the possible contribution of access legislation to transparent governance is the scope of the application. Iyer ( 2006 ) and Mendel ( 2005 ) suggest that the scope of coverage refers to the subjects covered by the act as well as the coverage of " public authorities " which are expected to provide access to their records. Neilsen ( 2006 ) and Roberts ( 2002 ) both comment on the fact that as governments continue to expand their privatization programmes , and divest agencies and enterprises to private holdings , access legislation will lose its comprehensive effect unless there is expansion of its scope to include the private sector . </legislation.n.538><legislation.n.539>Nevada State Senate Bill 283 went into effect this week , recognizing rights of same-sex couples equal to those of married couples.

Within this time , ministries responsible for finance , justice and administration and the Government Office for Legislation can request an extension of this deadline to nine working days in those cases where materials are extensive or if the adoption of the proposals would have significant financial implications , would place additional burdens on the judicial system and the public administration , or if the legal system would have to be changed as a consequence. If members of the Government have commented on the proposals , the procedure for dealing with the issue in question continues following the receipt of a notice from the proposer , either that the proposal has been harmonised , or that the harmonisation process has been unsuccessful and that he or she requests that the proposal be dealt with in spite of it not being harmonised. Proposals , which have not been harmonised within a month of their publication , are removed from governmental procedure . </legislation.n.540><legislation.n.541>The main objective of the Bill is to establish and constitute the South African Developmental Welfare Council. The primary role of the Council will be to facilitate interaction between government and civil society in regards to policy , legislation , and developmental social welfare issues.

Amazingly , there has not been a major rail safety legislation enactment since 1994. Several of the highlights of the railroad safety legislation are covered in Rick ' s article including positive train control , mandated by 2015; new requirements and regulations relating avoiding accidents and injuries due to crew fatigue; authorization of monies for Amtrak; minimum training for railroad conductors; regulations prohibiting railroads from interfering with medical treatment of injured railroad employees , provisions mandating railroad supervisors carry workers to the nearest medical facility , and hours of service limitations and the first time legislation has addressed limbo time.

By exercising rights that assist in removing barriers to full participation people with disabilities can live with maximum autonomy , independence and dignity. The DLCG considers disability legislation to be one element of a genuinely inclusive society that is open to all by promoting and supporting equality , participation and social inclusion of people with disabilities. This legislation should implement the commitments made in A Strategy for Equality. It will complement national , European and international obligations , and set an ambitious agenda for the future rooted in a social and human rights model of disability . </legislation.n.548><legislation.n.549>The Residential Tenancies Act , 2006 ( RTA ) takes effect January 31 , 2007.

During this period , Mr. Watchman worked extensively on the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act , the Civil Rights Act of 1991 , and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.

" </legislation.n.554><legislation.n.555>Agitation for bankruptcy legislation rose to a fever pitch at roughly twenty-year intervals throughout the nineteenth century. A depression starting in 1793 led to the first federal bankruptcy law in 1800 -- an act that Congress repealed three years later.5 Congress went back to the drawing board in the 1820s , when financial crisis and the controversy over the Bank of the United States prompted calls for another bankruptcy law. The debates never came to fruition , however , and it was not until 1841 , following the Panic of 1837 , that Congress passed its second bankruptcy law. The 1841 act lasted only two years , when defections from the party that had won its passage , the Whigs , led to repeal. The cycle came around once more on the eve of the Civil War , with the Panic of 1857 putting bankruptcy back on the agenda , and setting the stage for the 1867 act. The 1867 act lasted longer than its predecessors , with a movement for repeal leading to amendment instead in 1874. But by 1878 , the nation was once again without a federal bankruptcy law . </legislation.n.555><legislation.n.556>Members of Tasmania 's Upper House were divided last night over legislation allowing unions to enter workplaces for health and safety reasons.

We know , then , that such studies anticipating the effects of proposed policies and legislation already exist. It is my opinion that senators should have access to them in order to know not only the objectives of the government , but , primarily , to know what the government in office expects the potential impact of a bill to be. The government already conducts these studies. The purpose of this motion is therefore to ensure that the legislative branch has access to impact studies prepared by the executive branch. Providing these studies to senators would not involve more time or money . </legislation.n.561><legislation.n.562>Disputes arising out of individual employment contracts or out of employment legislation governing employment relationships are subject to the competence of the district courts. District courts also deal with employment-related criminal cases.

The legislation includes health and safety requirements for all types of child care and requires that states allow parental choice in the selection of all types of child care and requires that states allow parental choice in the selection of a child care provider. Parental choice has increased the use of informal care. To provide protection for children in informal care , the Child Care Administration has amended its regulations , policy and procedures to require Child Protective Services ( CPS ) clearances for informal providers and any adult regularly present in the provider 's home during child care hours and limit to six the number of children in an informal provider 's care . </legislation.n.563><legislation.n.564>There are a number of laws and policies which impact on records retention.

In gametheoretic parlance , brinkmanship is the creation and gradual escalation of the risk of the threatened consequences.208 Applied to this context , a legislator can take various actions that gradually and steadily raise the likelihood of the threatened legislation , continuing all the way to the point at which the probability is equal to ( or greater than ) the effectiveness condition.209 In order to serve their purpose , however , these actions must be common knowledge : the firm must know that the legislator has taken these actions. Examples of legislative brinkmanship abound. Negotiating with fellow lawmakers in order to secure sufficient political support is one form of legislative brinkmanship. Pushing the legislative process forward is another. Inciting public opinion buildup concerning the policy in question , thereby attracting other lawmakers and gaining their political support , provides a third possible action . </legislation.n.568><legislation.n.569>Figure 3 , which is shown on the next page , represents a game with imperfect information. The notion of imperfect information captures situations in which one player holds more information than the other. The allocation of information in this game is imperfect because the legislator does not reveal the chosen level of severity , keeping it private. This is consistent with casual observation that shows that rarely do legislators divulge such information. Even more , in some cases a legislator may be - or pretends to be - undecided on thisissue at the time she issues the threat. Either way , absent information indicating otherwise , there is an equal chance that the terms of the threatened legislation will be lenient , moderate , or severe . </legislation.n.569><legislation.n.570>The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in obiter dicta held that Provincial contributory negligence apportionment legislation would apply to a collision governed by Canadian Maritime Law.

However , there are a range of moral rights that might be termed institutional moral rights . These are moral rights that depend in part on rights generating properties possessed by human beings qua human beings , but also in part on membership of a community or of a morally legitimate institution , or occupancy of a morally legitimate institutional role. Such institutional moral rights include the right to vote and to stand for political office , the right of legislators to enact legislation , of judges to make binding judgments , of police to arrest offenders , and of patients to sue doctors for negligence . </legislation.n.571><legislation.n.572>The internal supervision is based on Finnish legislation , ownership policy , steering and supervision of the Board of Directors and internal supervision guidelines and instructions approved by the Board of Directors. The functionality of internal supervision is ensured through appropriate organisation of tasks and competence and proper practices of the operating management.

South-Eastern Underwriters Ass'n , 322 U.S. 533 ( 1944 ) . In South-Eastern Underwriters , the court mustered a 4-3 majority to hold that Paul 's cramped notion of commerce , if it had ever made any sense , was no longer tolerable in light of the Roosevelt-era expansion of the concept. The federal government was thus liberated to throw its commerce clause powers , including its antitrust arsenal , at the insurance industry and to invoke the mighty " dormant commerce clause " to threaten the panoply of protectionist state legislation that had grown up under the constitutional shield created by Paul v. Virginia . </legislation.n.573><legislation.n.574>Among other things , the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 establishes a number of statutory committees of the Parliament at s.80. A Scrutiny of Legislation Committee was first established in 1995 and continues to operate under the Act of 2001. The Committee 's areas of responsibility are set out in s.103.

Therefore , at times people were admitted for non-medical reasons. To rectify this situation , in 1994 the federal government introduced a separate piece of legislation regarding statutory long-term care insurance. All members of Sickness Funds as well as people with full-cover private health care insurance were declared mandatory members of the long-term care insurance scheme , which is administered by both the Sickness Funds and the private insurers. Members and their employers must contribute jointly 1.7 of monthly gross income ( or 0.85 each ) . </legislation.n.578><legislation.n.579>The ECCB also conducts on-site inspections for anti-money laundering compliance of onshore and offshore banks in Dominica. Inspections of the offshore banks are conducted by the ECCB in collaboration with the FSU. The ECCB is unable to share examination information directly with foreign regulators or law enforcement personnel; however , legislation to permit such sharing is being drafted. The Offshore Banking ( Amendment ) Act No. 16 of 2000 prohibits the opening of anonymous accounts , prohibits IBCs from direct or indirect ownership of an offshore bank , and requires disclosure of beneficial owners and prior authorization to changes in beneficial ownership of banks. All offshore banks are required to maintain a physical presence in Dominica and to have available for review on-site books and records of transactions . </legislation.n.579><legislation.n.580>Under the Canada Assistance Plan ( from 1966 to 1996 , followed by a phase-out period ) , provinces and territories were required , as a condition of federal cost sharing , to establish an appeal system in their social assistance legislation for people who feel deprived of basic necessities under social assistance programs.

Apparently , it 's a larger problem than I thought. According to a recent article in the New York Times , several states have enacted legislation or are in the process of outlawing " DWT " or " Driving While Texting. " Seems that too many of our fellow drivers ca n't keep their hands off of their cell phone text messaging features while they are cruising.

The clarity of legislation as a legal institution depends on the clarity of the individual enactments that it comprises. A high-quality structure can not be built with poor-quality bricks. The quantity of enactments , the system used to organise them and the connections made between them all play decisive roles , just as the way in which bricks are arranged and cemented into place contributes to the quality of the building . </legislation.n.588><legislation.n.589>The Legal Canada Community provides practical legal information aimed at people living in Canada.

However , the law is not enough. Without a strong commitment from all society , including the active participation of disabled people and their organisations in securing their own rights , legislation remains an empty shell. Public education is therefore necessary to back up legislative measures and to increase understanding of the needs and rights of disabled people in society and to fight the prejudice and stigmatisation that still presently exists . </legislation.n.590><legislation.n.591>Ideally , national legislation for safe patient handling would outlaw the manual lifting of patients and would require use of safe mechanical patient lift equipment by nurses , nursing assistants , lift teams , and all other healthcare workers , across all acute care , long-term care , and residential care settings , wherever dependent patients and residents require assistance with lifting and movement needs. A national " no manual patient lifting " standard would also reduce pain and injuries to patients such as skin tears , abrasions , dislocations , tube dislodgement , and being dropped , which sometimes occur during attempts by nursing staff to manually lift . </legislation.n.591><legislation.n.592>As in the earlier analysis , the players ' behavior in equilibrium depends on : ( i ) whether the threat is credible; and ( ii ) whether the probability of passing the threatened legislation is higher or lower than the effectiveness condition.

After a period when social partner Framework Agreements were given legal effect by a Council decision and were transposed into the legislation of the member states , negotiations on other topics stalemated. In particularly since the beginning of 2000 , little progress has been made towards new legislation as the social partners failed to reach an agreement. Especially the employers are also less pressed to cooperate since the shadow of hierarchy is rather light given the interest heterogeneity of national governments and the shift away from social democratic dominance , as one employer representative admits : </legislation.n.595><legislation.n.596>The country has an underdeveloped financial infrastructure , containing six small private banks and three government banks. Currently , there are no foreign banks that operate within the country. The Central Bank has mandated that banks report suspicious transactions , but supervision capability is limited , as most records and communications are not yet computerized. Foreign exchange controls limit possession of foreign currency , and the government controls the exchange of foreign currency into local currency. There are no money laundering controls applicable to non-banking financial institutions or intermediaries. The Government of Ethiopia ( GOE ) has proposed counterterrorism legislation , which is still under review in Parliament. The Central Bank has the authority to identify , freeze , and seize terrorist finance related assets , and it has done so in the past. The Central Bank routinely circulates to its financial institutions the names of suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations listed on the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee ? s consolidated list. During 2005 , no assets linked to these persons or entities have been identified . </legislation.n.596><legislation.n.597>In principle , the Federation is only the guarantor of the institutions of local government , but has - apart from a few exceptions - no direct relations to individual municipalities or districts.

The Secretary of Agriculture was now authorized to inspect and condemn any meat packing product , which was found to be unfit for human consumption standards. This law was motivated for the protecting of Americans and their diets. Before the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 was passed , food products did not have explanatory labels with full accuracy ( although not everyone complied ) . Despite this , other laws were passed to back up the 1906 meat inspection federal law such as the Pure Food and Drug Act passed on June 30 , 1906 . </legislation.n.600><legislation.n.601>Senators Ken Salazar and Lamar Alexander and Representative Mark Udall have introduced legislation that would translate many of the key recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group into U.S. law.

The House Committee on Financial Services voted 40-28 on Tuesday to advance the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009 ( H.R. 3269 ) . In addition to providing shareholders of public companies with the ability to vote their approval of such executive compensation packages , this legislation requires members of public company compensation committees to be independent , and establishes an ability for the compensation committee to engage the services of independent consultants and counsel. Separately , in sections affecting financial institutions , this bill would require reporting of incentive compensation and its relationship to risk management and would authorize regulators of such institutions to prohibit compensation structures that encourage inappropriate risks.

Specifically , the legislation would reinstate the motivating factor standard that was previously used for age discrimination cases and repudiate the but for analysis adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court.

On further investigation , this thesis received further confirmation. A practising County Archaeologist and the Training Officer of the Institute of Field Archaeologists , the guardians of standards in British Archaeology , said on questioning , I think its important that they ( archaeologists ) know about common law.

While I support instant background checks that are immediately erased from government computers if the applicant is a law-abiding citizen , I do not believe that new federal laws and restrictions will do anything to curb gun violence in America. As a state legislator , I helped pass the conceal-carry law in Texas. As a Congressman , I have helped pass legislation to arm pilots against terrorist hijackers , as well as the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act which will protect law abiding firearms manufacturers and dealers from liability for crimes committed with firearms , and I supported allowing the Assault Weapons Ban to expire . </legislation.n.610><legislation.n.611>Amending enactments is a regular part - in terms of the volume of documents , even the biggest part - of legislative activity. As far as clarity of legislation is concerned , the amendment of enactments is a delicate task in two respects : not only must the amendments be perfectly integrated into the enactment concerned but the amended enactment must also be consistent with the rest of the legislation.

An article should not contain more than three paragraphs. Provisions that do not comply with this requirement often betray an imperfect design on the part of the persons who drafted them or the legislature , or they are the result of changes that the document has undergone.

Following the same source , a survey made in 2006 showed that the overall market size for public sector information only in the EU is estimated at 27 billion. The EU adopted the PSI Directive in 2003 [ EU-PSID ] to overcome barriers that limit the re-use of government information; this Directive deals with how public sector bodies should make their information available for re-use , and with key issues like transparency of what is available and under which conditions , fair competition and non-discrimination between all potential re-users. The transposition of this Directive into national legislations in the EU includes the promotion of the re-use through multi-channel platforms as , for example , in the case of the national law of Spain . </legislation.n.635><legislation.n.636>In order to pass this legislation that would prohibit individual states from recognizing same-sex marriages , the measure would need two-thirds of support in the Senate and House , as well as be ratified by at least 38 state legislatures.

The dispute arose because , arguably , editing out such materials violates artistic copyrighted content. Reinforcing the Committee 's interest that the industry and the manufacturer end the dispute , the chairman threatened to introduce formal legislation to address these issues if the parties did not reach an agreement.

Should the New Deal Congress have given up on its program of economic recovery after the Supreme Court struck down its early efforts ? Bamberger unfortunately does not consider the legislature 's plight during the New Deal. The structure of his argument against enactment of laws deemed unconstitutional , however , appears to suggest that a legislature should be held to a similar standard as is a lawyer : not to put forth legislation where there is no bona fide argument that the law will survive judicial scrutiny or where existing precedents against it , if any , have not been impaired by subsequent decisions. If this is indeed his position , one wishes he had addressed arguments in favor of allowing a political body somewhat greater leeway than a lawyer or in granting the legislature an appropriate role in fomenting new constitutional interpretations . </legislation.n.663><legislation.n.664>When groups are relatively small , members may contract with one another and ensure compliance.

The stated purpose of the Emergency Influenza Containment Act ( H.R. 3991 ) which applies to employers with 15 or more employees is to ensure that American workers are able to follow , without financial harm , the recommendations of their employer and public health authorities to stay home when they have symptoms of a contagious disease that may put co-workers , customers , or the public at risk. Under the terms of this legislation , which covers both full- and part-time workers , employees would be entitled to this paid leave only if they are sent home or advised to stay home by their employers.

Although Botswana does not yet have a full-fledged financial intelligence unit , the DCEC has responsibility for investigating suspected instances of money laundering , and it can demand access to bank records if needed during the course of an investigation. Currently the law provides for asset forfeiture only after a conviction. During an investigation , the government may appeal to the High Court for a restraining order effectively freezing the financial assets of a suspect , but only for a non-renewable , seven-day period. Government agencies are actively considering the need for broader asset forfeiture to allow a financial intelligence unit to effectively combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

Roughly speaking , legislation and policymaking are primarily the responsibility of the federal government and are therefore centralized ( although Land governments also play a major role in shaping national legislation via the Federal Council , Bundesrat ) , but administration , including implementation of federal laws and policies , is heavily decentralized and deconcentrated. Carrying out federal law and administering federal policies is generally the task of the L nder . The L nder have , on their part , left most of the administrative and implementation functions to the local authorities. Hence , the lion 's share of public functions falls to the local authorities , particularly those involving direct contact with citizens. There are , of course , exceptions. The operation of the school system as well as of the police are traditionally under the direct administrative responsibility of the L nder.

Although the proposed legislation would modify some of those standards , and while an enforcement mechanism has been added , the protection offered still is premised on individuals being able to take responsibility for themselves.

NASW and our coalition partners have been successful in convincing the Senate to reject the bill for now , but proponents have introduced new bills to nationalize the regulation of the small group health insurance market.

The bills are in the drafting stage in several congressional committees and likely to see action later this year in a lame-duck session . </legislation.n.699><legislation.n.700>In the democratic tradition , governance was based on the power of numbers. Majority will was law , even though it might be irresponsible or disadvantageous to minorities. As the expenditure of growing taxation took over from simple legislation as the main pre-occupation of government , the added influence accompanying the power to dispense money tended to corrupt legislators. The 'rewards ' of office increased , as also did campaign expenditure , and those who financed the campaigns of legislature-hopefuls naturally expected to be rewarded if their candidate was successful. Governments became unresponsive and secretive , their powers and the taxation needed to support them steadily increased . </legislation.n.700><legislation.n.701>Many of the laws mentioned above apply to the unorganised sector also. In some cases a separate notification may be necessary to extend the application of a particular law to a new sector. It is useful to notice that some pieces of legislation are more general in character and apply across the board to all sectors. The Trade Union Act 1926 , The Minimum Wages Act 1948 , The Contract Labour ( Regulation and Abolition ) Act 1970 , The Workman ' s Compensation Act 1923 , and The Payment of Wages Act 1936 are examples of this type. In certain cases , even the IDA 1947 would be included . </legislation.n.701><legislation.n.702>The question about the proposed legislation is if any action regarding defamatory statements is even possible under current law. The legislation might at least force the repeal of slander and libel laws and remove from state legal codes the suggestion that there are any protections against defamation . </legislation.n.702><legislation.n.703>Chapter 3 is primarily an analysis of two pieces of legislation the Civil Rights Act ( CRA ) of 1991 , and the Violence Against Women Act ( VAWA ) of 1994. Mink discusses the CRA 's reinstatement of the disparate-impact test for discrimination set forth in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. ( 1971 ) , which had been watered down by a series of Supreme Court decisions. She also tells us about the monetary remedies for intentional discrimination ( including sexual harassment ) that were proposed as a needed incentive to women to come forward and complain , as well as an incentive to employers " to prevent and stop sexual harassment and other forms of sex discrimination. " ( 96 ) </legislation.n.703><legislation.n.704>The Superiority of Self-Regulation over Legislation : Provided they adequately account for externalities , firms are best situated to regulate risk and conduct.173 Compared with legislators , firms incur fewer costs in discovering the correlation between processes and outputs. This is due to the fact that firms , not legislators , are better informed of the source of the problem , its scope , and its possible solutions; 174 they are also better positioned to devise cost-effective solutions and policies for dealing with the very same concerns that legislators seek to address by means of legislation. Hence , threat-induced self-regulation offers a superior functional and cost-effective method for achieving the policy objectives underlying the threatened legislation . </legislation.n.704><legislation.n.705>However , social audit arrangements have mostly been ineffective because there is no legal provision for punitive action. States should enact legislation to facilitate social audit by the Gram Sabha . </legislation.n.705><legislation.n.706>The Patriot Act II bill itself is stamped " Confidential -Not for Distribution. " Upon reading the analysis and bill , I was stunned by the scientifically crafted tyranny contained in the legislation. The Justice Department Office of Legislative Affairs admits that they had indeed covertly transmitted a copy of the legislation to Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert , ( R-Il ) and the Vice President of the United States , Dick Cheney as well as the executive heads of federal law enforcement agencies . </legislation.n.706><legislation.n.707>As a member of the European Union ( EU ) , France is obligated to implement all three EU money laundering directives , including the revision of Directive 91/308/EEC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( Directive 2001/97/EC ) , that was transposed into domestic French legislation in 2004. The EU adopted the Third Money Laundering Directive ( 2005/60/EC ) in late 2005 , and must be implemented in France by December 15 , 2007 . </legislation.n.707><legislation.n.708>A 1998 Policy Report by the National Center for Policy Analysis looked at obstacles to the growth of the U.S. MSA market. [ 82 ] Among other things , the NCPA suggested that the range of permitted deductibles was too narrow and the limit on the amount that could be deposited to an MSA account could expose MSA holders to substantial out-of-pocket health care expenses before their insurance took over. Concluding that the MSA legislation was " the result of a number of political compromises that had little to do with health policy , economic research or market demand " , [ 83 ] the NCPA made a number of recommendations for MSA reform , including the following : </legislation.n.708><legislation.n.709>Even individuals and organizations that are not active Internet users play a role in the Internet governance function. The general public wields its influence primarily through political arenas. Public concerns influence the conduct of governments and businesses. An increasing number of issues affecting Internet governance are gaining wider visibility among the general public. Issues such as information privacy , use of the Internet for traditional government functions ( e.g. , education , voting , development of legislation , constituent contact ) , and online taxation now attract the attention and interest of a growing segment of the general public , extending well beyond the core group of active Internet users. Some other current examples of topics now drawing increasing governance attention because of the interest spurred by the general public are privacy of personal data in the online environment and management of online advertising directed toward children. Other Internet topics will highlighted by similar general public interest in the future. That public concern is recognized by elected political officials , who in turn will take legislative and regulatory action to try to respond to the public concern. In this way , the public at large has the ability to influence Internet governance . </legislation.n.709><legislation.n.710>That regional districts are so heterogeneous raises a question : is it feasible to make system-wide changes to legislation or policy and achieve positive results in all regions ? Since the third-generation regional district legislation in 2000 , provincial improvement strategies have moved toward expanding the array of tools and techniques that can be employed differentially by individual regional districts. The in-progress RDTF review , which is developing improvement strategies intended for selective application , is an example . </legislation.n.710><legislation.n.711>In 1914 , the Ontario Government established a workers ' compensation plan for workers who had become disabled on the job. The enactment of this legislation advanced the means used by government to enforce its policy. This is considered to be the first example of a social insurance program enshrined in provincial legislation in Canada. Other provinces followed Ontario 's lead and during the next thirty years , workers compensation programs were set up across the country.

His legislations were typically marked with a civil rather than a religious nature. . His legislations , dating back to the 18th Dynasty ( circa 1330 BC ) were the first to enshrine public freedoms and rights. He also emphasized the concept of public posts as a means to serve rather than to overpower the people . </legislation.n.714><legislation.n.715>Throughout the 1990s , environmental organizations were funded to achieve specific goals. Executives from many of the major environmental groups occupied management positions in the Clinton-Gore administration , and were only too willing to make grants to these organizations , and to rewrite regulations and push for legislation to expand government control over all land use . </legislation.n.715><legislation.n.716>For the last four years , a Republican Congress has done almost nothing to rein in the expansion of presidential power. This abdication of responsibility has been even more remarkable than the president 's assumption of new powers. In recent months , though , Bush 's relative unpopularity , as reflected in opinion polls , has emboldened Congress to take some steps toward reasserting its oversight role. In addition to the new anti-torture legislation , there is talk of requiring regular reports on secret detentions; and last month Congress nearly allowed the U.S.A. Patriot Act to lapse , granting only a five-week extension instead of the full renewal sought by the administration. Still , political logic dictates that , as long as Republicans control Congress , its oversight will be cautiously managed so as not to harm the party or the party 's next presidential candidate. And even accounting for a legislative backlash , history suggests that the presidency ultimately emerges stronger after a president makes new claims of his constitutional authority . </legislation.n.716><legislation.n.717>Congressman Shays introduced legislation in 2006 which , although not passed by Congress , laid the groundwork for the introduction of the current cruise safety bill.

In general the proposed legislation still goes far beyond what is needed to implement Article 23 and is likely to increase restrictions upon the fundamental human rights of Hong Kong citizens. In the light of the definition or indeed lack of definition of several of the proposed offences we remain appalled at the potential for abuse of the proposed legislation . </legislation.n.720><legislation.n.721>The National Council does not initiate legislation , but votes on bills proposed by Prince Rainier III , the principality ' s ruler of 53 years. It also votes the country ' s budget , and plays a role in the ratification of certain international treaties.

Post-implementation reviews of legislation should therefore be mandatory within a given timeframePCG recommends two yearsand these reviews must be open to public scrutiny. The reviews must also involve consultation with those affected by the legislation under scrutiny to determine whether it has been a success or not . </legislation.n.722><legislation.n.723>A significant portion of the report concentrates on the World Bank ' s work in these areas because about one quarter of all Bank lending operations have targeted public sector governance and the rule of law over the past five fiscal years. The report underlined that , Across-the-board anti-corruption campaigns and broad civil service reforms have often yielded disappointing outcomes , because they have focused on passing of legislation or on establishing new institutions , but they have paid insufficient attention to how such laws will be enforced and how new institutions will carry out their mandate. </legislation.n.723><legislation.n.724>Currently , cruise ships operating under foreign flags of convenience are not required under U.S. law to report crimes occurring outside of U.S. territorial waters. Legislation approved today will ensure that crimes committed while aboard cruise ships do not escape the jurisdiction of American law enforcement. Title IX requires cruise ships to comply with design and construction standards , such as specific rail heights , peep holes , warning devices and cabin security measures. The bill also requires that vessels are equipped with a video surveillance system to assist in documenting and prosecuting crimes , and it requires vessels to maintain a log book to record reports on specified complaints. Finally , once enacted , vessels will be required to contact the nearest FBI office as soon as possible to report incidents involving homicide , suspicious deaths , missing U.S. nationals , kidnapping , assault , and other serious occurrences . </legislation.n.724><legislation.n.725>" Women who are victims of rape put their trust in authorities to bring their offenders to justice. When evidence that is so painstakingly collected sits untested , stored away on police departments ' shelves , that trust is violated. This mandate must be put in place to assure rape victims that their cases will be effectively prosecuted and their offenders put behind bars. This legislation will put Illinois at the forefront of this issue and help bring about justice for victims. " </legislation.n.725><legislation.n.726>Relaxing the demands and lowering the cost of compliance are undesirable from the legislator 's utility-maximization perspective.200 Intensifying the severity of the threatened legislation201 is similarly unattractive.202 The intuition here is that the harsher the threatened legislation is , the more implausible - perhaps impossible - it will be to enact it into law , unless a substantive compromise is made. This highlights the existence of an inverse correlation between the severity and probability of threatened legislation. For this reason , increasing the severity of the threatened legislation may proportionately lower its probability of enactment. And , because the expected negative impact remains virtually unchanged , increasing the severity will have no bearing on the firm 's incentive to comply . </legislation.n.726><legislation.n.727>Free access to education has meant that women in the UAE have been able to play a significant role in development with the complete support and commitment of Sheikh Zayed and the UAE government. The belief that women are entitled to take their place in society is grounded in the UAE Constitution. These constitutional guarantees have been carried through into implementing legislation . </legislation.n.727><legislation.n.728>On balance , I thought the change process was a good thing , part of a more wide-ranging microeconomic reform agenda. I did n't think the Westminster traditions were under siege : rather I welcomed the removal of burdensome prescriptive controls that beset management of the Australian Public Service. I saw no significant threat to integrity. The formulation of public service values in legislation enhanced understanding of the complex relationships between assertiveness and responsiveness , responsibility and accountability , openness and confidentiality that govern the respective roles of Minister , Parliament and public servant. I was all in favour of getting the best value-for-money from taxpayer funds , whether through improved public service performance or outsourced delivery. I believed that cross-agency teams improved not only public policy but enjoyment of the workplace. If this was post-modern I was for it. It certainly sounded more youthful than the eponymous labels of ' baby boomer ' or ' veteran ' . </legislation.n.728><legislation.n.729>Although never adopted , the proposed legislation points out the need for informing employees , among others , of the intent to monitor the workplace. Although the AMA survey indicated that only 25 of the companies surveyed inform employees of their monitoring and surveillance practices , smart employers are choosing to notify employees in advance about the possibility that their activities may be monitored. These notices are often contained in a written electronic media policy or within the employees handbook. Given the risks involved in not informing employees of monitoring and surveillance activities , it 's smart employee relations , smart risk management and smart management . </legislation.n.729><legislation.n.730>The Act on Cooperation within Undertakings will be completely reformed. In order to create opportunities for real negotiation and actual participation , the aim of the reform will be to bring more issues involving workplace development and operations and work organization within the sphere of cooperation than is the case at present. Issues involving the organization of work will not , however , affect the right to supervise work. Whether the municipal sector could be brought within the sphere of the Act will be explored. The Annual Holidays Act and the Act on the supervision of occupational health and safety will be reformed following tripartite negotiations. The legislation on data protection in working life will be supplemented based on the work of the working group on alcohol and drug testing and technical surveillance , on the principle that employees ' personal data and privacy must be protected. The functioning of personnel funds will be developed . </legislation.n.730><legislation.n.731>The Cambodia Disabled People 's Organisation ( CDPO ) drafted the initial text of the draft Legislation in 1995 , but it was not until February 2000 that it was submitted to the former Ministry of Social Affairs , Labour , Vocational Training and Youth Rehabilitation ( MoSALVY ) .

We filed briefs in both cases representing members of the House and Senate who sponsored the legislation outlawing this gruesome act that many , including Justices of the Supreme Court , consider to be infanticide. . . .One of the most disturbing aspects of this case is the fact that the plaintiff , Planned Parenthood , has received in the last two years - that they ' ve reported - over $ 500 million in taxpayer money. America needs to wake up to this disturbing fact ! On one hand , Planned Parenthood , the largest abortion provider in America , is funded in large part by our hard-earned tax dollars. This money is allocated from Congress. Then Planned Parenthood turns around and sues Congress for passing a law banning partial-birth abortion. In essence , Congress is taking our money , giving it to Planned Parenthood , who then sues Congress with the aid of the money we ' ve already given them . </legislation.n.745><legislation.n.746>Other subjects that may be explored include legislation , jurisdictional issues concerning the regulation of tobacco by FDA , advertising and promotion , industry accountability , constitutional issues , ethical questions , economic matters , product liability and the political milieu.

That Act allows for the making of regulations to implement Security Council resolutions made pursuant to Article 41 of the United Nations Charter. Those resolutions often require states to prohibit their nationals from engaging in the supply of arms and military technical assistance to particular countries , but have included a restriction on the import of diamonds and timber from a country.

The government will give beneficiaries a fixed amount of money to purchase private insurance. Those who choose to stay with traditional Medicare will have to pay a premium calculated , in part , on the cost of private plans. Since private insurers will cherry pick the healthiest retirees , the relative cost of insuring those remaining in traditional Medicare , the poorest and the sickest , will inevitably rise , driving up premiums . </legislation.n.749><legislation.n.750>396.

For example , it can promise to , in exchange for imposing a costly program on the public , cut back on other programs on a gradual basis for the next 10 years. But that is just legislation. Legislation can be changed by the politicians that come to power at the next election -- and usually is. The fact is no long-range promise can be counted on. This is not just a problem with the representatives , but arises also from the fact that the citizens themselves may change their mind . </legislation.n.751><legislation.n.752>In Australia , the primary environmental legislation at a federal level is called the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

Dozens of subsections and even the titles of the subsections are identical to those in the House version. This is very important because it catches the Justice Department in a bald-faced lie. The Justice Department claimed that the secret legislation brought into the House was only for study , and that at this time there was no intention to try and pass it. Now upon reading S. 22 , it is clear that the leadership of the Senate is fully aware of the Patriot Act II , and have passed these riders out of their committees into the full bill. I spent two hours scanning through S. 22 and , let me tell you , it is a nightmare for anyone who loves liberty. It even contains the Our Lady of Peace Act that registers all gun owners. It bans the private sale of all firearms , creates a Federal ballistics database , and much more . </legislation.n.757><legislation.n.758>The first Congress 's decision not to attempt to condition the president 's removal authority on the advice and consent of the Senate was only the beginning of the controversy over presidential removal powers. In 1833 , when President Andrew Jackson removed the secretary of treasury for failure to carry out his policy toward the national bank , the Senate passed a resolution of censure.79 In defense of his action , President Jackson argued that he was simply exercising his authority under the Take Care Clause.80 In 1867 , Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act , 81 which required Senate consent to the removal of cabinet officers , 82 over President Andrew Johnson 's veto.83 This triggered the events that led to President Johnson 's impeachment following his unsuccessful effort to remove Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton.84 In 1872 and 1876 , Congress adopted legislation requiring Senate consent before the postmaster general and various postmasters could be removed , though it repealed the Tenure of Office Act in 1887 following a confrontation with President Grover Cleveland.85 </legislation.n.758><legislation.n.759>Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996 has been in force since October 1st 1997.

This legislation would have required DOJ and HCFA to have evidence of intentional wrongdoing before using the False Claims Act to threaten hospitals with prosecution for Medicare billing errors. In response to a groundswell of congressional support for the legislationit attracted more than 200 cosponsors in the House aloneDOJ and HHS OIG issued guidelines for the government 's use of the False Claims Act. The guidelines recognize that there must be some proof of wrongdoing by hospitals before prosecution is threatened. We welcomed the guidelines , and we believe that they can be effective if strictly enforced . </legislation.n.764><legislation.n.765>Although terrorism is already an autonomous crime under Colombian law , there is no legislation criminalizing the financing of terrorism. A draft law has been introduced to amend the penal code to define and criminalize direct and indirect financing of terrorism , of both national and international terrorist groups. Per GAFISUD and Egmont Group recommendations , the UIAF will receive SARs regarding terrorist financing. The new law will allow the UIAF to freeze terrorists ? assets immediately after their designation. In addition , banks will now be held responsible for their client base. Banks will be required to immediately inform the UIAF of any accounts held by newly designated terrorists. Banks will also have to screen new clients against the current list of designated terrorists before the banks are allowed to provide prospective clients with services. Previously , banks were not legally required to comply either of these regulations , but many had complied regardless. The bill has been presented to Congress and currently awaits approval. The proposal may be delayed due to congressional elections in March 2006 , with the new congress taking office in July 2006. President Uribe reportedly supports the new legislation . </legislation.n.765><legislation.n.766>PA Consulting Group 's local government expert , Chris Henning comments : " This Bill goes to the heart of the perennial debate about the balance of powers between central , regional and local government. It also touches the relationship between local democracy and engagement which move beyond individual local authorities and reach across the traditional boundaries in search of a better quality of customer experience and greater value driven outcomes - such as those that the 13 'Total Place ' pilots are seeking. This legislation seeks to enable a shift of economic development powers and responsibilities back towards local government - a central recognition that the 10 year experiment with Regional Development Agencies has not been a universal success . </legislation.n.766><legislation.n.767>Child Access Prevention laws have been passed by 17 states. These states hold gun owners criminally liable if children access their loaded weapons to hurt themselves or someone else. Research demonstrates that in the 12 states that passed CAP laws by 1997 , accidental deaths of children from firearms decreased 23 in the two years after the laws went into effect. In addition to requiring gun manufacturers to make child-proof guns , the legislation would subject gun owners to fines of up to $ 10 , 000 if a child gains access to their firearms. That punishment could include a one-year prison sentence if the weapon was used in an act of violence. The Youth Violence Prevention Act of 2001 , which was introduced in early April by Representative Peter DeFazio ( D-OR ) , would create a child access prevention law at the federal level , as well as mandate that trigger locks are included with all new handgun purchases . </legislation.n.767><legislation.n.768>( 4 ) This term was cointed by Ernst Forsthoff in the 1930s.

The implementation of the legislation as its stands will further undermine Hong Kong 's status as a " World City " and could potentially destabilize Hong Kong society , criminalize the legitimate actions of its independent civil society , undermine Hong Kong 's independent media and further underscore the movement of Hong Kong away from the international community of states which uphold and promote internationally recognized human rights . </legislation.n.770><legislation.n.771>The Anti-Money Laundering Law applies to financial institutions of all forms as well as professionals involved in financial matters. Regulated activities include money deposits , insurance , investment , real estate , casinos and entertainment. The legislation also addresses international cooperation and allows for the freezing or seizing of assets in suspected terrorist finance cases. The government regularly circulates the names of individuals and entities included on the UNSCR 1267 Sanctions Committee ? s consolidated list. The law also requires financial institutions to verify customer information , including current residence. This verification process promotes rigorous transparency and strict control of transactions. Furthermore , it imposes criteria for : customer identification; communication of information; documentation related to international cooperation; surveillance procedures for suspect accounts; and legal protection of professional secrecy for individuals reporting suspect transactions . </legislation.n.771><legislation.n.772>Second , passage of the bill will put tremendous pressure on the administration to end the aggressive military operations of the " surge " and begin U.S. troop withdrawal. More than half of the current cosponsors of this legislation are from the president 's own party This bipartisan support is almost certain to be more effective in ending the surge and beginning withdrawal than failed attempts by Congress to enact a binding withdrawal date . </legislation.n.772><legislation.n.773>In this context it would be appropriate for the disability legislation to build on , and not undermine , existing national anti-discrimination legislation.

Factional discipline is primarily tied to participation in the vote. An unexcused absence , particularly for a vote on a law that is deemed significant , can entail sanctions and fines set down in the faction rules. Factions expect their members to support their own proposals; governing party MPs are also expected to back Government proposals. Factions prepare for a vote and facilitate the assertion of the faction 's position in chamber in a variety of ways.

Prior to that reform , patients requiring hospital treatment could only receive it in the hospital to which they were assigned , that is the hospital serving the area in which the patient resided. When a patient elects to receive care in a hospital other than the one to which he/she was originally assigned , a specified sum of money can be transferred from the budget of the latter to that of the former. County councils thus have to pay for services provided to their residents by another county council.

This function may be handled internally by a staff unit or an auditing department , or externally by a consultant or management firm ( cf. Richter 2001 : 404 ) .

In Missouri and Illinois , lawmakers are trying to pass legislation to allow broad access to CCW. In December , the state legislature in Michigan passed a CCW law that significantly loosened the state 's restrictions and ability of law enforcement to have discretion in granting permits. While Governor John Engler signed the bill , since then citizens have collected over 260 , 000 signatures , enabling the measure to be put to a state referendum next year , and possibly overturned . </legislation.n.832><legislation.n.833>The Christian lobby that formed in the late nineteenth century campaigned to expand the moral powers of the federal government and to establish the religious authority of the state. Some of the lobbyists believed the power of the government rested in God , but most sought only to force government to respect God 's law and thereby prove itself worthy to exercise its powers. During the Civil War , the National Association to Amend the Constitution first lobbied to have an acknowledgment of God , Christ , and the authority of the Bible incorporated into the preamble to the Constitution. That crusade for what came to be called the Christian amendment continued after the war , because its proponents believed the nation owed allegiance to God. But they also thought the amendment would demonstrate the religious authority of the state and provide an unassailable constitutional basis for the federal legislation of morality.

That legislation increased payroll tax rates high enough so the baby boomers would be required to prepay the cost of retirement benefits for themselves , in addition to paying for the benefits of the preceding generation. The 1983 payroll tax increase has generated more than $ 1.5 trillion in Social Security surplus , earmarked specifically for funding the retirement of the baby boomers. Because of that tax increase , the trust fund should today contain at least $ 1.5 trillion in real liquid assets in the form of regular marketable Treasury bonds just like those bonds in which many private pension plans invest , but it does not contain any marketable bonds . </legislation.n.835><legislation.n.836>UN-HABITAT 's national level support to legislative reform has been initiated in Kenya. The Campaign has provided inputs to the review of the Kenya Local Government Act through the Consultative Group on Participatory Local Governance. UN-HABITAT 's submission has two purposes. First , to draw attention to Kenya 's commitments to participatory governance in international law and in commitments it has made at various international conferences sponsored by the United Nations. The paper also highlights the examples of legislation from The Philippines , Bolivia and South Africa that enshrine participatory governance , as a source of text that could be incorporated in Kenya.

Prof. Ken Blanchard provides a typical rationale : </legislation.n.838><legislation.n.839>A legislative threat directed towards a group normally requires that all of its members comply with the stated demands. Accordingly , anything short of group- wide compliance will lead a legislator to carry out a threat.285 This immediately raises the following question : are group members likely to comply with a legislator 's demands so as to avert the threat of legislation ? Focusing on this question , this Part examines the effects of strategic interaction within groups - whether organized or unorganized , homogeneous or heterogeneous , small or large - on the prospects of threat-induced , group-wide compliance. In so doing , the analysis considers the model 's predictions as they apply to groups . </legislation.n.839><legislation.n.840>Canadian law does not generally provide for extraterritorial application. Extending the application of Canadian legislation abroad could raise several problems , including conflict with the sovereignty of foreign states; conflicts where states have legislation that differs from that of Canada; and difficulties with Canadian officials taking enforcement action in foreign states. Canada has objected to the extraterritorial application of other states ' laws and jurisdiction to Canadians and Canadian businesses where there is no sufficient nexus to those states or where the action undermines Canadian legislative authority or Canadian policy in the area . </legislation.n.840><legislation.n.841>The normative levels are dictated by the structure of the authorities empowered to legislate and by the division of legislative powers among them. It is essential to create a simple and precise hierarchy of enactments that enables the maintenance of order in a state 's legislation. The criteria for classifying enactments at the appropriate levels must be clear and easy to apply in order to avoid disputes about the correct level of regulation or , more widely , the designation of jurisdictional authority when a legislative project is undertaken. Legislation that is well organised can easily be viewed as a whole and is satisfying to consult. Accordingly , systematic organisation is one of the conditions that legislation must meet in order to be clear and accessible to the public . </legislation.n.841><legislation.n.842>At the outset , the legislator151 issues a threat to enact legislation that will adversely affect the targeted firm if it fails to voluntarily change its conduct in line with the specified demands.152 The threat implicitly includes a promise that if the firm complies , the legislator will forego or stay the threatened legislation. It is assumed that the severity of the threatened legislation is fixed and known. If enacted , the threatened legislation will negatively weigh on the firm in direct proportion to the severity of its terms. For instance , the legislation may impose strict standards of conduct , increase the funding and probability of enforcement actions for violations of existing laws ( e.g. , by providing strong incentives to bring suits ) , or raise fines and damages that make enforcement incentives stronger.153 The negative impact on the firm may also transpire in the following ways : making business licenses harder to obtain , barring specific business practices , imposing measures that increase operational costs , increasing liability exposure and liability risk , enhancing competition in the market in which the firm operates , and reducing or capping prices charged for the firm 's products . </legislation.n.842><legislation.n.843>But Weiner 's broader argument was that legislation matters less than the reality it creates.

The defences argued were that the Liquor Control and Licencing Act was ultra vires the province insofar as it attempted to regulate vessels , a matter coming under Federal maritime law , and that the vessel was operating outside the territorial jurisdiction of the province. The court determined that the proper test to apply was whether the provinical legislation affected a vital part of the federal undertaking or whether it impaired or sterilised a federal undertaking. If it did either , it was ultra vires. The court found , however , that the sale of liquor on a vessel was not a vital part of a ship 's operations. The court held , therefore , that the Liquor Control and Licencing Act did not encroach upon federal jurisdiction over navigation and shipping and did not impair a federal undertaking.The court further held that the vessel was , at the material times , operating in and around the Greater Vancouver area which was within the territorial jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia . </legislation.n.858><legislation.n.859>To allay the corporate community 's fears of the consequences of the new federal regulatory legislation , President Nixon on April 9 , 1970 , issued an executive order creating the National Industrial Pollution Control Council ( NIPCC ) .134 NIPCC consisted of sixty-three top corporate executives appointed by Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans who met in secret with federal officials to air complaints about impending regulatory actions.135 </legislation.n.859><legislation.n.860>In Canada , Ontario 's legislation provides that , with certain exceptions , marriages revoke a will.

The fact is that all of these arguments can be correct without contradicting one another because the central terms at issue are multivalent.

It is therefore prudent for the firm to assess this probability so as to choose its best response strategy wisely. The firm can gather data and analyze relevant information to gauge the likelihood of both favorable and unfavorable voting scenarios in the House and Senate.191 Specifically , given the inherent intricacies of the political process , a variety of institutional , political , and reputational factors may influence legislative behavior in Congress and affect the likelihood that the threatened legislation will be enacted. The composition of the House and the Senate , for example , is one significant determinant. In addition , the membership and control of the relevant congressional committee is an overwhelmingly important factor that can make or break the threatened legislation.1 Diverging partisan preferences concerning the issue are also important.193 Lastly , to the extent it is observable to entities outside the political arena , logrolling ( i.e. , vote-exchange agreements ) also shapes the firm 's probability assessment and , hence , its best response . </legislation.n.884><legislation.n.885>The Regulatory Fair Warning Act of 1999 can help us achieve this goal.

Additionally , these restrictions do not prohibit the Department from informing the public about a pending legislation affecting the Department or even expressing the Department 's view on pending legislation. However , they do prohibit the Department from engaging in or promoting grass roots lobbying.

The Court concluded that the Constitution gives Congress the power to acquire and govern new territory but does not provide for the right of trial by jury in those territories. However , Congress could pass a law requiring trial by jury in the territories. The territorial government of the Philippines did not have to provide a jury trial in criminal cases unless Congress passed legislation requiring it to do so . </legislation.n.903><legislation.n.904>This course includes the study of the sources of American law and analysis and synthesis of court decisions. The interpretation of statutes , the guides to such interpretation , the interrelation between case and statutory law , and the characteristic differences between case law and legislation are also treated . </legislation.n.904><legislation.n.905>After suffering stunning defeats at the polls in 2000 and 2004 , anti-freedom groups like the Violence Policy Center , Sara Brady and their ilk focused on state legislatures. They were hardly content to accept the demise of the so-called assault weapons ban and introduced even more menacing legislation in several states. After taking control of the U.S. House and Senate , the Democrats introduced an even more Draconian assault weapons ban at the federal level. Though filed , this bill has not been pushed by the Democrats for fear it would hurt them in the 2008 Elections. The anti-gun forces bankrolling the anti-gun Democrats are confident that whether Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton is in the White House , they will remember them as their friends. So if we see a President Obama or President Clinton in 2008 , then the far-reaching new assault weapons ban will be the first of many battles we will have to fight. Remember , Obama has stated he supports not only the assault weapons ban , but also a federal law banning concealed carry by citizens throughout the entire Country ! </legislation.n.905><legislation.n.906>1. It verifies all proposed legislation in order to ensure that it complies with the One Law. If there is an injured party , or if any injury is committed , the law must be seen to prevent that injury. But it is equally important to ensure that the law goes no further , thus intruding into personal liberty without justification. If there is no injured party , there can be no law. When verifying that proposed legislation is thus compliant , the process by which the law was debated and formulated is also verified to ensure that all the specified due processes were complied with . </legislation.n.906><legislation.n.907>New legislation establishes the " Right To Know Law " . Revised law , applies to requests made after January 1 , 2009 . </legislation.n.907><legislation.n.908>Mark Robinson ' s account of Fundar in Mexico ( 2006 ) is about a CSO taking its information one step further; it doesn ' t merely monitor public expenditure and use the information to put pressure on local institutions , but also initiates more substantial changes in government budget priorities. Fundar formed a network with feminist organisations and reproductive health groups in Mexico to increase budgetary allocation for a national programme to combat maternal mortality. Fundar ' s early work created pressure to reform legislation on public access to information. The group then used budget analysis tools to show that the government was not allocating sufficient funds to tackle maternal mortality. Through advocacy , including active use of the media and building alliances with more progressive public officials , Fundar managed to achieve a ten fold increase in the 2003 budgetary allocation for a national health care programme to combat the problem13 . </legislation.n.908><legislation.n.909>Exciting news as more states have introduced and have passed legislation for safe patient handling ( SPH ) . With my last report , I had missed that Illinois introduced SPH legislation in January 2006 and that Hawaii adopted a resolution in April 2006 supporting SPH policies in American Nurses Association ' s Handle With Care Campaign.

The legislature of the Dominion is composed of the governor-general and two houses of parliament , known as the House of Commons and the Senate. The governor-general is the representative of the Crown , and is appointed by the king of Great Britain , as king of Canada ( on the advice of the Canadian government ) , for a period of about five years. Like the king , his part in legislation is confined to opening and closing the sessions of parliament , and to giving assent to the bills which the two houses have passed. He has , it is true , under the British North America Act the right of reserving bills for the approval of the British government; but this is a right which he rarely , if ever , exercises.

We even have an the ability for minor summary offences to be brought within the ambit of the definition of 'serious criminal activity'. The bill provides that summary offences of a prescribed kind can be regarded as serious criminal activity. I would like to know whether it is the intention of the government to prescribe white collar crimes as the type of crimes caught by this legislation , or are we only talking about crimes of violence and serious drug crimes ? </legislation.n.914><legislation.n.915>Baltimore County Zoning Regulations Updated regularly.

A general criminal forfeiture provision for intentional crimes has existed in Colombian Penal Law since the 1930s. Since then , Colombia has adopted more specific criminal forfeiture provisions in other statutes , most notably those containing Colombia ? s principal counternarcotics statute , Law 30 of 1986. In 1996 , Colombia added non-conviction-based forfeiture with the enactment of Law 333 of 1996 , which established a process that allows for the extinguishing of ownership rights for assets tainted by criminal activity. This process is only a first step in Colombian law that requires a second judicial procedure to transfer the title from the original owner to the GOC. This second procedure can take years if the original owner decides to fight the transfer. Despite an expansive legislative regime , procedural and other difficulties led to only limited forfeiture successes in the past , with substantial assets tied up in proceedings for years. However , in 2002 the counternarcotics and maritime unit of the prosecutor general ? s office used Law 333 to successfully forfeit $ 35 million of U.S. currency seized in 2001 with the assistance of DEA . </legislation.n.956><legislation.n.957>UPDATE : President Young sent out this message to the e-Activist Network on June 24 : " The subcommittee on the Federal Workforce , Postal Service and the District of Columbia marked up H.R. 22 today and passed it by a unanimous vote.

Presidential Efforts to Manage the Executive Branch 1. Presidential Management Before the Rise of the Administrative State. Even before the New Deal and the environmental and consumer protection legislation of the 1970s , many federal statutes gave the heads of executive agencies responsibility for regulatory decisions. For example , following the creation of the National Park Service in 1916 , the secretary of the interior was directed by federal law to " make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the use and management of the parks , monuments , and reservations under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.

For example , gaining access to legal representation was often stressful and confusing. Lack of specialist services or interpreters meant that women from Black and Minority Ethnic communities were denied effective access to the law; and those women whose immigration status made them ineligible for help with legal aid experienced particular difficulties. The process of going to court was itself traumatic and frightening , partly due to the lack of separate waiting areas , so that applicants and their abusers often had to share the same small space. Women ' s Aid research at the time highlighted the inadequacy of any legislation without effective implementation and training for court staff on the impact of domestic violence on women and children ( Barron , 1990 ) .

More clarity opens a virtuous circle of more articulated visions , better communication with the public , more public support , and greater ability to get political support to implement the policies. In a Presidential system , the obstacles to pass legislation through Congress are real enough , but can be reduced if the Executive sets clear goals and gets support in public opinion for its policies. One of the chief reasons why the Plano Real was a success , at least in part , because it was conceived and administered by a brilliant group of economists who did they homework , knew what they were doing , and were able to communicate it to politicians and to the public. A similar vision is still needed in the social realm . </legislation.n.991><legislation.n.992>Senior ministry officials play some role in the preparation of cabinet meetings.

The legislation should include an obligation to develop and broaden the definition of disability in the light of new EU and international obligations and a review of national legislation. This should adopt a social and human rights model of disability that recognises how social organisation creates disabling conditions that result in social , economic , political and cultural exclusion. This should be in keeping with the definition of disability found in A Strategy for Equality which includes children and adults who experience any restriction in their capacity to participate in economic , social or cultural life on account of a physical , sensory , learning , mental health or emotional impairment. Account should be taken of different definitions in the EU , the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation 's International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF ) . Ultimately there must be common definitions of these concepts in the Disability Bill and in the equality legislation . </legislation.n.1004><legislation.n.1005>Consider the example of welfare reform , passed in 1996. The debate surrounding that legislation turned on a series of moral propositions : that Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) had created a culture of poverty; that it rewarded indolence , fostered dependence , and encouraged broken families. The argument in favor of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act ( PRWORA ) was , in turn , framed in terms of the moral norms of equality , reciprocity , personal accountability , and the inherent dignity of work. It is undeniable that the law has brought federal policy more in line with those deeply held American values. As a result of the new law , many former welfare recipients have morphed into the working poor , and there are early signs that this change has left most Americans less prone to stigmatize them -- and more disposed to assist them through both governmental and nongovernmental outlets . </legislation.n.1005><legislation.n.1006>The second topic is the EU 's Social Policy program and employee rights legislation and case law , especially as they affect the corporate governance of multinational company operations.

There is no magic in the name to conjure up anything , for as Professor PP Craig writes in Administrative Law , 4th Edition ( 1999 ) : " There is a bewildering variety of names for delegated legislation. Order in council , rules , regulations , bye-laws and directions all jostle one another upon the statute book. The key to sanity is the realisation that nothing turns upon the precise nomenclature " at p. 367.

A draft Bill on central legislation was prepared as early as in 1980. The National Commission on Rural Labour , in its report of 1991 , recommended that a central legislation for agricultural labour providing security of employment , prescribed hours of work , payment of prescribed wages and machinery for dispute settlement was necessary.

Bentsen has focused on federal health policy as it relates to both increasing access to health care for working families and children and maintaining the federal commitment to academic medical centers. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included provisions implementing two separate pieces of legislation introduced by Congressman Bentsen , requiring Medicare managed care plans to contribute to the cost of graduate medical education in the same way as traditional Medicare and ensuring that senior citizens can purchase supplemental insurance , called Medigap , if they switch from a Medicare managed care plan to traditional Medicare.

Anthony Comstock lobbied for tougher federal laws against obscenity , birth control , and abortion in the early 1870s. Soon thereafter , his friend Joseph Cook , a Boston-based minister who earned his living on the lecture circuit , campaigned for laws against polygamy , Sabbath breaking , and other behavior he considered sinful. Henry Blair , a Republican senator from New Hampshire , first introduced a prohibition amendment in Congress in the 1870s and worked for a broad array of moral legislation , even after he left Congress. Blair became an ally and friend of Frances Willard , who , along with Comstock , was perhaps the best known of the Christian lobbyists. Far less well-known but important nonetheless was Wilbur J. Crafts , who founded the International Reform Bureau , proclaimed himself a Christian lobbyist , and opened an office on Capitol Hill in 1895 . </legislation.n.1026><legislation.n.1027>rgen Habermas ' response to the European Union democratic deficit calls for a minimal threshold of democratic legislation through an explicit constitutional founding.

Instead of constructing a common European political identity , I appeal to the novel democratic potential of institutions in the EU such as the Open Method of Coordination for mediating overlapping sovereignties in accord ( ... ) with freedom as non-domination.

In 1990 , Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York introduced legislation to repeal the 1983 payroll tax increase in an effort to keep the surplus Social Security money out of Bush ' s hands. The 1983 legislation had departed from the traditional pay-as-you-go method of funding Social Security. Upon the recommendation of the commission headed by Alan Greenspan , Congress enacted a tax increase that would result in the baby-boomer generation paying for the retirement benefits of two generations. They were taxed enough to prepay the cost of their own generation ' s retirement , in addition to paying for the retirement of the previous generation. Senator Moynihan was outraged to see the administration embezzling and spending the money that was supposed to be building up a large reserve with which to fund the retirement of the baby boomers . </legislation.n.1032><legislation.n.1033>By the 1920s many of the great archaeologists of the day were better known as excavators than for their day jobs - Mortimer Wheeler , for instance , who was also Curator at Cardiff Museum. Many excavations of this time start to be for specific academic reasons rather than a general quest for knowledge and the period marks the slow decline of amateur excavations both in number and status. At Sutton Hoo the landowner asked the local museum for help. The curator found her a self-taught excavator for the first of three excavation campaigns , started in the 1930s. But once the importance of the site was realised , legislation enabled the project to be taken over by the British Museum and the Office of Works . </legislation.n.1033><legislation.n.1034>H.R. 1804 may be rolled into other legislation before it advances.

The scholars discussed above rely , at least in part , on the argument or observation that certain forums have been open as a matter of practice and therefore that limiting such forums undercuts such practice. Cole speaks of whether institutions do or do not play an important role in furthering public debate; Post writes of the roles that people " actually inhabit; " 230 Redish and Kessler refer to a program 's predescribed goals; Yudof would hold agencies to their subdelegations. But as I have explained , all of these scholars improperly rely on extant practice to trump a challenge to that practice , namely , the law in question that converts an open forum to a limited one. There is no " natural " openness to forums. Whether they have been open or not is a matter of practice; certainly current legislation is at least strong evidence of the decline of our challenge to open forum practice . </legislation.n.1035><legislation.n.1036> In particular , the Working Group is disappointed that Ireland did not seize the opportunity of the Prevention of Corruption ( Amendment ) Bill 2008 to act upon the Phase 2 recommendations to consolidate and harmonise the two separate foreign bribery offences in the Prevention of Corruption ( Amendment ) Act 2001 and the Criminal Justice ( Theft and Fraud Offences ) Act 2001. The Group therefore recommends , as it did in 2007 , that Ireland act on this issue as a matter of priority. It urges Ireland to pursue its declared intent to make changes to the 2008 Bill in order to achieve greater consistency between the two statutes , and consolidate at the first possible opportunity the corruption offences into a single piece of legislation. In addition , the Group continues to recommend that Ireland adopt on a high priority basis appropriate legislation to achieve effective corporate liability for foreign bribery. </legislation.n.1036><legislation.n.1037>The focus of this course is the law relating to the independent employment relationship.

The UPA Government is touching a low road in betraying the trust of Parliament and of its own reformist postures. During the notification stage , many ministries have put on hold significant parts of the acts passed by Parliament and assented to by the President , thus allowing the executive to stray into the domain of the legislature. Various ministries have already run their knife through over half-a-dozen crucial acts , ranging from the ones regulating petroleum and natural gas to those that curb powers of arrest in criminal cases.

A union could be certified as a bargaining representative for the affected employees if a majority of the employees in the relevant bargaining unit have signed authorization cards. Fifty percent , plus one , would suffice to result in unionization of the bargaining unit.

This debate can go on indefinitely , most commonly referred to as a filibuster and taking the form of an exceptionally long speech ( as in one lasting for a day or days , or a series of such speeches ) to prevent the legislation from moving forward ... and that , my friends , is where Senator Specter would come in. Sixty votes are needed in the Senate to enact what is called cloture - basically this sets a deadline for debate to end , after which a final vote is made. Senate Democrats currently have enough votes to pass the Employee Free Choice Act , but without Specter , there appears to be only 59 Senators that would vote for cloture - one fewer than needed to end debate and take the legislation to a final vote.

At times , though , after-the-fact processes had resulted in the halting or repeal of damaging legislation. For example , President Garc a 's decree nationalizing banks in July 1987 was repealed in late 1990 , and President Fujimori 's Decree Law 171 , which legislated that all crimes committed by the military in the emergency zones be tried in military courts , was repealed in early 1991.

" </legislation.n.1070><legislation.n.1071>One alternative to eliminating the dual entitlement rule might be to provide all Social Security recipients with a legal guarantee to their benefits. One of the consequences of this year 's debate on the future of Social Security is that existing retirees may have some concern that their full benefits may not be paid. Because of the Supreme Court rulinged in the case of Flemming v. Nestor that retirees have no ownership over their benefits and that Congress could adjust their benefits at will , retirees may not be willing to simply accept the word of public officials that their benefits are safe. One low-cost , but effective action would be to grant existing and future retirees a written property right to their benefits. Attaching such a simple measure to legislation dealing with GPO would expand its coverage from benefiting only a small segment of Social Security recipients to legislation that benefits everyone who receives Social Security . </legislation.n.1071><legislation.n.1072>Lawyers in Canada are governed by provincial law and by professional bodies established under the governing legislation ( Law Societies ) .

Women , several scholars have argued , sought empowerment through reform activities. The efforts of women in lobbying Congress and mobilizing the churches were even more important to the passage of moral legislation than most scholars have acknowledged. Their gender obviously influenced their reform activities; the female culture of the WCTU , for example , helped inspire and sustain many of them. In addition , as Paula C. Baker has argued , their subordinate status encouraged women to perceive government as a potential source of protection from dangerous males; females therefore more readily advocated an expansion of government 's functions. However , like class , gender does not fully explain the motives of the Christian lobbyists. Women in the Christian lobby always worked easily with men , and the men sought women 's help , because both shared a moral reform agenda and a deep Christian faith. In the final analysis , their Christian faith and its proscriptions about personal behavior proved more important in leading many women to support moral legislation than did the goal of expanding their role , just as the promotion of Christian values proved more vital than the preservation of class privilege.

While Djibouti took a positive step by adopting anti-money laundering legislation , enforcement of the law remains a major challenge. Though Djibouti makes an effort to control all formal transaction points , a large number of hawaladars escape Central Bank regulation. Corruption is also a concern. Corrupt customs officials can easily be tempted to allow large amounts of money or trade goods that transfer value to pass through the borders without any declaration.

Even if the ranks of the disaffected do not grow , therefore , it takes time -- usually at least a generation and often more -- for any new law or policy that is an outgrowth of real controversy to be accepted as a fait accompli. People 's hearts and minds , as well as their behavior , need to change if the same old battles are not to be fought over and over again indefinitely. This is not something that can be expected to happen overnight , nor can it be expected to happen automatically.

In other words , the legislative process is frequently used solely to exert threats of impending legislation rather than to enact a legislative measure. Therefore , formal and observable legislation is nothing but the tip of the regulatory " iceberg " which also encompasses legislative threats and the ensuing body of invisible law - namely , informal , threat-induced regulation of social conduct . </legislation.n.1099><legislation.n.1100>In Australia , two recent examples of 'corporate citizenship legislation ' include an attempt by the Australian Democrats to enact a corporate code of conduct and the Financial Services Reform Act 2001. In the first case , the Australian Democrats introduced a Corporate Code of Conduct Bill that aimed to regulate the activities of Australian companies employing more than 100 people in offshore operations with respect to human rights , the environment and labour standards. ( 58 ) The proposed legislation would have required these companies to report in Australia how they complied with a range of standards in the above areas. Although the Bill was defeated in 2001 , a revised version is being prepared for reintroduction to the Senate this year.

There are several factors driving restructuring. Fiscal constraints and political-economic restructuring in Canada ' s provinces have been instrumental , including : provincial-to-municipal devolution of fiscal responsibilities for public service provision; a shift in the ownership of infrastructure from higher levels of government to municipalities; increasing use of the private sector to support the provision of public services; and funding and employment cutbacks to the public sector including environmental ministries. Likewise , the Walkerton water quality tragedy and the results of the subsequent Walkerton Inquiry provided an impetus for the revision of drinking water legislation , monitoring and enforcement provisions. These pressures are compounded a series of inter-related challenges , including aging infrastructure , limited resources for infrastructure renewal , and new environmental and social pressures stemming from heightened awareness of the links between poor water quality and public and environmental health . </legislation.n.1101><legislation.n.1102>On September 28 , 2008 , for the fifth time in as many years , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed legislation for the safe handling of healthcare patients in California. See within below for Governor Schwarzenegger ' s veto message of Senate Bill 1151 , Hospitals : lift teams , Hospital Patient and Health Care Worker Injury Protection Act.

While some legislators opt to describe it with specificity or have already introduced a proposed bill that reveals that information , others may disclose only general information. These observations confirm one 's intuition that legislators strategically choose how much information to impart - in other words , what to make public and what to keep private - because revelation of pertinent information carries decisive strategic impact on the threat 's effectiveness . </legislation.n.1104><legislation.n.1105>The courts may order counseling for those involved in intrafamily violence. In 1997 there were approximately 61 , 000 reports of domestic violence. The Citizens ' Peace Foundation indicated that there were 993 cases of rape reported to the police in 1997 , and 1 , 052 in 1998. It is believed that a majority of rape cases go unreported. On July 2 , a new law took effect that increased the penalties for sexual abuse. The legislation includes clauses to facilitate proof of the crime and protect the privacy and safety of the woman making the charge. The new law also overturned 100-year-old legislation that permitted a man charged with rape to be released if he asked the victim to marry him and she accepted . </legislation.n.1105><legislation.n.1106>This is a complete resource of employment law and personnel practice.

It is too complicated in parts , and it does sometimes choose courses that are inefficient or ineffective. But there is little reason to believe that a devolution to the common law ( either alone or in conjunction with state legislation ) can provide the environmental protection that most Americans say they want.

Such a limitation may disadvantage Manx residents in a dispute with the U K government as that country 's legislation contains a similar clause.

Several policy options to consider are : </legislation.n.1111><legislation.n.1112>The tasks and powers for the People 's Council and for the People 's Committee on each level both are listed in a fixed order. The lists of fields in which the council or the committee have a task offer an overview of the task areas common to regional and local authorities all over the world. This is common to those authorities when we do not take into account the legislative technique by which those tasks ( and powers ) are attributed to them. The term of local autonomy usually is connected with the technique of attributing a rather undefined , general power to a local authority , like : 'the power to regulate and administer the local affairs. ' [ 38 ] But the limits to this general power and consequently the limits of this autonomous capacity are defined by higher legislation. The level of local autonomy is in reality dependent on the degree of freedom to decide how to implement higher legislation such that this implementation matches the local needs best . </legislation.n.1112><legislation.n.1113>This means that instead of using public funds to contract with private plans in a manner designed to assure accountability and value and to provide adequate coverage for low-income children the Administration is seeking to allow public funds to be used for insurance that could leave substantial numbers of children without coverage for particular services they may need or leave their families with co-payments for care that the families have difficulty affording. ( Jonathan Gruber ' s assessment of the tax credits and deductions the Administration proposed a year ago also suggests that the crowd-out or substitution effects of the Administration ' s health tax proposals would be much greater than the effects from the SCHIP legislation . ) </legislation.n.1113><legislation.n.1114>Sponsored by Ruben and Barve , The Maryland Family and Medical Leave Act of 2002 is designed to help employees balance the demands of the workplace with family needs and to promote economic security of families.

That is not the case we wish to work in positive partnership with the Commonwealth to achieve the best possible outcomes for Norfolk Island and all of its residents.

We are encouraged that we have allies in the Obama administration and in Congress who are committed to working with us to strengthen the Postal Service for decades to come , he added . </legislation.n.1117><legislation.n.1118>Strange corroboration of the negative case comes from Prime Minister John Howard himself , who , like any good rhetorician , pays deceptive courtesy to the opposing argument. Howard rejects proposals for changing Senate voting methods to produce major-party majorities , an alternative way of ensuring a more pliable Senate. He goes on : ' I think it ' s unfair and it ' s undemocratic. And I think the innate sense of fair play of most Australians would react to the big boys as they would describe them ganging up on the smaller parties ' ( Howard 2003 ) . Is there a difference between producing a single party dominated Senate so that legislation sails through it and over-riding the repeated denials of one elected in the present , proportional way ? The latter might convey the same sense of ' ganging up ' , seen not only as a sleight against minor parties but against a greater public will. My point is that Howard picks up the theme , and then surely finds a false target. The public isn ' t really worried about how governments bully minor parties. They are more concerned when governments do the bullying for even bigger bullies , and we all end up with policies that do not reflect the public interest . </legislation.n.1118><legislation.n.1119>The anthrax letters to the media can be considered peripheral to political targets.

If enacted , the legislation will negatively affect the firm in direct proportion to the leniency , moderation , or severity of its terms. A legislator may also decide whether or not to reveal the level of severity. In order to render the theoretical model most descriptive of the real legislative landscape , this Subpart extends the analysis to consider cases in which a legislator decides : ( i ) the severity of the threatened legislation; and ( ii ) whether or not to disclose the chosen level of severity to the firm.213 Incorporating these strategic decisions in the model gives rise to games with perfect and imperfect information . </legislation.n.1139><legislation.n.1140>REPEAL SENATE BILL 1284 SPONSORED BY SENTATOR BILL MORROW.

[ 22 ] The state , usually with the help of police , takes the lead in prosecution , which is why in common law countries cases are cited as " The People v ... " or " R ( for Rex or Regina ) v ... " Also , lay juries are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact : juries can not change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity , but the normal punishment for a crime will be imprisonment , fines , state supervision ( such as probation ) , or community service. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences , especially with respect to sentencing , legal research , legislation , and rehabilitation.

In many respects , they would be right , because the legislation on safety and health at work to some degree extends beyond what is required by the common law duty of care of employers. This is especially so with some of the comfort/welfare matters such as sanitary facilities , meal-making facilities and similar requirements imposed by , for example , Part III of the Safety , Health and Welfare at Work ( General Application ) Regulations 1993 , the Workplace Regulations 1993. Nonetheless , in other respects , the statutory regime is an incomplete statement of an organisation 's duties , in at least two respects . </legislation.n.1146><legislation.n.1147>It made sense that the government responded to this question with a plan for assimilation. Indeed , by retaining a limited degree of sovereignty for the Indian tribes , the Marshall decisions had made it difficult for the government to alter the independent status of the tribes through legislation , thus leaving the government to use assimilation as a way to induce the tribes to relinquish their independence. Many tribes , aware that the failure to educate their children would lead to further impoverishment and dependency , embraced the opportunities provided by the boarding schools.

Prior to 2004 , Albanian law did not allow for asset forfeiture without a court decision. In 2004 , Albania passed legislation that made the freezing and seizure of assets much easier. First , Albania passed a comprehensive anti-Mafia law , Law No. 9284 , which contains strong civil asset seizure and forfeiture provisions , subjecting the assets of suspected persons and their families and close associates to seizure. The law also places the burden to prove a legitimate source of funding for seized assets on the defendant . </legislation.n.1148><legislation.n.1149>While it is certainly key to include specific targets , specific modes of consultation ( e.g. poverty-reduction secretariat , minister ' s council of stakeholders for poverty reduction ) , specific programs with specific set objectives over time ( e.g. to find work for x number of new immigrants in their chosen fields ) , and tying it in with other legislation ( such as the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act ) , the Human Rights Code needs to be amended to properly protect this group . </legislation.n.1149><legislation.n.1150>( ii ) An action for breach of statutory duty is not a negligence action. The legislation which creates the duty will determine the nature of the obligation and negligence may have nothing to do with the duty or its breach.

Bush have spent every dime of the surplus Social Security revenue flowing into the Treasury during their terms in office , according to economist Allen W. Smith , Ph.D. in his new book , *Demystifying Economics : The Book That Makes Economics Accessible to Everyone. Smith points out that the 1983 legislation , which substantially raised Social Security taxes , was designed specifically for the purpose of building up a surplus in the Social Security trust fund in preparation for the staggering new obligations the fund would face when the baby-boom generation begins retiring about 2010. Instead , Smith reports that the government began using the surplus to pay for other government programs as soon as it first appeared in 1983 , and it has continued to do so ever since . </legislation.n.1179><legislation.n.1180>The lesson of history is that governments of all persuasions tend to be casual about civil liberties in direct proportion to the size of their majorities. Understandably perhaps , ministers of all parties feel the weight of executive responsibility. Sometimes parliament , as a whole , resists intrusion as the House of Lords has done under both Conservative and Labour administrations. Often , however , it does not. Raab quotes the scandalous legislation that allows the retention of DNA from those unconvicted of any crime.

Memorials were nineteenth-century interest groups ' principal mechanism for weighing in on proposed legislation in the absence of ( or in addition to ) legislative hearings. For most of the nineteenth century , the missives concerning bankruptcy almost always came from states or cities. By the 1890s , the authorship of the memorials looked entirely different. Rather than states and other governmental bodies , it was chambers of commerce , boards of trade , and other commercial organizations who filled lawmakers ' mailboxes with their views.37 </legislation.n.1181><legislation.n.1182>Administration Claim 1 : The SCHIP legislation is being designed as a vehicle to advance a Washington-run , government-owned [ health ] plan , where government makes the choices , where government sets the prices , where government then taxes people to pay the bill. </legislation.n.1182><legislation.n.1183>As in Australia , national legislation in Germany enforces therapeutic reference-based pricing for prescription drugs as the reimbursement method under the Sickness Funds.

In this respect , the 1999 agreement reached between the social partners on the pension system reform and the 2002 law on employment relationships are considered major achievements. Both were later modified and , in 2006 , further amendments to the Employment Relationship Law came under discussion between the social partners and the government. After a year of negotiations , consensus was achieved in June 2007.The ESC also examines strategic development papers put forward by the government , amongst them Slovenia 's development strategy and the draft economic and social reform package to enhance the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy. It was also consulted on the reform programme for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and thereafter on the yearly reports on the implementation of the programme.

The SERNAM has a pilot program that provides occupational training and child care in an effort to alleviate this disparity. The Labor Code provides benefits for pregnant workers and recent mothers. Employers do not have the right to ask women to take pregnancy tests prior to hiring them; legislation prohibiting this practice took effect in November 1998 . </legislation.n.1195><legislation.n.1196>As the second step a balance has to be established between direct and representative democracy at the municipal level.

The course will introduce students to the basic contours of Congressional lawmaking practice , theoretical models of the legislative process , the application and interpretation of statutes by the executive branch , and numerous aspects of judicial statutory interpretation. Students will explore and critique the different methods and canons that courts apply in construing statutes and consider issues such as the appropriate degree of deference to administrative interpretations , judicial use of legislative history in construction , and interaction between the courts and Congress. The basic text will be the Eskridge , Frickey &amp;Garrett casebook , but students will also read selected legal and/or political science articles presenting current theories of legislative process and interpretation , and review examples of current cases and statutory debates. Grades will be based on an examination at the end of the semester . </legislation.n.1199><legislation.n.1200>Geographic , institutional and social segregation pre-dates the introduction of apartheid in 1948. The Group Areas Act , apartheid 's key piece of legislation , not only entrenched in law the systematic segregation of residential areas and the compulsory removal of black people to own group ' areas , but also created the legal framework within which affluent white municipalities could , with impunity , abdicate their financial responsibility towards servicing black disadvantaged areas. Apartheid regulations also barred most retail and industrial developments in black areas. As a result , large black populations were forced into areas which had a very limited tax base , thus depriving municipalities in these areas of the means to meet the needs of local residents , whilst many white municipalities had large concentrations of economic resources to tax and small populations to serve . </legislation.n.1200><legislation.n.1201>Students examine a recently passed legislation at the community , provincial or federal level and outline the key points of the legislation. Collaboratively , students identify the key issues surrounding the legislation and analyse the different points of view on these issues. Finally students will explain , in written form , the different points of view on the issues. This activity introduces students to analytical skills that will be reinforced and used in the culminating activity of this course . </legislation.n.1201><legislation.n.1202>The reality is , however , that the government ' s strongest recognitions of sovereignty have taken the form of executive memorandums or proclamations , rather than the establishment of entitlement programs or other legislation guaranteeing the government ' s support of the tribes. And while the courts have at times come out strongly for tribal sovereignty and the rights of tribes to determine their own futures , they have not always ensured that the tribes receive the tools to do so. The situation of tribes is therefore such that they must rely not only on the rule of law , but also on the good faith of the federal and state government to protect their remaining sovereignty rights. [ 367 ] Considering the extent of control the federal government exercises over the rights of tribes to exist , it is therefore difficult to conceive of tribal sovereignty as something constructed and advanced wholly , or even mostly , by the tribes. Making this conception of sovereignty even more complicated is the fact that the government has also treated federal Indian policy as an outlet for the expression of its national political and social goals . </legislation.n.1202><legislation.n.1203>Employee benefits managers and specialists handle the companys employee benefits program , notably its health insurance and pension plans. Expertise in designing and administering benefits programs continues to gain importance as employer-provided benefits account for a growing proportion of overall compensation costs , and as benefit plans increase in number and complexity. For example , pension benefits might include savings and thrift , profit sharing , and stock ownership plans; health benefits may include long-term catastrophic illness insurance and dental insurance. Familiarity with health benefits is a top priority , as more firms struggle to cope with the rising cost of health care for employees and retirees. In addition to health insurance and pension coverage , some firms offer employees life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance , disability insurance , and relatively new benefits designed to meet the needs of a changing work force , such as parental leave , child and elder care , long-term nursing home care insurance , employee assistance and wellness programs , and flexible benefits plans. Benefits managers must keep abreast of changing Federal and State regulations and legislation that may affect employee benefits . </legislation.n.1203><legislation.n.1204>It is difficult to discern what is implied by protective legislation in this question. Various non-governmental organisations have criticised changes to the method by which federal and provincial governments now share the costs of various social welfare programs. It is the government 's position that the Committee 's focus should be on whether the substantive entitlements under the Covenant are being met by governments in Canada , and not on the internal means by which such entitlements are being funded when those means fall within an appropriate range of government responses . </legislation.n.1204><legislation.n.1205>The World of Work will be watching this legislation closely and will bring you updates as they occur.

We are also showing you how to prepare for disciplinary hearings and for arbitrations. This includes how to prepare evidence and cross-examination questions. Other practical issues include setting up a proper grievance procedure and dealing with the four main categories of problems that an employer experiences ie misconduct , poor work performance , redundancy and possible constructive dismissal claims. Thus , the aim of the CD is focusing on practical issues that can not be obtained from any law book and will also enable you as the employer to save on costs.

[ 128 ] This purse string has been used to put the states in a 'catch-22 ' situation retain autonomy and lose funding or accept funding and submit to federal control. In addition , legislation prohibiting the states from keeping 'troops ' except as directed by the President has been read to apply to the militia. [ 129 ] Although the term 'Troops ' in the Constitution was probably intended to apply to standing armies , [ 130 ] this seemingly unfounded application of the prohibition to the militia means that even if the states could afford to maintain their militia in accordance with federal standards without federal assistance , they would be forbidden to do so. Moreover , today the state National Guards are organized into federal divisional structures requiring the maintenance [ Page 344 ] of state units that have no purpose other than to support a national defense strategy. [ 131 ] For example , what possible use could a state have for a Military Intelligence Battalion whose primary mission is to collect and analyze tactical and strategic battle information ? </legislation.n.1208><legislation.n.1209>Rather than giving the Treasury all the funds at once , the legislation gives the Treasury $ 250 billion immediately , then requires the President to certify that additional funds are needed ( $ 100 billion , then $ 350 billion subject to Congressional disapproval ) . The Treasury must report on the use of the funds and the progress in addressing the crisis. EESA also establishes an Oversight Board so that the Treasury can not act in an arbitrary manner.

Given the complexity of the law , the availability of costs orders where a claim is misconceived , and the unavailability of legal aid , I wonder if there are Article 6 implications. Refusal of legal aid where it is crucial to the presentation of a party ' s case can constitute interference with Article 6 rights. One even has to wonder whether ignorance of the law being no excuse is compatible with our legislation being impossible to decipher. The now oft-quoted preface to Archbold 2009 states in relation to criminal law : </legislation.n.1212><legislation.n.1213>We believe that current laws must be enforced and that new common-sense legislation is needed to stem the rising tide of gun violence throughout the United States.

This legislation ( 29CFR 1910.1450 ) requires all employers who are engaged in laboratory use of hazardous chemicals to appoint a chemical hygiene officer and develop a chemical hygiene plan. The plan should detail how each employee will be protected from overexposure to hazardous materials and describe specific work practices and procedures in the laboratory to minimize employee risk. Students are not considered employees under this law. However , this standard is based on the assumption that safety experts agree on a set of standards and practices for laboratory work that should be integrated into the chemical hygiene plan. This body of knowledge becomes the standard by which a teacher is judged for negligence . </legislation.n.1214><legislation.n.1215>The internal supervision in Mets hallitus is based on Finnish legislation , ownership policy , steering and supervision of the Board of Directors and on the relevant guidelines and standards. A significant component of internal supervision is risk management , which in Mets hallitus is accomplished in accordance with a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors , taking into account the Group ' s targets. Mets hallitus furthermore has an independent internal auditing function , which reports directly to the Board of Directors and the Managing Director . </legislation.n.1215><legislation.n.1216>Early in the century , constitutional issues figured especially prominently in the bankruptcy debates. Because the Constitution uses the term bankruptcy without further elaboration , some lawmakers insisted that the drafters intended to preserve the distinction in earlier English law between " bankruptcy " laws and " insolvency " laws. As distinguished from insolvency laws , which were designed to help debtors , they argued , bankruptcy laws only applied to traders and could not permit voluntary bankruptcy -- that is , Congress could not give debtors the right to invoke the bankruptcy laws on their own behalf. Bankruptcy , on this view , was designed solely to help creditors round up a debtor 's assets and use them for repayment. These lawmakers insisted that Congress simply did not have the authority to enact more sweeping bankruptcy legislation. Lawmakers who supported a broader bankruptcy law rejected this distinction , arguing that the Bankruptcy Clause used the term bankruptcy as a shorthand that referred to any legislation designed to deal with financial distress . </legislation.n.1216><legislation.n.1217>Another contemporary effort is to provide an umbrella statute to take care of employment conditions and social welfare benefits for all unorganised sections. Common central legislation for all agricultural workers is also on the anvil. Many powers are vested in quasi-judicial authorities , labour courts , and magistrates ' courts. The power of review is in the High Courts and finally in the Supreme Court . </legislation.n.1217><legislation.n.1218>The other objective is to support the dialogue between parliamentarians and electorate. As the Belarusian parliament develops its role in the country , it is increasingly interacting with citizens , with government and other parts of Belarus society to determine legislation and influence national programmes. However , the ability of the citizen to influence this increasing role is limited by many of the traditional barriers between elected representatives and their electorate inherited from the Soviet period. Although the spread of ICTs in Belarus has provided opportunities for ICTs to be used in many new ways , they have so far been hardly used to narrow the gap between the parliamentarians and the people they represent. That is why it is essential to overcome these barriers impeding citizen 's influence and interaction with parliamentarians , by increasing the understanding among deputies in the Belarusian Parliament of the opportunities new technologies can provide to improve democracy; and through providing them tools to start doing this . </legislation.n.1218><legislation.n.1219>...

National legislation is a key mechanism for translating international legal commitments into practice. Kenya 's commitments to participatory governance , therefore , should be reflected through specific mechanisms and language in the Local Government Act. By doing so , Kenya will be able to report to the various United Nations human rights monitoring bodies that it is implementing its commitment to the realization of the full complement of human rights in Kenya . </legislation.n.1220><legislation.n.1221>This summary of state drug testing laws enacted in 2005 provides a nice overview of various state laws on this subject.

By one count there are 147 pieces of animal legislation being proposed in 37 states. Most of these are primarily aimed at limiting reproduction of pets and the kind of pets we choose to own. All of them shift the decision making that has traditionally been with the pet owner to the state. All presume that the state is wiser and better able to make decision for us than we are. All presume a problem that needs a solution and move along the axis of freedom and control with an objective to solve problems by formal means rather than by allowing informal relationships to influence our lives and neighborhoods. The major problem with this push is the assumption that all problems need to be solved and that legislation is the solution . </legislation.n.1229><legislation.n.1230>This term 's Advanced Criminal Law course will have three components. The largest will be work for the Pennsylvania Legislature in doing a study of the penalty inconsistencies in current Pennsylvania criminal law. The work is aimed toward writing legislation that will rationalize offense penalties and grades throughout the Pennsylvania Code. The class will work with the members and staff of the Democratically-controlled House Judiciary Committee and the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. A second class component will be a study of the competing arguments for how criminal liability and punishment should be distributed : a theoretical analysis of who should be punished how much. After reading Distributive Principles of Criminal Law ( Oxford 2008 ) , each student will present and defend her own distributive principle proposal. Finally , throughout the term , students will serve as prosecutors and defense counsel for a series of real-world case studies that present issues of special theoretical and practical importance , drawn from Criminal Law Case Studies , 3d edition ( West 2007 ) . Any student wishing to enroll in this class must be present at the first class meeting . </legislation.n.1230><legislation.n.1231>The Secretary of the Interior had the ability to decline to enter into self-determination contracts. This Act limited this ability , however , by requiring that Secretary set forth the reasons why the government was rejecting the contract. [ 234 ] Furthermore , the Secretary had to assist any tribe with a rejected contract to overcome the reasons for the rejection. The legislation also enabled the tribes to appeal the government ' s rejection of a self-determination contract in federal court. [ 235 ] While the BIA was reluctant to relinquish its control and attempted to slow down the contracting process , the tribes refused to take no for answer and continued to submit their applications until their contracts were approved. Leaders simultaneously applied pressure to members of Congress to ensure that the legislation proved to be more than a paper tiger.

Legislation in the ACT allows the family of negligently killed victims to claim compensation for the 'reasonable expenses of burial and cremation ' [ 15 ] . The ACT Courts have interpreted this phrase very narrowly to find that it includes only the bare cost of burial or cremation and not other costs such as for a memorial or headstone to a grave [ 16 ] . This legislation prevents relatives of people killed in the ACT from claiming reasonable compensation for items such as headstones , wreaths , funeral notices and church services which they would generally be able to do if the death occurred in other States [ 17 ] . </legislation.n.1234><legislation.n.1235>Sounds fine , but they do not mention that a large proportion of this EU regulation is designed precisely to cut bureaucracy and red-tape for businesses by setting a common EU norm to replace 27 divergent national standards in the EU 's single market. In calling for regulations to be repealed , " Open Europe " is rarely specific. For instance , do they want to repeal legislation that allows a company to register a trademark once , to be valid throughout Europe ? Without that legislation , companies would have to register their trademarks 27 times over , going through different hoops and bureaucracies in 27 different countries , filling in 27 different forms etc . </legislation.n.1235><legislation.n.1236>The Liquor and Registered Clubs Legislation Amendment ( Community Partnership ) Act 1998 , which came into force in May last year , requires the Government to initiate an independent inquiry to consider the social impact of gambling.

" It focuses attention not merely on rewards for obedience but actually stimulates individuals to be themselves , to invent , to make over group values and standards. It encourages not obedience so much as initiative , in fact , as much initiative as is compatible with group unity. It is more than the principle of " attractive legislation " which L. F. Ward developed. [ 3 ] Ward would have the group offer such inducements as will in all cases make it advantageous for persons to perform acts beneficial to society. This standard implies social values as being already determined , whereas " constructive control " as used here implies that persons are to be stimulated to make over even the group values. Ward 's principle appeals to personal gain; constructive control emphasizes social service without expectation of personal reward . </legislation.n.1244><legislation.n.1245>For example , for years airline pilots pleaded for Congress to enact modest protections for airline employees who exposed safety concerns.

Disasters prompted action but in each case the legislative response was limited to fixing the crisis at hand . </legislation.n.1245><legislation.n.1246>The framework for corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) is determined through international cooperation at governmental level. This applies , for example , to agreements and conventions concerning human rights , labour standards , the environment , sustainable resource management , taxation , corruption and trade. The Government ' s role is primarily to enter into international agreements , incorporate international provisions into Norwegian legislation , and to follow up and enforce the requirements. At the same time , however , international cooperation at governmental level has insufficient tools at its disposal to ensure that rights established by law or agreement are respected in all sovereign states at all times. CSR is therefore both important and necessary . </legislation.n.1246><legislation.n.1247>They are liable to punishment if they decide to co-sign decisions or collaborate with the making of decisions which go against these laws; if they deliberately refrain from executing the law; or are guilty of not carrying it out ( clauses 355 and 356 ) .

Reviews of experiences in implementing access legislation in Jamaica and Belize have indicated that the public needs to be more aware of the scope and benefits of the legislation. In the Jamaican review of 2006 public libraries in collaboration with the Library and Information Association of Jamaica ( LIAJA ) submitted a statement to the Joint Select Committee of Parliament for Review of the Access to Information Act.

And he rejected the petitioner ' s arguments that 18 U.S.C. 666 ( a ) ( 2 ) , which proscribes bribery of State and local officials of entities , was unconstitutional because of a lack of any jurisdictional requirement of a connection to federal money in Sabri v.

The legislation also introduces a currency transaction reporting requirement of 30 , 000 leva ( 15 , 000 euros ) , thus bringing Bulgaria into compliance with Council Directive 2001/97/EC on prevention of the use of the financial system for money laundering ( 2nd EU Money Laundering Directive ) .

In 2005 , there was a disproportionate number of SARS reported compared to the number of financial institutions. The GOB should ensure adequate supervision of non-governmental organizations and charities. It should also work to improve information sharing between regulatory and enforcement agencies.

He offers four recommendations on how the United States can attain sustainability without depositing its hazardous waste problem on the doorstep of the world s poorest countries. Of the book , Senator Russ Feingold said , This comprehensive review of the United States  environmental efforts is a reminder that despite our progress , we have further to travel on the road toward sustainability.

The opposition to a creditor-inspired bankruptcy law came from a cluster of pro-debtor forces that had a crucial restraining effect on the creditors ' bankruptcy proposals -- much as their predecessors had had since the early decades of the nineteenth century.

Many of those points have since been addressed through legislation , and the GOB has committed to introducing additional amendments to address the remaining issues . </legislation.n.1291><legislation.n.1292>In order to pass this historic legislation , we need you to take a few minutes to make an important phone call or send an email !

Unless the ice is removed by the trucking company or the driver , the slabs of ice fall from the tractor trailers onto the highways and passing cars , creating significant danger on our highways. While falling ice has been a known hazard for decades , trucking companies have paid scant attention to the risk it poses. The slabs of ice and snow falling off tractor trailers are often large , and given extra force by the speed of the truck when the ice comes off the trailer , and the speed of the car the ice hits. In fact several deaths have resulted from ice falling from tractor trailers. Legislation has been proposed and passed as a result of these tragedies , now requiring truck drivers to clean the ice off of the trailers in many northern states with long winters. For example : </legislation.n.1293><legislation.n.1294>In 1982 , a Special Committee of the House of Commons on Indian Self-Government was appointed to review legal and institutional issues related to the status , development and responsibilities of band governments on reserves. Its 1983 report , known as the Penner Report after Committee chair Keith Penner , recommended that the federal government recognize First Nations as a distinct order of government within the Canadian federation , and pursue processes leading to self-government. It proposed constitutional entrenchment of self-government and , in the short term , the introduction of legislation to facilitate it . </legislation.n.1294><legislation.n.1295>It was only later that I learned what had truly transpired.

There is a view that exemptions would create more bureaucracy and opportunities for abuse and that so long as employers have sufficient warning of any new system that is to be implemented that is all that is required. Against this view are the opinions of the majority of those who run small businesses who fear that excess legislation will cripple their ability to function . </legislation.n.1297><legislation.n.1298>The quantity of norms enacted depends on the normative density , which is determined by the legislative authority. By normative density I mean the degree of detail present in the regulations. Ordinarily , the normative density will vary according to the legislative level , with the lowest levels - that of ordinances - having the highest density. However , there are certain limits that this density should not exceed. In my view , the size of the legislation and its normative density must be determined in the light of two criteria : the public interest and the persuasive power of the norms . </legislation.n.1298><legislation.n.1299>The two senators just quoted , Calhoun from South Carolina and Webster from Massachusetts , illustrate the geographical lines along which the debates tended to divide. Because southerners feared that northern creditors would use bankruptcy law as a collection device to displace southern farmers from their homesteads , the strongest opposition to federal bankruptcy came from the South. Many western lawmakers opposed bankruptcy legislation for similar reasons. Lawmakers from the commercial northeastern states , by contrast , were much more likely to view federal bankruptcy legislation as essential to the promotion of commercial enterprise.13 </legislation.n.1299><legislation.n.1300>We support legislation to require that the Congressional Record contain an accurate record of proceedings.

While he acknowledged that the issue of race relations was controversial , he appealed to a more fundamental point of moral agreement : he centered the debate about civil rights around the fundamentally moral , and fundamentally American , principles of equality of opportunity and equal justice for all. When King spoke to fellow Christians , he was more than willing to frame the moral argument in exclusively Christian terms. But in the public square , King felt compelled to make the moral argument by appealing to principles that he and all Americans shared. " The American dream , " King said , " reminds us that every man is heir to the legacy of worthiness. " The treatment of African Americans contradicted -- indeed , belied -- that belief , and civil rights legislation would help to overcome that contradiction. If enacted , it would help Americans live up to their own beliefs -- indeed , to the beliefs that defined us as a people.

And , significantly enough , our expectations are realised ! The Banking Legislation makes provision for the establishment of an Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank. This department may be used to : " ( a ) lend money; and " ( b ) purchase or otherwise acquire shares and sell or otherwise dispose of shares and securities so purchased or acquired.

Legislation must be enacted to establish a repayment plan for gradually repaying the $ 1.5 trillion that has already been looted. Since the Social Security trustees are required to invest surpluses in government securities , all future such investments must be in regular marketable securities that are already in circulation. This will result in temporarily paying down the national debt with surplus Social Security money. When the money is need the trustees could simply cash in securities. The trustees should also be given authority to invest a portion of the surplus money in the stock market . </legislation.n.1304><legislation.n.1305>To make this possible the agency should require the external party to create or manage records in a manner specified by the agency.

During World War Two the Nazis compelled many victims in occupied countries to sell properties and businesses. After the war the Western Allies agreed to restitute property taken and the United States , France and Britain each passed different legislation governing the restitution of property taken by Nazis. The US established the Court of Restitution Appeals ( and its successor the Supreme Restitution Court Third Division ) as a court of last resort for restitution cases.

Customary law enacted over the centuries covers a wide range of issues including marriage , libel , theft , murder , land boundaries , mountain land use , forest rights , and extortion. Miao have used gatherings for legislation and setting up boundaries to A organize themselves regionally as in 1937 when thousands of Miao rallied to oppose high taxes and impressments of Miao into Chiang Kal-shek 's KMT army. For the past several hundred years , rich forest resources brought more attention to the Miao areas of Guizhou and the increasing imposition there of Chinese law and written contracts , although Miao traditional law continued to function at the local level. During the Qing Dynasty ( 1644 - 191 central government officials in Miao areas left village civil disputes to traditional laws and often deferred to customary law in handling serious criminal cases as well . </legislation.n.1314><legislation.n.1315>the problem is partly taken into consideration in the above mentioned authorisation; a measure to support non self sufficiency will , however , also be introduced , as many would hope , by members of the Government , not only on a health level , but also as regards assistance and daily life. Each region presently provides for this with different methods. Without doubt , this matter comes under essential levels of social-health and assistance. A national regulation is therefore necessary which , among other things , has already been taken into consideration by different legislation proposals , bringing about a single text which we will talk about below : </legislation.n.1315><legislation.n.1316>It will be important for the legislation to take action to raise awareness in society about the rights , needs , potential and contribution of people with disabilities. This should be provided within an equality framework. All public bodies and private services and amenities open to the public should be required to provide disability awareness training to all their staff over an appropriate time frame with provisions to ensure that disability equality training takes place as an ongoing obligation. This should include all public bodies and services provided to the public , including education and transport providers , employers , training agencies , community groups , the media , the entertainment industry etc . </legislation.n.1316><legislation.n.1317>In addition , each public body should , as part of their overall strategy statement , develop a disability strategy for complying with the legislation and produce an annual progress report on progress in implementing the disability strategy.

The Courts have characterized such legislation as " fundamental " and having " quasi-constitutional " status , thus the provisions of the human rights legislation are to be construed liberally and purposively. It is clear that an employer may not discriminate directly or indirectly against a person respecting their continued employment based on an actual or a perceived disability. In cases where there is a causal connection between the workplace offence and a " disability " as defined by the Human Rights Code , an employer has a positive duty to accommodate the individual to the point of undue hardship. [ 35 ] </legislation.n.1319><legislation.n.1320>Provides original reporting on workplace immigration news developments , federal and state legislation and regulations , and immigration enforcement actions in various industries. It also offers guidance for employers on workplace immigration policies and practices . </legislation.n.1320><legislation.n.1321>It should also be understood that these programs have little to do with the alleviation of poverty. Professor Walter Williams has argued that labor unions attempt to reduce the supply of labor through minimum wage laws , licensing , and other labor market restrictions. Such laws generally have the effect of increasing the incomes of skilled workers , mostly union members , and reducing or even eliminating the incomes of unskilled workers , usually nonunion , often minorities , and as a result of these policies almost certainly poor. Having thus closed off the labor market , union leaders support transfer programs that will prevent starvation and social unrest among the unemployed. [ 31 ] The goal is not to help the poor but to preserve the system by which favored groups are helped. Not only does such legislation divert attention from the real aims of those supporting it; it can also help to build a powerful political machine , as Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward have demonstrated. [ 32 ] </legislation.n.1321><legislation.n.1322>Enactments are addressed to the members of the public , who are the recipients of the normative message. In order to be clear and readily understood by everyone , the language of enactments must be as close as possible to ordinary , everyday language with regard to syntax and vocabulary. However , the language of legislation also has its own unique features that must be observed . </legislation.n.1322><legislation.n.1323>Crime is an issue that often seeps into Presidential elections in one form or another. Indeed , the Bush Administration has rolled back or undermined the two primary crime-fighting initiatives of the Clinton Administration by allowing the 1994 federal ban on assault weapons to lapse , and by eliminating Clinton ' s COPS program , which put tens of thousands of new police on the streets of American cities. Gun control is largely a dead letter , since the NRA has shown that it has the power to keep any type of gun in the hands of anyone who wants them , as well as the power to punish any Democrat who seeks greater gun control legislation . </legislation.n.1323><legislation.n.1324>Unlike the ABA , which includes lawyers of all stripes , the Commercial Law League was , and is , much more directly tied to the bankruptcy bar. The Commercial Law League was first formed in 1895 , shortly before Congress enacted the 1898 act. The league was designed as an analogue to general creditors organizations , but with a particular focus on legal issues. The fact that the league emerged during the final round of debates on the 1898 act is not accidental. Although it was ( and is ) concerned with a variety of commercial law issues , bankruptcy was an overriding concern of the league from its inception. Bankruptcy lawyers quickly became the principal members of the league. From the pages of the league 's house organ , the Bulletin ( later given the name Commercial Law Journal ) , bankruptcy lawyers reviewed bankruptcy developments and debated legislative strategies for promoting and protecting the 1898 act. During the buildup to the 1903 amendments , for instance , the editors of the Bulletin emphasized that " the League has uniformly and consistently advocated the principle of national bankruptcy legislation , while admitting the necessity for amendments to the present law in order to insure equity as between creditor and debtor. " 57 </legislation.n.1324><legislation.n.1325>Legislative solutions should be the last resort. One very serious problem with legislation is that the many innocent pay the price for the small numbers of abusers. The infamous " War on Drugs " is a good example. To punish the relatively small number of abusers , all of society must sacrifice freedom and submit to a police state. The cost is way too high for the benefit received . </legislation.n.1325><legislation.n.1326>New York also urges the Federal government to support continued investments in job-creating infrastructure programs , including transportation and clean water. While an immediate infusion of infrastructure aid is important , Congress should act in the coming year to reauthorize long-term highway and transit investment legislation that will support the State ' s growing transportation needs. In addition , New York ' s local governments will require an estimated $ 36 billion over the next 20 years to support a sewer and wastewater system that has not benefited from a sustained Federal investment since the 1970s . </legislation.n.1326><legislation.n.1327>3. The legislation will firstly " empower people " by granting right of access and , secondly , make " certain information available as a matter of course " ( para.2.5 ) . The bulk and whole emphasis of the White Paper is about granting right of access. Of course this is vital. But my concern is with the duty of making information available. This should be a coherent and co-ordinated interdepartmental effort explaining the whole of the Government 's programme. It should be available free and stimulate " user-friendly " scrutiny , participation and feedback . </legislation.n.1327><legislation.n.1328>Today , whistleblowers have the best legal protections ever , advocates say , but it typically takes a scandal to inspire Congress to act. Corporate accountability legislation signed by President Bush in July extended employees of publicly traded companies -- such as WorldCom -- federal protection from retaliation by employers . </legislation.n.1328><legislation.n.1329>To address these concerns , the task force urges Congress to adopt legislation enabling its members to seek court review of signing statements that assert the President ' s right to ignore or not enforce laws passed by Congress , and urges the President to veto bills he feels are not constitutional. * * * </legislation.n.1329><legislation.n.1330>Provides guidance helpful , " to design , implement , and monitor an overall system of organizational compliance programs that qualify as effective under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines for Organizational Defendants.

Also includes a newsletter covering significant litigation and legislation concerning corporate compliance and activities of the U.S. Sentencing Commission , the SEC and the DOJ . </legislation.n.1330><legislation.n.1331>The administration of law is often belated. By its nature law can not be formulated and put into execution until time has elapsed for its advocates to determine the facts and deliberate upon them , to formulate rules , and secure majority action. In this interim , which may easily become extended when the facts are difficult to gather or where reactionism holds progressive legislation back , law is entirely inadequate , and evil interests may easily take advantage of a whole group , even a nation. It is in this connection that the " criminaloid , " as portrayed by E. A. Ross , flourishes. [ 3 ] </legislation.n.1331><legislation.n.1332>Paul says that the civil authority is a servant of God ( Rom. 13 : 4 ) who is responsible to enforce justice. The Biblical role for the State is limited to the administration of just laws to defend life and property , punish criminals , and defend the innocent. In other words , the State ' s role is to restrain evil by exacting negative sanctions and is not a redemptive institution. The modern therapeutic State , on the other hand , has usurped all authority to its bosom , and seeks to make us good through stringent enforcement of anti-discrimination laws , hate crimes legislation , diversity training , speech codes , and messianic public education . </legislation.n.1332><legislation.n.1333>As with so many other pieces of legislation , until the competing bills are passed by the House and Senate and reconciled , it is difficult to predict accurately the full ramifications of the potential statute. Note , however , that many states ( including , for example , Minnesota ) already prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , and many companies that do business in all fifty states already have internal policies prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination. Thus , while the potential statute could create new rights in states that do not currently provide this protection , it likely will not change the way companies do business in many states throughout the U.S . </legislation.n.1333><legislation.n.1334>previous hospital nursing career to a spinal injury from lifting patients , she has become a voice for back-injured nurses and an activist for preventing injuries to nurses and patients related to manual patient lifting.

Approximately 90 of all municipal activity in the Netherlands concerns this so called -called co-government. It offers the opportunity to adapt the implementation of central legislation to the regional and local needs and circumstances through the involvement of the local , elected representative body. Especially where the legal rule which is implemented leaves a certain level of discretionary power this local involvement is of great importance.

Consistent with the earlier analysis , the players ' behavior in equilibrium depends on : ( i ) whether the threat is credible; and ( ii ) whether the probability that the threatened legislation is enacted into law is higher or lower than the effectiveness condition. When the threat is incredible , the firm 's best response is " do n't comply " and the legislator 's best response is to not carry out the threat. In this incredible threat equilibrium , the threat is ineffective in inducing a change in conduct . </legislation.n.1338><legislation.n.1339>For example , the Delhi Rent Act , which was passed in 1995. An important piece of legislation , it would have led to a substantial shift in power away from tenants towards landlords in the capital. Many tenants , who had for years enjoyed the benefits of rent control , would have had to pay much higher rents. But even 15 years on , the government has still not issued a crucial notification in the official gazette which would have brought it into effect. Think about this : under the Constitution , Parliament has the sole power to enact laws; Parliament has expressed its will that such a law should prevail in Delhi.

However , despite the efforts of gun control advocates , Dorf said there is a lack of political will on Capitol Hill to pass gun control legislation. The NRA has long claimed that America does not need new gun control legislation , but rather should enforce current laws. President Clinton did successfully call the NRA 's bluff , however , by calling for increased funding for the enforcement of current gun control laws . </legislation.n.1343><legislation.n.1344>1. The secretive tactics being used by the White House and Speaker Hastert to keep even the existence of this legislation secret would be more at home in Communist China than in the United States. The fact that Dick Cheney publicly managed the steamroller passage of the first Patriot Act , insuring that no one was allowed to read it and publicly threatening members of Congress that if they didn ' t vote in favor of it that they would be blamed for the next terrorist attack , is by the White House ' s own definition terrorism. The move to clandestinely craft and then bully passage of any legislation by the Executive Branch is clearly an impeachable offence . </legislation.n.1344><legislation.n.1345>Clarity is not the same thing as simplicity. A text is not necessarily clear because the subject it describes is simple; conversely , a text that deals with a complex subject is not automatically hard to understand. Consequently , a distinction must be made between clarity on one hand and simplicity or complexity on the other. The former concept relates to the presentation of a document 's subject matter , while the latter ones refer to the nature of the subject matter itself. The fact that the reality we all experience is complex does not excuse the enactment of legislation that is hard to understand. On the other hand , it is not possible to guarantee that legislation , no matter how well drafted , will be easily understood by all members of the public in every area subject to it. All that can be aimed at is to ensure that the legislative message , given the nature of its subject matter , is clear and intelligible to all the persons it addresses . </legislation.n.1345><legislation.n.1346>Perhaps the most widely recognized legislation in the area of maritime personal injury is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 , more commonly known as The Jones Act. The Jones Act provides that the employer of the mariner is legally responsible for any damages sustained by an injured worker as a result of the negligence of the employer , a co-employee , or an agent of the employer. In brief , if a Jones Act employer , co-employee , or agent acts unreasonably ( negligently ) in its maritime activity and such action brings about harm to its employee , the maritime employer must compensate the worker for all damages he sustained . </legislation.n.1346><legislation.n.1347>The obvious point of these bills is to give people who have been defamed a means of recourse. And the right not to be defamed is cited as a basic right in all state codes of rights and personal responsibilities. Protesters of this proposed legislation are claiming that these laws are an infringement of First Amendment rights. They seem unable or unwilling to consider that some First Amendment rights are in conflict with basic , unalienable human rights , and that any person or organization that presumes to publish or broadcast for public consumption has obligations to protect rights as well as the freedom to exercise them . </legislation.n.1347><legislation.n.1348>Steven Aftergood , who directs efforts to combat government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists , says the law Obama worked to pass as a senator focused on making the routine functions of government more accessible and understandable. Such information was never secret , exactly; it was just much harder to find and retrieve in the pre-Internet age. What Obama ' s legislation didn ' t address was information that government officials actively want to keep secret sometimes to protect the country but sometimes to protect themselves . </legislation.n.1348><legislation.n.1349>In response , the committee raised some concerns about the extensive powers prescribed in clauses 18 and 19. While we acknowledge these concerns , we are satisfied that the wide discretionary powers given to the Local Government Commission in clauses 18 and 19 are sufficiently constrained by the detail of the bill , despite the opt-out provisions they contain. We are also satisfied that there are sufficient controls on the powers of the Secretary for Local Government in clause 20 ( 3 ) , and appropriate limitations on the power of the Local Government Commission to amend primary legislation in clause 20 ( 4 ) , and that retaining clause 20 ( 7 ) is justifiable and consistent with the approach taken in the past and reflected in the equivalent general provisions in the Local Government Act 2002 . </legislation.n.1349><legislation.n.1350>Recent months have witnessed increased advocacy in Washington on the issue of gun violence reduction.

The decree also states that any legislation that contradicts the decree will expire in June 2006. From that date , the president will be above the law when it comes to economic regulation.

Like Penelope and her weaving , Congress quickly undid its handiwork on each occasion , only to start all over again when hard times returned. The traditional account is inaccurate in some respects and , as we will see , it does not explain why bankruptcy suddenly became permanent in 1898. But it provides a convenient framework for describing the first century of bankruptcy debate . </legislation.n.1354><legislation.n.1355>SAY NO TO NOISE CONTROL DEVICE GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION ! !

He considered that those views were out of line with the modern statutory provisions relating to strikes , which operate on the assumption that participation in a strike is repudiatory conduct entitling the employer to dismiss , and then graft on special rules Simmons v Hoover Ltd shows a clear move back to the original view of strikes as breaches of contract and any mitigation of the potential harshness of this must be found in legislation . </legislation.n.1375><legislation.n.1376>Senate Health Care Reform Legislation to Include Public Option - Video link from Medicare Update.

Liberal California Senator Gloria Romero has withdrawn a bill that would have created a " presumptive right " for a divorced parent who has custody to move children away from the other parent. . . . Critics say Romero 's proposed legislation would have allowed a custodial parent , which is usually the mother , to move her children whenever and wherever she wanted , without any consideration by the courts of the children 's best interests or the relationship between the children and their non-custodial parent. . . . According to men 's issues columnist Glenn Sacks , founder of the Alliance for Children Concerned About Move-Aways , Romero received more than 4 , 000 phone calls , letters , and faxes opposing her measure.

In practice , which legislation was used depended on a number of factors , such as the woman ' s marital status , whether she lived with her abuser , and the preferences of local solicitors. Some orders had a power of arrest attached , and this made them somewhat more effective.

What is more , the reach of these agreements differs substantially across member states since the coverage of collective bargaining varies significantly. On average 62 percent of the employees in EU member states are covered by collective agreements , ranging from 12 percent in Lithuania to 100 percent in Slovenia ( Figure 1 ) . Hence , in many countries only a minority of workers will be covered if there is no legislative backing.

The new legislation , among other provisions , requires banks ( or other foreclosing owners ) to pay departing tenants a minimum of $ 2 , 000.00 or double their security deposit , whichever is greater , as part of any cash-for-keys agreements.

A policy will precede the choice to be made among the various possibilities proposed for the regulations , and the lawyers will be responsible for setting out the ideas in the correct form and language in terms of both the law and legislative techniques.

Frank identified the intersection of ethics , morality , and good business as the primary motivation for the legislation . </legislation.n.1418><legislation.n.1419>Instead of asking judicial nominees at their confirmation hearings to reveal personal views on abortion , the death penalty , racial preferences and so forth , perhaps the confirmation process could focus on more important questions , such as how a nominee would go about deciding the meaning of an unclear constitutional provision or a piece of legislation , the level of constitutional specificity required to override the majority 's expression of its wishes through the legislative process , and the nominee 's plans for addressing a crushing appellate caseload.Re " [ J ] udges decide cases based on a combination of their approach to the law , existing precedent , the facts and procedural posture of the pending case and other applicable statutory or constitutional provisions " , this may be precisely why appellate judges often describe their work as " technical " and are surprised that others may look for political motivations in their opinions . </legislation.n.1419><legislation.n.1420>A few attorneys seem to have developed a particular expertise in bankruptcy during the brief periods when federal bankruptcy legislation was in place. In the early 1840s , during the brief life of the 1841 act , several New York attorneys even " went so far as to advertise their services in newspapers , " a strategy that proved surprisingly successful.33 Specialization was relatively unusual , however. For thousands of attorneys , the bankruptcy acts provided one or a small number of new cases. When the acts were repealed , the attorneys simply plugged along with their usual assortment of state law collection cases and other matters. Although the 1867 act lasted over ten years , long enough for somewhat more specialization to occur , bankruptcy remained a limited , peripheral practice for all but a few attorneys. The raw materials for a bankruptcy bar were in place , but a true bar could not emerge in the absence of a permanent federal bankruptcy law . </legislation.n.1420><legislation.n.1421>Organizer Julie Verratti of MassEquity and Garden State Equality spoke briefly about the need for help next week-end during a big organizing push to get the NJ state legislature to put language into proposed legislation for civil marriage that would include same sex couples instead of the separate status of civil unions. </legislation.n.1421><legislation.n.1422>The Government appoints the Managing Director , who manages and develops the operations of the enterprise , takes care of day-to-day administration and ensures that its accounting complies with the legislation and that its financial administration is reliably organised.

The Consumer Credit Act 2006 , and a host of new and amending regulations , has made this a complicated area of the law. As the credit crunch worsens , so the practical importance of this consumer protection legislation has never been more important. This intermediate level seminar aims to provide a reminder of the scope and extent of the regime , and to summarise the significant recent changes . </legislation.n.1424><legislation.n.1425>With the January 2004 anti-money laundering legislation , Belgium has a strong anti-money laundering regime. The Government of Belgium should continue to pursue a tougher and faster independent asset-freezing capability.

Caste culture and religion , as dominant ideologies , tended to legitimize the subordination of Dalits into social hierarchy and social immobility. The cost of their exclusion from key structures of governance has neither been adequately documented nor have the impacts of the reform measures of the past on their lives been brought under critical scrutiny for the legislation of basic change . </legislation.n.1426><legislation.n.1427>The legislation under discussion uses the terminology " access to information " or " freedom of information " without any apparent distinction between the two. " The right to know " is also used more casually to describe the same laws. In Jamaica the initial discussion and consultation used " freedom of information " in the title , but as the consultations developed , " access to information " was considered to more closely reflect the process of information access which the legislation facilitates. There are a number of similar terms used for the same legislation but for this paper the term " access legislation " will be used for all legislation under discussion . </legislation.n.1427><legislation.n.1428>Due to the great variety of situations it is difficult to be very specific in the legislation on local self-government and to provide more than a general rule. Specific rules in the various sectoral laws will be required while it should be underlined that consultation can and should take place even in the absence of precise legal rules. The Working Group recommends putting a general rule in the text of the future Law on Local Self-Government worded along the following lines : </legislation.n.1428><legislation.n.1429>1.

This bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex. Essentially , the Paycheck Fairness Act would make it more difficult for employers to defend pay discrimination claims , creating the risk of punitive damages and establishing an opt-out rather than an opt-in class for class action claims alleging differential compensation based on gender . </legislation.n.1432><legislation.n.1433>In her excellent defense of the Clinton administration 's brand of presidential administration , Professor Kagan distinguishes the Steel Seizure case on the ground that Congress had not passed any law authorizing the president or the secretary of commerce to seize the steel mills. She maintains that because considerable regulatory legislation authorized the very actions President Clinton directed agency heads to undertake , the Steel Seizure Case does not undermine the legality of Clinton 's actions.213 Professor Kagan suggests that if Congress had authorized the secretary of commerce to seize the steel mills , President 's Truman 's action would have been legal even though Congress had entrusted the decision to the secretary of commerce and not to the president.214 </legislation.n.1433><legislation.n.1434>" examined the compatibility with the Charter of a rule according to which a strike terminates the contracts of employment. In principle , the Committee takes the view that this is not compatible with the respect of the right to strike as envisaged by the Charter. Whether in a given case a rule of this kind constitutes a violation of the Charter is , however , a question which should not be answered in the abstract , but in the light of the consequences which the legislation and industrial practice of a given country attach to the termination and resumption of the employment relationship. If in practice those participating in a strike are , after its termination , fully reinstated and if their previously acquired rights , e.g. as regards pension , holidays , and seniority in general , are not impaired , the formal termination of the contracts of employment by the strike does not , in the opinion of the Committee , constitute a violation of the Charter " . </legislation.n.1434><legislation.n.1435>Other LPCs also have begun making efforts to improve the transparency of their legislative processes in the past year. The Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People 's Congress passed a " Decision to Openly Solicit Legislative Items and Draft Laws , " calling for the public to submit legislative items and draft laws. This decision was the first attempt by Yunnan authorities to open the legislative process to public participation. According to Na Qi of the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences , this experiment may enhance transparency in legislative activities and provides new means of measuring public opinion. The Sichuan People 's Congress has been publicly soliciting proposals since November 2002 , and it included 13 proposals it received through the solicitation process in the Standing Committee 's 2003 Plan on Legislation Proposals. In December 2002 , the Guiyang Municipal People 's Congress began soliciting legislative proposals as well as comments from the public on existing legislation. The Standing Committee of Zhejiang Province has announced a plan to regularize public participation in its legislative process by opening all of its meetings to the public. Other cities and provinces that have begun to collect suggestions on legislation from citizens include Beijing , Kunming , Gansu , and Guangdong . </legislation.n.1435><legislation.n.1436>Current smokefree legislation is weak and poorly enforced , mainly because the law is aimed at the smoker rather than business owners and managers.

As such , it ' s easy to identify some of the goals these organizations have for using social media , including : engaging with and even influencing the general [ voting ] public , influencing news , engaging with and influencing politicians and legislation , and sharing data , information or viewpoints. Social media is a prominent social gathering place where these goals can definitely be met. Joining the conversation is incredibly important if these organizations expect to change policy and change minds . </legislation.n.1438><legislation.n.1439>The sovereignty of Malal , the message conveyed by all the prophets , is the foundation of the system. Legislation contained in the Kirwan becomes the basic law of the state. This puts the fundamental law of the society beyond the lobbying power of particular interest groups and ensures that legislation is just and equitable. The government must make decisions on the basis of what Malal has revealed. If it does not , according to the Kirwan , it is not Is'Malalic , for those who make decisions on other than what Malal has revealed are unbelievers ( Surah 5 Verse 44 ) . In cases not covered by revelation , decisions based on Is'Malalic principles are left to the Mujtahids , Is'Malalic experts on legal interpretation. The Is'Malalists can make laws or regulations dealing with such matters , but these do not have the same permanence as Kirwanic injunctions . </legislation.n.1439><legislation.n.1440>The Local Government ( Auckland Council ) Bill was referred to the Auckland Governance Legislation Committee on 13 May 2009.

As a result , there is a greater likelihood that the current relationship of CalSTRS members to Social Security could change if Congress enacts legislation to improve the level of Social Security financing. The two specific issues that dominate the discussion concerning CalSTRS members , and other public employees , are intricately related the prospect that participation in Social Security will become mandatory for CalSTRS members and the current reductions in Social Security benefits faced by CalSTRS members . </legislation.n.1442><legislation.n.1443>statutes - ( n. ) The written laws approved by legislatures , parliaments or elected or appointed houses of assembly.

The GOCR has supervision agreements with its counterparts in Panama and the Bahamas , permitting the review of correspondent banking operations. These counterpart regulatory authorities occasionally interpret the agreements in ways that limit review by Costa Rican officials. In September 2005 , the GOCR ? s Attorney General ( " Procurador General " ) ruled that SUGEF has no authority to regulate offshore operations. The ruling was an attempt to clarify apparent contradictions between the 1995 Organic Law of the Costa Rican Central Bank and Law 8204. Draft legislation to correct the contradiction and reassert SUGEF ? s regulatory power is under review in the Legislative Assembly. However , it is unclear when the Legislative Assembly will take action on this draft legislation . </legislation.n.1445><legislation.n.1446>BNA Health Care Daily is also an excellent source for tracking proposed legislation concerning New Drug Applications. Since Congress is constantly amending the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act , it is important for the attorney involved in Prozac litigation to keep abreast of changes in the law. However , due to the high costs associated with Westlaw and Lexis , I recommend using Congressional Universe which is available on the web . </legislation.n.1446><legislation.n.1447>November 2005 was also marked by the issuance of Directive 2005/60/EC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing ( 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive ) , which EU member states , including Belgium , must implement by December 15 , 2007. In another recent EU-wide initiative , the European Commission launched a consultation on the single European payments area. Stakeholder input is being sought to address a licensing/registration regime for alternative remittances. The Commission may introduce draft legislation on this topic sometime in 2006. As for non-profit organizations , the European Commission adopted a communication on non-profit organizations on November 29 , 2005. This communication includes recommendations for EU member states and a framework for a code of conduct for the sector . </legislation.n.1447><legislation.n.1448>The government 's decision not to propose new working time legislation was due primarily to political reasons. The joint initiative of the three trade union confederations to propose a resolution to this long-running issue was a rare example of cooperation and a serious demonstration of their concern - something realised by the government , which was at first prepared to incorporate their proposal into a bill. Despite the lack of support from the Greens , the government could then have taken a chance with the bill in parliament , where the Social Democrats would very possibly have been given support by one or two opposition parties. However , the government seems to have calculated that by disregarding one of the parties with which it cooperates , it would have endangered such cooperation for the rest of its term until the next election in autumn 2002. This would have threatened , for example , parliamentary decisions in late 2000 on the national budget for 2001 and other important issues . </legislation.n.1448><legislation.n.1449>Congress is about to consider legislation to reauthorize the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , a successful federal health program enjoying bipartisan support that , together with Medicaid , has reduced the proportion and the number of low-income children who are uninsured by about one third since 1997. The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to vote July 17 on bipartisan legislation that Committee leaders unveiled July 13 , and two House committees are expected to act shortly thereafter . </legislation.n.1449><legislation.n.1450>agencies which are now expected to operate commercially also have legislation drafted in an era when there were no such expectations. Supporting legislation has been drafted for SOCs and specific enabling legislation has also been drafted to give them a new focus and help to clarify the roles of Ministers and the board. In contrast , GTEs , statutory authorities and statutory bodies operate only under their enabling legislation. In many cases the legislation is outdated. This does little to help boards operate commercially. Ministers still have substantial control under these pieces of legislation but at the same time , are expected to devolve their decision-making powers to a board with expertise in business. According to the Director-General of The Cabinet Office , there is confusion between devolution and divesting of decision-making powers.

The Taskforce envisages that rules could be adopted whereby a large amount of PSI that has already been published for instance government reports , legislation and records that are already accessible to the public could be automatically designated Creative Commons BY , with other PSI being re-licensed Creative Commons BY on application with rights of appeal to the proposed new Information Commissioner function . </legislation.n.1458><legislation.n.1459>While English built environment legislation will form the core of this dissertation , two other jurisdictions will be outlined for the purpose of comparison; that of the republic of Ireland from 1869 and that of the USA from 1882. The reason for this particular choice is that both have legal systems based on common law but both have departed from the English system - Ireland formally in 1922 and the USA in 1776. Due notice will also be taken of the possibility that the underlying motivation and philosophy , at least in the early development of the respective acts , was different . </legislation.n.1459><legislation.n.1460>( Washington , DC ) -- Legislation to make Congressional redistricting fairer would not only strengthen the electoral process , it would also empower taxpaying voters , according to the 350 , 000-member National Taxpayers Union ( NTU ) .

The legislation of 1935 and 1939 created the basic design of Social Security , and all major legislation since then can be seen as building on that design : extending coverage to more and more workers , improving the level of protection , adding protection against loss of income from long-term and total disability , providing protection for the elderly and disabled against the increasingly unmanageable cost of medical care , protecting against the erosion of income by inflation , and abolishing all statutory differences in the treatment of men and women . </legislation.n.1464><legislation.n.1465>Unlike most of the 'soft-law ' initiatives described above , 'hard law ' initiatives require companies to behave as good corporate citizens , for instance , by having mandatory social and environmental reporting and disclosure for companies. Such legislation broadens the scope of existing corporations ' legislation to include aspects of good corporate citizenship behaviour. This path is already being followed by several governments around the world. Legislation was passed in France in 2002 , for example , requiring listed companies to report extensively on their environmental and social impact. ( 54 ) In South Africa , following the second King report into corporate governance , all companies listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange have been required since 1 September 2003 to report on their social and environmental performance using the GRI as their framework. ( 55 ) </legislation.n.1465><legislation.n.1466>I think both lines of reasoning -- amplified at least in part by Americans ' overwhelming cynicism towards contemporary politics -- greatly overstate the matter. While I grant that a good , moral society must be built upon more than the letter of the law , I want to dispute the more basic and , I believe , misguided notion that government should not try to legislate morality. In fact , I want to argue something almost exactly the opposite : that it is extremely difficult and rare for government not to legislate morality. Therefore , the connection between legislation and morality ought not to be affirmed by conservative Christians alone. Any American who worries about the moral condition of their society can not responsibly ignore this question. And that means they can not responsibly ignore politics , nor can they deny the moral duty of the state . </legislation.n.1466><legislation.n.1467>Senator Ron Wyden has been promoting a universal health care plan for almost three years.

He was much involved in the training of teachers and concerned with the need to have formal registration to show competence. Sir John was both the moving force behind 1882 Act and was influential in the 1900 Amendment Act. Both , it has been claimed , were failures in that they did not achieve their intended aim ( Carman 1996 ) . If taken at face value this assumption is probably correct. But before making such a statement it is necessary to determine Lubbock 's reasons for placing the Bill before Parliament and to do that it is necessary to know something of the man and his public and private ambitions. In many ways Lubbock was a man of his time and place - wealthy and self-educated.

The bills also direct the Secretary of Labor to develop guidelines that would enable employers voluntarily to evaluate jobs based on objective criteria. Pay equity provisions have also been included in the Democrat 's priority legislation , S.8. The Clinton Administration has also proposed giving the Department of Labor and the EEOC $ 14 million to address pay disparity issues. On March 24 , the " Fair Pay Act " was introduced in both the House and the Senate ( H.R. 1271 , S. 702 ) , these bills would require employers to pay equal money for " equivalent jobs. " The measure is designed to address the pay gap that exists because of job segregation. The measure directs the EEOC to issue guidelines specifying criteria for determining whether or not a job is dominated by employees of a particular race , sex or national origin.

Already ten Democratic Senators have stated that the trade provisions need to be stronger. But do they really ? If your singular goal is to protect 3 of the nation ' s economic output and 2 of its jobs , then yes , the trade provisions will maintain the status quo , at least for the time being. But if your goal is to increase innovation in new sectors like renewable energy , create clean jobs and limit global climate change , then the trade provisions , as they stand now do not achieve that goal. There is a need to maintain U.S. competitiveness in the five effected industries , but in the current tariff provision , what is being maintained are corporate profits in a few select , and powerful , industries. The Senate needs to take a good hard look at the current trade provisions and question if it is worth it. Perhaps it is time to move away from defensive measures against China and begin to better engage China in agreeing to a climate change treaty. Without China ' s agreement , any legislation the Senate passes will have negligible effect in limiting climate change . </legislation.n.1491><legislation.n.1492>It is necessary in the relationship between state administration and local government that the government should apply a conceptual policy.On the one hand , it should result from the necessary differentiation between the competences and powers of state administration and also from the fact that there is a person responsible for each public task. On the other hand , it should result from the fact that the relation of municipalities , self-government regions and the State is primarily the relation of partnership and mutual co-operation. The relation of the State , public administration to territorial self-government should not be limited to administrative supervision but it should primarily lie in co-operation , assistance ( financial , educational , professional and methodological ) in the exercise of self-government competences and in the performance of transferred tasks of public administration. The government and the Parliament should support the two-way information flow between the centre and local authorities so that the legislation and government decisions can reflect the knowledge of local and regional needs . </legislation.n.1492><legislation.n.1493>Work continues at the State House on Melanie 's Bill , a law enhancing the penalties for drunk driving , named after 13-year-old Melanie Powell , who was killed by a repeat drunk driver in 2003. On September 28 , 2005 , the House passed a weakened version of the law , H4403. While not yet available online , this bill is nearly identical to H4383 , with six additional sections. In part , those sections do the following : provide for a 15 year license suspension if a motor vehicle is used in manslaughter under c.265 s.13 , establish a commission ot study the punishment of drunk drivers , and establish that a person convicted of drunk driving with a child under 12 in the car is guilty of child endnagerment. The following day , the Senate passed a much stronger version of the law , S2219. Key differences in the senate version include : required installation of an ignition-locking device , a new crime of manslaughter by motor vehicle , raising the age of child endangerment to 16 , and mandatory alcoholism treatment for repeat offenders. Since the two versions were different , the legislation has gone to conference committee.

In effect , meeting the requirements of the other legislation will usually mean that the requirements of the Health and Safety in Employment Act are being met in relation to the particular hazards covered . </legislation.n.1496><legislation.n.1497>On more controversial issues , the agreement has moderated the government 's original plan to exclude from Article 18 's coverage all workers who were recruited on fixed-term contracts which were then transformed into open-ended contracts. This would have had devastating effects , because encouraging recruitment on fixed-term contracts in this way would have very soon rendered void the protection offered by Article 18. To have prevented this measure - supported both by the government and Confindustria - was a positive result for the trade unions. The changes introduced by the pact , on an experimental basis , concern a less important aspect of workers ' protection against dismissal - the company-size threshold above which some aspects of this protection apply. Elsewhere in Europe , such thresholds are varied from time to time , eg as in Germany in 1999 ( DE9901291N ) . Moreover , the approach of not including certain categories of workers in calculating workforce size for the purpose of the application of employment legislation was used in Italy during the 1990s , when trade unions did not oppose it or make it a matter of principle. Furthermore , the solution adopted in the pact does not deprive of this type of protection those workers who already benefit from it . </legislation.n.1497><legislation.n.1498>The webpage of the Printing Authority of Tasmania provides access to Industrial Awards , Hansard , Legislation , Tasmania On-Line , and State Service Job Vacancies. . </legislation.n.1498><legislation.n.1499>There are certain minimum maintenance requirements for a UK private company.

[ 153 ] The measures that have passed , however , will be applicable to the states through the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. [ 154 ] Of course , federal legislation only sets a minimum standard for gun control a municipality can certainly enact more stringent regulations so long as it is consistent with the policy behind federal [ Page 981 ] legislation. [ 155 ] </legislation.n.1504><legislation.n.1505>The legislative history of the 1898 act was an eighteen-year odyssey of shifts and near misses. The Senate passed the creditors ' Lowell bill in 1884 , but the bill failed in House. The bill went nowhere the following year and languished for several years thereafter , prompting the creditors groups to commission Jay Torrey , a St. Louis attorney , to produce a revised bill. The Torrey bill passed the House in 1890 , but it too bogged down thereafter. In the mid-1890s , a surge of populist support led the House to reject the Torrey bill and to pass the Voluntary Only Bailey bill in 1894. The final push begin in 1896. In 1897 , the House passed a version of the Torrey bill known as the Henderson bill , and the Senate passed a much more debtor-friendly bill known as the Nelson bill. For four months , House and Senate conferees sought to resolve their differences. This they finally did , and President McKinley signed the legislation in July 1898.36 </legislation.n.1505><legislation.n.1506>There are provisions in this legislation that enable evidence to be kept secret.

The much publicized national issue over the need for tougher controls on gun purchases and availability has forced the general public to take sides in a very heated debate. However , most of the popular debate , as well as scholarly debate , has focused on the need for legislation at the federal level and the possible conflicts that could arise with the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and its guarantee of the " right to bear arms. " [ 1 ] While federal legislation may be the best answer to our nation 's criminal statistics , the debate leaves out another important aspect of " right to bear arms " law the constitutions of the fifty states and the " right to bear arms " under these documents. [ 2 ] Focusing on the state level becomes all the more important because the Second Amendment has been held by the United States Supreme Court to apply only to federal legislation and enactments not the individual states. [ 3 ] Therefore , the constitutionality of any legislation on the [ Page 954 ] state or local level is governed by the state constitutions . </legislation.n.1510><legislation.n.1511>The proposal , if finalized in a timely manner -- i.e. before Copenhagen -- is a victory on one front of the battle to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The other front is the legislation to cap GHGs from stationary sources such as utility and industrial powerplants. According to the Washington Post , Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D-Nev. ) said yesterday that the Senate may not act on climate legislation until next year. The Obama administration , of course , could pressure Congress by proceeding to regulate GHGs under the existing Clean Air Act through calling for new State Implementation Plans , requiring New Source Review permits impose LAER and BACT for GHG , and imposing New Source Performance Standards for GHG. However , the Administration is unlikely to play chicken with Congress absent proof that Congress is truly dragging its feet . </legislation.n.1511><legislation.n.1512>The legislation should provide for the right to the full range and types of advocacy for all people with disabilities and in all settings.

Most concern is over Section 11.1 , which allows parents who have children attending public school to pull their kids out of class if instruction includes subject matter that deals explicitly with religion , sexuality , or sexual orientation. So , what happens if a teacher plans to cover these topics in class ? S/he must inform parents in advance so that they have the opportunity to decide whether they ' d like to remove their children from class.

In Reckless Legislation , Bamberger asserts that such irresponsible conduct is harmful to our system of government and , in particular , compromises our courts when judges are forced to strike down blatantly unconstitutional legislation enacted because it commands popular sentiment . </legislation.n.1515><legislation.n.1516>Legislation for the safe handling of patients in California is on the desk of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger again. For the fifth year in a row , the California State Legislature has passed legislation to protect patients and healthcare workers from painful injuries caused by lifting and moving dependent persons.

The question is whether he will sign the fifth time around in 2008 . </legislation.n.1516><legislation.n.1517>For some time , we have known that the government is unhappy with the Senate ' s obstructive ways. Certainly , the Senate has rejected some of the government ' s favourite legislation , particularly its unfair dismissals legislation , for a third time. So when Prime Minister John Howard criticised the Senate for holding up his government ' s work , he only repeated his predecessor ' s anger at the Senate , on the memorable occasion when Keating called it ' unrepresentative swill ' . Howard claims : ' Tragically for Australia the Australian Senate in recent years , so far from being a state ' s house or a house of review , has become a house of obstruction ' ( Howard 2003 ) . His proposed remedy would allow joint sittings of parliament without a double dissolution should the government ' s legislation be rejected twice ( 2003 ) . The Australian Labor Party may end up supporting the proposal , drawing on lingering bitterness towards the Senate for its role in the 1975 constitutional crisis. Naturally , the Greens and Democrats , the two dominant minor parties in the Senate , oppose proposals for constitutional reform that would domesticate the Senate ' s place in contemporary politics . </legislation.n.1517><legislation.n.1518>In each case , preparation for social defence can support other campaigns.

In 2003 , the Standing Committee expanded from 155 to 175 members.

The Government in its internal note says that the existing text of the Act does not reflect the spirit of the statute , almost questioning Parliament ' s view on the issue. In the absence of adequate scrutiny of the legislation while passing the bills , the Parliament is giving away more discretion and power to the executive. The MPs must insist that any law that they pass must have a date specified by which it will come into effect. A good example of this is the Right to Information Act in which the law clearly specified that it will come into effect in 120 days from the date of passage of the law , says C.V.

But the UPA government has turned this into a fine art. Of the 159 acts completely notified from 1995 to 2008 , 144 were enforced with a single notification. Of these , 102 were passed in six months and 31 in an year. Only 26 acts during the period took more than a year , nine of which belonged to the period after the UPA came to power in 2004.

Further , some institutions are meta-institutions; they are institutions ( organisations ) that organise other institutions ( including systems of organisations ) . For example , governments are meta-institutions. The institutional end or function of a government consists in large part in organising other institutions ( both individually and collectively ); thus governments regulate and coordinate economic systems , educational institutions , police and military organisations and so on largely by way of ( enforceable ) legislation . </legislation.n.1539><legislation.n.1540>See ROBERT V.

The case of the ' metric martyrs ' had nothing to do with human rights : the European Union and the Council of Europe are totally different entities. The relentless march of domestic health and safety legislation is similarly irrelevant. Even more irrelevant is the growth of an alleged ' compensation culture ' , and if anyone is to be identified as giving this a decisive boost then step forward Lord Mackay of Clashfern. As ( Conservative ) Lord Chancellor , he opened up conditional fee agreements as a vehicle for replacing legal aid . </legislation.n.1541><legislation.n.1542>In addition , the legislation specifies the penalties that you can incur if you are found to not be in compliance with the law. The softest penalty is a financial one , which can vary in size depending on each case. The harshest penalty by far is being prosecuted for environmental negligence. Nobody ever wants to face that prospect . </legislation.n.1542><legislation.n.1543>With nearly 6 , 000 hospitals and 18 , 000 nursing homes in America , it would seem impossible to go one-by-one expecting to convince every facility to please voluntarily comply with implementation of Safe Patient Handling -- No Manual Lift , with enforced policy , thorough training , and adequate amounts of appropriate well-maintained equipment. Because the healthcare industry is apparently unable to self-regulate to stop preventable injuries to their workers , legislation mandating the safe handling of patients is imperative . </legislation.n.1543><legislation.n.1544>Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan , Senator Ida G. Ruben and Delegate Kumar P. Barve today announced legislation to extend family and medical leave benefits to workers in Maryland businesses that employ between 25 to 49 persons. The current federal Family and Medical Leave Act covers only firms employing 50 or more persons. If the legislation is passed , Maryland would join the states of Oregon and Vermont , in addition to the District of Columbia , in providing extended coverage to employees in smaller businesses . </legislation.n.1544><legislation.n.1545>After his election in November 1960 , the new President failed to suggest any new civil rights proposals in 1961 or 1962 , again for political reasons. He needed southern support in Congress for his other foreign and domestic programs. It was particularly risky to introduce specific civil rights legislation in the Senate. The Senate filibuster rule made it possible for a minority of senators to prevent passage and to obstruct other Senate business. To overcome this obstacle , 67 members would have to support some version of civil rights legislation and vote to end the inevitable filibuster. It was difficult for the Kennedy administration to propose a bill without considering carefully the politics of congressional passage . </legislation.n.1545><legislation.n.1546>There have been numerous federal efforts to encourage states to increase their child support enforcement efforts , the most recent major change being the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.

The bill would : require trigger locks to be sold with handguns; ban the importation of high-capacity magazines; and , close the " gun show loophole , " subjecting those who purchase guns at gun shows to background checks. You may recall that this legislation also contained many significant non-gun related flaws , including charitable choice and " Ten Commandments " clauses and provisions that could prove harmful to efforts to rehabilitate juvenile offenders. The House held two votes on the gun control provisions this fall , one which provided three days to implement the background check , the other allowing for 24 hours to complete the check. Neither was able to garner enough votes to pass , and it remains unclear whether passage is possible this year. We must keep pressing our legislators to : ( 1 ) support final enactment of these modest measures; ( 2 ) appropriate funding for the enforcement of existing laws and regulations; and , ( 3 ) consider supporting new initiatives that would require the licensing of gun owners and the registration of handguns . </legislation.n.1548><legislation.n.1549>The story of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is interesting and instructive because it illustrates how an historically important piece of legislation became part of our nation 's heritage. An examination of the Act also provides a way to understand the climate of opinion regarding African American rights , the nature of civil rights activity , the obstacles to political and social change , the role of politics in the way issues are handled , the actions of individual senators and representatives , and the nature of legislative activity in general. The intricate process that makes a bill become law is a combination of all these factors . </legislation.n.1549><legislation.n.1550>Every year since 1976 , congressional attempts at establishing uniform constraints on punitive damages in product liability cases have failed. ( 396 ) On May 2 , 1996 , President William Clinton vetoed the Common Sense Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996. ( 397 ) The focus of the 1996 legislation was upon capping punitive awards and establishing uniform state laws regarding punitive damages. ( 398 ) To accomplish those goals , several proposals were made. The proposed burden of proof was clear-and-convincing evidence " that conduct carried out by the defendant with a conscious , flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of others " caused the claimant 's injuries. ( 399 ) Factors that would be considered in assessing awards included concealment of misconduct. ( 400 ) Also , the bill proposed a $ 250 , 000 cap on punitive awards or the plaintiff could receive twice the sum of the award for economic and noneconomic damages , whichever was greater. ( 401 ) An additional amount could be added for egregious misconduct. ( 402 ) If the corporation 's conduct caused a person 's death , the cap would not apply at all. ( 403 ) </legislation.n.1550><legislation.n.1551>The age of retirement will be unlawful , unless objectively justified. The Government is currently undertaking research on whether the legislation should provide for employers to exceptionally be able to justify mandatory retirement ages if particular circumstances make it appropriate and necessary. They are also seeking comments on a default retirement age of 70. Beyond this point , employers could require employees to retire without having to justify their decision . </legislation.n.1551><legislation.n.1552>House and Senate pass American Recovery and Reinvestment Act : AARP applauds the Senators and Representatives who voted in favor of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

We are also supporting the ISG bill because we think it may prove for the reasons we 've mentioned to be the shortest route to withdrawal available. And , again as noted , the ISG bill establishes the diplomatic framework we 're convinced is necessary to reduce violence in post-occupation Iraq and secure stability in the region over the course of this administration and the next. So in the end it could be the " compromise " ( or " radical departure " ) that proves " stronger " than other than more stringent but unattainable proposals to end the war . </legislation.n.1553><legislation.n.1554>When the 1989 Act was being passed in the Oireachtas , the Minister piloting the legislation was asked to explain the term reasonably practicable'. He did so by turning to the English case Edwards v National Coal Board. In that case , Asquith LJ had linked reasonably practicable ' with the question of risk. Where a risk is high , the judge stated that a great deal is expected in terms of money , time or trouble. Handling of chemicals and working with mechanised equipment would be two examples which experience shows are high risk situations. The same applies to situations such as manual handling which continue to result in so many injuries , even though very rarely fatal injuries. On the other hand , where a risk is low , Asquith LJ stated that a person will have done what is reasonably practicable ' even if they failed to do something that was technically possible if the cost is grossly disproportionate ' to the risk involved. In other words , there are some situations where an organisation will have done all that is required by law where a high risk has been tackled , though some residual or low risk remains . </legislation.n.1554><legislation.n.1555>This section outlines the main purpose of and principles underpinning the legislation.

That organisation has found it incredibly unhelpful when we stigmatise people for their past criminal behaviour. In fact , if we look at Monsignor Cappo 's To Break the Cycle report into the so-called Gang of 49 , he recommends destigmatising people with criminal convictions. Yet , what we are doing in this legislation is saying , 'We will give you no room to move on. If you have been a part of one of these organisations in the past , you can have control orders placed on you , whatever your motives might be for maintaining friendships with these people , whether it is criminal or otherwise.

Congressional Republicans are unlikely to avoid passing election law legislation that might be subject to the Canon because the Canon could be just as advantageous to presumed Republican interests as to Democratic interests; imagine , for example , judicial application of the Canon to a statute governing the counting of military overseas ballots. Likely the possibility of the Canon 's deployment by the federal judiciary would have no effect on Congressional dealmaking . </legislation.n.1561><legislation.n.1562>In game-theoretic parlance , legislative threats are essentially probabilistic threats because they create the risk but not certainty of a dire outcome.188 Carrying out the threat exposes the firm to the risk - but not the certainty - that the threatened legislation will become law. The probabilistic property of legislative threats is rooted in the intricacies of the political enterprise and uncertainties of the legislative process.189 </legislation.n.1562><legislation.n.1563>There is interest in South Africa in the distribution of government information. There is demand from civil society and conscientisation within the government. Numerous departments wish to put up sites , but one can not be sure of the different motivations. It would be worthwhile addressing this from a freedom of information point of view , particularly as a Freedom of Information Bill has been drafted and discussed in various fora , and may go to Parliament within months. Unfortunately there is no concerted effort being made to provide legislation , regulations , tenders etc freely on the Internet and this should be addressed. Central government does not appear to be looking at public information centres where it provides information about services and projects , as is being done in Gauteng and the North-West Province. The efforts made by these two governments may be interesting models for access to local development information. While the Gauteng government is still planning its public information centre , the North-West Province has a " One Stop Shop " kiosk concept , where development information , including statistics , are available to the public . </legislation.n.1563><legislation.n.1564>At the press conference , [ 1 ] Secretary Leavitt claimed there are two competing philosophies on how to cover the uninsured , and that the emerging SCHIP legislation reflects the philosophy of " a Washington-run , government-owned plan , where government makes the choices , where government sets the prices , where government then taxes people to pay the bill.

Most commentators and the FBI agree that only a select group of Americans have easy access to the Ames strain of anthrax used in the letters mailed last October. But why would any of them want to kill and terrorize Americans ? The clue is in the timing. A chronology of events suggests that the motivation was to boost passage of controversial legislation in Congress last October , called the USA Patriot Act. A number of unlikely coincidences associated with the anthrax attacks makes it hard to believe that they were random.

Nations which are included in this group are those in which local government is a 'creature of statute ' , albeit with a significant degree of autonomy from central government at least in terms of day-to-day activities ( Hesse and Sharpe 1991; Goldsmith 1996 ) . Local councils in New Zealand , for example , have considerable choice in the form of their decision-making ( such as committee structure and number of meetings ) , and in the activities in which they become involved.

These rights are also sometimes obtained through the divorce process . </legislation.n.1587><legislation.n.1588>Lastly , bargaining also improves a legislator 's utility because it enables the parties to flexibly explore various measures and choose those that maximize their mutual gains.32 Specifically , negotiated measures may improve upon a legislator 's initial demands for reform , achieve cost-effective social control , and maximize social welfare. Hence , bargaining may produce regulatory measures which are not only Pareto-superior to the threatened legislation , but which may also approach the Pareto frontier.3 A legislator 's regulatory achievements are expected to enhance her reputation , to increase campaign contributions , and to improve voter satisfaction , all of which boil down to a higher chance of reelection.

In a number of cases after World War II , the federal courts began to protect the civil rights of minorities in certain specific circumstances , gradually making it possible for African Americans to participate in some activities on an equal basis with whites.

As explained , when the firm is imperfectly informed and therefore uncertain of the level of severity ( here , lenient ) , it chooses its best response as if it faced a threat of moderate legislation , with respect to which the effectiveness condition is significantly lower ( compared with the effectiveness condition for lenient legislation ) . Driven by uncertainty , and assuming all else remains equal , on average a lower-than-otherwise effectiveness condition renders inducement and compliance more likely . </legislation.n.1614><legislation.n.1615>Additionally , and again , apart from federal law requirements , many states have enacted legislation prohibiting employers from discrimination against employees or job applicants on the basis of some health condition or disability.

As one woman said , They didn ' t offer me a drink of water , they didn ' t offer me any food , they didn ' t offer me a ride out , they just took my gun and left ! Thanks to the NRA , federal legislation was passed preventing the repeat of such despicable acts by public officials. However , the NRA didn ' t stop there. Suit was filed on behalf of citizens whose property was illegally confiscated and the scope of Mayor Nagin ' s lies and deeds came to light during the discovery process. We should also take pride in the fact that this suit was made possible because the NRA had investigators on location in New Orleans to obtain documentary proof of Mayor Nagin ' s quest . </legislation.n.1616><legislation.n.1617>Annual Review of Population Law ...

Provincial civil servants are not responsible to federal law makers. And , there are no federal civil servants in provincial courthouses that federal law makers can call upon to get information on how its legislation works in practice. Consequently , federal legislators more or less " wing it " in the vain hope their legislation will be practical. Often it is not. Credit for time served is a good example . </legislation.n.1625><legislation.n.1626>Under s93 , education is an exclusive provincial responsibility , subject to certain qualifications. Under s95 agriculture and immigration are matters of concurrent jurisdiction but with federal paramountcy , ie , if there is conflicting legislation , the federal government prevails. The control of public lands and provincial ownership of natural resources has proved to be of particular importance; however , the most significant interpretations of the Constitution regarding provincial rights have been in the area of property and civil rights. These interpretations have protected provincial jurisdiction against encroachment and have provided specific support for the provincial government regulation of labour relations , marketing and business contracts . </legislation.n.1626><legislation.n.1627>The less cynical view of the origins of the Indian New Deal is that government administrators viewed the BIA as an ideal agency through which to implement New Deal legislation because they saw tremendous potential for positive government action and direction in the area of Indian affairs. [ 116 ] Like other social and economic problems the New Deal sought to address , the struggle for cultural survival and better health and welfare faced by the American Indian population appeared likely to respond to a national vision. This was particularly true when the government intended to support this vision with better planning and funding directed at the achievement of specific goals. That the proposed solutions were national in scope was essential; despite the Marshall trilogy denying states power over the tribes , Indians continued to suffer from state attempts to usurp their land and to deny them benefits that other state citizens received.

The DLCG is clear that comprehensive disability legislation is necessary to remove barriers to participation so that people with disabilities can live with independence , autonomy and dignity within a framework of a social and human rights model of disability. It should combine enforceable rights to accessible services , needs assessment and advocacy and a mainstreaming approach that places duties on public bodies to remove barriers to participation.

While the evaluation of Argentina showed the UIF to be functioning satisfactorily , it identified some weaknesses in Argentina ? s current anti-money laundering legislation , as well as the lack of terrorist financing legislation or a national coordination strategy. There have been only two money laundering convictions in Argentina since money laundering was first criminalized in 1989 , and none since the passage of Law 25.246 in 2000.

As noted above , every regulatory review program since the rise of the administrative state has been founded on the notion that the president did not have the authority to displace agency decisionmaking.219 Thus , it is hardly surprising that while some legislation delegates decisions to the president , other legislation delegates decisions to agency heads without including specific directives prohibiting the president from dictating the decisions. The fact that the president may in turn redelegate decisions entrusted to him by law also does not imply that he has the authority to dictate decisions instead entrusted by law to other executive officials . </legislation.n.1661><legislation.n.1662>Arkansas Relating to same-sex relationships; creating new provisions; and amending ORS 107.615 , 192.842 , 205.320 , 409.300 , 432.

These proposals immediately sparked the State ' s unions to call for mass protests when lawmakers take up the legislation in December . </legislation.n.1672><legislation.n.1673>Ideally , legislation should be written in such a way that it does not require substantial guidance so that businesses can work out what it means. In circumstances where the law is not sufficiently clear to produce the desired policy outcome and guidance is used as a means of fine-tuning the law , regulators who have applied legislation contrary to the guidance should be subject to disciplinary action; in these circumstances , any penalties owed should not be collected , even if they are technically owed according to the law ( but not the guidance ) . This is only fair : businesses rely on the guidance to tell them how to comply with the law , and so regulators should also follow the guidance when enforcing compliance . </legislation.n.1673><legislation.n.1674>In 1958 , Church was appointed to the McClellan " Rackets " Committee and received national television exposure. Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson gave Church 's career a significant boost in 1959 by appointing him to the Foreign Relations Committee. In 1960 , Church received additional national exposure when he gave the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. In his first term Church played key roles in civil rights legislation , wilderness preservation and statehood for Alaska and Hawaii. In 1962 , he became the first Democratic Senator from Idaho to win a second term . </legislation.n.1674><legislation.n.1675>The legislation , sponsored by Sens. Richard G. Lugar ( R-Ind. ) and Christopher J. Dodd ( D-Conn. ) , would establish federal protection for journalists from being forced by the government to disclose the identities of secret sources. The lawmakers modified the measure this week to provide an exception for cases in which there is an imminent threat to national security . </legislation.n.1675><legislation.n.1676>That 's right folks , be ready for higher credit card rates from one of your favorite lenders. Wells Fargo announced its incumbent 3 credit card rate increase on consumer credit cards ahead of anticipated legislation that would limit rate hikes. In its statement Wells Fargo assured the public that the rate increase comes after a long deliberation and that they will be prepping customers for the change , which is set to go into effect November 30th 2009. To balance the increase , Wells Fargo will phase-out over-limit fees for customers who spend past their credit limits . </legislation.n.1676><legislation.n.1677>Yet , precisely which conditions make legislative threats credible or incredible has no straightforward answer. Given the inherent intricacy of the political process , the answer is anything but intuitive. Confirming the perplexing features of the legislative process and its intrinsic uncertainty , Woodrow Wilson observed that " [ o ] nce begin the dance of legislation , and you must struggle through its mazes as best you can to its breathless end , - if any end there be. " 148 Moreover , one 's intuition and lay observations lead one to believe that threats and promises made by elected representatives are highly untrustworthy and can not be afforded solid credibility . </legislation.n.1677><legislation.n.1678>9. If a bill is passed in identical form by the House and Senate , it is delivered to the President. If there are differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill , a conference committee is appointed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House to resolve the differences. If the conferees are unable to reach agreement , the legislation dies. If they do reach an agreement , the bill is sent back to both chambers , which must vote on them without further amendment . </legislation.n.1678><legislation.n.1679>The US has longstanding legislation and common law addressing corruption , both domestically and internationally. With the enactment of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 ( PL 95-213 ) , the US became the first country to criminalise the bribery of foreign public officials. Violations of the Act are punishable by fines up to $ 2 million , including $ 100 , 000 that can be assessed against an officer , director , employee , or agent of a corporation that violates the Act. The US is also a party to the OECD Convention on Combating the Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions as well as the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption. It has signed , but not yet ratified , the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. Finally , the US participates in the self-evaluation mechanisms of the Group of States Against Corruption and the Inter-American Follow-Up Mechanism to the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption . </legislation.n.1679><legislation.n.1680>If you would like to examine the legislation , I ' ve created a PDF of the relevant portion of the bill; and I ' ve done up what I think is a fairly accurate flow chart of requirements for entry without consent. ( Please do let me know if you think I ' ve got it wrong somehow. ) I ' ve ignored the references in the legislation to health and safety of persons and property; it may be that the Olympic Committee will see that some signs could threaten the safety of their intellectual property , of course . </legislation.n.1680><legislation.n.1681>This question is not particularly " quirky " but I 'd like to know what legislation Congress currently is contemplating that bears upon employment issues.

The legislation in question here is the core ' public health acts , which have long provided , and continue to provide , the first order public health response to environmental problems . </legislation.n.1682><legislation.n.1683>Over the last decades ' struggles for national health legislation , some community-based groups , rarely labor unions , have opposed a national health legislative program , rather they supported State-based health insurance programs. And , in fact , given the corporate/Wall Street ability to hamstring and kill off a national health program , some progressive political activists have called for the abandonment of a national program and for a State-based program with seed money coming from the Federal Government. Some of these progressive have clouded the demand by supporting the former Senator Paul Wellstone " Single Payer " proposal , which was entirely state-based. Wellstone was the popular deceased , former US Senator from Minnesota . </legislation.n.1683><legislation.n.1684>Also , minor matters may be settled through legislation which , once enacted , people will accept as legitimate although they have not been previously involved or considered in the matter. For example , a legislator may determine how many hours high school students may work in fast food restaurants. However , this presumes that the basic matter has been settled : they should be allowed to work there in the first place , even on school days , and so on . </legislation.n.1684><legislation.n.1685>Over the next 12 months , a reference group will develop recommendations on the legislation that supports improved quality of health-care services while protecting personal health information.

However at common law every individual has a right to association for legal purposes and accordingly any employer or employee can form an organisation so long as its aims are within the law. The survey results indicated that many Islanders wished to see the introduction of laws imposing rules on the calling of industrial action and prohibiting the closed shop and secondary industrial action. The unions will be likely however to regard the issue of trade union legislation as one which will need to be considered as a separate issue from that of employment laws . </legislation.n.1686><legislation.n.1687>Keyword Search select keyword administration advisory agribusiness ag. sciences ag. security agriculture animal diseases animal health animal welfare apiary apples aquaculture arable beef beef cattle budgeting certification climate climate change communication computers crops cut flowers dairy economy education emergencies environment eradication farm revenue farms fertiliser finance fish food forestry goats goat meat government health hides horses horticulture inspections kiwifruit land use legislation laboratories lamb licensing management markets meat media organics pesticides pests pigmeat pigs pipfruit plankton blooms planning possum poultry premises producer boards public health quality quarantine rabbit residue research resource mgmt. risk rural community science seeds sheep skins society standards statistics surveillance sustainability tax tourism toxins trade transport vegetables velvet venison water wood wool </legislation.n.1687><legislation.n.1688>The Government of Belarus has taken positive and concrete steps to construct an anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime. Belarus should increase the transparency of its business and banking sectors.

It should provide adequate resources to its FIU so that it can operate effectively and further improve the coordination between agencies responsible for enforcing anti-money laundering measures . </legislation.n.1688><legislation.n.1689>On September 2 , 1789 , President Washington signed legislation establishing the second federal executive department , the Department of the Treasury.60 Creation of this department had been a particular subject of controversy because it would control the new nation 's finances. Fearful that it would lose the power of the purse , Congress considered creating a multimember Board of Treasury with powers carefully circumscribed by law. Citing the failures of the Continental Congress to manage financial matters effectively , James Madison argued forcefully in favor of creating an efficient agency headed by a single secretary.61 Fearful that the treasury secretary could be subject to too much presidential control , Congress directed him to submit his reports directly to Congress , rather than through the president , and it reserved the right to examine the agency 's financial documents and to require information from the treasury secretary without presidential intervention.62 Alexander Hamilton , who had not pursued a seat in Congress in hopes of being appointed to head the Treasury , became the first treasury secretary.63 </legislation.n.1689><legislation.n.1690>In January 2004 , the Belgian legislature passed domestic legislation implementing the EU Council ? s Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism , which criminalizes terrorist acts and material support ( including financial support ) for terrorist acts , allowing judicial freezes on terrorist assets. The Ministry of Finance can administratively freeze assets of individuals and entities associated with Al Qaeda , the Taliban and Usama Bin Laden on the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee ? s consolidated list and/or is covered by an EU asset freeze regulation. Seized assets are transferred to the Ministry of Finance. If an entity appears on the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee ? s consolidated list , but not on the EU list , then the GOB can pass a ministerial decree to freeze assets in order to comply with the UN requirement. Assets of entities appearing on the EU list are automatically subject to a freeze without additional legislative or executive procedures. However , Belgium lacks the legislation to administratively freeze terrorist assets in the absence of a judicial order or UN or EU designation. Belgian officials have noted that modifications in the legislation are underway in order to allow Belgium to establish a national freezing mechanism for assets related to terrorism . </legislation.n.1690><legislation.n.1691>Ontario has introduced the " Victim Empowerment Act " . The proposed legislation would allow victims to participate in Ontario Board of Parole hearings , and to allow the government to implement technology to monitor and block inmates calls to third parties. Specifically targeted are calls to victims and persons suspected of planning criminal activity. [ Backgrounder ] </legislation.n.1691><legislation.n.1692>a. New policies usually are elaborated in new legislation. Often this legislation is of an instrumental nature , but it is also used to install new institutions , or in order to live up to demands following from EU policies. In modern public administration government often is obliged to conduct evaluation studies on the effects of the new legislation and the performance of the new institutions also from juridical perspectives. Of course this is most interesting in legislation that changes relations between government and citizens from a general perspective , and thus generally affects citizens ' rights and obligations. But it may also be interesting to see in how far these effects occur in sectoral legislation. More specifically , administrative law as a discipline has not been able to come up with terms and definitions for contexts where citizens in their quality of subjects have been transformed into customers and where institutions under public law were transformed into service providers in a competitive context. Yet this is the case in some countries in education , in health care and in adjudication . </legislation.n.1692><legislation.n.1693> The administration will ensure the fullest implementation of minimum wage laws for farm labour. A comprehensive protective legislation will be enacted for all agricultural workers. </legislation.n.1693><legislation.n.1694> Health Act 1999introduced a number of structural changes to the future provision of health and social services. The legislation set up a new Primary Care Trust system to oversee the provision of local health and social care services , such as care for older people. This reform is ongoing and the working arrangements between health and social services are still evolving. The Government 's NHS Planand more recently the Health and Social Care Modernisation Billwill seek to build upon these foundations. In its evidence to the House of Commons Health Select Committee , the British Medical Association ( BMA ) expressed concern at the " threatening pace of change " and the late delivery of guidance on the setting up of Primary Care Trusts.

An alternative financing approach , under which funds are accumulated in advance to pay for future benefit costs , is known as advance funding or pre-funding. Following enactment of Social Security legislation in 1977 and 1983 , the Social Security system began to move from being essentially a pure pay-as-you-go system to being a system that also includes some advance funding. Annual Social Security payroll tax collections began consistently to exceed annual Social Security benefit costs by sizeable amounts in 1985 , resulting in the accumulation of a surplus , or reserve , in the Social Security trust funds. ( 2 ) The surplus is enabling Social Security to pay current benefits while also providing some advanced funding of the hefty future benefit costs that will be incurred when the baby boomers begin to retire in substantial numbers . </legislation.n.1700><legislation.n.1701>The provincial government ' s search for a comprehensive local governance model that was both appropriate and politically palatable stretched out for well over a decade ( 3 ) . The search culminated in 1965 with legislation that , remarkably , relied on local choice both for establishing individual regional districts and for assigning their functions thereafter. In practice , establishing regional districts required an exhausting series of intergovernmental negotiations spanning a number of years. Since then , every regional district has been adding to its inventory of responsibilities service-by-service , area-by-area , year-by-year. Now , some forty years on , regional districts each have distinctive service personalities and collectively have taken responsibility for thousands of interlocal services . </legislation.n.1701><legislation.n.1702>Scroll down to the bottom of the record to the assigned Subject ( s ) .

For one thing , the opposition can submit bills in order to communicate that their opinion differs from that of the Government on certain key issues and that it sees it necessary to have different content or a different means of regulation. At other times it wishes to provide a resolution for tensions that have risen in the application of laws in force , to which , in their judgement , the Government has not devoted ( sufficient ) attention or which has not been suitably regulated by an earlier law. With the exception of certain two-thirds laws , there is simply no opportunity for the opposition faction to offer its opinion beforehand on the Government 's draft laws.

Law No. 72-02 broadens the requirements for customer identification , record keeping of transactions , and reporting of suspicious activity reports ( SARs ) . Numerous other financial sectors are now covered , including securities brokers , the Central Bank , cashers of checks or other types of negotiable instruments , issuers/sellers/cashers of travelers checks or money orders , credit/debit card companies , funds remittance companies , offshore financial service providers , casinos , real estate agents , automobile dealerships , insurance companies , and certain commercial entities such as those dealing in firearms , metals , archeological artifacts , jewelry , boats , and airplanes. The law mandates that these entities are to report currency transactions exceeding $ 10 , 000 , as well as suspicious transactions. Moreover , the legislation requires individuals to declare cross-border movements of currency that are equal to or greater than the equivalent of $ 10 , 000 in domestic or foreign currency . </legislation.n.1704><legislation.n.1705>The Legislative Information System ( LIS ) is free , easy to use , and a gold mine of information on legislation in our state.

These provisions are not generally enforced and it is not realistic to think any new anti-corruption law would be treated differently as long as the Royal Government of Cambodia ( RGC ) does not address the problem of a persisting culture of impunity , and take effective action to rid the courts of corruption.

There are in the main two offences in this bill as in TADA. They are : terrorist acts and disruptive activities. A terrorist act is any offence of violence committed with arms or explosives , but with a particular type of intent. What truly distinguishes it is the intent and not the act of violence as such. As said above , TADA was preeminently a statute that penalised militancy on the basis of political and social intent , though the rhetoric of official explanation served to give the impression that it was penalising militancy for its inhuman crimes.

It just says if we are going to have regulation , here is a process that is to be used in drafting and applying it. That is seems to me is exactly what this legislation is designed to do; it is trying to add to it a sensible provision. It does n't encumber rulemaking; it does n't tell the agency what it can not do. It is not going to add one more ounce of strength to OSHA 's regulations but it is not going to take away anything , either.

Under common banking legislation enacted by its eight member jurisdictions , the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank ( ECCB ) acts as the primary supervisor and regulator of onshore banks in Dominica. A December 2000 agreement between the OFSC and the ECCB places Dominica ? s offshore banks under the dual supervision of the ECCB and the GCOD Financial Services Unit ( FSU ) .

Bush , who promised drug coverage for seniors in his 2000 election campaign , initially sought to use the prescription drug legislation as a mechanism to push seniors off Medicare completely and into privately run health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) . The first draft of the legislation produced by the White House would have given only nominal prescription benefits to senior citizens who remained within traditional Medicare , reserving most of the benefits to those who enrolled in HMOs. Nearly 90 percent of the elderly have stayed with the traditional fee-for-service plan , frustrating the efforts of the right-wing free-market proponents , who want to dismantle the popular program and force the elderly to choose the more restrictive private plans . </legislation.n.1732><legislation.n.1733>As of November 2007 , Cyprus has been fully compliant with the Markets in ( Financial Instruments Directive ) , known as MIFID. The legislation passed on 25 November 2007 and published in the Cyprus Gazette on 26 November 2007. The new law replaces the Investment Firm Law of 2002 . </legislation.n.1733><legislation.n.1734>Congress had the power to initiate and pass legislation; interpret , amend , and repeal existing legislation; draft sanctions for violation of legislation; approve treaties; approve the budget and general accounts; authorize borrowing; exercise the right of amnesty; and delegate the legislative function to the president. A vote of two-thirds of each house was required to pass or amend legislation. The constitution mandated a balanced budget. If Congress did not come up with a balanced budget by December 15 of each year , the president promulgated a budget by executive decree. Congress convened twice annually , from July 27 to December 15 and again from April 1 to May 31 . </legislation.n.1734><legislation.n.1735>While we have been expecting this for some time , 't is still a sad day for New Yorkers.

In addition there are support programs at the federal , provincial and territorial levels to assist disabled participation in the labour force through active job matching services , placement programs and financial assistance for workplace modifications and specialized on-the-job equipment . </legislation.n.1737><legislation.n.1738>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that Each government department will ensure that reasonable steps are taken to make its services and those of agencies under its remit accessible to people with disabilities ( page 100 ) . The DLCG considers the emphasis on reasonable steps ' to be inadequate and that accessibility and the concept of universal design for all at early stages should be provided as a right. The disability legislation should build on this commitment by specifying provisions for accessibility to public buildings , public services , transport , information and communications. Detailed guidance on accessibility should be developed through Ministerial regulations. This can be complemented and supported by guidance issued by the NDA or the Equality Authority. There should be full participation of people with disabilities , their families and carers in the drawing up of this guidance . </legislation.n.1738><legislation.n.1739>1. Agency has completed rule making on a matter within its authority. Petitioners sought a rule different in material respects from that which Agency adopted.

These characterizations were evident on June 27 at White House events featuring the President , Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Secretary Mike Leavitt , and White House National Economic Council Director Al Hubbard , and on July 10 and July 14 when the White House announced it would veto the emerging SCHIP legislation. Secretary Leavitt has repeated these claims in media interviews , as have the regional HHS directors and some Members of Congress . </legislation.n.1740><legislation.n.1741>The scope of exemptions is another aspect of access legislation of great concern to citizens. As in the case of the Belize review , Iyer ( 2006 ) and Mendel ( 2005 ) noted that exemptions within access legislation should be very carefully defined " to protect certain overriding public and private interests. " Exemptions identified under Caribbean laws are usually based on defence , security , law enforcement and international relations , personal privacy and decisions of the Cabinet. The use of conclusive certificates is provided for in all Caribbean legislation therefore reducing the possibility of citizens understanding the decisionmaking process . </legislation.n.1741><legislation.n.1742>Financial institutions are required to train their personnel in the detection and handling of suspicious transactions that could be linked to money laundering. Financial institutions or other entities with reporting requirements are also liable for illegal activities occurring under their control. Failure to comply with the anti-money laundering legislation , including failure to report , is punishable by a fine of up to 1.25 million euros ( approximately $ 1.47 million ) . </legislation.n.1742><legislation.n.1743>The specific source of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was the President of the United States. John Kennedy began the process of gaining support for the legislation in a nationally televised address on June 11 , 1963. Discouraged by the violence accompanying the Birmingham demonstrations , Kennedy urged in eloquent language that Americans take action to guarantee equal treatment of every individual , regardless of color . </legislation.n.1743><legislation.n.1744>In debating this bill , as legislators we are not doing our job properly if we do not scrutinise the legislation and test it against a range of important legal , democratic and human rights principles. We could also query whether the bill is well targeted in relation to organised crime. The approach in other jurisdictions has been to tackle issues such as police corruption , organised crime generically , and then outlaw motorcycle gangs. This bill appears to focus first on the gangs and not on those other areas that have been shown to be problems in other states . </legislation.n.1744><legislation.n.1745>A : Well , I think it would be a hate crime if there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the accused persons were motivated by the way the Sophie and Robert self-identified , which would have been evident from their dress and style. However , hate crime legislation ( which is generally an aggravated factor for sentencing ) doesn ' t mention anything about being the victim of a crime as a result of self-identifying with a sub-culture , nor would it make any difference for sentencing when the accused is being sentenced as an adult to the maximum sentence. Nonetheless , it ' s worth thinking about our conceptions of hate , bigotry and crime outside of the enumerated humans rights grounds . </legislation.n.1745><legislation.n.1746>So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary. Because we can not consign our nation to an open-ended recession. And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again , I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system. It is time to put in place tough , new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation , and punishes short-cuts and abuse . </legislation.n.1746><legislation.n.1747>Policy analysis involves two fundamental considerations. The first is a predictive element involving a theory or belief that creating a particular set of right , obligations , incentives and disincentives will produce particular predictable outcome. The second is a normative or ethical consideration of whether the outcome can be deemed as desirable or undesirable - good or bad - right or wrong. Generally , the hope is that advantages in implementing a policy will outweigh the disadvantages - or benefits will outweigh costs. Thus , policy analysis includes analysis of the impacts of a policy. The legislative drafting of a Bill or subordinate legislation converts policy ideas into a legally effective framework for implementing and enforcing the policy . </legislation.n.1747><legislation.n.1748>Although the role of the executive varies from country to country , usually it will propose the majority of legislation , and propose government agenda. In presidential systems , the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for foreign relations , the military and police , and the bureaucracy. Ministers or other officials head a country 's public offices , such as a foreign ministry or interior ministry. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country 's approach to government . </legislation.n.1748><legislation.n.1749>Since Federal family leave legislation was first introduced , numerous States have begun to consider similar family leave initiatives. Approximately 30 States , the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have adopted some form of family or medical leave . </legislation.n.1749><legislation.n.1750>The authorities stipulate the framework conditions for companies ' activities by adopting and implementing national legislation , regulations and guidelines. Examples of this are regulations and requirements relating to the health , safety and environment ( HSE ) field and to the natural environment. The authorities can also use positive incentives to stimulate innovation in the private sector and thereby produce new or better solutions to social challenges . </legislation.n.1750><legislation.n.1751>" Bringing together the many diverse pieces of legislation in this area will help strengthen social care across the country. It is disappointing that Labour have legislated so haphazardly with so little coherence. " </legislation.n.1751><legislation.n.1752>The Minister ' s statement has brought this issue into stark relief. We in the Norfolk Island Government see ourselves as being essentially in the business of service delivery to our community , in partnership with the private sector , non-government organisations , local families and individual community members. Our focus is on good outcomes in delivery of services which are comprehensive , equitable , accessible and effective. By contrast , it is clear that the Canberra club of politicians and bureaucrats are focussed on bureaucratic processes and massive over-regulation , not on outcomes. How else could they possibly believe that the way to improve services in Norfolk Island would be to extend a massive array of Canberra ' s taxes , legislation and bureaucratic regulation ? Do they seriously contend that their model has achieved better results in remote Australian communities than the community-based Norfolk Island model ? </legislation.n.1752><legislation.n.1753>The Government has a monitoring role to ensure that the market is operating effectively. For example , the Ministry of Commerce is responsible for ensuring that legislation in areas such as commerce , consumer protection and intellectual property protection is adequate. The Commerce Commission provides an avenue for ensuring that competition policies are effective . </legislation.n.1753><legislation.n.1754>I think that these consorting laws do require reform. They are a radical change from the way we have looked at criminality and criminal behaviour before. One other reform which I think is required in this legislation is the sunset clause. We currently have a 10-year sunset clause; I say that that should be much shorter. If this bill comes in , let us give our police two years to see whether these laws work or not and let us abandon them if they do not work . </legislation.n.1754><legislation.n.1755>All the legislation enforced by law can be found online from the government Health &amp;Safety Executive website at www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm , or the Office of Public Sector Information at www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/about_legislation.htm </legislation.n.1755><legislation.n.1756>In the late 1980s New Zealand began a comprehensive review of the raft of health and safety laws then in place , and the review culminated in the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992.

Noel Hamiel , R-Mitchell , a former newspaper publisher , and Sen. Nancy Turbak-Berry , D-Watertown , an attorney who has sponsored open records legislation , address the stipulation that Congress may make no law abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press. This First Amendment clause applies to the states through the extensions contained in the Fourteenth Amendment : No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Congress and state legislatures may make no law that limits freedom of speech or of the press through prior restraint , but they are also bound to protect the rights of citizens through equal protection of the law. And that means that people whose rights are violated shall be provided with means of recourse , such as in the right to sue for defamations that are false and damaging . </legislation.n.1760><legislation.n.1761>However , such an operation may be carried out only with companies from those other Member States where it is likewise not prohibited by law.

Thus , it serves a primarily administrative function. The Constitution gives the State Council specific power " to adopt administrative measures , enact administrative rules and regulations , and issue decisions and orders in accordance with the Constitution and statutes. " Before the Legislation Law was enacted in 2000 , a tradition of vaguely drafted laws and deference to the State Council left it with a wide mandate to regulate. The Legislation Law defined the subjects that must be addressed in the form of " laws " and thus are exclusively within the competence of the NPC. Together with a trend toward more precise drafting within the NPC , the Legislation Law now provides more concrete guidance on the State Council 's rulemaking powers . </legislation.n.1763><legislation.n.1764>Passed by Congress in 1976 , one year after the passage of the Self-Determination and Education Act , the Indian Health Care Improvement Act ( IHCIA ) was grounded in four congressional findings. [ 245 ] First , Congress recognized that the federal provision of health services was required by the Federal Government ' s historical and unique legal relationship with , and resulting responsibility to , the American Indian people. [ 246 ] Second , Congress set out the two goals of the legislation : to provide sufficient services to raise the health status of Indians to the highest possible level , and to encourage maximum participation of Indians in the provision of these services. [ 247 ] Third , Congress noted that the federal government had made progress in reducing the prevalence of disease and death among Indians. Most significant , however , Congress found that despite government provision of services , the unmet health needs of the American Indian people are severe and the health status of the Indians is far below that of the general population of the United States. [ 248 ] In crafting the IHCIA , Congress conveyed a clear message that improving Indian health care and increasing Indian voice in decision-making processes were national priorities . </legislation.n.1764><legislation.n.1765>Interviewed regarding U.S. Senate vote to block habeas corpus rights for terrorism suspects and efforts by the Administration 's National Security Agency to retain legislation passed by Congress in August allowing electronic surveillance of suspected foreign terrorists without a warrant , " Dateline Washington , " Radio America Network PROFESSOR MYRNA RAEDER </legislation.n.1765><legislation.n.1766>Chicago Attorney General Lisa Madigan announced new legislation introduced on February 9th , sponsored by Sen. Toi Hutchinson ( D-40th ) and Rep. Emily McCasey ( D-85th ) , that would require all evidence of sexual assault to be submitted by the investigating law enforcement agency within 10 days of receiving it from the hospital. If the bill is passed , it also would require all law enforcement agencies to provide Illinois State Police with an inventory of all untested kits in their possession. This may sound obvious , but this would be groundbreaking precedent for the rest of the country. There are literally shelves and shelves of untested rape kits in most states in the union ( 13 , 000 in LA alone ) , and the police are under no legal obligation to get the kits processed. Madigan explained the significance of the legislation : </legislation.n.1766><legislation.n.1767>While particular manifestations may vary , such threats have common characteristic features. The legislator normally reveals substantial and unambiguous information about his interest in controlling me conduct in question and spells out me social stakes that will likely be affected if a change in behavior is not achieved. Also he ordinarily expresses the social desirability of me reform that the threatened legislation is meant to achieve.118 In other words , explicit threats convey the legislator 's unequivocal concern with the negative externalities of a particular conduct and his intention to exercise legislative mandate to remedy me problem.119 By exerting an explicit threat , the legislator publicly commits to pursuing me advocated reform by legislation in the event that tiireat recipients do not comply with his articulated demands.120 </legislation.n.1767><legislation.n.1768>Capacity development of Indigenous communities : Each of the trials has built on local Indigenous initiatives that were already under development to improve service delivery to their communities. For example , processes such as the ATSIC Murdi Paaki Regional Council initiatives of community working parties , the incorporation of the Tharmarrurr Regional Council under local government legislation in the Northern Territory , and the Cape York Partnerships in Queensland were relatively developed when the decision was made to make each of these areas a trial site.

This requires a focus on social policies that can help to meet the different and diverse needs of individuals and to enhance their autonomy and participation so that the person with disabilities is at the centre of service provision. In this context the legislation should also lay out clear duties on public bodies to promote equality and to remove barriers to full participation . </legislation.n.1770><legislation.n.1771>The AMLTF , if enacted , would criminalize terrorist financing.

The draft legislation also provides for the establishment of a Financial Investigation and Prosecution Office wherein law enforcement investigators and prosecutors will work as a team from the beginning of the case to trial. The 2005 draft legislation also addresses asset forfeiture and provides that assets , substitute assets ( without proving the relation to the crime ) and instrumentalities of the crime can be forfeited.

Although the views will be described in stylized form , the overall pattern is not simply hypothetical.

The bill , titled the Afghanistan-Pakistan Security and Prosperity Enhancement Act , is meant to help strengthen democracy in the two countries by creating Reconstruction Opportunity Zones and increasing their ability to export goods to the U.S. - and in return , it only requires that the countries make sure their factories are providing adequate working conditions . </legislation.n.1777><legislation.n.1778>Weiner had brought the handbook in order to make a point. Opponents of health care reform have spent a lot of time complaining about the complexity of health care legislation , in many cases waving around the huge piles of paper it takes to print the full bills. It 's a misleading argument : The bills are long in part because the government uses large type and wide margins to print them. And after the experience of the Bush administration , when the president and his allies frequently made policy without thinking through all of the implications , one could plausibly argue that legislative complexity is actually the product of due diligence. This is one-sixth of the economy we 're talking about , after all . </legislation.n.1778><legislation.n.1779>These three categories involve many corollary and derivative issues and their implementation in practice , in the form of specific legislation , is enormously complex.

Obama heeded the letter writers ' advice and backed the commission. But when the proposal came to a vote on the Senate floor last week , four of the Republican signers -- Crapo , Kay Bailey Hutchison , Texas , Jim Inhofe , Okla. , and Robert Bennett , Utah -- voted no. So did three other Republican senators who had also been co-sponsors of the legislation -- 2008 presidential nominee John McCain , Ariz. , Sam Brownback , Kan. , and John Ensign , Nev.

Elsewhere Colombia was an early implementer with legislation passed in 1888. The current trend seems to have been led by the United States with the passage of the Freedom of Information Act in 1967. This landmark legislation enshrined in law the public 's right of access to federal government records , and may have encouraged other countries including Australia , Canada and New Zealand to develop their own laws ( see Table 1 ) . </legislation.n.1781><legislation.n.1782>An implicit threat is inferred where the actions of legislators signal a legislative threat. In contrast to their explicit counterparts , implicit threats contain no public commitment , nor a contingent plan to enact legislation in the event that firms do not comply. Accordingly , target entities face no demand to modify their conduct , nor are they warned that failure to do so will put them at risk of unfavorable legislation.124 However , a public expression of interest in controlling the conduct in question is not inconsistent with implicit threats . </legislation.n.1782><legislation.n.1783>Congress is now on the verge of passing historic health care reform legislation , which will improve our health care system and make substantial progress toward providing medical coverage for 2.5 million uninsured New Yorkers.

For these reasons the Government is now also strengthening its efforts concerning trafficked children.

Many of those who voted to repeal the rule stated that they were not opposed to having an ergonomics standard , but that they objected to the particular standard that OSHA adopted.229 Labor Secretary Elaine Chao announced that the department would consider a new rule to protect workers from repetitive-motion injuries.230 Others , however , believe that the CRA precludes OSHA from issuing a new ergonomics rule without new legislation specifically authorizing it to do so.231 </legislation.n.1804><legislation.n.1805>Where correction of weak performance is already taking place , businesses and individuals should be made aware of this.

Though thus far only the state of California has enacted anti-affirmative action policies via the UC Board of Regents and Governor Pete Wilson 's brazen political opportunism , several states and the U.S. Congress have proposed legislation that would undo these policies. This is occurring at a time when progressive forces are largely unprepared to mount a counter-offensive.

As a result of the introduction of the NFR , Aruba no longer has an offshore regime ( grandfathered until 2007/2008 ) . As of July 1 , 2003 , the incorporation of low tax offshore NVs was halted.

With the changing job patterns , working relationships , the rise in self-employment , outsourcing of work , etc. there has been a problem in the management of occupational safety and health risks. Nevertheless particular attention needs to be paid to the health and safety of workers in hazardous occupations ' and especially the migrant workers and other vulnerable persons. Work related hazards and occupational diseases in small-scale industries and agriculture are likely to increase as the occupational safety and health services are out of reach in these occupations. However , with increasing Public Interest Litigations ( PILs ) , Proactive legislations and continual struggle by environmental activists , the awareness with respect to occupational health concerns are gaining more ground . </legislation.n.1816><legislation.n.1817>The 'do nothing ' policy option is not a feasible option given that the case against corporate citizenship is weak and based on nave and incorrect assumptions , and it is unlikely that the kind of pressures and forces that have led companies to adopt some of its premises will disappear.

This commission will examine the current legislation that governs rights to annual leave , parental leave and study leave , and present a proposal in autumn 2001 on increasing the influence of workers concerning the timing and other aspects of leave , and on greater flexibility for employers. The commission should also examine what forms a future working time reduction might take , and how it could be implemented.

In consideration of the latter , the discussion underscores the institutional , political , and reputational factors that influence legislative behavior in Congress and , hence , the probability of the threatened legislation.

These were followed in the 1970 ' s by statutes protecting an employee from unfair dismissal [ 7 ] ( as opposed to the common law right to protection from wrongful dismissal ) and from discrimination [ 8 ] . The European Economic Community also emerged as a law making body with an impact in this field. Many additional pieces of legislation have issued over the last thirty years from both the UK Parliament and the European Union leaving many people in the UK with the impression that employment legislation is a confusing jigsaw of piecemeal provisions which are continuing to increase in number and to add to business cost . </legislation.n.1842><legislation.n.1843>Prodebtor lawmakers tended to view the cost of the bankruptcy apparatus as a fatal problem. The prospect of an expanding federal bureaucracy made matters still worse. " In my judgment , " a Texan congressman concluded in 1890 , " the people do not want any more Federal officials over them. " 48 Hostility to federalization was , of course , a familiar theme from southern and western lawmakers in the annals of nineteenth-century lawmaking , dating back to Jefferson 's vision for an agrarian nation and the states ' rights movement often associated with Senator John Calhoun. By the late nineteenth century , the states ' rights perspective was somewhat nuanced. Southern and western lawmakers actively supported federal railroad rate regulation and intervention by the Interstate Commerce Commission , for instance.49 With bankruptcy , however , they had much less sympathy , since federal bankruptcy legislation seemed to favor northeastern commercial interests. The cost and inconvenience of the federal courts exacerbated this concern . </legislation.n.1843><legislation.n.1844>The Right to Information Acts specify the modalities for obtaining information and provide penalties or failing to furnish or supplying false information.

By the early 20th century , however , further legislative modifications and judicial decisions rendered by the United States Supreme Court restricted severely the application of civil rights measures. As a result , individual states controlled the treatment of blacks , with southern states generally the harshest in their abuse of civil rights. The federal government took very little action to enforce civil rights after 1900.

At present , both the SIPA and the FIU remain under-funded and under-resourced. Although progress in implementation and enforcement has been made , BiH should continue to strengthen its institutions , particularly those State-level institutions responsible for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. Significant additional training should be implemented so that law enforcement , prosecutors , and judges will have a better understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing and how to pursue it.

There are a number of problems with the criminal associations provision , not the least of which is that a provision in clause 35 talks about people being reckless in not knowing whether or not a person with whom they are dealing is a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang , a declared organisation , or has a control order against them.

If legislation is inconsistent with the federal policies , then it is possible that such gun control legislation would preempt the local or state laws. However , laws or ordinances that create stronger controls on guns seem to be consistent with the policy behind federal gun control legislation of reducing crime and death in our society , as well as the presumption of the validity of the state use of its police power.

This new piece of legislation will allow the government to keep the child until the extension application is heard . </legislation.n.1931><legislation.n.1932>Human Resource Management in Public Administration - Human Resource Management , associated with Public Administration , is considered to be an in-house structure that insures unbiased treatment , ethical standards , and promotes a value-based system. This section covers five main topics of human resources management in public administration. This section also provides an overview of the human resource function , contributors to human resource development and implementation , pertinent human resources legislation , and the human resource legislation : </legislation.n.1932><legislation.n.1933>We received submissions from the existing Pacific Island Advisory Boards from Manukau , Waitakere , Auckland , and North Shore city councils , and other Pacific organisations , and other ethnic organisations and individuals on this issue. They advocated strongly , firstly for dedicated Mori seats , and then secondly , that the current legislation include the enabling of Pacific and Asian participation in the Auckland Council. Labour believes that the establishment of a new Auckland Council is a prime opportunity to develop a structure that is inclusive of people , and which will reflect the diversity of key sectors , namely Mori , Pacific and Asian people . </legislation.n.1933><legislation.n.1934>Even in the case of legislation that is well organised , it is necessary to ensure that it does not grow to the point where the overall view is lost , a situation that is described as legislative inflation. The more extensive and dense legislation is , the more difficult it becomes to understand and the greater the potential risk that it will include inconsistencies if not outright contradictions , with the result that certain parts of the legislation may become unclear. The legislature must therefore retain an overall view of its work in order to avoid losing control over it. To this end , legislative activity should be restricted to that which is strictly necessary. It is , of course , impossible to quantify an appropriate level of legislative activity in the abstract. The political authorities should be responsible for determining a suitable volume of legislation . </legislation.n.1934><legislation.n.1935>The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 ( IDA ) provides for the settlement machinery above. The framework of this legislation , which is the principle legislation dealing with core labour issues , is of colonial origin. This law originated firstly in the Trade Disputes Act 1929 , introduced by the British , when there was a spate of strikes and huge loss of person days and secondly through Rule 81A of the Defence of India Rules 1942 , when the British joined the war efforts and wanted to maintain wartime supplies to the allied forces. Interestingly the interim government on the eve of formal independence retained this framework by enacting the IDA , which still remains on the statute book . </legislation.n.1935><legislation.n.1936>It is precisely against this backdrop that investor rebellion over a ? 22 million payoff to the poorly performing CEO of GlaxoSmith Kline , and large payments to directors at the telecom company Marconi , notwithstanding the company 's failures , led members of the U.K. Parliament to reckon that increased pay-performance sensitivity is needed. Pushing for reform , MPs directed a clear threat of legislation to public companies that , if enacted , would have required companies to stop rewarding directors who failed to promote their shareholders ' best interests.94 </legislation.n.1936><legislation.n.1937>As we understand the status of this legislation , the House and Senate have a conference committee reconciling the House and Senate bills. We hope the conference committee eliminates all of these provisions. Ultimately , good governance requires an engaged board and good people. No legislation can mandate the group dynamics that lead to a successful organization. Rather than trying to manage from on high , Congress and others entities with legal authority should do a better job of monitoring taxpayer dollars. If an agency fails to accomplish its mission , the grant should not be renewed. If any legislation is necessary , it should be legislation that eliminates appeals and second chances for nonprofits that fail to get the job done when given government funding . </legislation.n.1937><legislation.n.1938>Recognizing these realities , the Global Campaign on Urban Governance proposes to take action on three fronts. First , by exploring the links between international law and the principles of good governance , the Campaign will provide a substantive and legal basis to promote normative debate on the principles of good urban governance. This work will also support the ongoing " Dialogue on Decentralisation " the follow-up activity to the World Charter of Local Self-Government. Second , the work on legislation will support the preparation of national campaigns by examining Government commitments to international and human rights legislation. Third , the Campaign will provide support to countries seeking to revise national , state/provincial or local legislation to provide for more inclusive urban governance . </legislation.n.1938><legislation.n.1939>The first part of the book consists of two chapters that provide introductory information on workplace substance abuse and a review of legislation and legal implications related thereto. The three chapters in part two provide guidelines for establishing substance abuse policies , procedures , and training.

The bill will amend the Liquor Act , the Registered Clubs Act and several other Acts that govern the conduct of gaming in licensed premises , registered clubs and other places.

At this point of the discussion I am content to ask the reader to compare the force it now exerts in politics with that of the interest of individuals and parties in capturing and retaining office and power , with that exercised by the propaganda of publicity agents and that of organized pressure groups . </legislation.n.1942><legislation.n.1943>Obviously I think that people who commit violence against pregnant women should be punished. But I have to say , it really pisses me off that the anti-choice folks think they can be so frigging blatant in legislation like this , all the while claiming that abortion has nothing to do with it. This law is straight up saying that a fetus has the same rights as a woman. And we ' re supposed to buy that this isn ' t a choice issue ? Puh-leeze . </legislation.n.1943><legislation.n.1944>Due to the new rules established to allow the carry over of legislation from the first to the second year of a term of the General Court , legislation must be filed in either the House or Senate Clerk 's prior to five o'clock on the second Wednesday of January of the first annual session of the General Court . Legislation filed subsequent to the filing deadline would thus be subject to Joint Rule 12 and would require approval by the committees on Rules of the Two Branches. Only matters filed by the Governor and matters that have local approval of a city or town would be exempt from the joint rule provision . </legislation.n.1944><legislation.n.1945>( from Cornell University , Catherwood Library , resources and internet links on disability , workers ' compensation , ADA , disability mailing lists , legislation for the disabled , job hunting , etc. ) Federal Workers Compensation Statutes </legislation.n.1945><legislation.n.1946>About 30 countries have implemented some type of personal account system as a component of their mandatory retirement insurance program.

The methods are multiple , where people targeted by electronic attack are either tortured to manipulate their will , or that they are recruited after such torturous abuse to join such a group , or that the groups using such devices recruit from various sources of government agencies ironically using loopholes in government legislation , where such legislation has its roots in being formulated by moles who have infiltrated our policy making bodies. There is evidence that Atta the 911 terrorist leader was instigated in part through the use of such weapons , and had some connection to US interests . </legislation.n.1948><legislation.n.1949>After criticizing H. R. 7152 in March , Dirksen began to work more closely in late spring with Humphrey and the civil rights forces to fashion a strategy that would secure passage of the bill. Dirksen organized Republican support for the bill by designating a floor captain for each of the bill 's seven sections. He and the bipartisan leaders believed that five or six " swing " votes held the key to cloture and the end of debate. Almost all of these uncommitted senators were conservative Republicans from rural states without racial difficulties. Their constituents opposed the legislation because it involved expanded federal powers. The problem facing the leadership was how to enlist the support of these uncommitted senators . </legislation.n.1949><legislation.n.1950>Notice that on the account of the distinction between the institutional and the individual levels of just/unjust actions and relations , if a role occupant ( acting qua role occupant ) treats some non-role occupant unjustly then this is , nevertheless , an injustice at the institutional level.

Less than two years after it went into effect , President Tyler ( who had assumed the presidency after President Harrison died ) signed the repeal legislation and the 1841 act was gone. Just as the initial vote papered over a variety of strident dissenting views , the repeal illustrated just how quickly a majority coalition can collapse when lawmakers ' underlying preferences are unstable . </legislation.n.1952><legislation.n.1953>But Mr. Graham , in a statement , said he had told Mr. Obama in no uncertain terms that the immigration debate could come to a halt for the year if the president moved to pass health care legislation by a method known as reconciliation , which requires a majority of 51 senators instead of 60 and would in practice require no Republican votes . </legislation.n.1953><legislation.n.1954>The case comes at a time when gay groups have suffered several setbacks , including the defeat of same-sex marriage legislation in New York and New Jersey and a vote last fall that overturned such unions in Maine.

Or policymakers could decide that once Social Security legislation is enacted , other uses of unified budget surpluses are acceptable. The Administration is proposing that no use be made of the projected surpluses until this decision can be made in the context of Social Security legislation or after such legislation becomes law . </legislation.n.1956><legislation.n.1957>" Congressman Tanner and his 47 House colleagues who are cosponsoring his legislation deserve a round of applause for proposing one major remedy for the anemic political lifeblood of the nation , " Sepp concluded. " Taxpayers should welcome more competitive elections as their chance to take back the government that once listened to them instead of special interests. " </legislation.n.1957><legislation.n.1958>The Seanad ( Senate ) plays only a minor role in legislation; at best , it can only delay the passage of Dail bills. It was designed to provide a forum for various interest groups and be a counter balance to the partisan politics of the Dail. For this reason , elections to the Senate involve a complicated process. Six senators are elected by Irish graduates of national universities. Forty-three are elected by members of parliament and local government representatives ( themselves elected by popular vote ); the candidates are nominated by bodies representing five groups of interests ( education and culture , agriculture , industry and commerce , labor , and public administration and social services ) as well as by parliament. Finally , eleven are nominated by the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister ) , partly to ensure that the government of the day has a majority in the Senate . </legislation.n.1958><legislation.n.1959>Since the State of the Union address , there has been some confusion over how projected budget surpluses can be used to shore up Social Security and just what President Clinton has proposed. The Administration has sought to clarify that its position is that none of the surplus should be used for tax cuts or spending increases at least until comprehensive legislation is enacted that addresses Social Security financing needs on a long-term basis . </legislation.n.1959><legislation.n.1960>Oregon 's same-sex marriage legislative activity.

If the legislature has concluded its yearly session , and the governor does not sign the bill within ten days , it dies. This is referred to as a " pocket veto. " This ten-day period includes Sundays and holidays , even if they fall on the tenth day , and it begins the day after the legislation is laid on the governor 's desk . </legislation.n.1966><legislation.n.1967>This is not an argument lest the argument be misunderstood for extending TADA or TADA-like legislation to mainstream crime too. Policemen for one would be only too happy to read it that way. Procedural fairness and justice in action are non-negotiable elements of criminal investigation and trial procedure. There is no other way that the law can ensure that the innocent will never bear the cross. If this reduces the efficacy of the criminal justice system , then so be it. It only means that criminal justice can reach thus far and no farther. The rest of the distance in crime prevention is to be traversed by social , political and moral efforts. If they too can not do the full job , then the residue is to be borne by all of us as the disorder inherent in human social existence , human nature as expressed in organised social existence . </legislation.n.1967><legislation.n.1968>In the course of her political tenure , a legislator may develop and maintain a solid reputation for promoting consistent policies; for taking a tough stance on defined policy issues , including the one presently in question; for advancing specific causes; and for being of high integrity , namely by keeping her word and promises. A legislator 's good reputation credibly commits her to exercising the threatened legislation if the firm does not comply and , conversely , to foregoing enactment if her demands are duly met. Offering a similar observation , Gordon Tullock has insightfully noted , albeit in a different context , that " politicians may sometimes have to enact legislation . . . just as the Cosa Nostra occasionally burns down the buildings of those who fail to pay its protection levies. " Mindful of a legislator 's reputation , a firm is led to believe that a legislative threat is credible. Ultimately , a firm will comply with a legislator 's demands because , given the threat 's credibility , compliance will maximize its utility and thus becomes the rational and prudent strategic choice.264 </legislation.n.1968><legislation.n.1969>Public administration is carried out by public servants who work in public departments and agencies , at all levels of government , and perform a wide range of tasks. Public administrators collect and analyze data ( statistics ) , monitor budgets , draft legislation , develop policy , and execute legally mandated government activities. Public administrators serve in many roles : ranging from " front-line " positions serving the public ( e.g. , peace officers , parole officers , border guards ); administrators ( e.g. , auditors ); analysts ( e.g. , policy analysts ); and managers and executives of government branches and agencies . </legislation.n.1969><legislation.n.1970>These groups ( and others ) are recognised as being at risk of a digital divide - not being able to access electronic services , and not having digital literacy skills or motivation. Accessibility is being addressed to a certain extent through web accessibility standards , or legislation such as Disability Discrimination Act ( DDA ) . However , there are serious gaps in understanding the diverse needs of citizens and how to make e-government inclusive. Digital inclusion is core to this . </legislation.n.1970><legislation.n.1971>Under s.42 of the Family Law Act 1996 , non-molestation orders reproduce and extend the previous powers of the courts to make orders prohibiting a person ( the respondent ) from molesting another person associated with him or any relevant child. The term molestation is perhaps unfortunate as it tends to denote sexual molestation and can be confusing to potential applicants or respondents. However , as under previous legislation , an order prohibiting molestation can include both general or particular acts of molestation , none of which need be overtly 'violent ' , and can be used to order someone to stop using or threatening violence against ( usually ) a woman or a relevant child , or to stop intimidating , harassing , or pestering them. It can also have very specific instructions in it to suit a particular case - for example , it could order an ex-partner to stop telephoning or pestering the applicant at work . </legislation.n.1971><legislation.n.1972>In 1996 Congress passed legislation designed to make health insurance more available to working families and their children. The law expanded access to health insurance for workers who lose their jobs or who apply for insurance with a pre-existing medical condition , and it set up a pilot program of tax-deferred savings accounts for use in paying medical bills. President George W. Bush has proposed several ideas to make health care coverage more available and affordable , including the expansion of medical savings accounts and legislation that would make it easier for small employers to pool together to offer their employees better health coverage options . </legislation.n.1972><legislation.n.1973>It may be a stringent requirement for SMEs to observe the future legislation if they have to revise their practices all by their own. Thus the government should provide tangible assistance to SMEs , such as workshops , guidelines , and translation services and the like . </legislation.n.1973><legislation.n.1974>But , so what ? The abuse continues. Before we can make major corrections we have to center our efforts on those who are really responsible for the many abusive government intrusions. Elected officials ? Not really. These days they are just mechanisms who put their final sanction on whatever legislation they are instructed to support in order to replace the Constitution with a WORld Management System ( WORMS ) . Very few , if any , politicians write the legislation that gives away our freedom and our sovereignty. In fact , very few even read the legislation . </legislation.n.1974><legislation.n.1975>In addition to providing shareholders with a nonbinding approval vote over executive compensation and golden parachutes , this bill would direct federal agencies to establish regulations requiring certain financial institutions to disclose the structure of their incentive-based compensation arrangements to determine whether such arrangements encourage inappropriate risk. This bill would also prohibit covered financial institutions from rewarding their executives and corporate officers with compensation structures that encourage risky behavior. Moreover , if enacted into law , this legislation would require the members of public company compensation committees to be independent , and would establish authority for such committees to use independent consultants and counsel. While it took only ten days from the date of introduction for this bill to clear the House , it will face a more difficult path in the Senate , where many have voiced concern that the measure would allow the government to unnecessarily intrude on private business operations . </legislation.n.1975><legislation.n.1976>WHEREAS the Honorable Allan Rock stated " This legislation will help us preserve the peaceful character of Canadian society and help police fight crime and violence.

The contribution to better tax policy and better tax law are key elements of Treasury ' s role as a central policy agency . </legislation.n.1979><legislation.n.1980>The report delineates critical constraints which new policies should take into account. These are : the low status of government communicators , a tradition of inflexible and inward-looking bureaucracy , a high level of concentration of media ownership , a journalism profession impoverished by Apartheid , obsolete media legislation and finally , the reality of severe resource constraints on government . </legislation.n.1980><legislation.n.1981>The Government has sufficient institutional support to draft bills , primarily through the ministerial departments set up for codification.

In November 2001 , the GOB amended its financial crimes legislation to shift the burden of proof to the accused to demonstrate that property in his or her possession or control is derived from a legitimate source. Absent such proof , the presumption is that such property was derived from the proceeds of crime. The law also enhances the GOB ? s ability to freeze bank accounts and to prohibit transactions from suspect accounts . </legislation.n.1982><legislation.n.1983>Another important piece of legislation is the Employment Rights ( Dispute Resolution ) Act 1998 , the provisions of which are likely to come into force in early 1999. In addition to renaming industrial tribunals as employment tribunals , the Act provides for : the appointment of legal officers to hear interlocutory matters; expanding the definition of those who can make a compromise agreement from lawyers to " relevant independent advisers "; employers and employees to refer their disputes to a binding arbitration scheme set up by the Advisor , Conciliation and Arbitration Service ( ACAS ) . In addition , a wider use of " dismissal procedures agreements " is likely to curb the ability of employees to claim unfair dismissal in the same vein as section 110 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Instead , the agreement will specify its own dispute resolution , such as arbitration. It also encourages employer and employee to make more use of internal appeal procedures and penalises them for not doing so . </legislation.n.1983><legislation.n.1984>When dealing with employee misconduct , companies must keep careful mind of the legislative and common law legal framework that governs the employment relationship.

One study estimates that the legislation will add $ 139 billion to the coffers of US drug makers over the next eight years.

CalSTRS has taken an active role in opposing mandatory Social Security in the past and will continue to do so in the future. In addition , CalSTRS will continue to monitor legislation that modifies or eliminates the offset provisions. Although legislation is introduced consistently to either modify the offset provisions or completely eliminate them , CalSTRS is considering alternatives that could make these provisions more acceptable . </legislation.n.1987><legislation.n.1988>This course is intended to familiarize the student with the basic principles of accounting and their connection to the law. Included is a study of appropriate accounting concepts from both a practical and a theoretical perspective. Of necessity will be a review of the statements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board , the Opinions of the Accounting Principles Board and the official pronouncements of any other organization deemed appropriate. The student will also be asked to review pertinent cases affecting the ultimate accounting as well as legislation affecting the profession. Due to the problems discovered during the relatively recent accounting and management scandals a major emphasis will be placed on the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and other statutes and regulations affecting the accounting industry . </legislation.n.1988><legislation.n.1989>With the drastic increase in and awareness of crime , it seems that more and more cities are enacting restrictive gun control ordinances , including assault weapon bans. [ 140 ] When the state 's highest court endorses such action , the cities and counties of the state will only be encouraged to enact more legislation if a city council decides that such is the answer to crime. In Ohio , Arnold has essentially paved the way for all other cities in Ohio to enact such legislation. So long as the ordinance is a reasonable exercise of the municipality 's police power , the ordinance is constitutional and not in violation of article I , section 4 of the Ohio Constitution , the Ohio " right to bear arms " provision.

While Americans are n't quite as crazy as the leadership of the anti-abortion movement , they do n't exactly favor the kind of broad abortion rights that many of us believe women are entitled to . </legislation.n.1990><legislation.n.1991>The second strategy will involve the fostering and encouraging of gaming industry initiatives. Those involved in the gaming and wagering industries will need to accept greater responsibility to contribute to the harm minimisation program. The third strategy will ensure that appropriately tailored regulatory controls are put in place by the Government. Those controls are contained mostly in legislation and licence conditions , and focus on matters such as limiting access to commercial gaming and wagering . </legislation.n.1991><legislation.n.1992>11. Governments have responded to the increasing complexity and hazards of modern society by legislating to oblige people to take safety measures. In particular , many laws govern safety at the workplace. In most cases legislation provides for a fine or other penalty when someone fails to perform a statutory duty . </legislation.n.1992><legislation.n.1993>The Article borrows tools and insights from the field of game theory to model the strategic interaction between legislators and target firms as a noncooperative game. This model yields clear and insightful predictions regarding the inducement effect of legislative threats-namely , the capacity of legislative threats to induce target entities to modify their behavior so as to avert the risk and consequences of the threatened legislation. The inducement effect , it is shown , depends on : ( i ) the credibility condition-namely , whether threat recipients believe that the threat is credible or , rather , mere " cheap talk "; and ( ii ) the effectiveness condition-that is , whether the perceived probability that the threatened legislation will be enacted into law is sufficiently high. The analysis also demonstrates how legislators ' commitments , reputation , and motivations affect the credibility of threats and , consequently , their inducement effect on the conduct of target firms.HEADNOTE </legislation.n.1993><legislation.n.1994>the traditional public policy approach of legislation and regulation. Several governments already follow this option , which is the preferred approach of non-governmental organisations. Much proposed and existing legislation in this area relates to mandatory social and environmental reporting for publicly listed companies. In Australia , the Democrats are pursuing legislation to regulate the activities of some Australian companies engaged in offshore operations with respect to human rights , the environment and labour standards. The Democrats aim to reintroduce to the Senate a revised version of their defeated Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000 , which requires companies employing more than 100 people in offshore operations to report in Australia how they complied with a range of standards in the above areas . </legislation.n.1994><legislation.n.1995>As the Bill will make changes to existing councils ' planning decisions in June 2010 , it must be passed by the end of May.

It considers what can be inferred from the sparse constitutional text and from the structure of government it erects , the most distinctive feature of which is the separation of powers. Part II then discusses how the first Congress , which included many of the Constitution 's Framers , addressed questions concerning the president 's authority over agencies when it enacted legislation establishing them. Part III reviews historical practices , including the history of presidential efforts to influence rulemaking and attempts by Congress and the judiciary to counter such influence. It examines congressional efforts to vest power in agency heads and to limit the president 's authority to remove them. It also discusses presidential efforts to assert greater management authority over executive agencies , including the regulatory review programs employed by every president since Richard Nixon. Part IV then explores policy considerations that counsel against giving the president authority to dictate decisions entrusted by statute to executive officers . </legislation.n.1996><legislation.n.1997>Much of the action happened on the Senate and House floors , but tremendous efforts were also made to mobilize community and media support. The National Organizations Responding to AIDS , a coalition convened by the AIDS Action Council , worked to sign on co-sponsors , reach out to the media , and bring activists to Washington , DC. Among the results of those efforts were editorials favoring legislation and a sit-in in the Senate gallery urging swift action on the bill.4 </legislation.n.1997><legislation.n.1998>Given the lack of a detailed and clear outline of the proposed legislation the public consultation exercise was severely hampered. The consultation document was vague , unclear and contained misleading and inaccurate references to other state and international legislation . </legislation.n.1998><legislation.n.1999>If legislation is to be implemented effectively , then it must be straightforward for those affected by legislation to be able to comply with it. Too much legislation , and too many changes in legislation , can reduce the likelihood that those affected by legislation will be able to comply easily , however . </legislation.n.1999><legislation.n.2000>On the issue of preemption of state privacy laws , Sen. James Jeffords ( R-VT ) , Chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee , has proposed " grand fathering " existing state laws that are stronger than those set in the Federal legislation , but would not allow states to pass more restrictive laws after the date of enactment of the proposed Federal law. Consumer advocates , including ANA , are concerned that such an inflexible preemption would not allow states to act in a public health emergency to meet privacy needs that could arise . </legislation.n.2000><legislation.n.2001>Contains bulletins; statutes and rules; employer , worker and insurer forms; process overview; notices; publications; database of employer coverage; information about dispute resolution self-insurance for employers.

It is currently estimated by the Social Security trustees that in 2018 the fund will begin running deficits that will become larger and larger each year. The plan was to supplement the insufficient payroll tax revenue for 2018 and the years that follow by dipping into the large reserve that was built up during all those years of surpluses ( 1983-2018 ) which was specificially earmarked by the 1983 legislation for the funding of the retirement of the baby boomers . </legislation.n.2003><legislation.n.2004>In 1999 , former Senator Frank Lautenberg ( D-NJ ) added an amendment to a juvenile justice bill that would have closed the gun show loophole and mandated a 3 business day background check for prospective buyers. The amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 51-50 , with then-Vice-President Al Gore breaking the tie. In the House , Representative Carolyn McCarthy ( D-NY ) , whose husband was killed by Colin Ferguson during the 1993 Long Island Railroad shooting , sponsored a companion bill in the House that was defeated. On the same day , Representative John Dingell ( D-MI ) sponsored a watered-down version ( mandating a 24-hour background check at gun shows ) supported by the National Rifle Association , and this measure passed. Efforts to resolve the differences between the House and Senate Juvenile Justice bills in Conference Committee stalled , and legislation aimed at closing the gun show loophole did not pass in the 106th Congress . </legislation.n.2004><legislation.n.2005>The essays are organized into four sections , titled " Reviving the Common Law , " " The Environment under the Common Law , " " The Institutions of the Common Law , " and " Perspectives on the Shift away from the Common Law. " In the first section , David Shoenbrod takes the current administrative regime to task and argues for a revival of common law principles within local legislation . </legislation.n.2005><legislation.n.2006>Even before civil rights legislation came up for consideration in 1964 , the Senate set the stage for a lengthy civil rights debate when it considered changing the Senate rule governing the shutting off filibusters. The filibuster permitted one or more senators to speak on any subject without a time limit. In contrast to the House where debate is limited , Senate Rule XXII stated that the only way to limit debate was for two-thirds of the senators present and voting* to vote for cloture. Cloture ends debate and makes it possible to vote on a bill. Senate liberals who anticipated a filibuster by opponents of civil rights wanted to make it easier to shut off debate by decreasing the number of votes needed to end debate. The Senate , however , refused to change Rule XXII on January 31 by a 53 to 42 vote. This set the stage for the impending Senate consideration of the House passed version of the civil rights bill by making it possible for a minority of senators to block action with a filibuster . </legislation.n.2006><legislation.n.2007>Even if legislation does not specifically address every whistle-blower , courts throughout the country have given them rights as a matter of public policy. However , it must concern a violation of a statute or constitutional provision of fundamental importance to society in general. For example , it is illegal as a matter of public policy to fire an employee for refusing to lie in a court proceeding . </legislation.n.2007><legislation.n.2008>The Democracy and Governance ( D &amp;G ) research programme evaluates the legislation , policies and administration of the government in terms of its ability to reduce inequality and poverty. It also explores public institutions in their relation to the political economy as a way of understanding what obstructs or contributes to democratic consolidation in South Africa. The research model is informed by the idea that good policy and political debate are dependent on high-quality research , including research that is theoretical and historical. This speaks to the nature of the State , and the South African State in particular. It poses questions such as : How does the government understand the form of the State and its capacity to effect change ? How does this correspond with the way the State is understood by other political and social actors ? And are we in a position to say something about the South African State as it really is ? </legislation.n.2008><legislation.n.2009>NALC is aggressively working to support passage of S. 1507 , a bill introduced by Sen. Tom Carper earlier this week , that will provide short-term relief to the Postal Service by restructuring its payments for future retiree health benefits. The legislation was developed by the Obama administration ' s Office of Management and Budget and is designed to achieve virtually the same level of relief provided by H.R. 22 , a bill that has advanced to the floor of the House of Representatives. In addition to reducing pre-funding payments by some $ 6.4 billion over the next five years , the bill also makes it easier for the Postal Service to borrow money during the current economic crisis . </legislation.n.2009><legislation.n.2010>... Critics say the bill offers confusing and unnecessary changes to a law that has been in place for years. The bill 's sponsor , Rep. Richard Byrd , R-Kirkwood , said the legislation offers a needed fix to a child abuse reporting law that has recently been contested in court . </legislation.n.2010><legislation.n.2011>The report of the National Human Rights Consultation ( the Brennan report ) , released on 8 October 2009 , reported ' strong support for the development of a human rights culture in the public sector ' and that ' it was felt that this would lead to better integration of human rights in the development of legislation of policy , in administrative decision making , and in service delivery ' . [ 3 ] </legislation.n.2011><legislation.n.2012>Welfare reform , like civil rights legislation before it , is merely one example among many. Campaign finance reform , health care , environmental policies , debates about vouchers and charter schools -- all of these contentious and contemporary debates center around distinctively American values. Indeed , it is hard to think of a debate that does not involve , at its core , moral questions. Even the most arcane appropriations battle turns on deciding how much we are willing to pay for some social good and how much we want it relative to other social goods. In every case , there is no reason to assume that some speedy and mutually agreeable resolution is on the horizon. But if such a resolution were to come to pass , it could lead to a better understanding and appreciation of the principles that informed the debate in the first place. And that means it is also possible that , in King 's language , such changes could positively affect the moral habits of all Americans . </legislation.n.2012><legislation.n.2013>Adequate resources will be provided for training to alleviate the current shortage of doctors and emphasis will be given to geriatric and psychiatric expertise in primary health care. Resources must also be provided for training immigrant physicians in linguistic and professional skills. The Government together with labour market organizations and other interested parties will seek ways to keep doctors in the public health sector after they have qualified. Legislation will be prepared by the three aforesaid parties to reduce the need for doctors to issue medical certificates for short periods of sick leave . </legislation.n.2013><legislation.n.2014>This infusion of art and environmental consciousness is one of Lin ' s trademarks. Growing up in Athens , Ohio during the 1970s , she was exposed to environmental issues at an early age. In 1969 , the Cuyahoga River , located in Ohio , caught on fire as a result of its heavily polluted waters. This initiated a massive public response , making Ohio the focal point of national environmental awareness and legislation that would follow. In addition to her artistic pursuits , Lin also sits on the board of the Natural Resources Defense Council . </legislation.n.2014><legislation.n.2015>Once you 've got your safety and health policy written , it 's important to keep up on changes in your workplace that may include new hazards and safety risks.

While she couldn ' t get this legislation passed in the previous Congress , she has been successful with getting two other bills passed. One protects women from being harassed on federal property including museums and national parks , and the other encourages breast-feeding under a federal nutrition program for poor women . </legislation.n.2017><legislation.n.2018>On Wednesday , a Senate filibuster blocked legislation to overturn the Supreme Court holding in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp;Rubber Co. ( 2007 ) 550 U.S. __. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama each took time away from the campaign trail to speak in favor of the bill , but John McCain stayed away , expressing satisfaction over the bill 's failure . </legislation.n.2018><legislation.n.2019>But for domestic violence victims , who are not threatened by an " intruder , " the courts are less lenient. And as I read it , this legislation could prevent some domestic violence victims from going to prison for killing their abusers in self defense , if they have a protective order . </legislation.n.2019><legislation.n.2020>08/30/09 : The Washington Times has an editorial discussing the US Coast Guard 's recently issued anti-piracy guidelines , requiring vessels to submit plans for combating terrorism and piracy. However , those guidelines , allowing ships to carry arms onboard , still have to go through an arduous legislative process. The Times argues that , as piracy continues to escalate in 2009 , Congress needs to act swiftly to clarify legislation allowing US-flag merchant ships and their American crews to arm their ships . </legislation.n.2020><legislation.n.2021>In California , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year , stating that existing workplace injury standards are sufficient. But several other states are currently working to pass legislation similar to the new Texas law . </legislation.n.2021><legislation.n.2022>Obviously , harmonizing the attitudes , structures and processes of government with the aspirations and needs of its urban citizens would not be enough. Such change will not necessarily or automatically lead to good human progress unless operationally-dynamic administrative mechanisms and legally valid checks &amp;balances are in place to ensure that the peoples ' aspirations are met through ( a ) productive facilitation of opportunities and ( b ) unimpeded enforcement of policies and legislation that such systems promulgate. In doing so , care must also be taken to ensure that their results will contribute to build a society that upholds justice , equity and peace. In the final reckoning , governance must not only appear to be effective but should also be measurably effective . </legislation.n.2022><legislation.n.2023>A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution , much as legislative bodies are. In most countries judges may only interpret the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries , where matters are not constitutional , the judiciary may also create law under the doctrine of precedent. The UK , Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of parliamentary sovereignty , whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature. [ 150 ] In communist states , such as China , the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive , or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary. [ 151 ] In Muslim countries , courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia : the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt may invalidate such laws , [ 152 ] and in Iran the Guardian Council ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the " criteria of Islam " .

The most important rights of the committees pursuant to the Constitution , the Legislation Act and provisions of the Standing Orders can be summarised as follows : </legislation.n.2025><legislation.n.2026>Over the last several years our courts have begun to develop a legal remedy for bullied/harassed workers under the umbrella of constructive dismissal. While historically workers were protected from harassment that could be linked to the prohibited grounds of discrimination under the human rights legislation there was really no remedy for employees who were subject to general harassment. This started to change as early decisions began to carve out protection for employees based on constructive dismissal principles and finding that it was a fundamental implied term of any employment relationship that employers treat employees with civility , decency , respect and dignity . </legislation.n.2026><legislation.n.2027>Each European country operates a distinct system of labour legislation and judicial enforcement. This is often closely linked to the process of collective bargaining and social partner consultation arrangements. Set out below are brief introductions to the framework of labour laws in a number of European countries followed by examples of primary legislation in English . </legislation.n.2027><legislation.n.2028>Second , on the burden . When we get it right , European legislation is an exercise in cutting red tape. One patent instead of twenty-five; one trademark and registration form and fee instead of twenty-five; one administrative document for our lorries at frontiers instead of the forty-something there used to be; one single set of standards for the single market instead of having to adapt production lines to twenty-five divergent ones . </legislation.n.2028><legislation.n.2029>This booklet is a general guide to the legislation only. It does not describe solutions or approaches for particular industries or hazards - information on which may be found in industry-specific regulations , codes of practice , or guidelines . </legislation.n.2029><legislation.n.2030>In an attempt to crack down on cyberbullying and online harassment , Texas lawmakers have passed legislation that would " make it a felony to create phony profiles on social networking sites with the intent to " harm , defraud , intimidate , or threaten " others. " </legislation.n.2030><legislation.n.2031>To create the conditions for promoting sustainable participation , governments must create and adapt basic legislation and institutions that guarantee political and economic freedoms as well as strive to meet a broader range of basic human needs ( BHN : food , housing , health and medical care , education , etc. ) . Governments also need to relax regulations in order to remove obstacles to economic participation , improve financial management , build infrastructure , and train business people and entrepreneurs. These are important components of good governance ( discussed below ) , which is the basis of participatory development . </legislation.n.2031><legislation.n.2032>Australia criminalized money laundering related to serious crimes with the enactment of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. This legislation also contained provisions to assist investigations and prosecution in the form of production orders , search warrants , and monitoring orders. It was superseded by two acts that came into force on January 1 , 2003 ( although proceedings that began prior to that date under the 1987 law will continue under that law ) . The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 provides for civil forfeiture of proceeds of crime as well as for continuing and strengthening the existing conviction-based forfeiture scheme that was in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 also enables freezing and confiscation of property used in , intended to be used in , or derived from , terrorism offenses. It is intended to implement obligations under the UN International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and resolutions of the UN Security Council relevant to the seizure of terrorism-related property. The Act also provides for forfeiture of literary proceeds where these have been derived by a person from commercial exploitation by the person of notoriety gained from committing a criminal offense . </legislation.n.2032><legislation.n.2033>Social Security legislation may itself ultimately address the question of whether and how to use the surplus to bolster Social Security. For example , the federal government could take the surpluses in the unified budget and appropriate them to an entity with the independence of the Federal Reserve Board , which in turn could invest these funds in the private market and subsequently redeem the investment instruments on an as-needed basis to provide resources to the Social Security trust funds. A recent Washington Post article cites former CBO director Robert Reischauer as mentioning such an option . </legislation.n.2033><legislation.n.2034>Categories : Climate Change , Comedy , Culture , Development , Energy , Entertainment , Environment , Environmental Disaster , Environmentalism , Government , Green , Law , Legislation , Natural Disaster , Nature , Policy , Politics , Pollution , Regulation , Research , Science , Society , Sustainability , Video , Weather , Wildfires Tags : Anthropogenic Global Warming , BIll Maher , Carbon , Carbon Dioxide , Carbon Emissions , Carbon Sequestration , Climate Change , Climate Change Disbelievers , Climate Change Dissenters , Climate Change Models , Climate Change Skeptics , Climate Crisis , Climate Model , Climate Models , Climate Talks , Copenhagen , Global Warming , Global Warming Disbelievers , James M.

It is not OK , but we can agree that these assumptions are prevalent. So if that is the case , and we have politicians that want to classify pregnant women as " disabled " these same misconceptions apply on some level. There is then the belief that pregnant women are unable to take care of themselves , make choices for themselves , etc. Is the answer for society 's mistreatment of both differently-abled people and pregnant women legislation that will classify women as " temporarily disabled ? " </legislation.n.2039><legislation.n.2040>Article 684 of Ethiopia ? s new Criminal Code , approved in May 2005 , criminalizes money laundering. Under Article 684 ( 1 ) , an offender could be criminally liable either for both the predicate acts and money laundering offenses or for the principal criminal act. A violation under Article 684 ( 1 ) is punishable with five to fifteen years imprisonment and a fine not exceeding the equivalent of $ 11 , 560. The Central Bank has drafted separate anti-money laundering legislation , with includes a provision mandating the establishment of a Financial Intelligence Unit ( FIU ) . This legislation is currently being reviewed by relevant government agencies. In conjunction with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , the Government of Ethiopia is working on the development of a country strategy to help Ethiopia better respond to financial crimes. The plan includes the identification of training and capacity-building activities needed by the Ethiopian authorities , including judges and prosecutors . </legislation.n.2040><legislation.n.2041>Whom do legislators seek to protect when they draft employment legislation ? What is the particular vice that the ESSC is seeking to remove when contemplating the introduction of new employment legislation ? It is admirable to want to create a harmonious , co-operative and flexible environment in the workplace whilst at the same time effectively employing the Island ' s manpower. But what is actually needed to achieve this ? The implementation of legislation will cost money , both to employers who will incur additional administrative costs , and to government by way of law drafting time and enforcement measures. The President of the Policy and Resources Committee made it clear in the Minimum Wage debate that the introduction of the minimum wage would be subject to the usual prioritisation processes with regard to both law drafting time and manpower resources. It is suggested that employment legislation will be treated in the same way . </legislation.n.2041><legislation.n.2042>The Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913 was a landmark in historic landscape legislation not so much for what it did but in how it did it. It was , in comparison with previous Acts , long and adopted a style that was both more detailed and technical. A complicating factor was that it used some old terms in new ways before it redefined them , principally " Monument " and " Ancient Monument . </legislation.n.2042><legislation.n.2043>New Zealand legislation does not distinguish between different types of storage or communications media and is fully applicable to any material stored on computers or in magnetic or optical forms.

Firms ' interests are said to be identical when their expected payoff in the game is the same. Specifically , when firms are similarly situated - including , for example , when market power is equally distributed , when firms are of similar size , when firms have similar manufacturing capacity , or when firms are equally competitive - no payoff variability exists. It follows that if compliance qualifies as the firm 's best response strategy , it logically also constitutes the best response strategy of the group as a whole. When interests are identical , avoiding unfavorable legislation is equally beneficial to every member in the group . </legislation.n.2046><legislation.n.2047>Among the many factors that may reduce the clarity of legislation , debate in the legislature over a drafted bill undoubtedly takes first place.

India is a signatory to the ESCAP Resolution. The Resolution laid emphasis on enactment of legislation aimed at equal opportunities for people with disabilities , protection of their rights and prohibition of abuse and neglect of these persons and discrimination against them. Under article 253 of the Constitution of India , Parliament can enact a law even in respect of a subject of State List in order to give effect to international conference.

It would be hard to weaken and water down this bill any more than it has been during the past 8 years it has been under consideration in the Congress. Every time this legislation has been brought forward to the floor , we have pared away more and more of the protections this bill would provide workers in order to make it more palatable to more Members of this body. Most businesses are not even covered by this bill any more. Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees are now completely exempted. This bill will have no effect at all on 95 percent of the businesses and 44 percent of the employees in this country. The sponsors of the bill have also dramatically reduced the amount of leave that would be available to employees. When we started this process we were talking about providing 18 weeks of family leave and 26 weeks of disability leave. What we 're down to now is a total of just 12 weeks of leave for any reason . </legislation.n.2057><legislation.n.2058>The Government of Bermuda should continue its efforts to update its financial services legislation relating to anti-money laundering and counterterrorism.

Hence , credibility is a necessary albeit insufficient condition for inducing a firm to comply with a legislator 's demands.

Running parallel to that request was the belief held by the ESSC that Jersey ' s employment laws were out of date , fragmented and ineffective. Whilst legislation establishing sound and internationally recognised controls upon the finance industry is readily forthcoming there is , in comparison to many other countries , little legislation to protect either the employer or the employee in the workplace itself.

In view of the fact that this banking legislation can be used to introduce an even more totalitarian state of affairs than we already suffer from in this country , it is essential that the Australian people clearly understand that social crediters advocate financial principles which are fundamentally opposed to those put forward by the Labor Party. Mr. Lazzarini stated during the Banking Bill debates that no one on his side of the house advocated Social Credit. Senator Grant , Labor Senator for New South Wales , put the matter even more clearly : " The Bill and what it stands for are the exact antithesis of what the Douglas Credit propagandists advocate ... .

As the school governance referendum is to amend the District Charter , the public can essentially be viewed as the legislative body and thus those employees who would normally lobby the Council could lobby the public. Employees whose authorized duties involve lobbying the legislative body include the Mayor and his cabinet , agency heads , and may include certain high level employees of such offices as the Communications Office of the Mayor , the Office of Policy and Evaluation , and the Office of Intergovernmental Relations. In addition , the heads of independent agencies such as the D.C. Public Schools , and boards such as the Board of Education , are authorized to lobby as part of their normal job duties. We suggest that the Director of these offices review their statutory or administrative authority to confirm that lobbying for legislation is an authorized function . </legislation.n.2078><legislation.n.2079>The dramatic transition from episodic bankruptcy to a permanent law in 1898 poses an obvious puzzle : what was the magic of the 1898 act ? Why did the instability finally stop ? To answer this question , we must briefly go back to the beginning , to the decades of debate that preceded the act. A common theme running through the bankruptcy debates was party politics. Throughout the nineteenth century , Democrats and their predecessors often resisted federal bankruptcy legislation , whereas Republicans and their predecessors were its most fervent advocates.3 Viewing the debates as a conflict between Democrats and Republicans only begins to explain why Congress could not reach a stable resolution , however. Within each party , for instance , lawmakers often held strikingly different views of bankruptcy -- Republicans in the commercial Northeast were far more enthusiastic about bankruptcy legislation than their southern and western colleagues , and roughly the reverse held true for the Democratic opposition. Adding to the confusion was the fact that the legislators faced a series of options on the bankruptcy issue. Rather than just favoring or opposing bankruptcy , lawmakers divided into at least three separate camps and sometimes more . </legislation.n.2079><legislation.n.2080>Generally , it has been when ruling and opposition factions have been forced by " external " causes that they have managed to agree on constitutional amendments or on passing or amending laws that require a qualified majority - and then usually as an outcome of thorny negotiations. Specifically , when the Constitution had to be amended as a pre-condition or consequence of accession to the EU or NATO , new laws were required , for example regarding the election and legal status of MEPs and regarding cooperation between Parliament and the Government on European issues. Other laws , for example the Act on Electoral Procedure , had to be amended for that reason. However , variously constituted parliaments regularly saw the defeat of Government attempts to push through a modern Act on Legislation and to amend the Act on the Constitutional Court. Further failures included public administration reform and the electoral reform required to cut the comparatively high number of MPs as well as long overdue amendments to the Standing Orders , which are also necessary for constitutional omissions. ( In December 2007 , after two terms marked by failed attempts , agreement was reached on several issues and the Standing Orders were amended . ) </legislation.n.2080><legislation.n.2081>Following his election in 1932 and the implementation of his New Deal policies , much of Roosevelt 's legislation was challenged as unconstitutional and struck down by the Supreme Court. A majority on the Court , who had been appointed by Republicans , began declaring cornerstones of the New Deal unconstitutional in 5-4 decisions. The New Dealers were frantic. In 1934 , Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins expressed concern to Supreme Court Justice Harlan Stone that the social security system they were devising would be declared unconstitutional. Stone replied -- - " [ t ] he taxing power of the Federal Government , my dear , the taxing power is sufficient for everything you want and need. " </legislation.n.2081><legislation.n.2082>The Wilderness Act of 1964 provides the strongest level of protection that federally-owned land can have. Designation of wilderness areas can be done only by Congress in legislation under this Act.

Provision must be made for the disposal and retention of public records held by an external service provider or privatised entity. The contract or agreement with an external service provider or privatised entity must state that public records should be returned to the originating or controlling government agency if the contract or agreement is terminated for any reason . </legislation.n.2084><legislation.n.2085>The past decade 's experience shows that the legislative process set down in the Standing Orders and the order for debating and passing resolutions have basically been a success. An indication of this is that , though amendments to the Standing Orders have been on the orders of the day several times , these proposals have never been aimed at amending provisions on legislation , only at making minor corrections. However , the characteristic tensions in certain periods of legislation and problems tied to the quality and endurance of laws have not abated . </legislation.n.2085><legislation.n.2086> The national government is responsible for public policy matters and legislation related to health care and health care insurance.

The law mandates that a select group of employees will be paid union contract wages and benefits , instead of the Department of Labor 's determined standard wage rates , and creates two distinct classes of janitors those hired before July 1 , 2009 and those hired after such date. By removing the link of certain employees ' wages and benefits to the Department of Labor 's standard wage rates , we are exposing the state to an unknown and unmanageable level of cost. There will be an entire subset of services whose price will be dictated by privately conducted union negotiations and contracts to which the state is not a party. Both groups of janitors perform the same critical services for the state and therefore should be paid the same wage rates , regardless of when an individual was hired. I can not sanction wages and benefits that are determined completely outside of the state 's control and that have not been included in the budget for the next biennium . </legislation.n.2090><legislation.n.2091>NSW Ombudsman - The NSW Ombudsman site offers information on legislation , mediation , complaints and child protection.

These provisions are norms in which the legislature sets out the intentions underlying the regulation it has imposed. Rules of this kind should be used only with great restraint because they do not have the characteristics of legal norms described above. However , they can be highly useful if employed with great care. In particular , they are used to define a restrictive legislative framework for use by the authorities empowered to promulgate legal norms at a lower level , such as provisions governing application or enforcement. These authorities are then required to make regulations to the desired effect while complying with the limits imposed by the higher law . </legislation.n.2092><legislation.n.2093>These rights mean the same thing to tens of millions of gun owners , Constitutionalist , traditionalist and conservatives as some Civil Rights mean to millions of blacks.

[ 144 ] Soon after passing the Indian New Deal legislation , Congress cut the appropriations that were necessary for its success. [ 145 ] In addition , the institutional prerogative of the BIA to control every aspect of Indian affairs quickly began to dilute the goals of the legislation. As a result , there was little compliance by the BIA with the IRA provision requiring it to consult with the tribes about the use and amount of government appropriations.

Crucial to the timing of the act , and to its early survival , was a simple shift in party politics. Each of the prior bankruptcy acts was enacted in years when the Republicans or their predecessors controlled both Congress and the presidency. The 1898 act was no different. In 1898 , the Republican party controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress for the first time in years. The Republicans retained this control for more than a decade , as Theodore Roosevelt took over for President McKinley , and subsequently won a second term. Republican control helped put bankruptcy legislation on the front burner in 1898 , and it helped keep the 1898 Bankruptcy Act in place long enough for the bankruptcy bar to develop and cement the coalition in favor of its retention . </legislation.n.2119><legislation.n.2120>On Wednesday , Jan. 20 , the Brookings Institution hosted a discussion on cloud computing including a keynote address from Brad Smith , senior vice president and general counsel of Microsoft Corp.

More than any other piece of legislation in the world , the ESA stands as an expression of humility , as a recognition that the Earth does not belong to mankind and our purposes alone. It is ironic that the most ecologically sensitive statute ever passed was , in large part , an accident. When Congress adopted the ESA , most of those who voted for the Act thought that it would be used to save big , popular , lovable animals like Grizzly Bears and Bald Eagles , but that it would have little other impact. Many commentators and attorneys knowledgeable in the ESA agree that Congress had no clearidea of what it was doing when it passed the Act. The language of the ESA goes far beyond protecting just a few fashionable and popular animals , but virtually none of the congressmen at the time realized that the language of the ESA would require the halting of a major federal project such as the building of a dam because of potential harm to a small fish with no apparent use to mankind . </legislation.n.2130><legislation.n.2131>The looting problem can be fixed in a matter of months if the government does two things. 1 ) It must immediately cease the illegal practice of spending Social Security money for non-Social Security purposes; and 2 ) Legislation must be enacted that requires the government to repay , in installments over a period of years , the $ 1.5 trillion in Social Security money that has already been looted. If this is done , we are left only with the long-term problem that must be resolved before 2042. There is no urgent crisis other than the looting , and that is in no way the fault of the baby-boom generation. The blame rests squarely on the shoulders of the bureaucrats in Washington . </legislation.n.2131><legislation.n.2132>The key questions in strategic interaction are : ( i ) how much information does each player know; and ( ii ) when does he know it. The game 's information structure is important because the strategy a player chooses crucially depends on what one player thinks the other player knows.158 I presently model a game with perfect information , capturing the idea that a player knows whose turn it is , as well as the exact stage the game has reached in the game tree.159 Concretely , the firm can tell both that a legislator has issued a threat and what the severity of the threatened legislation is.160 Even though a legislator can tell whether the firm is in compliance , she can not directly observe the specific measures taken by the firm ( e.g. , enhanced internal controls , risk-reduction measures , or capital investment ) .161 Here , the underlying intuition is twofold. First , a legislator can monitor a firm 's processes and output for compliance using testing , auditing , and agents to gather information; 162 a legislator can check whether firms have reduced gas emissions or whether athletic organizations have tested baseball players for steroid use. Second , a firm has strong incentives to make its compliance known ( but the converse is not necessarily true ) . </legislation.n.2132><legislation.n.2133>It is also inspired by the following vision of democracy3 : " The concept of democracy will only assume true and dynamic significance when political policies and national legislation are decided upon jointly by men and women with equitable regard for the interests and aptitudes of both halves of the population .

People earning over the prescribed income limit are entitled to purchase voluntary private health care insurance , and most of them do ( 31 of the Dutch population ) . Those who have private insurance do not have to pay the income-related contribution that finances the Sickness Funds. Private insurers are both non-profit and for profit. Some of the non-profit insurers are owned by the Sickness Funds while others are " mutual " insurers , owned by their shareholders , or run by large multinational corporations. The for-profit insurers are mostly large , multi-line insurers whose activity is not limited to health care , but also include life , home and automobile insurance. People with private health care insurance pay providers for the cost of care and are subsequently reimbursed by their insurer. Private insurers must accept all those who apply for coverage that is equivalent to that offered under the Sickness Funds.

We might find an answer in the Australian public ' s view about who benefits from the way government runs. Another question in the AES gives us a handle on this. The survey asks , ' Would you say the government is run by a few big interests looking after themselves , or that it is run for the benefit of all the people ? ' Just under half of the public ( 48 per cent ) thinks the government is run for big interests and only a small minority ( seventeen per cent ) think it is run for all the people. Another third think governments are half run by big interests , and half for all people. These numbers are hardly encouraging for any government seeking to consolidate its own capacity to govern , and to pass legislation without too much obstruction . </legislation.n.2143><legislation.n.2144>18.

For example , the issue of comparing intentional conduct with lesser forms of culpability has received much more attention since the Uniform Comparative Fault Act was promulgated. This includes the possibility of comparing any negligence on the part of a claimant with intentionally caused harm by a defendant as well as comparing the intentional conduct of one joint tortfeasor with the negligent conduct of other joint tortfeasors. The occasion for these issues to be raised has increased as the courts have expanded tort liability in areas involving an actor 's obligation to protect a tort victim from the intentional tortious acts of a third party. Present legislation dealing with apportionment of tort responsibility does not always address these issues and , where that is the case , court decisions have been anything but unanimous in resolving the problems.

Inflation protected : Once they begin , Social Security benefits are protected against inflation by periodic cost-of living adjustments ( COLAs ) linked to the Consumer Price Index. Inflation protection is one of Social Security 's greatest strengths , and one that distinguishes it from other ( except federal ) retirement plans. No private pension plan provides guaranteed protection against inflation , and inflation protection under state and local plans , where it exists at all , is capped. Without COLAs , the real value of Social Security benefits would steadily erode over time , as is the case with unadjusted private pension benefits. Although a provision for automatic adjustment was not part of the original legislation , the importance of protecting benefits against inflation was recognized , and over the years the system was financed to allow for periodic adjustments to bring benefits up to date. But this updating was done only after a lag. Provision for automatic adjustment was added in 1972 . </legislation.n.2150><legislation.n.2151>Some other troubling aspects of the Government ' s policy are the complex pieces of legislation required to bring in such far reaching changes and the ways in which such new laws may further impact upon the Common Good in times to come. The Government aims to bring industrial and workplace relations under a single and vastly simplified umbrella by way of legislative changes to the Corporations Act. There is an implicit danger here of making an individual ' s labour and some of their human rights subject to the power of Corporations.

Most freedom of information legislation includes a range of documents , or information about documents , that agencies are required to publish. However , the extension of this basic requirement to comprehensive ' model publication schemes ' requiring agencies to maintain publications schemes approved by a Commissioner , has to date occurred only in the UK and Scotland and , in Australia , in Queensland with other States making moves to follow. The UK refined its initial publication scheme in light of early difficulties in implementation , and , while acknowledging the differences between the UK model and the Australian Government ' s proposed publication scheme , particularly the wider publication requirements in the Australian model , the UK ' s current ' model publication scheme ' provides a useful model from which to draw lessons for Australia . </legislation.n.2155><legislation.n.2156>To pass legislation , a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill ( proposed law ) in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution , a special majority for changes to the constitution will be required , making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process , which can be formed from Members of Parliament ( e.g. the UK or Germany ) . But in a presidential system , an executive appoints a cabinet to govern from his or her political allies whether or not they are elected ( e.g. the United States or Brazil ) , and the legislature 's role is reduced to either ratification or veto.

They summon , prorogue and dissolve the provincial legislatures and assent to provincial legislation in the name of the Crown.

In fact , confirming this observation , Nobel laureate economist James Mirrlees cautioned that " government ministers [ ought ] to try to maximize utility , even if their personal sense of achievement is gravely compromised , their crazy industrial dreams unfulfilled. " Hence , if threat recipients believe that the threat maker is motivated by a specific emotion or preference ( say , righteousness or accountability ) , they will be led to conclude that that person will carry out the threat even i/the cost of doing so is prohibitive. In fact , given this emotional motivation or preference , the ensuing emotional sense of fulfillment makes a legislator 's benefits from exercising the threat far greater than those that would have otherwise accrued. It is therefore precisely this sort of belief- that a threat will be carried out even if it is not in the threat maker 's material interest to do so - that makes a threat credible. Taking the effect of emotions into account , threat recipients will have strong incentives to comply with the threat maker 's demands . </legislation.n.2161><legislation.n.2162>Thus from various sources and under various influences there developed an inner split in liberalism. This cleft is one cause of the ambiguity from which liberalism still suffers and which explains a growing impotency. These are still those who call themselves liberals who define liberalism in terms of the old opposition between the province of organized social action and the province of purely individual initiative and effort. In the name of liberalism they are jealous of every extension of governmental activity. They may grudgingly concede the need of special measures of protection and alleviation undertaken by the state at times of great social stress , but they are the confirmed enemies of social legislation ( even prohibition of child labor ) , as standing measures of political policy. Wittingly or unwittingly , they still provide the intellectual system of apologetics for the existing economic regime , which they strangely , it would seem ironically , uphold as a regime of individual liberty for all . </legislation.n.2162><legislation.n.2163>Foreign Law Guide : Current Sources of Codes and Basic Legislation in Jurisdictions of the World ( Law Lib. - Mondale Hall *Access not available outside Mondale Hall ) </legislation.n.2163><legislation.n.2164>Kerry and Edwards have embraced pending congressional legislation to create a lower tax bracket for domestic manufacturing operations.

This tactic likely would have worked had it not been for passage of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. In spite of dishonest comments to the contrary , this Act prevents only groundless and frivolous suits , it does not prevent suits based upon true products liability theories of recovery. In true gun control advocate form , Senator Obama lashed out against this legislation blatantly lying about the threat to the firearm industry in the process.

Films and other programs judged by the CNT to be excessively violent or to have obscene language or sexually explicit scenes can be shown only after 10 p.m. when " family viewing hours " end. In practice , the ever-increasing volume of programming makes the CNT 's job all but impossible. The CNT issues occasional warnings to networks and cable service providers and sometimes obliges them to postpone the showing of certain films until after 10 p.m. It also occasionally levies fines.

They can raise those profits by raising prices , selling more products , or by cutting costs. One way to cut costs is to inflict them on the environment. If all power companies are cutting their costs by emitting sulfur oxides into the atmosphere , there is no way that one firm can stop its destructive behavior unless all other firms do so at the same time; the conscientious firm would be forced out of business because of its higher costs. Environmental protection requires legislation and government regulation , although there are many techniques for pollution control.

In the early 1980s , the European Directives tended to focus on fairly narrow points , such as the precautions to be taken to protect workers exposed to asbestos or noise. Obviously , these are important topics , but in the mid-to-late 1980s , it was decided to lay down general principles to be applied to all places of work. This resulted in the 1989 Framework ' Directive on safety and health , which laid down general principles largely along the lines in the British Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and those now in the Safety , Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. Since 1989 , a number of detailed Directives have been agreed at European level and many of these have been implemented in Ireland by means of Regulations made under the 1989 Act or comparable legislation . </legislation.n.2188><legislation.n.2189>Lynne Featherstone , MP , is currently campaigning for an amendment to the Equality Bill so that names and other personal details are taken off job application forms , to stop employers from gleaning any information about gender , age or race before calling candidates in for an interview. The new legislation is due to be implemented in October 2010 . </legislation.n.2189><legislation.n.2190>Licensing requirements , as set out in the legislation , are comprehensive. The Banking Act 2003 and a Prudential Statement on Licensing issued in February 2004 contain detailed licensing criteria for both locally incorporated and foreign banks , including " fit and proper " criteria for shareholders and officers , satisfactory risk management , accounting and management control systems , and minimum capital requirements. The Banking Act 2003 defines banking business , prohibits the unauthorized use of the word " bank " in a company name , and requires prior approval for changes in significant shareholding . </legislation.n.2190><legislation.n.2191>In 2007 , the minimum hourly rate for exempt computer software professionals in California was $ 49.77 per hour. This hourly rate was reduced to $ 36.00 per hour in 2008. Until 2008 , the exemption applied only to hourly workers. In September 2008 , AB 10 amended California Labor Code 515.5 to apply the overtime exemption to qualifying computer programmers , analysts and engineers who are paid a monthly salary of $ 6 , 250 or more each month ( $ 75 , 000 annually , excluding bonuses ) . Alternatively , employers can also keep such employees on an hourly basis and enjoy the exemption if the employees are paid at least $ 36 per hour for all hours worked. The bill was passed as urgency legislation and is already in effect . </legislation.n.2191><legislation.n.2192>Fancy Labor members asking the people to believe , that a financial policy enthusiastically supported by Mr. Menzies is one to be continued for all time ! COMPLETE FINANCIAL DICTATORSHIP THREATENED Before examining the most important aspects of the Labor Government 's two Banking Bills , it is essential to know who was responsible for the drafting of this legislation. There is no doubt that many Labor members had little idea of the real objectives of the legislation they so enthusiastically supported. One of them , Mr. Martens , related at Canberra on June 26 , 1945 , how he answered electors who asked him what the legislation meant : </legislation.n.2192><legislation.n.2193>approve the establishment of special administrative regions and the " systems to be instituted there. " The 3 , 000 members of the NPC meet once a year and serve 5-year terms. Delegates are elected by the people 's congresses at the provincial level as well as by the People 's Liberation Army. Provincial delegations meet before each NPC session to discuss agenda items. Because of the infrequent meetings , the NPC functions through a permanent body , the Standing Committee , whose members it elects. The Standing Committee 's powers were enhanced in 1987 when it was given the ability to " enact and amend laws with the exception of those which should be enacted by the NPC , " thus giving this body legislative powers. The Standing Committee presides over sessions of the NPC and determines the agenda , the routing of legislation , and nominations for offices. The NPC also has six permanent committees : one each for minorities , law , finance , foreign affairs , and overseas Chinese and one for education , science , culture , and health. Leaders of the NPC Standing Committee are invariably influential members of the CCP and leaders of major mass organizations. The Standing Committee has within it a smaller group that is led by the chairman of the Standing Committee . </legislation.n.2193><legislation.n.2194>Martin Luther King , Jr. admitted that the ultimate solution to " the race problem " was beyond the reach of law. He even agreed with the proposition that morality can not be legislated. But King also argued that the legal agenda of the civil rights movement was not pointless. His famous and most piercing response was that while the law could not make the white man love the black man , it could make him stop lynching him. Enactment and enforcement of the relevant legislation would , King insisted , portent more than a trivial change; lynchings were not beside the point . </legislation.n.2194><legislation.n.2195>By enacting The Financial Transactions Reporting Act ( FTRA ) 2003 , and eight other legislative acts on May 7 , 2003 , and additional legislation in 2004 , Cook Islands authorities strengthened its anti-money laundering/counterterrorism financing ( AML/CTF ) legal and institutional framework.

It is one of the proposals currently being considered to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) . This legislation would allow private sector employers to offer employees the option of taking comp time PTO rather than receive cash wages for all overtime hours worked at a rate of 1.5 hours per hour for which the overtime premium would be due. The maximum accrual of comp time would be 160 hours ( essentially , one month ' s work ) . There are certain prerequisites that must be met for an employee to be eligible. Of course , as with the other legislation discussed in this analysis , until the final provisions of the legislation are agreed upon and the bill is converted into a statute , the specific prerequisites will not be fully known . </legislation.n.2198><legislation.n.2199>Now in New York and in California there is a movement afoot to establish by law or constitutional amendment a cap on the growth of funding. Senator Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) has also introduced legislation at the Federal level to do the same. These proposals would restrict the actual growth of the budget to a certain percentage. These are admissions that the legislature and executive branches can not do their jobs and control spending themselves to at least a level related to revenues . </legislation.n.2199><legislation.n.2200>As reported by the CBC , the British Columbia government has introduced legislation that would empower Richmond , Vancouver and Whistler , for the months of February and March in 2010 , to act swiftly to remove graffiti or signs that contravene their bylaws.

On the down side , it turned judges into politicians. The ultimate decision maker on Charter issues is the SCC. Its political views might be quite different from those of the lower courts . </legislation.n.2201><legislation.n.2202>The Banks and Deposit Companies Act 1999 implements the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Basel Committee. Banks and other financial institutions are required to retain records for a minimum of five years. Bermuda has not adopted bank secrecy laws , but like the UK , recognizes a banker ? s common-law duty of client confidentiality. Bankers and others are protected by law with respect to their cooperation with law enforcement officials. The Insurance Amendment Act 2004 implemented a number of changes to Bermuda ? s insurance regime pursuant to the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ? ( IAIS ) adoption of revised core principles for supervision , as well as to the comments made by the IMF in their report on Bermuda ? s insurance provisions. A further series of more substantive amendments to the Insurance Act is currently in preparation and expected to be introduced into Parliament in the spring of 2006 , which should complete the overhaul of the island ? s insurance legislation , consistent with new international standards for this sector . </legislation.n.2202><legislation.n.2203>I do not know of what non legislation resolve has been reached that pulled the Bill , other than the non clarification of what the Bill was meant to resolve.

Directors need to understand that no legislation specifically identifies risk. Legally , authoritative guidance can not be ignored. No company or person can delegate risk. Yet occupational road risk has to be identified and assessed in the workplace-by law. Hence , there is growing interest in outsourcing ORR protection to assist in meeting the requirements. " </legislation.n.2204><legislation.n.2205>In a democratic state , in which the legislature is formed from the people , the standards of clarity and intelligibility for enactments are high. Members of the public must be able to fully appreciate the contents and effects of proposed legislation and form an opinion before voting on it in a referendum or deciding whether to request that the issue be put to the popular vote. To the extent that enactments are not sufficiently comprehensible in themselves , it is essential that all necessary explanations be provided so that members of the public can make their democratic choices and exercise their democratic rights in full knowledge of the facts. Accordingly , it is unsatisfactory to enact legislation that is accessible only to parliamentarians and lawyers . </legislation.n.2205><legislation.n.2206>Abstract : When NAFTA was first adopted both Mexico and Canada negotiated protectionist provisions designed to ensure that the largest banks in the two countries remained under domestic control.

Agency staff and members of the public may lose confidence in the integrity of the records , and the agency could expose itself to unacceptable levels of risk and potentially costly consequences. This may also lead to unnecessary duplication of effort. Agencies must therefore ensure that storage arrangements are included in any relevant contractual agreements.

This inducement effect depends on the credibility of both the threat to enact the legislation ( in case of noncompliance ) and the implied promise to refrain from enacting it ( in case of compliance ) . Thus , unless both are credible , the threat will have no impact at all. Given the decisive role of credibility , this Part focuses on : ( i ) the conditions necessary to make the threat ( and promise ) credible; and ( ii ) the mechanisms that legislators can avail themselves of in order to ensure credibility.233 </legislation.n.2214><legislation.n.2215>In New York also facing large deficits due to declining revenue and increased spending the Governor , David Paterson , has proposed legislation that caps the growth of the state budget. This would be flexible and tied to the rate of inflation over the last three years. New York saw an average of almost eight percent increases in annual spending since 2003. If the cap had been in place it would have been around three.

The Act was a peculiarity among New Deal legislation , however. In the midst of the great depression , its immediate effect was to lower the take-home pay of those Americans who still had jobs. The Act called for wage-earners to contribute a portion of their salaries to fund retirement benefits that most of them would not receive for many years. The Act specified that government would contribute nothing toward those benefits . </legislation.n.2217><legislation.n.2218>This course is designed to examine the allocation of power between children , parents , and the government both within and outside of the family unit. Rather than providing a survey of family law , this course focuses upon primarily poverty law issues that arise from public institutions designed to promote social welfare and to protect and nurture young people and their families. Students should enter the course with a basic understanding of Constitutional law , along with a desire to explore social welfare through a variety of mediums. This course focuses upon the child welfare system. We begin with the foundational cases that establish both the legal rights and liabilities of parents. We will also examine recent federal legislation regarding termination of parental rights and touch upon adoption policy as it intersects with the foster care system. In exploring the dependency and child welfare systems , we will consider the role that race and class play in abuse and neglect cases and work to define the appropriate parameters of state intervention into the daily lives of families. Finally , we will examine the unique challenges that face counsel for children and parents . </legislation.n.2218><legislation.n.2219>The role played by Canadian banks , insurance companies , and trust and loan companies as financial intermediaries in our society and the need for a supervisory framework to protect both the soundness and safety of these institutions and the security of their customers are central to this course.

The lender would apply payments first to interest and then to principal. On subsidized loans , the Department of Education would pay unpaid interest for three years; after that , interest would be capitalized. The Department of Education would pay or cancel loans after 25 years for borrowers who continue to be eligible for this program or choose to repay under the income-contingent repayment program ( ICRP ) or who have qualified for economic hardship deferment. The new IBR program would be an additional option for qualified borrowers to the existing income-contingent repayment program , which is open to all borrowers in the Direct Loan Program.

Here , logrolling provides one way in which a legislator can guarantee ( or increase the likelihood of ) sufficient political backing for the threatened legislation and thus a higher probability of its enactment.204 </legislation.n.2253><legislation.n.2254>Argentina ? s primary anti-money laundering legislation is Law 25.246 of May 2000. Law 25.246 expands the predicate offenses for money laundering to include all crimes listed in the Penal Code , sets a stricter regulatory framework for the financial sectors , and creates an FIU , the Unidad de Informacion Financiera ( UIF ) , under the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. This law lay down requirements for customer identification , record keeping , and reporting of suspicious transactions by all financial entities and businesses supervised by the Central Bank , the Securities Exchange Commission ( Comisi ? n Nacional de Valores or CNV ) , and the Superintendence of Insurance ( Superintendencia de Seguros de la Naci ? n or SSN ) . The law forbids the institutions to notify their clients when filing suspicious financial transactions reports , and provides a safe harbor from liability for reporting such transactions. Reports that are deemed by the UIF to warrant further investigation are forwarded to the public prosecutors ? office. As of November 2005 , the UIF had received 1416 reports of suspicious or unusual activities , forwarded 102 suspected cases of money laundering to prosecutors for review , and assisted prosecutors with 79 cases . </legislation.n.2254><legislation.n.2255>Law - Illinois " Ethics Police " still in start-up mode An AP story today in the Evansville Courier &amp;Press reports : SPRINGFIELD , Ill. - A year after Gov.

Although rural interests lobbied in a relatively organized fashion on some issues -- such as railroad rate legislation -- opposition to bankruptcy came less from organized lobbying than from lawmakers who viewed themselves as representing agrarian interests , together with a few ideological entrepreneurs ( such as Representative Bailey of Texas , who figured prominently in the 1890s ) . </legislation.n.2256><legislation.n.2257>The Guide prefaces the listing of legislation with a short overview of the Irish legal system and discussion of the contract of employment.

State governments have the sole power to legislate on such subjects as law and order , public health and sanitation , local government , betting and gambling , and taxation on agricultural income , entertainment , and alcoholic beverages. On some issues both the union government and state governments may legislate , though a union law generally takes precedence. Among these areas are criminal law , marriage and divorce , contracts , economic and social planning , population control and family planning , trade unions , social security , and education. Matters requiring legislation that are not specifically covered in the listed powers lie within the exclusive domain of the central government . </legislation.n.2281><legislation.n.2282>Legislation related to safe patient handling has already passed and has been introduced in several states. Now , with involvement of United American Nurses , AFL-CIO , efforts are moving toward introduction of national legislation to stop devastating musculoskeletal injuries from physically lifting patients. Such painful back , neck , and shoulder injuries have been permitted to take their toll on the health , lives , and careers of nurses and other healthcare workers for far too long. It is welcome news that a national legislator has responded to the cry to stop disabling our country 's limited supply of healthcare workers by requiring them to lift outrageous amounts of weight . </legislation.n.2282><legislation.n.2283>The essence of Social Security is a social insurance program provided by the federal government. The legislation that created Social Security was enacted in response to the growing financial needs of the American people created by the Great Depression. The program was a natural development at the time when many aged people had lost their lifetime savings during the Depression and gainful employment opportunities were few. Social Security was designed to provide workers and their dependents with protection against poverty in the event of declining income due to retirement , disability , or death. To achieve that purpose , Social Security redistributes income in the following ways : </legislation.n.2283><legislation.n.2284>" modern management " is expected to provide leadership to an organisation and involve staff in organisational development through processes such as corporate and strategic planning.

Payroll taxes are presumed to be government revenues , and Social Security benefit payments government expenses , so that if benefits are raised , there will be less money to be spent elsewhere in the budget. The truth is that all of Social Security 's inflows and outflows are separated from the rest of the government budget and have no impact on the budget , neither to increase nor decrease the deficit. No piece of legislation passed by Congress has ever authorized shifting money from one to the other . </legislation.n.2286><legislation.n.2287>The leader of the Rebels became involved in child care through his association with the girlfriend and the girlfriend 's family.

There , FDA commented that [ t ] hrough the creation of registries , a sponsor can evaluate safety signals identified from spontaneous case reports , literature reports , or other sources , and evaluate factors that affect the risk of adverse outcomes , such as dose , timing of exposure , or patient characteristics. Given the focus on the development of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ( so-called REMS ) in the Senate-passed version of the FDA Revitalization Act , and if such legislation is enacted , the use of patient registries will likely increase. As such , the AHRQ handbook could be a very valuable tool for industry . </legislation.n.2291><legislation.n.2292>The legal system employs a coercive set of norms to define the basic societal structure within which the pursuit of all activities may take place. While legislation accounts for a substantial part of the legal universe , norms also pour forth from other rulemaking and judicial bodies.2 The makeup of the legal universe therefore includes norms of different hierarchies ( i.e. , statutes , regulations , opinions ) 22 and norms of different types ( i.e. , rules , standards ) .23 Operating in tandem , lawmaking and law enforcement guide the conduct of individuals , firms , and governmental bodies.24 </legislation.n.2292><legislation.n.2293>In Canada , a number of legislative and regulatory mechanisms hold Canadian companies and residents accountable when there is evidence of environmental offences and/or violations of human rights legislation associated with the activities of Canadian businesses. For example , federal and provincial human rights legislation regulates the conduct of private employers in each jurisdiction and prohibits certain discriminatory practices. In addition , federal and provincial environmental legislation establishes various environmental offences that apply to Canadian businesses. Canadian criminal law may also apply in cases where there is conduct that is of the nature of a criminal offence. The Canadian Criminal Code provides for criminal liability for corporations as well as individuals. In 2004 , the Criminal Code was amended to better ensure that organizations could be held accountable when they commit criminal offences. Corporate bodies ( and other organizations ) can now be found criminally liable for criminal offences as a result of the criminal actions of a wider variety of senior officers at all levels of the corporation than was previously the case : both those with operational authority ( those who oversee day-to-day operations of the organization or a part thereof ) and those with executive authority , such as directors or officers . </legislation.n.2293><legislation.n.2294>Leavitt asserted that only 1.7 million uninsured children are eligible for SCHIP at any point during the year and that covering all of them immediately would cost in the range of $ 10 billion over five years. He asserted that the only way Congress could spend $ 50 billion over five years ( the amount allowed for the SCHIP bill under the congressional budget resolution ) would be for Congress to launch a dramatic expansion of SCHIP , such as to cover people up to 400 percent of the poverty line. And since the majority of people between the current SCHIP income limits and 400 percent of the poverty line already have private insurance , Leavitt concluded , the goal of the legislation obviously is to convert these people to being recipients of government health insurance . </legislation.n.2294><legislation.n.2295>It is unclear from the legislation whether proof of ''knowledge'' would be the burden of the agency or is intended to be raised as an affirmative defense by the regulated entity.

In a parliament without a strong party system , no one group consistently has the numbers to pass legislation , which means lots of elections , frequent changes in the governing group and unstable government of the country. For example , before Federation , when the Australian colonies came together to create the Australian national government , colonial governments changed frequently. In South Australia there were 42 governments in the 45 years between 1856 and 1901 . </legislation.n.2297><legislation.n.2298>Some employers are more conscientious than others.

In sufficiently small groups , such as close-knit oligopolies , members may contract with one another - explicitly or tacitly - so as to ensure that each member complies and that the group as a whole wards off the risk of legislation.287 Intragroup threats of ostracism or cross-punishments guarantee that members will abide by their agreements. Moreover , given a group 's small size it is reasonable to assume that a legislator would be able to tell whether members have duly complied , which would further reinforce members ' incentives to secure group-wide compliance . </legislation.n.2299><legislation.n.2300>This course will begin by critically examining the scientific and economic work on the causes and consequences of global warming , with special attention to the political economy of international efforts to curb global warming , the structure and process of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , and the methodologies underlying economic estimates of costs and benefits. The course will then proceed to consider both domestic and international legal and political developments in the climate change area. These include the Kyotol Protocol , the European Emissions Trading Scheme , and -- in the U.S. -- the history and political economy of efforts to pass federal climate change legislation , state legislation and regulation ( with a focus on California ) , regulation under existing federal environmental statutes and regulation via common law public nuisance actions. The course will conclude by discussing the many substantial environmental impacts from the new " green " energy projects funded by the 2009 stimulus bill and justified by the need to avert global warming , and the treatment of those impacts under existing state , local and federal environmental and land use laws.

Ivoire , supervise and examine Ivoirian compliance with anti-money laundering/counterterrorist financing laws and regulations. Under the new money laundering legislation , Ivoirian banks and financial institutions will be required to verify and record the identity of their customers before establishing new accounts or processing transactions. All Ivoirian financial institutions are now required to begin to maintain customer identification and transaction records for ten years. For example , all bank deposits over approximately CFA 5 , 000 , 000 ( about $ 10 , 000 ) made in BCEAO member countries must be reported to the BCEAO , along with customer identification information. Law enforcement authorities can access these records to investigate financial crimes upon the request of a public prosecutor. In 2005 , there were no arrests or prosecutions for money laundering or terrorist financing . </legislation.n.2301><legislation.n.2302>Specifically , in an attempt to reduce emissions in the semiconductor industry , the EPA threatened regulatory intervention. The threat of inopportune legislation induced me industry to enter into agreements with the EPA and commit to lower emissions.104 Fearing the potentially intrusive and economically unfeasible requirements of the proposed regulation , business corporations seem to find refuge in agreements they negotiate in the shadow of the threat , which allow them to adopt environmentally responsible and costeffective solutions.

It is , therefore , the intent of the General Assembly , in the interest of the health and welfare of the citizens of Illinois , to establish a reasonable penalty system which is responsive to the current state of knowledge concerning cannabis and which directs the greatest efforts of law enforcement agencies toward the commercial traffickers and largescale purveyors of cannabis. To this end , this Act provides wide latitude in the sentencing discretion of the courts and establishes penalties in a sharply rising progression based on the amount of substances containing cannabis involved in each case . </legislation.n.2306><legislation.n.2307>In fact , Meyerson points out it was American businesses and their representative groups ( here ' s looking at you , U.S. Chamber of Commerce ) that opposed legislation in China aimed at strengthening worker rights. The goal was to improve working conditions and arrest the practice of withholding wages and forcing employees into working insanely long hours , but American business interests succeeded in pushing amendments to make it more acceptable to foreign firms - a fancy way of saying weakening the effect the bill would actually have on workers and the businesses that depend on keeping costs down.

Many feared that their southern constituents would vote them out of office if , as senators , they voted for equal rights for African Americans. The " southern bloc " held up consideration of the bill from March into June hoping that presidential candidate George Wallace , a segregationist from Alabama , would do well in the early presidential primaries. If Wallace seemed popular , Russell would argue that the nation as a whole did not support federal civil rights legislation and that the Senate should not pass an unwanted bill. Southern senators could not compromise. Only by forcing cloture could they demonstrate to their constituents that they had fought to the end against hopeless odds . </legislation.n.2308><legislation.n.2309>The result might well be that the plaintiff is left without any relief , since U.S. courts may refuse to enforce foreign judgments that do not afford U.S. defendants due process.

The problem can be remedied by the plaintiffs ' countries -- by repealing discriminatory foreign legislation such as Law 364 . </legislation.n.2309><legislation.n.2310>This story demonstrates the strategic use of legislative threats , an increasingly prevalent but virtually unnoticed modus operandi of legislators and regulators on both the national and state levels. Conceptualized in this Article , legislative threats encompass threats exerted by one or more legislators on firms ( e.g. , business corporations ) , professions , industrial sectors and trade bodies , universities and public institutions , federal agencies , and even U.S. states , according to which the legislator will exercise his legislative mandate and enact adverse legislation in order to regulate the conduct in question , unless the threat recipients alter their behavior to bring it in line with the legislator 's demands. Implicit in the threat is the inverse promise that the legislator will forgo the threatened legislation if , and only if , the threat recipients duly meet such expectations. Under certain conditions , legislative threats induce entities to modify their conduct and abandon targeted practices , averting the risk and consequences of the threatened legislation . </legislation.n.2310><legislation.n.2311>When the House-passed bill reached the Senate floor in March 1964 , three groups of senators formed : pro-civil rights Democrats , southern Democrats opposed to the bill , and Republicans. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey led the Democrats who supported the bill and worked actively for its passage. As Senate majority whip , Humphrey enjoyed the support of Mike Mansfield , Senate majority leader. Together they were determined to pass the legislation and even arranged grueling twelve-hour daily sessions to wear down the opposition. Humphrey 's task was to line up supporters to defend the bill in debate , to persuade reluctant members of his party to vote for passage , to encourage publicity , and to count votes. The Senator from Minnesota labored hard for passage and sought cooperation from many sources , including the Republicans . </legislation.n.2311><legislation.n.2312>Arguments are likely to be made in respect of which the county court is powerless to respond. There are some weaknesses in the current legislation which may require amendment. The Human Rights Act , section 4 , provides that where a court is satisfied that a provision of primary legislation is incompatible with a Convention right , it may make a declaration of that incompatibility. However , section 4 ( 5 ) provides that only the High Court or above may make such a declaration. Where it appears , therefore , that such a position may be reached , the case should be transferred to the High Court , or the argument rejected on the basis of reliance on section 6 ( 2 ) and leave to appeal considered . </legislation.n.2312><legislation.n.2313>The continuation of this state of affairs has now become intolerable. During this century , civilian gunfire has killed over 800 , 000 Americans , more than all the military fatalities in all wars from the Revolution through Vietnam. About 20 , 000 Americans are killed in this fashion annually; each year guns were used in over 120 , 000 robberies. The rate of homicides committed with guns in the United States is 35 times higher than the rate in England and Germany. In 1970 , handguns killed only three persons in Tokyo , where strict gun control is in effect. During the same period , over 500 persons were shot to death in New York City. Gun control legislation is , therefore , a vital necessity . </legislation.n.2313><legislation.n.2314>In Canada , legislation related to the provision of services for the poor began with the enactment of the Poor Law in 1614. During the feudal period , vagrants and other alms-seekers including persons with disabilities turned to churches and monasteries for charitable support. At the time , it was considered to be an ethical responsibility to protect the rights and dignity of those in need. Poverty was understood as a personal weakness and failure . </legislation.n.2314><legislation.n.2315>Part III examines the economic machinations underlying legislative threats : how , and in what circumstances , are legislative threats expected to induce a change in the behavior of entities to which a threat is directed ? In other words , under which conditions are threat recipients expected to comply with the legislator 's demands ? I borrow insights from game theory and model the strategic interaction between legislators and entities as a dynamic game in which legislators exert probabilistic threats. The probabilistic feature expresses the notion that executing a threat does not ensure the enactment of the threatened legislation : the legislator can not guarantee that the threatened consequences will transpire , making the threatened legislation probable but never certain. Using game-theoretic methods , I use the model to predict how legislators and firms are expected to behave , showing the existence of two mutually exclusive predictions : compliance and noncompliance. This analysis unveils the potential inducement effect of legislative threats , which underlies their regulatory power . </legislation.n.2315><legislation.n.2316>The Federal Grand Jury in Chicago is sitting on two sealed indictments , awaiting instructions from the newly sworn in U.S. Attorney Janet Reno.

Under current legislation any striker in the UK is considered to have broken his contract of employment as all those on strike may be sacked together without compensation. They may be sacked selectively when the strike is 'unofficial'. The lack of protection applies regardless of the cause of the strike. So where an employer deliberately engineers a dispute it is the workforce which may be in breach of contract.

" </legislation.n.2321><legislation.n.2322>Under the current system , there is little to deter the transfer of legally sold guns to criminals and youth. The secondary black market for handguns has thrived on these illegal transfers. Between 36 and 50 of male eleventh-graders believe they could easily get a gun if they wanted one , according to Handgun Control , Inc. Registration prevents illegal transfers by making the registered owner responsible for what happens to his or her gun. Licensing and registration of handguns is necessary to ensure that guns remain in the hands of responsible , law-abiding citizens and to assist law enforcement in tracing guns used in crime. The licensing of all handgun owners is needed to insure that felons and others prohibited from gun ownership can not obtain firearms. The legislation also includes measures to insure that licensees have been trained in the safe use and care of firearms. A handful of states already have licensure , but a national law is necessary to ensure people are not able to cross state lines to buy unregistered firearms . </legislation.n.2322><legislation.n.2323>" Review of Eskridge &amp;Frickey , Cases and Materials on Legislation : Statutes and the Creation of Public Policy.

It would require employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for the care of a newborn baby , an adopted child , an ill family member , or an employee with a serious illness. Additionally , employees on leave would continue to receive health benefits , and the same or equivalent job would be waiting for them when they return. Sounds reasonable , right ?

The interrelation between the economic and social development , between the economic and social policy is weakened , and often the economic dominates over the social . Overcoming this problem requires the adoption of a new concept for the relationships among the various policies , so that in case of major changes a preliminary assessment is made to what extent the policies and measures envisaged are harmonized and consistent with each other , and do not hinder the achievement of the outlined goals. The main disadvantage of the past practice was that the social policy faced the necessity to deal with the consequences of the economic policy , which determined its passive nature. The emphasis of the new social policy is placed on the implementation of a more active policy , which addresses the causes , not the effects. This implies , that carrying out a preliminary assessment of the social impact in cases of major changes in the legislation should be an indispensable part of the social policy itself . </legislation.n.2332><legislation.n.2333>Clear legislation presupposes a simple and precise hierarchy of enactments.

In other words , the threat is mere " cheap talk. " In this case , the firm 's best response is " do n't comply " because , compared with the expected payoff for choosing " comply , " it maximizes the firm 's utility.185 Stated differently , it makes no sense to incur compliance costs when the threat is incredible , because doing so would not benefit the firm. The firm 's choice is inconsequential because either way the risk of adverse legislation is zero. The Nash criterion mentioned above is satisfied because once the " do n't comply " strategy is chosen as the firm 's best response , the firm has no incentive to choose " comply. " According to this prediction - the incredible threat equilibrium - the firm does not comply with the legislator 's demands , and the legislator does not carry out the threat notwithstanding the firm 's noncompliance . </legislation.n.2345><legislation.n.2346>With reference to the transposition of the achievements of the EU legislations and the obligations of the Republic of Bulgaria under Chapter 13 Employment and social policy it is envisaged to be established a Guarantee Fund for protection of workers and employees in case of insolvency of their employer.

The main objective of the project is the creation of normative guarantees for the workers and employees that in case of insolvency of their employer they will receive their labor remuneration within the time stipulated in the law. The establishment of such a guarantee institution is supported by the social partners and would play an important role in the market economy situation . </legislation.n.2346><legislation.n.2347>In his analysis , Judge Wettick found nothing in the state assessment statutes that supported this position. The court reasoned that whenever a developer is purchasing vacant land it has two choices : it can purchase the land for its fair market value and then develop the land , or it can develop the land after entering into a transaction which will be structured as a long-term lease with the amount of rental payments being based on the fair market value of the vacant land. But according to Judge Wettick , any state legislation that would expressly allow this different tax treatment based on the structure of the transaction would be unconstitutional based on the uniform tax clause and the prohibition against creating tax exemptions not expressly provided for in the state constitution. Even if current state statutes did support Tech One 's position , state law similarly calls for the assessment of all real estate , including improvements : Pennsylvania law does not permit a method of assessing property that does not consider the value of buildings and other improvements ( even if technically owned by a tenant ) . </legislation.n.2347><legislation.n.2348>There is undeniable evidence in court cases to show that the ratification of [ U.N. resolutions inconsistent with Constitution ] was , and is , illegal !

The state can not expect its citizens to comply with the law if it fails to bring the law to their attention. This is a recognised principle of the rule of law. The form and conditions of the publication of legislation currently in force are very important matters. The legislation of a state can be considered a living thing , in that it constantly changes as some enactments are amended and others are repealed and replaced by new legislation.

It will be concluded that UK law lags far behind many other countries and that the legislation does not empower employees in the UK with a right to strike.

If it does not , according to the Quran , it is not Islamic , for those who make decisions on other than what God has revealed are unbelievers ( Surah 5 Verse 44 ) .

A communitarian can readily agree that the basic liberal line against enacting shared formulations of the good , even if redrawn some , is difficult to hold. There is clearly room for enacting legislation if it is based on truly shared moral understandings , but only if it follows a prolonged and encompassing moral dialogue; if it has gained wide support , well above a mechanical majority ( say , 70 to 80 percent of the people ); if it does not offend the Constitution; and if it can be effectively enforced. Banning abortion , divorce , and homosexual activities fail to meet all these criteria. Stewardship of the environment does not , and -- I would argue -- neither does better protection of young children from violent material , abusive marketing ( e.g. , of Alcopops ) , guns ( e.g. , through mandatory locks and gun-free zones around schools ) , and pedophiles ( Megan 's Laws ) , among others . </legislation.n.2381><legislation.n.2382>We also have in this act some exceptions to allow criminal associations where there are close family members.

As a legitimate independent organization we are concerned that the proposed legislation , unless further defined , could restrict our ability to independently research and publish information on events and issues which the Central People 's Government believes are subversive. We also believe that the current proposals on the proscription of societies could dramatically weaken the confidence and ability of both the funders and the staff of NGOS to continue working in an environment where the independence of Hong Kong judicial definitions and practices are subsumed under Mainland concepts of " national security " and its opposition to any independent civil society . </legislation.n.2391><legislation.n.2392>Law school alumnus , Mark D.

Part of this payment is covered by a grant from the national government. All drugs prescribed by doctors and hospitals are purchased by a single national agency , Apoteksbolaget , a state-owned company which owns all community pharmacies and hospital pharmacies in Sweden. All pharmacists therefore are public employees. Apoteksbolaget , which operates its pharmacies under one-year contracts with the county councils , is required by national legislation to supply drugs at uniform prices throughout the country and at the lowest possible cost to both individual and society. Patients must defray the cost of their prescription drugs up to the maximum payable ( $ 405 ) . They then receive a card entitling them to free prescription drugs for the remainder of the year . </legislation.n.2394><legislation.n.2395>All told , then , Congress passed three federal bankruptcy laws prior to 1898 : the Bankruptcy Acts of 1800 , 1841 , and 1867. Together , the acts lasted a total of sixteen years. The absence of a federal bankruptcy law did not leave a complete vacuum in debtor-creditor relations , of course. Most states had insolvency laws on the books.6 Some of them , like Massachusetts 's , predated the Revolution. In times of financial panic , states also responded by passing stay laws imposing moratoria on creditor collection. Proponents of federal bankruptcy legislation emphasized both the wide variation in these laws and their serious constitutional limitations , such as the inability of state law to bind out-of-state debtors.7 </legislation.n.2395><legislation.n.2396>The teacher will distribute group news articles or editorials that present different points of view on the legislation to each.

Subsection 45.16 ( 7 ) of the RCMP Act constitutes a partial privative clause so that deference was owed to the Commissioner 's decision. The Commissioner 's obvious expertise favoured deference. The three-stage comprehensive disciplinary process provided for in the Act revealed the legislation 's recognition of the need for the Force to control its own disciplinary matters. Again , Force members do not come under the Public Service Employment Act and this favoured deference. Finally , since the disciplinary process is largely fact driven , great deference was owed as to questions of fact but not when it came to questions to law , with respect to which the Court had greater expertise. Limited deference should be granted in the case of a mixed law and fact question. That was the reasonableness simpliciter standard. Since all four issues identified by applicant raised mixed law and fact questions , reasonableness simpliciter was the applicable review standard . </legislation.n.2397><legislation.n.2398>Categories : Climate Change , Conservation , Development , Economy , Energy , Environment , Environmental Disaster , Environmentalism , Government , Law , Legislation , Natural Disaster , Nature , News , News Picks , Policy , Politics , Pollution , Regulation , Science , Social Issues , Weather Tags : Anthropogenic Global Warming , Climate Change , Climate Change Disbelievers , Climate Change Dissenters , Climate Change Models , Climate Crisis , Climate Model , Climate Models , Connecticut v.

The scale of operation is in may cases a decisive factor for the administrative capacity of such an unit to meet the legally required level. The scale of operation is also of great importance for the capacity of an administrative unit to meet the demands of the constituency and to serve the local or regional population in an optimal way. The Vietnamese central government has adopted a programme of adjusting this scale of operation on the provincial as well as on the local level. A big programme of decreasing the scale of regional government and of increasing the scale of local government has been carried out during the past years and it still continues to be. Very regularly decisions either splitting up former provinces or merging former , smaller communes , wards etc. into bigger units are being published in the C ng B o ( the Official Gazette , publishing the VN legislation ) . The number of provinces has been doubled over the past years and the number of municipalities is still decreasing . The results are approaching a halving of the number of municipalities . </legislation.n.2404><legislation.n.2405>It often happens that amendments to legislation are not made with as much attention as would be desirable. Often , time limits are too short and the close consideration of the material or the wider consequences on other legislation is neglected. The volume and complexity of the body of legislation as a whole mean that in some cases it is very difficult to determine with certainty all the implications that a legislative amendment can have for the legal system. In these circumstances , a reduction in the volume of the legislation could only make the job of the drafters easier . </legislation.n.2405><legislation.n.2406>On Dec. 17 , 1999 , the Work Incentives Improvement Act was signed into law. Under previous legislation , individuals who were disabled often lost Medicaid and Medicare coverage when they returned to work. The increase in income placed the individual above the coverage threshold , but oftentimes the income earned was not enough to offset the costs of medical treatment or equipment that was needed. Thus , individuals had to choose between rejoining the workforce and losing their Medicare/Medicaid benefits , or remaining outside the workforce and retaining their benefits. The new legislation allows individuals to " buy into " Medicaid by paying premiums that would be established by the individual states . </legislation.n.2406><legislation.n.2407>CONGRESS 'S AUTHORITY to regulate bankruptcy derives quite explicitly from the Constitution , which states in Article I , section 8 that Congress may pass " uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies. " The Founding Fathers included the provision almost as an afterthought. Charles Pinckney of Rhode Island proposed the Bankruptcy Clause late in the constitutional convention of 1787 , and it was approved with little debate.1 Almost the only contemporary evidence of the meaning or importance of " uniform bankruptcy " comes in the Federalist No. 42. Written by James Madison , Federalist No. 42 describes federal bankruptcy legislation as " intimately connected with the regulation of commerce , " and necessary to prevent debtors from fleeing to another state to evade local enforcement of their obligations.2 </legislation.n.2407><legislation.n.2408> I want to thank the bipartisan leadership of the House Government Reform Committee , including Chairman Ed Towns ( D-NY ) and Ranking Member Darrell Issa ( R-CA ) as well as sub-committee Chairman Stephen Lynch ( D-MA ) and Ranking Member Jason Chaffetz ( R-UT ) for fighting so long and hard for H.R. 22 , Rolando said.

The European Commission does not decide on EU laws it merely makes proposals. All European legislation has to be approved both by the Council and the European Parliament.

Reportedly , additional laws are in draft form. Legislation governing foreign exchange controls allows the Central Bank ? s Supervision Division , the governmental entity charged with money laundering issues , to exercise some authority against illicit banking activities. The Central Bank of Angola has the authority to freeze assets , but Angola does not presently have an effective system for identifying , tracing , or seizing assets. Instead , such crimes are addressed through other provisions of the criminal code. For example , Angola ? s counternarcotics laws criminalize money laundering related to narcotics trafficking. One of three draft laws to reform the banking sector specifically targets money laundering. The money laundering bill , which has not yet been approved by the Angolan Parliament , was drafted with the assistance of the World Bank.

Although Congress considered a civil rights bill each year from 1945 until 1957 , every measure failed to pass into law. It was not until Congress turned its attention to voting rights in 1957 that the first civil rights act of the 20th century actually became law. Congress followed the 1957 Civil Rights Act with another in 1960. Together these measures made moderate gains for minorities.

" The state 's at-large law read as follows : " It is unlawful for any person to allow a dog ... to go upon the premises of another , or upon a highway or upon a public road or street ... . " Three dogs were running at large and savagely mauled the 60-year-old librarian as she took her nightly walk. Because the statute used the word " allow , " however , no criminal charges were brought against the dog owners , because they denied knowing or permitting their dogs to be loose.

" </legislation.n.2448><legislation.n.2449>I ' m committed to carrying out , in our first year , a review of recent criminal justice legislation and identify elements that could be repealed. There is quite a lot of material on statute that has never been implemented. The last thing I want to do is have another criminal justice bill , if I can possibly avoid it. There might be a criminal justice repeal bill though , to get rid of some of the stuff that we think is completely otiose , but I certainly don ' t want to land the judiciary in particular , or lawyers , with extra legislation . </legislation.n.2449><legislation.n.2450>CAARA members should advise any agency participating in outsourced records management to establish whether it is taking place as a result of specific legislation.

Fortunately , the actions of the legislature rarely have the effect of making draft legislation obscure - on the contrary , the legislature 's intentions often become more clearly expressed as the result of a comparison of the new wording with the original and the statements of the members of the legislature who request changes. Loss of clarity more typically arises in connection with an enactment 's other provisions if the amendments produce inconsistencies or a lack of precision. The possibilities in this regard are numerous. Thus , for example , the introduction of a norm that is excessively detailed compared with others in an enactment will probably affect only the homogeneity of the normative burden but not reduce the enactment 's intelligibility. In other cases , the clarity of the enactment may be reduced . </legislation.n.2460><legislation.n.2461>The Central Bank of Belize supervises and examines financial institutions for compliance with anti-money laundering/counterfinancing of terrorism laws and regulations. The banking regulations governing offshore banks are different from the domestic banking regulations in terms of capital requirements. Banks are not permitted to issue bearer shares. Nevertheless , all licensed financial institutions in Belize ( onshore and offshore ) are governed by the same anti-money laundering legislation and must adhere to the same anti-money laundering requirements. To legally operate from within Belize all offshore banks must be licensed by the Central Bank and be registered with IBCs. Before the Central Bank issues the license , the Central Bank must verify shareholders ? and directors ? backgrounds , ensure the adequacy of capital , and review the bank ? s business plan. The legislation governing the licensing of offshore banks does not permit directors to act in a nominee ( anonymous ) capacity . </legislation.n.2461><legislation.n.2462>The new water company utility has faced problems common to all essential services agencies operating in developing world contexts , for instance the tricky imperative of network expansion , and the community must continue the fight against privatization , currently against German Development Agency ( the development arm of the German government , similar to USAID ) efforts to introduce more private sector participation ( PSP ) . However , this effort toward peoples ' control of water has been relatively and remarkably successful. The Coordinadora advocated for and won legislation whose language promotes indigenous water rights and water defined as a public good. The company performed well enough to qualify for a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank , which , unfortunately , is one of the only sources of capital in the region; the Cochabamba utility ' s effort currently constitutes one of the most successful loan packages in the sector. Moreover , experts estimate that , without foreign private involvement , three million dollars in capital stay in Cochabamba every year , instead of leaving the country for the pockets of rich US stockholders . </legislation.n.2462><legislation.n.2463>The US government , federal , state and local authorities are using microwave wave and acoustic weapons as well as implanted devices to attack thousands of Americans openly in their homes right now today.

Implicit in the threat is the inverse promise that the legislator will forgo the threatened legislation if , and only if , threat recipients duly meet these demands. The Article examines ten case studies drawn from diverse areas of social policy , which demonstrate both the pervasive use of threats and their formidable regulatory capacity. The Article also offers an analytic taxonomy that delineates the conceptual boundaries of legislative threats and enhances the precision of the analytic inquiry : this taxonomy includes explicit , implicit , and anticipatory legislative threats . </legislation.n.2464><legislation.n.2465>A legislator is rationally interested in securing a firm 's compliance in order to avoid incurring the cost of carrying out a threat. Compliance maximizes the legislator 's utility and makes her better off.199 In order to ensure compliance , however , the legislator must guarantee that it qualifies as the firm 's best response. In theory , the legislator may shape the firm 's cost-benefit calculus by : ( i ) relaxing his demands so as to lower the firm 's compliance costs; ( ii ) making the legislation 's undesirable impact harsher; and ( iii ) striving to raise the probability of successfully passing the threatened legislation , making it greater than ( or at least equal to ) the effectiveness condition . </legislation.n.2465><legislation.n.2466>Section 3.

JSG urges the Committee to consider adding a provision to H.R. 881 which would allow an aggrieved party to sue an agency found to have violated the provisions of this bill and a provision which would mandate the review of an agency 's actions where it has failed to fairly or adequately to warn individuals and small businesses of what the agency 's rules require . </legislation.n.2469><legislation.n.2470>Brendan DeMille suggests that Duke 's move may mean the ACCCE is collapsing from within.

Comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation regulations have allowed the government to refine and improve its ability to combat financial crimes and money laundering. Nevertheless , the laundering of drug money from Colombia ? s lucrative cocaine and heroin trade continues to penetrate its economy and affect its financial institutions. Additionally , a complex legal system and limited resources for anti-money laundering programs constrain the effectiveness of the GOC ? s efforts. Laundering illicit funds is related to a number of criminal activities ( narcotics trafficking , commercial smuggling for tax and import duty evasion , kidnapping for profit , and arms trafficking and terrorism connected to violent paramilitary groups and guerrilla organizations ) , and is carried out , to a large extent , by officially recognized foreign terrorist organizations. The GOC and U.S. law enforcement agencies are closely monitoring transactions that could disguise terrorist finance activities for local foreign terrorist organizations. The U.S. and Colombia exchange information and cooperation based on Colombia ? s 1994 ratification of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances.

In the former legislative authority is vested in the legislature/parliament exclusively. For a variety of reasons , the legislative may , however , delegate such powers while retaining control and monitoring capability. In judicial review a body of experts , usually judges , are empowered to review legislation passed by the legislative and to strike them down as null and void if found to be in violation of the constitution of the country. Neither one of these is inherently superior to the other; each has its own strengths and weaknesses. An immediate strength of parliamentary supremacy is that it conforms to the democratic tenet of legislation by the elected representatives of the people. An immediate strength of the judicial review model is that it can be used to cater for the interests of particular disadvantaged groups who may not be able to elect enough representatives at their own . </legislation.n.2478><legislation.n.2479>3 ) Fairness in Arbitration Act : This Bill , which was proposed in July 2009 , would invalidate arbitration agreements in employment , consumer and franchise contracts between parties of unequal bargaining power , unless both parties voluntarily agree to use arbitration after a dispute arises.

And why did the first permanent U.S. bankruptcy law look so different from the English bankruptcy law that emerged in the same era under apparently similar circumstances ? To answer these questions , we first must consider the role of business organizations and the prodebtor interests that opposed them in the years leading up to the 1898 act; and the role of the bankruptcy bar once the act was in place. The backdrop against which the interest group dramas played out was the general Republican support for , and Democratic hostility to , federal bankruptcy legislation . </legislation.n.2496><legislation.n.2497>" The absence of federal legislation protecting sources has created extraordinary chaos , " Norman Pearlstine , Time Inc.

A 2000 amendment to the money laundering law requires a wide range of financial institutions to report all suspicious transactions to the Czech Republic ? s financial intelligence unit ( FIU ) , known as the Financial Analytical Unit ( FAU ) of the Ministry of Finance. In September 2004 , the latest amendments to the money laundering law came into force. The amendments introduce several major changes to the Czech Republic ? s money laundering laws and harmonize the nation ? s legislation with the requirements of the Council Directive 2001/97/EC on prevention of the use of the financial system for money laundering ( Second 2nd EU Money Laundering Directive ) .

For instance , the United States Supreme Court struck down a Texan law forbidding women to be assisted with abortion in Roe v. Wade. [ 97 ] The constitution 's fourteenth amendment is interpreted to give Americans a right to privacy , and a woman 's right to choose to have an abortion is part of that. The judiciary is theoretically bound by a constitution , as much legislatures are. In most countries judges may only interpret the constitution , and all other laws. However in common law countries , where matters are not constitutional , the judiaciary may also create law under the doctrine of precedent. On the other hand , the United Kingdom , Finland and New Zealand still assert the ideal of parliamentary sovereignty , whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature . </legislation.n.2506><legislation.n.2507>Until the recent past there was no comprehensive law for persons with disabilities.

In addition , the extent of the states ' tolerance for the plight of those in need of assistance is statutorily limited; with few exceptions , the 1996 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant scheme imposes a cumulative lifetime cap of five years receipt of welfare assistance.

But the civil rights movement headed by Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. was no less an effort to promote a particular morality through law , and it succeeded. Not only did the resulting legislation affect people 's attitudes and behavior as intended , but it is now commonly viewed as a prime illustration of the right way to achieve change in a democratic society. In fact , more often than not , the same people who dismiss Prohibition as a misguided and even antidemocratic initiative celebrate the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They view this and related pieces of legislation as essential steps in America 's ongoing effort to realize the promise of its democratic ideals . </legislation.n.2514><legislation.n.2515>We propose legislation to abolish the Internal Revenue Service , and will veto any authorization , appropriation , or continuing resolution which contains any funding whatsoever for that illicit and unconstitutional agency.

In a few decades , Brazil changed from a rural to a predominantly urban society , TV networks spread the values and behavior of urban life to the whole country , women entered in earnest in the job market , and the patterns of nuptiality and child bearing approached those of Western Europe. Population growth rates went from 2.99 between 1950 and 1960 to 1.93 between 1980 and 1991 , and are still going down.

The Taskforce envisages that rules could be adopted whereby a large amount of PSI that has already been published for instance government reports , legislation and records that are already accessible to the public could be automatically designated Creative Commons BY , with other PSI being re-licensed Creative Commons BY on application with rights of appeal to the new Information Commissioner . </legislation.n.2520><legislation.n.2521>The enormity of the task facing the ESSC if they are to devise a workable , effective and acceptable legal framework of employment legislation that will take the Island ' s workforce , both employers and employees , successfully into the millennium is clear. But how much additional legislation are Islanders prepared to accept ? In the responses to the survey phrases describing the exercise " as taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut " and " if it ain ' t broke don ' t fix it " were common. The reader can see from the brief survey of employment law in some other jurisdictions that employment infrastructures are usually established over a period of years. The " Fair Play " questionnaire asked Islanders whether they felt that a new employment law was needed. A large majority of both employers and employees gave a positive response to this question. However the questionnaire then went on to ask questions relating to specific areas of employment law and at this point opinions varied. Three elements which did score highly were the need for an ACAS style conciliation service supported by an Employment Tribunal system , the need for employers to provide itemised pay statements for their employees , and protection for employees from unfair dismissal . </legislation.n.2521><legislation.n.2522>The newly restored government composed of the seven party alliance ( SPA ) has acted swiftly and radically to get on what it hopes is an irreversible path toward a new form of governance and restored hope for the Nepalese people.

It has set a course toward a secular state that emphasizes inclusion of all communities in the country and equality between men and women.

In the amended article 136 , distinction was made between draft legislation that should be harmonized and other ordinary draft legislation. Legislative proposals to be harmonized with the EU acquis carry the mark P.Z.E. The amended Article 161 stipulates that legislative proposals being harmonized with the EU legislation of the European Union shall be enacted under summary procedure if so sought by the sponsor , unless the competent working body ( which is either the Committee on the Constitution , Standing Orders and Political System or the Legislation Committee ) propose that such legislation be discussed and debated in the first reading due to its failure to comply with the Constitution or the legal system. In terms of procedure , the article 161 provision basically represents a regular application of summary procedure for legislation that is being harmonized with EU acquis. Unlike the case of other draft legislation , voting on enabling the use of summary procedure for P.Z.E. legislation is not required . </legislation.n.2531><legislation.n.2532>Law - More on pharmaceutical arbitrage and drug import This opinion piece in today 's Wall Street Journal ( paid subscription required ) , titled " Why Not Import Drugs From Fantasyland ?

I was curious as to your comment about public policy creating the building blocks . Is it not the people that create the building blocks through their everyday actions ? Unions , civic organizations , and faith communities have more responsibly to my mind , than does the state in progressive change. As Tony Benn has said , the legislature only ratifies the peoples ' choice as expressed in mass action. That choice is generally expressed in the street long before the legislature ever takes the matter up. On our side of the Atlantic , it was marches and sit-ins that spurred civil rights legislation , not benign elected personalities. Saying that , I give great credit to the Johnson Administration for its pro-activeness . </legislation.n.2534><legislation.n.2535>The Fair Labor Standards Act , perhaps the single most important piece of legislation for workers in the United States , establishes minimum wage , overtime pay , child-labor protections , and the standard of a 40-hour workweek -- but excludes live-in workers from overtime pay.

But one emerging lesson is that legislation should always incorporate explicit provision for the dissemination of free information.

And omission will continue to widen the gap between the information rich and information poor . </legislation.n.2548><legislation.n.2549>Since 1986 , French counter terrorist legislation has provided for the prosecution of those involved in the financing of terrorism under the more severe offense of complicity in the act of terrorism.

As such , the operational arrangements for the MCGC were largely established under the framework provided by the Audit Act 1901 ( Audit Act ) and its subordinate legislation ( including the Finance Regulations and the Finance Directions ) which were in effect until 31 December 1997.

The Union Labour Minister urged the State Governments to send their views on the Report in writing to enable the Government to come out with a definite view.

Its effects are manifested in ideas , education , governmental policies , economic stratification , social segregation , housing markets , hiring and promotion practices , psychological issues , and minority access to a variety of social services and opportunity . </legislation.n.2571><legislation.n.2572>This legislation gives the state power command the mass media , as the government is the only unit with authority to release news on any event. If a media wants to report something , it has to receive permission from the local government. The government would also have the authority to identify the resource and evaluate the validity of the news. It would have absolute power over the media whenever there is any breaking news . </legislation.n.2572><legislation.n.2573>Copyright Law and Intellectual Property This research project examined the broad policy rationale for copyright in relation to public sector information and found there is a strong argument to realign Commonwealth copyright policy based on the principles of open access and re-use which would facilitate complex flows of information between and within the public and private sectors. The report argued that this could be achieved without the need for significant changes to copyright legislation by repositioning crown copyright to enable rather than restricting re-use; adopting copyright management practices appropriate to the Web 2.0 environment ( e.g. standardised open licenses which provide clear statements of users ' permissions ); and providing clearer guidance to agencies about the use of open licenses , and the meaning of publication in the Copyright Act . </legislation.n.2573><legislation.n.2574>POLICE STATE LEGISLATION -- THE USA PATRIOT ACT , PATRIOT II AND THE VICTORY ACT -- THE INFORMATION , THE DOCUMENTS -- CLICK HERE TO GO TO INFOWARS.COM 'S SPECIAL SECTION </legislation.n.2574><legislation.n.2575>Senate leaders had prepared for the legislative controversy over H. R. 7152 in a number of ways. The Senate Judiciary Committee , which was the logical committee to consider a civil rights bill , was manned by conservatives who probably would have delayed or even pigeonholed the bill. Senate leaders knew that since the bill had passed the House , it could be placed directly on the Senate calendar without having to go through committee. Although the Senate rules permit this bypassing of its committee structure , the tactic is employed rarely. Opponents of the civil rights bill opposed the leadership strategy , but supporters gathered enough votes to place H.R .7152 directly on the Senate calendar by a 54 to 37 vote on February 26 , 1964. This action was crucial since it meant that southern conservatives could not kill the bill in committee and would have to rely on the filibuster to defeat civil rights legislation on the Senate floor . </legislation.n.2575><legislation.n.2576>Subsequently , the legislator decides whether to carry out the threat. Carrying out the threat does not mean , however , that the legislator will be successful in enacting the threatened legislation; rather , all it means is that the legislator will endeavor to enact the legislation to the best of his political might. For this reason , exercising a threat creates the risk - not the certainty that the adverse legislation will be enacted into law.156 This fact suggests that legislative threats are probabilistic in nature , a feature that arises from the intrinsic uncertainty of the legislative enterprise.157 </legislation.n.2576><legislation.n.2577>The Parliament , in accepting this compromise , has now ensured that this directive will enter into law very swiftly. All of which is great news for the estimated 1.3 million British workers who will be protected by this legislation and a demonstration that our European common market is a social market that combines protection of workers ' rights with flexible labour markets . </legislation.n.2577><legislation.n.2578>Natural Resources. These files are a good illustration of Church 's ability to find compromise and balance both the economic and the aesthetic interests of his constituents and the nation. While the minerals and mining legislation for Church 's first three terms is almost exclusively pro-mining , his work at the same time to create national parks and forests and to preserve habitats for fish and wildlife led to his being named Conservationist of the Year in 1965. Water resources were an important Idaho issue and this material fills over two boxes. It shows Senator Church 's concern for the people of Idaho and their water rights . </legislation.n.2578><legislation.n.2579>Understanding common law legislation : drafting and interpretation / F.A.R. Bennion. Oxford; New York : Oxford University Press , 2001 . </legislation.n.2579><legislation.n.2580>The Project has been initiated by the Delegation of European Commission in Prague in the middle of 1997 , when , after dissolution of the Office for Legislation and Public Administration , there was no body responsible for a complex reform of public administration. At that time the reform was narrowed to the creation of higher territorial administrative units which , in spite of having been established by our laws , have not been actually implemented . </legislation.n.2580><legislation.n.2581>According to David Banisar 's ( 2004 ) global survey of access legislation , there were then 57 governments which had passed access or freedom legislation. Roger Vleugels ' ( 2006 ) overview of access legislation indicated that there are 11 more countries which have passed legislation , making a total of 68 . </legislation.n.2581><legislation.n.2582>Such a limitation may disadvantage Manx residents in a dispute with the U K government as that country 's legislation contains a similar clause. It effectively means that a 'black hole ' may be created for a limited number of complainants who , as citizens of a Crown Dependency , regard themselves as British citizens . </legislation.n.2582><legislation.n.2583>In the recent wave of legislation passing through California 's capital , one more to add to the books has to do with gender equality and California health insurance laws. Effective January 1st 2010 , state health insurance companies and HMO 's will not be able to charge men and women different rates for the same type of insurance policy . </legislation.n.2583><legislation.n.2584>The Swedish government had been widely expected to propose a bill on the reduction of working time in the near future. However , it announced at the end of October 2000 that possible legislation on this issue would not now be considered until 2003. The minority Social Democrat government had not received the support on this issue of both of the parties with which it cooperates in parliament , the Left Party and the Green Party , and did not want to risk endangering its cooperation with either of them . </legislation.n.2584><legislation.n.2585>The parliamentary process and method of legislation in Hungary as elsewhere are built on centuries of experience. Essential components include the preparatory role of the committees , the method of plenary debate with a division between general and specific debate , the right to make draft amendments which is due both committees and MPs , and " two-round " voting , first on the draft amendments and then on the bill as a whole . </legislation.n.2585><legislation.n.2586>The review of the legislation should also include a review of the definition of disability used in the proposed legislation and other relevant legislation. There should be scope to widen the definition and/or the inclusion of additional rights , particularly in the context of the implementation of the Framework Directive for equal treatment in employment and occupation for people with disabilities ( 2000/78/EC ) . </legislation.n.2586><legislation.n.2587>To require the active participation of people with disabilities , through advocacy where necessary , in policy development and service planning. This means that all Ministerial regulations , guidance and Codes of Practice that result from provisions contained in the legislation should be subject to consultation with all stakeholders including people with disabilities , their families , carers and support groups . </legislation.n.2587><legislation.n.2588>The merits of the theories of the " environmental justice " movement were n't addressed in our book but here 's a quick response : Professor Verchick 's much-vaunted federal pollution-control legislation is a significant part of the process of locating facilities that produce environmental externalities , and has been for more than thirty years. It 's hard to imagine how the common law , rather than federal statutes , is shown to be inadequate by the failure of those statutes to produce an appropriate distribution of such facilities. Further , the available evidence suggests the " environmental justice " movement has little to do with the environment or justice. This is n't something anyone takes on in our book , but in The Promise and Peril of Environmental Justice ( 1998 ) , a book published by the decidedly nonconservative Brookings Institution Press , Christopher Foreman finds little empirical support for the notion of environmental racism. ( See this website for a review of this important book . ) </legislation.n.2588><legislation.n.2589>This course provides advanced training in analytic and persuasive legal writing. It focuses on clear writing as the natural extension of organization and thorough analysis. The writing exercises use hypotheticals based on actual cases in a variety of practice areas. Students draft and edit short and long documents including letters , litigation documents , memoranda , and legislation . </legislation.n.2589><legislation.n.2590> The regulatory approaches including cap and trade that are on the table , even if they were enacted , are too weak to deal with the problem If you build an integrated gasification and combined cycle plant with carbon capture and storage , it won ' t run under today ' s regulatory system because it will be more expensive than the competing plants , even with the cap and trade program. ... Most of the people who are working on climate change legislation recognize that it ' s just a down payment ... . </legislation.n.2590><legislation.n.2591>" The founding of the committee is an innovative method to allow experts to participate in lawmaking , " said Zhou Jidong , director of the legislation office of the Beijing municipal government. In the past , meetings were held to listen to expert opinions on thorny problems concerning draft laws and regulations. The meetings , however , were usually held at short notice , resulting in low involvement of experts and poor quality advice . </legislation.n.2591><legislation.n.2592>Official website of the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism ( OSCT ) a Directorate within the United Kingdom Home Office which leads the work on counter-terrorism in the UK , working closely with the police and security services . The site has information about the work and responsibilities of the OSCT along with a full text copy of the counter terrorism strategy which can be freely downloaded. Also given on this site is information on how the government , emergency services , local authorities and regional agencies respond to a terrorist threat and the OSCT s strategy for using science and technology to combat terrorists. There is a description of the OSCT s programme for countering the threat of Chemical , Biological , Radiological , Nuclear and Explosives ( CBRNE ) . The legislation page provides access to key pieces of legislation , administered by the Home Office , which give the government key powers in combating terrorism. There is also information on proposed new legislation and on the independent reviews of terrorism legislation which are carried out regularly to ensure terrorism laws remain appropriate . </legislation.n.2592><legislation.n.2593>An explicit threat is made when a legislator unambiguously communicates her intention to enact legislation unless the tiireat recipients comply with her demands. Doing precisely this , Homeland Security officials convened the captains of the computer industry and leading trade groups to discuss government concerns of cyber attacks and threatened adverse legislation. In another case , me legislator circulated a draft bill to high-tech and media companies in an attempt to halt digital piracy . </legislation.n.2593><legislation.n.2594>The Bush Administration , however , is characterizing the children ' s health insurance legislation being developed in Congress as a big-government approach that would pave the way for socialized medicine , do little for low-income children , and primarily shift people with good incomes from private health care coverage to government health insurance at taxpayers ' expense. These characterizations were evident on June 27 at White House events featuring the President , HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt , and White House National Economic Council director Al Hubbard , and again on July 10 and July 14 when the White House announced it would veto the emerging SCHIP legislation. Secretary Leavitt has repeated these claims in media interviews , as have the Administration ' s regional HHS directors and some Members of Congress . </legislation.n.2594><legislation.n.2595>Collective investment schemes ( CISs ) are regulated by the BMA , and fund administrators are regulated persons for the purposes of the PCA. To strengthen regulation , CISs , including hedge funds , will be the subject of new legislation anticipated for the spring 2006 session of Parliament. The proposed legislation will expand the definition of collective investment schemes to include , in addition to mutual funds and unit trusts , other business vehicles that pool and manage investment monies. It will require the licensing of fund administrators to be subject to minimum standards and a code of practice. The BMA will also be able to conduct compliance checks of PCA procedures as carried out by CIS administrators. However , the BMA will continue to apply differentiated requirements involving lighter regulation of schemes catering to institutional and sophisticated investors , with greater reliance on transparency and disclosure . </legislation.n.2595><legislation.n.2596>In fact , this threat followed an earlier one. Working with bipartisan cosponsors , 83 Senator Ernest Hollings , the Commerce , Science , and Transportation Committee Chairman , introduced a bill that would have required Silicon Valley technology firms and Hollywood entertainment and content producers " to agree on a standard to stop digital piracy. " According to the bill , the government would step in and mandate a solution if the industry did not reach an agreement within one year. Stating that the " private sector needs a nudge , " and that " the government can provide that nudge " and aiming to induce an industry-engineered solution , Senator Hollings circulated draft versions of the threatened legislation to threat recipients , which included hightech companies and content producers.85 Senator Hollings ' bill was introduced only after Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee hearings had been unsuccessful in reaching an agreed-upon solution. During these hearings , media companies , including the Walt Disney Company , claimed that technology firms , such as Intel , derived gains from digital piracy. Once the threat had been issued , however , noncooperative behavior rapidly became cooperative and these companies began negotiating the standard technology in the shadow of the threat . </legislation.n.2596><legislation.n.2597>But to truly transform our economy , protect our security , and save our planet from the ravages of climate change , we need to ultimately make clean , renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America. And to support that innovation , we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . </legislation.n.2597><legislation.n.2598>The existing investment legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan determines the system of tax , customs and other privileges and preferences for business subjects carrying out investment activity on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. This system is both effective in regard of local and foreign investors performing investments into economy of Kazakhstan . </legislation.n.2598><legislation.n.2599>The Blair Government acknowledged its indebtedness to the Keating Government 's Working Nation document ( 1994 ) , in relation to unemployed beneficiaries there has , since the 1947 Social Security legislation , been a work testing eligibility requirement , and work relief programs ( the Susso ) during the 1930 's demanded actual work for sustenance prior to the supply of unemployment relief. The Howard Government 's 'work for the dole ' program is a latter day Susso scheme . </legislation.n.2599><legislation.n.2600>With today 's Senate action , we now turn our attention to the House of Representatives. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Central Conference of American Rabbis call on the House of Representatives leadership to schedule a vote on S. 1053 as quickly as possible. Passage of this legislation will ensure that no woman , man , or child will have to choose between quality health care and keeping a job or obtaining health insurance. Scientists continue to make remarkable advances in the treatment of illness-and today 's Senate passage of genetic nondiscrimination legislation will ensure that all Americans are free to lead longer , healthier lives without fear of genetic discrimination . </legislation.n.2600><legislation.n.2601>Aruba participates in the FATF through the Netherlands , and therefore , participates in the FATF mutual evaluation program. The GOA has a local FATF committee , comprised of officials from different departments of the Aruban Government that work together under the leadership of the MOT , to oversee the implementation of the FATF recommendations. The local FATF committee reviewed the GOA anti-money laundering legislation and proposed , in accordance with the nine FATF Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing , amendments to existing legislation , and introduction of new laws. In 2004 , the Penal Code of Aruba was modified to criminalize terrorism , the financing of terrorism , and related criminal acts. Aruba is in compliance with seven of the nine FATF Special Recommendations. Aruba will introduce the Sanctions Ordinance to become fully compliant with the Special Recommendations. The GOA and the Netherlands formed a separate committee in 2004 to ensure cooperation of agencies within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the fight against cross-border organized crime and international terrorism . </legislation.n.2601><legislation.n.2602>There was an example in New South Wales where similar legislation was used to lock down a suburb of Sydney - that is , to set up roadblocks - because of a fear that young men of Middle Eastern appearance gathered in cars were about to cause mayhem somewhere in Cronulla. It turned out that they were all just heading home. The police got it wrong. They set up roadblocks; the roadblocks did not catch anyone. They were not even heading in that direction. You can make mistakes. An unnecessary roadblock might not seem to be a terribly serious situation , but let us say that an important public protest was stymied by inappropriate police action. That is a tragedy for our democracy. I think that we need to take a serious look at whether the police powers to impose these public safety orders are too broad . </legislation.n.2602><legislation.n.2603>So one more of many victories for consumers thanks to European legislation applicable across the whole of the European market. But why then did Conservative MEPs oppose this ? Tory MEPs voted against caps on mobile roaming charges , championing the cause of big businesses to charge their customers what they like so no change there then from the Tories . </legislation.n.2603><legislation.n.2604>Terrorism and terrorist acts are not specifically criminalized under Argentine law. Because these acts are not autonomous offenses , terrorist financing is not a predicate offense for money laundering. In 2005 , Argentina ratified the UN International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism , but it has not yet passed domestic legislation. Several bills have been introduced in the Congress to implement the provisions of those treaties under Argentine law , but there have not yet been votes on any of these draft laws and the GOA has not yet indicated which , if any , of these bills it will support. In an attempt to close this gap , the Central Bank issued Circular 4863 in 2005 that requires banks to report any detected instances of the financing of terrorism. However , bankers have complained that the regulation is not backed by any legal definition of what constitutes terrorist financing in Argentina , and that the absence of domestic legislation means that they are not protected from lawsuits by clients if they report suspected cases of terrorist financing . </legislation.n.2604><legislation.n.2605>Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission ( HREOC ) - HREOC investigates infringements of discrimination legislation , undertakes public education about human rights and conducts public inquiries. Site includes information on human rights and making complaints , legislation , and publications . </legislation.n.2605><legislation.n.2606>The bill is currently in committee. While I 'm sure it wo n't go anywhere , the fact that such legislation could even be proposed in 21st century America is mind-boggling . </legislation.n.2606><legislation.n.2607>Discussions in the DLCG and a wider process of consultation , including sixty-eight written submissions and meetings in Cork , Galway and Dublin have helped to inform the content , focus and shape of this document and what the DLCG consider to be the core elements of disability legislation. The DLCG is of the view that these core elements include the right to an independent assessment of need that leads to a Statement of Needs and a plan that outlines how the needs identified will be met. This should be in line with the recommendations made in A Strategy for Equality , the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. In addition , the legislation should include the right to independent advocacy , physical , information and communications accessibility , and redress. Certain duties are also placed on public bodies to promote the mainstreaming of disability as well as duties on all public and private providers of services regarding accessibility . </legislation.n.2607><legislation.n.2608>Detailing the action that national medical associations can take to combat tobacco , he emphasise the importance of working for high rates of tobacco taxation and bans on advertising. The need for strong , effectively enforced legislation was stressed. The potential effectiveness of any measure is best assessed by the level of industry opposition - the greater the opposition , the more effective the measure is likely to be . </legislation.n.2608><legislation.n.2609>For years , the Chinese Government has been working on the legislation of export control over the sensitive items in other fields. The Chinese Government has successively formulated a series of laws and regulations and established relevant export control regimes in recent years , under which strict controls are exercised over the exports in nuclear , chemical and biological fields. Furthermore , China will continue to take measures to further improve and strengthen its relevant laws and regulations. These efforts are underway . </legislation.n.2609></legislation.n.train>
