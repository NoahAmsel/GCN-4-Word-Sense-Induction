Similarly , the reforms would have precluded disciplinary review of actions by members of the security forces and the police by civilian authorities. Such a change would have several problematic consequences. First , civil disciplinary proceedings currently serve at times to fill partially the gap left by ineffective criminal proceedings. Thus , at least some sanction is levied against members of the public security forces who commit violations , even though that sanction is often light in comparison to the abuse committed and can not satisfy the right to justice of the victim or his family members. However , a prohibition of review by the Procurator General in cases involving members of the security forces would preclude use of even this mechanism . </gap.n.78><gap.n.79>This is where the generation gap was most palpable for me , and a senior at Morristown made me realize it.

The gland contains modified photoreceptors , cords and pinealocytes arranged into clusters that are associated with astrocyte-like neuroglia. These neuroglia are the main cellular part of the pineal stalk. Pinealocytes are highly modified neurons that produce melatonin ( synthesized from tryptophan ) . Pinealocytes contain multiple synaptic ribbons randomly distributed between adjacent cells and coupled by gap junctions. Circulating levels of melatonin show a circadian rhythm as do the enzymes that make it ( e.g. , serotonin N-acetyltransferase ) in which the activities rise during darkness and fall during the day. The cyclical behavior of the pineal gland is controlled by the circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The pineal gland modifies the activities ( largely inhibitory ) of other endocrine glands such as the pancreas , parathyroids , adrenal cortex and medulla , gonads , adenohypophysis , and neurohypophysis. The hormones made are polypeptides or indoleamines ( e.g. , melatonin ) . These hormones can inhibit pars anterior synthesis and the release of hormones and hypothalalmic production of releasing factors.

Wood , which is a natural fibrous matrix , flexes to a certain degree before it snaps at the target point. When unpegged , this allows for an entire stack of wood to flex upon impact , resulting in the break occurring in the order of furthest board from impact to the closest board ( albeit a fraction of a second difference separates each board , making it appear instantaneous ) . This can be witnessed in many novice demonstrations where the rear board will break , but the remaining top boards are intact. When pegged , the gap between the boards necessitates each individual board to flex and snap before the next board is reached in succession; the person performing the break must physically touch every board in a pegged stack of wood . </gap.n.242><gap.n.243>The IRS attributes the majority of the gap to underreporting of income.

The observation of Fermi-surface ( FS ) -dependent nodeless superconducting gaps suggested that inter-FS interactions may play a crucial role in superconducting pairing. In the optimally hole-doped Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 , the pairing strength is enhanced simultaneously ( 2 /Tc 7 ) on the nearly nested FS pockets , i.e. , the inner hole-like ( ) FS and the 2 hybridized electron-like FSs , whereas the pairing remains weak ( 2 /Tc 3.6 ) in the poorly nested outer hole-like ( ) FS. Here , we report that in the electron-doped BaFe1.85Co0.15As2 , the FS nesting condition switches from the to the FS due to the opposite size changes for hole- and electron-like FSs upon electron doping. The strong pairing strength ( 2 /Tc 6 ) is also found to switch to the nested FS , indicating an intimate connection between FS nesting and superconducting pairing , and strongly supporting the inter-FS pairing mechanism in the iron-based superconductors . </gap.n.250><gap.n.251>US-Parks.com Park LocatorPre Planned RoutesNational Parks LodgingNational ParksOutdoor Gear Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Home &gt; Delaware Water Gap &gt; Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area 2000 - 2008 US National Parks and Monuments Travel Guide : US-P ... </gap.n.251><gap.n.252>Twenty five years after Walker passed through , Richard Henderson , a land speculator and former North Carolina judge , sent Boone and his woodsmen to mark a trail through the gap for eastern settlers bound for Kentucky.

Throughout South Dakota , the Topeka shiner population is declining , therefore areas where the Topeka shiner occurs will be analyzed. We are applying GAP procedures ( Scott et al. 1993 ) to aid resource managers in protecting the Topeka shiner. Since the South Dakota GAP project began in 1997 , we have completed digital maps of mammal distributions , land cover ( eastern South Dakota ) , and stewardship.

The " missing " 40 feet is replaced by coils ( trap ) . This short antenna has a radiation resistance of 4 ohms. It 's a " virtual " resistor , which when power is applied , radiates RF That , however , is n't the only resistor in the antenna system. There are more. The significant resistor is called earth loss , which is a function of the radials and ground. If three radials are used , the earth loss created is more than 30 ohms. We now have an antenna with 4 ohms that radiate and 30 ohms that warm the ground for a total of 34. But only 4 ohms radiate ! if 100 watts powers this antenna , only 12 watts actually radiates. If you add lossey traps equaling 2 ohms , the power out drops from 12 watts out to 11 watts out. While traps have their own deficiencies , it is the huge earth loss that really matters.

In January 1997 , the Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership ( MoRAP ) entered into an agreement with the USGS-Gap Analysis Program to conduct the first statewide pilot project for the aquatic component of Gap Analysis. Numerous objectives are being addressed in the Missouri pilot project.

The output gap is a measure of the potential GDP of the country less actual GDP. In other words , it 's a measure of the difference between actual economic output and potential economic output. Not to get too academic , but actual GDP consists of consumption , investment , government spending and net exports. During a recession , consumption and investment typically fall. Government spending , of course , never falls. The fall in consumption and investment lead to a drop in actual GDP to levels below potential GDP. Keynesians have a solution for this shortfall.

Second , the differences between the young and those 25-34 are also smaller in 1997 than in pervious years ( Table 5 ) . Third , the difference between the young and those 25-34 has never been the largest gap between adjoining in age groups ( Table 5 ) . In both 1985 and 1997 the gap between the two youngest age groups was in the middle compared to differences between other adjoining age groups.

Logarithmic gap costs perform poorly because they increase slowly ( Figure 3 ) . This causes logarithmic costs to " cheat " during pairwise alignments because two huge gaps , covering the entirety of the sequences may be less costly than three or more moderate gaps. In fact , many logarithmic costs have bimodal distributions; they either work or cheat. However , this may not be a problem because it is easy to tell when logarithmic costs cheat , which can be reflected by posterior decoding [ 9 , 18 ] . Log-affine gap costs are noticeably better than simple affine gap costs , even though the difference may not be enough to justify wide spread usage given the slower speed of the candidate list method. According to the above results , affine gap costs only diverge from log-affine gap penalties at large branch lengths . </gap.n.370><gap.n.371>Says Allison Kasic at Townhall.com , The wage gap a real statistic measured by the Department of Labor simply compares the median wage of the full-time working woman versus the median wage of the full-time working man.

In the composition of participants , it was a mix of activists , young women active in SRHR clubs supported by UNFPA throughout Africa , women ' s leaders and activists from the women movement , economist and academics. The YOWLI ' s focus was to ensure that the ACT was understood and owned by participants who would then implement it once back home.

Originally known as Vestal 's Gap , the 895 feet ( 273 m ) gap is one of the lowest crossings of the Blue Ridge in Virginia. During the colonial period the main road between Alexandria and Winchester ran through the gap. As such , part of General Edward Braddock 's army under George Washington crossed through the gap on their way to Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. By 1820 , the main route west became the newly completed Snickers Gap Turnpike which crossed the Blue Ridge to the south at Snickers Gap , and Keyes Gap lost its prominence.

It has the ability to remove Rho proteins from cellular membranes in cell-free systems. This indicates that it could regulate the available Rho proteins associated with membranes or facilitate movement of Rho from one membrane compartment to another. Rac proteins bound to Rho GDI have also been identified as components of the NADPH oxidase system that generates oxygen radicals in activated phagocytes. Rac and Rho GDI form a heterodimer required for oxidase stimulation in vitro. Along with two other cytosolic factors , the components assemble into a membrane-bound complex which uses electrons from NADPH to generate superoxide anions. Recombinant Rac proteins in their GDP-bound state can replace the requirement for Rac and Rho GDI in this system.

Agreements with more restrictions , such as the ones with specific visitation schedule or health care provisions , increase the average gap amount ( $ 570 and $ 559 , respectively ) . The intermediations of court or agency both in the process of reaching an agreement or receiving the amount settled also contribute to an increase in the default payment. These child support agreement with many restrictions have the worse combination of results possible : lower amounts granted and higher amounts in debt. These results indicate that the relationship between parents closely influences the child support results. When parents do not have to refer to third parts to solve their agreements to make the same agreements to be fulfilled , or when the agreements are very general counting on the responsibility that non-custodial parents feel in relation to their kids , the lower will be the chances that child support will not be paid or that the settled amount is below expectations . </gap.n.476><gap.n.477>Guests using facilities as a Drop In must be signed in by a military member or CAT I , II , III GAP holder ( maximum one guest ) .

Injecting different gases at kilohertz level frequencies is made possible by fluidic switching. Fluid amplifiers have been used to drive breaker contacts -- see e.g. U.S. Pat.

High frequency far-field electric stimulation has significantly higher defibrillation success compared to near-field ATP. The reentrant circuit can be anchored at a functionally or anatomically heterogeneous region , which constitutes the core of reentry. The virtual electrode theory of myocardial excitation by electric field predicts that areas near the core will experience greater polarization in response to an applied electric field compared with the surrounding , more homogeneous tissue. Various shock protocols to terminate atrial arrhythmias are contemplated. Thus , in one aspect , the region near the core of reentry can be preferentially excited with very small electric fields to destabilize or terminate anchored reentrant circuits. Once destabilized , subsequent shocks can more easily terminate the arrhythmia and restore normal sinus rhythm . </gap.n.526><gap.n.527>It is bad economics to imply that women somehow have a duty to be paid less until other financial priorities are accommodated.

In the first three quarters of 2000 , per capita cash income in rural areas increased 2.5 percent , while income in urban areas rose 8.4 percent , leaving the income gap a little wider than it was in 1978 . </gap.n.568><gap.n.569>Pressure in the spark gap can be varied through conventional means to adjust sparking conditions. Typically , the pressure in the spark gap is of the order of 75 psia , while that in the fluid switching devices may be 200 psia or more , and the pressure in the exhaust region downstream of the spark gap about atmospheric. But the fluidic injection means are made independent of such back pressure conditions through sonic orifice isolation. Such isolation also prevents random variations in back pressure from affecting the controlled injection of gases for predetermined cyclic compositional change . </gap.n.569><gap.n.570>And it was there that tavern owner Ed Joubert , trombonist Rick Chamberlain and sax player Phil Woods concocted the idea for an arts festival called the Delaware Water Gap Celebration of the Arts , or COTA.

During the summer and fall of 1784 , renegade Cherokees killed more than 100 travelers on the Kentucky side of the gap , so early settlers learned to travel in large groups for safety. One of the largest groups , numbering about 500 and including the entire Upper Spotsylvania Baptist Churh congregation from near Fredericksburg , Virginia , passed through the gap in the winter of 1781. Like others , they had to abandon their wagons , loaded with household possessions , and walk the mountain trail with only what they could carry or load on horses. The three-mile-long caravan finally crossed the gap in December , taking three weeks to cover a mere 30 miles through mud , snow and flooded streams.

The mid 90 's was the main era of social revolution , of becoming less " upright and proper " and more relaxed in their ways of life. The parents of people growing up then , most likely our grandparents ( or perhaps even great-grandparents ) would have been brought up under very different social conditions. The classes ( lower , middle and upper ) rarely intermingled , and there was basically a rule for everything , a right way to do everything. Our parents , after the social reforms , would have been much freer in their lives and decisions. Their parents , however , having grown up and lived for so long under more oppressive conditions , would not really be able to change like the teenagers/young adults. To roughly quote from the Matrix - " they can not free their minds " . </gap.n.713><gap.n.714>The activation status of the guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) -binding protein Ras is dictated by the relative intensities of two opposing reactions : the formation of active Ras-GTP complexes , promoted by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , and their conversion to inactive Ras-GDP as a result of the deactivating action of GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs ) . The relevance of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) to these processes is still unclear. The regulation of Ras activation by PI 3-kinase has been investigated in the myelomonocytic U937 cell line. These cells exhibit basal levels of Ras-GTP , which are suppressed by two PI 3-kinase inhibitors and a dominant-negative PI 3-kinase. In addition , PI 3-kinase inhibition aborts Ras activation by all stimuli tested , including fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( TPA ) . Significantly , TPA does not activate PI 3-kinase in U937 cells , indicating that PI 3-kinase has a permissive rather than an intermediary role in Ras activation. Investigation of the mechanism of PI 3-kinase action reveals that inhibition of PI 3-kinase does not affect nucleotide exchange on Ras but abrogates Ras-GTP accumulation through an increase in GAP activity. These findings establish blockage of GAP action as the mechanism underlying a permissive function of PI 3-kinase in Ras activation ( Rubio , 2000 ) </gap.n.714><gap.n.715>PFS : a philosophical question !

To give one example , at the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in 1995 , it was agreed that countries would allocate 20 of their national budgets and external assistance , respectively , to education , medical care , and other areas of social development. This is the so-called 20/20 initiative. But do commitments or outlays of 20 really mean that a country will meet this target ? If 20 of the budget is earmarked for education but is used largely to pay for heating school buildings , from an individual viewpoint the target has not yet been met and there is a need for further specific actions to promote education. Thus there are important questions to be asked regarding the impact of development assistance and welfare expenditure , and the gap between commitments and genuine improvements . </gap.n.795><gap.n.796>Front view of a 3 , 600 r.p.m. synchronous Rotary Gap.

Well , you 've come to the right place. Just in case , a gap is an area on a price chart in which there were no trades. Normally this occurs between the close of the market on one day and the next day 's open. Lot 's of things can cause this , such as an earnings report coming out after the stock market has closed for the day. If the earnings were significantly higher than expected , many investors might place buy orders for the next day. This could result in the price opening higher than the previous day 's close. If the trading that day continues to trade above that point , a gap will exist in the price chart. Gaps can offer evidence that something important has happened to the fundamentals or the psychology of the crowd that accompanies this market movement.

It has been suggested that one method of placing human rights obligations on those to whom the local authority contracts out the fulfilment of its duties is to incorporate the terms of the Human Rights Act into the contract between the private body and the local authority with third party rights for the service user. In Leonard Cheshire , Lord Woolf suggests that this may be a legal duty of local authorities under the Human Rights Act. [ 178 ] This proposed solution seeks to fill the gap in human rights protection created by contracting out the provision of public services. It would be accomplished by drafting the contract between the public authority and the private provider pursuant to the provisions of the Contracts ( Rights of Third Parties ) Act 1999. The service user would then have an enforceable right in contract against the service provider by which she could enforce her HRA rights . </gap.n.861><gap.n.862>[ 0031 ] The open state is defined wherein at least a portion of the flaps 26 , 28 adjacent the window 20 have separated exposing at least a portion of the expansion gap 24.

The distance males fall behind females , on average , appears very hard to make up , regardless of race or income. But of greater import is that the gap in averages across incomes , regardless of gender is even harder to reduce. In fact , the gap widens substantially as children age within each racial group. Thus , important as gender may be , it only exaggerates the much larger differences in achievement associated with income variation. Race does play a role , as there are differences in achievement within the same income level. This finding would suggest a need for interventions are not aimed just at one gender or one racial group . </gap.n.869><gap.n.870>The gap between income groups is quite different than anything observed in the prior half century , the survey found.

Gap1 ( m ) , which is closely related to Gap1 ( IP4BP ) , is also an IP4-binding protein; the pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) is the central IP4-binding domain. In addition to the PH domain , an adjacent GAP-related domain and carboxyl terminus are required for high affinity specific IP4 binding. The PH domain is highly conserved in the Gap1 family and also has striking homology to the amino-terminal region of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase. Substitution of Cys for Arg at position 628 in the PH domain corresponding to the mutation of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase observed in X-linked immunodeficiency mice results in a dramatic reduction of IP4 binding activity as well as the phospholipid binding capacity of Gap1 ( m ) . This mutant also shows the GAP activity against Ha-Ras is similar to that of the wild type Gap1 ( m ) . These results suggest that the PH domain of Gap1 ( m ) functions as a modulatory domain of GAP activity by binding IP4 and phospholipids ( Fukuda , 1996 ) . </gap.n.871><gap.n.872>Yet , despite its industry , it is not at all clear whether Labour still regards inequality as an issue worthy of concern within the anti-poverty strategy.

C. for an appropriate length of time. Thus , sufficient RF energy must be supplied to the porousconductor to produce this lesion-forming temperature in the adjacent tissue for the desired duration. When the flow rate of the conductive fluid medium is appropriately regulated , the conductive fluid medium flows at a sufficient rate to avoidstagnation or re-circulation and to push blood away from the gap between the catheter and the tissue. The flow rate should be high enough to prevent or minimize vaporization of the conductive fluid medium since such vaporization can inhibit delivery ofablation energy to the tissue. As previously mentioned , the distal portion of the ablation catheter forms the lesion by direct conduction of ablation energy from the porous conductor through the conductive fluid medium and into the tissue . </gap.n.978><gap.n.979>Futures trading with gaps : price gaps are the simplest of technical indicators , but that does n't mean properly analyzing them is easy.

A 1992 study by the U.S. Department of Treasury , based on a nationwide sample of 14 , 351 income tax returns filed from 1979 through 1988 , suggests there is considerable mobility between income levels. Of the people in the lowest income quintile in 1979 , 21 percent rose to the second quintile , 25 percent to the middle , 25 percent to the second-highest , and 15 percent moved up to the top quintile. In other words , 86 percent of those in the bottom income quintile in 1979 had managed to raise their incomes by enough to move to a higher quintile by 1988. Still the gap between the highest and lowest quintiles is much larger today , meaning that people in the lower quintiles have more ground to make up than in 1979 . </gap.n.995><gap.n.996>The idea of the gender gap tries to explain differences in income between genders. Culture and religion are thought to play a role in creating inequality by either encouraging or discouraging wealth-acquiring behavior , and by providing a basis for discrimination. In many countries individuals belonging to certain racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be poor. Proposed causes include cultural differences amongst different races , an educational achievement gap , and racism . </gap.n.996><gap.n.997>Use a top marine grade adhesive like Sikaflex 295UV with Sika-Primer 209 , Silpruf ( GE ) , or methacrylates to seal the window frame to the hull. All adhesives of this type cure to a flexible ( +or- 50 ) consistency. This much flex is crucial since an acrylic window expands and contracts a lot with temperature , more so than a fiberglass hull. Allow at least 1/4 " expansion gap all around the window frame to the window hole. Since the window frame is going to expand/contract with respect to the hull the adhesive must be thick enough to accommodate this lateral movement without splitting or separating from the surface it adheres to.

But the radical restructuring of Employment Insurance that took place beginning in 1996 really undercut a lot of that. And even though it wasn ' t very pronounced , the fairly light recession that took place just after the turn of the millennium actually seemed to mark the point at which women lost their momentum in terms of increasing their share of full-time jobs , and more and more new jobs for women since then have been in the part-time mode. Combine that with tax cuts that have left women literally with lower after-tax incomes overall then they would have had before , and with things like income splitting and incentives for women to focus a lot of their productive efforts in the unpaid sector , it hasn ' t taken much.

Whether or not concerns about the urban-rural income gap are justified depends , among other things , on the true magnitude of the gap and also on the factors that underlie the gap. Using a new and rich data , this study investigates the size of China 's urban-rural income gap , the contribution of that gap to overall inequality , and the factors underlying the gap in 1995 and 2002. The analysis improves on past estimates by adjusting for spatial price differences and including migrants. It also measures the extent to which the urban-rural income gap is due to differences in household and individual characteristics , rather than the advantages of location of residence.

So whether or not the near axon ( end which enters the cord ) actually carries pain signal is influenced by the connections that have already hit the cell body , which then decides the frequency of firing it will send to the near axon. Little globs or vesicles of excitatory chemicals are released from the near axon into the synaptic junction.

The main point is that , in our analysis , volatility of rural incomes reduces their certainty equivalent value relative to observed incomes and significantly worsens rather than ameliorates relative poverty in China.

Second , it believes this civilian elite to be ignorant of , and even hostile to , the armed forces eager to employ the military as a laboratory for social change , even at the cost of crippling its warfighting capacity. Third , it discounts the specter of eroding civilian control because it sees a military so thoroughly inculcated with an ethos of subordination that there is now too much civilian control. Fourth , because support for the military among the general public remains sturdy , any gap in values is inconsequential. The problem , if anything , is with the civilian elite. </gap.n.1404><gap.n.1405>The new shop is called Love , and will feature a wide array of bags , shoes , belts , flower pins , gloves , hats and scarves.

An arc can be created and the electrodes moved further apart while an arc is maintained. The voltage supplied could not jump the now greater distance between electrodes but since there is now a conductive path the voltage can travel a greater distance. Arc welding is a good example of this. As long as the air is kept at a high enough temperature the arc will continue. The arc will quench or go out when the temperature drops to the point where the air can no longer exist in a conductive plasma state. If the current through the arc is decreased the temperature decreases. If the current decreases to a low enough value , the temperature decreases to the point where the arc will quench. The arc can also be quenched by cooling the plasma by other means such as blowing a cool gas or air across the arc. If the arc is cooled enough , the arc will quench even if the current available is still high . </gap.n.1414><gap.n.1415>It meats that people ca n't speak confidence , that is what I think .For example , my father and I ca n't speak confidence and I ca n't speak more sentence with him.That is my mind with the words , I hope we do n't have generation gap . </gap.n.1415><gap.n.1416>Synchronous rotary spark gaps use a disc which rotates at a speed that is locked to the supply frequency.

This means that the electrodes line-up at regular intervals which occur at precisely the same place in each cycle of the AC supply. This causes a series of evenly timed firings with consistent voltages. The graph below shows an example of the firing waveform obtained using a synchronous spark gap which fires at 100 BPS with a supply frequency of 50 Hz.

Places with good schools may also be more appealing to migrants who bring creative and entrepreneurial skills and presumably higher earnings into the community. In addition , better schools may benefit rural youth by improving their preparation for either the labor market or further schooling , in either case raising their expected earnings. Firms that employ high-skill , highly paid employees may also be more likely to locate in areas with a better-educated workforce.

Among the numerous benefits , were Canada to initiate a GAP-based biodiversity mapping program in coordination with the U.S. and Mexico , would be a greatly enhanced capacity for continental biodiversity assessment and protection. But there are concerns about the amount of data available in Canada for developing species data layers.

This seemed to sort out the problem of the air circulation. I say 'seemed to ' because it works when the sealed unit is brand new , but , if I have my facts right ( someone correct me if I am wrong ) , sometimes up to 100 of the argon in this type of unit will have seeped out by the time it is three years old ! Not all sealed units lose all of the argon in such a short time. Some will lose only 1 a year , BUT the biggest issue is how full of argon they are in the first place. Often the method of filling the units with Argon can be very hit and miss and dependent on the skill of the operator , not necessarily on a metering machine.

An ideal system would be very expensive and high-maintenance. Therefore , a law regulating income withholding has the good intention of creating a new support for children with an absent parent , although its effect it is not easily predictable.

This was the normal method of receiving radio signals in 1901. In its most usual form , the coherer consists of a mass of metal filings lying in a small air gap between two metal plugs fitted tightly into a glass tube. One plug is connected to the receiving antenna , the other to earth. On reception of an RF pulse , the filings coherer moves to a low resistance state. Marconi refined the filings coherer as a result of many careful experiments. The Italian Navy coherer is a further development involving adding a small drop of mercury or carbon particles to the metal filings and using one plug composed of carbon. The phenomenon involves the breakdown of the thin oxide layers on the surfaces of the metal to form a good metal-to-metal contact. In essence , the coherer is the first solid state rectifier.

The court held that Second Generation did not meet its burden to show that there was a significant gap in coverage or its burden to show that the gap could not be filled by other means. It found that a gap is significant only if the area in question is not served by any carrier. Id. at *3. The court found that U.S. Cellular provided roaming service and Nextel might provide regular service along the relevant portion of Route 128. Id. It noted that Second Generation 's propagation study did not consider the possibility that a carrier could obtain a waiver of the Ordinance 's 199-foot height limitation and build a taller tower in the Overlay Zone. Id. In addition , the court observed that Second Generation failed to investigate whether other sites outside the Overlay Zone could provide the necessary service. Id.

The next day the markets gapped open at 7610 and have never looked back , leaving an opening gap at 7483 that will get filled at a future date. The point is that the markets made a huge move overnight , leaving behind all participants who were not already long , and of course inflicting as much pain as possible on traders who were short.

It is also evident that the number of NTSLs for countries at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere is much greater in comparison with those at similar latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere.

The young are generally more supportive of modern or egalitarian gender roles than older age groups are and have generally become more modern over time ( on 7 of 8 items ) , but their modern edge is declining mostly because older age groups have moved toward the modern perspective even more than the young have and thus closed the generation gap. For example , 26.1 of the young in 1973 agreed that women should stay home and men should run the country as did 60.2 of the old for a generation gap of 34.1.

More than likely , branch lengths much larger than 0.6 are responsible for this observation , but Figure 5 does not have the resolution to detect a more precise threshold. The observation that alignment identity improves at the longest branch lengths can be attributed to the fact that sequences at long branch lengths , although related , are saturated with indels and thus have very few nucleotides homologous to one another anymore.

From 1978 to 1995 , the urbanization rate improved 0.65 percentage point annually on average; while during 1996 to 2005 , urbanization rate grew at 1.4 percentage points annually. Additionally , the PRC 's regulations on population migration from rural to urban areas have significantly relaxed recently , and this has resulted in a huge amount of rural labor moving to urban areas.

We also noted wide differences in accuracy among smaller taxonomic divisions , which appear to relate both to problems in modeling distribution and also to relative completeness of inventory . </gap.n.1739><gap.n.1740>Initial Tap Sampling for Pb and Cu - Between JUL-01-2006 and AUG-02-2006 , Contaminant : Lead &amp;Copper Rule.

The general consensus is to connect anything you will touch during operation of the Tesla coil to the house or building ground. Anything that may be struck by an arc , or that may experience high voltage transients , should be connected to RF ground. The general idea is to pass all high voltage generated by the Tesla coil to the RF ground. We also need to prevent any high voltage spikes making their way into the house or building wiring. The NST seems to be a good boundary between the house wiring and the Tesla coil wiring because the primary and secondary windings are basically isolated from each other. Therefore , anything connected between the house outlet and the NST ( variac , control panel , line filter ) should be grounded to the house ground. The bottom of the secondary coil , the primary strike rail , NST protection gap and filter should be connected to RF ground. Grounding the NST case seems to have caused the most confusion. I recommend connecting it to the RF ground because it 's usually more likely to be struck by an arc or experience a voltage spike . </gap.n.1741><gap.n.1742>If you are using a rotary gap , make sure that the screws on the rotor and the screws on the stationary post are as close as possible.

Historical climate data were acquired from the National Climatic Data Center ( NCDN ) and include records from 1840 to 1991. Data were converted into INFO tables and exported to ARC/INFO to generate climate coverages using TOPOGRID and KRIGING tools. Historical climate data will be used to describe possible correlation with changes in populations of scaled quail. Other coverages such as soils , land use , and vegetation are under development. The final product of this research will provide a tool for development of management plans for the species at the county and ecoregion level. This approach may also prove the usefulness of GAP data to describe the effect of long-term habitat modification on other wildlife species . </gap.n.1744><gap.n.1745>The recreation area was originally envisioned as lands surrounding the proposed Tocks Island Reservoir.

This is the same data that was used to produce the famous conclusion that the tax gap ( the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid ) for that year was $ 290 billion. The authors supplement this data with estimates of additional unreported income by the IRS. They find that people whose real adjusted gross income ( AGI ) is between half a million and a million dollars fail to report 21 percent of their income on average.

Double bind implies an unbearable subjective tension ( the proverbial mother who explicitly enjoins her son to go away and start an autonomous life , but whose message between the lines is a desperate call to stay with her; the father who tells his son to act autonomously , so that if the son effectively does it , her thereby asserts his subordination to his father , since he followed his injunction ) , while the non-performative works smoothly , enabling you as it were to have a cake and eat it , i.e. , to assert your superiority over the Other in/through the very gesture of guaranteeing his equality and your respect for his difference . </gap.n.1814><gap.n.1815>At DentalPlans.com , you will find an unbeatable selection of discount dental plans in Wind Gap to choose from.

Long sparks load the secondary winding and remove energy from the system quickly so that the spark gap can quench at the earliest opportunity. An extreme example of this is found when the toroid arcs to a nearby grounded target. The arc to ground presents a low resistance across the secondary. In this case all of the energy is taken out of the system in a very short time. The spark gap has no option but to quench because the system is devoid of energy.

Few of his proposals may be tried in the current political climate , where far more pressure goes toward abolishing inheritance taxes altogether.

Insert one .028 " static gap ( distance between each electrode in this unit ) in series for every 2000 volts of line input to the coil , then set the rotary gap adjustment so that the coil system fires smoothly and reliably. Suppose your rotary system has a 12 kv line input : every electrode on the cylinder static gap unit is gapped at .028 " , and you need a total of 6 of these static gaps in series with the rotary for the system to function properly at 12000 volts. There is no limit to the number of parallel paths that can be theoretically used , but two is the practical limit with this design. Two cylinder static gaps hooked up for parallel operation , and run in series with the rotary will provide excellent quenching up to 2 kva continuous , 3.6 kva intermittent. Your rotary will require a much smaller gap , and your quench time will have dropped considerably. Your rotary will run cooler , your run times will be longer , and your secondary spark will be better . </gap.n.1884><gap.n.1885>I often end up at this store when we are out at Reston Town Center.

First of all , metro-nonmetro differences can exist because of differences in the characteristics of workers or because of differences in how those characteristics are rewarded in nonmetro vs. metro areas. Second , differences in the cost of living between nonmetro and metro areas can also influence the earnings gap. Nonmetro workers may be willing to accept lower earnings than they might otherwise receive in metro areas because they have lower expenses for housing , food , and other essentials. However , there is no easy way to quantify cost-of-living differences and so there is a wide dispersion in estimates of the differences. In any case , it appears unlikely that cost-of-living differences can fully explain the large nonmetro-metro earnings gaps faced by the most educated and skilled workers. Third , differences in cultural , natural , and other amenities may also influence wage differences , as workers may accept lower wages in order to live and work in more desirable locations.

If your kids are young , you might even want a kid dentist -- a dentist in Wind Gap who specializes in the dental needs of infants and children. A children 's dentist , also called a pediatric dentist , undergoes additional training to prepare for working with children. A Wind Gap cosmetic dentist can also provide dental care for the entire family. Wind Gap dentists who work with children can even teach parents and kids proper dental care and ways to prevent cavities . </gap.n.1949><gap.n.1950>The races remain deeply divided over affirmative action. But African Americans have become somewhat less supportive of making every effort to improve the position of blacks and other minorities , if that means according them preferential treatment. A 55 majority of African Americans express that view , down from about two-thirds in the early values surveys. Consequently , the black-white gap over that issue , once as large as 51 points , has decreased to 31 points . </gap.n.1950><gap.n.1951>Currently , many Canadians do not feel secure in their jobs or in their financial situations , and 39 believe that poverty is as near as one or two missed pay cheques. There are several factors that are known to contribute to this insecurity and to the growing gap. One reason is that many people face unemployment or precarious employment due to a lack of education and skills-based training. Education has had a particularly large bearing on the growing gap . </gap.n.1951><gap.n.1952>On average , diabetes patients incurred $ 2182 in total drug costs during 2006 , with a mean of $ 807 in out-of-pocket drug costs to patients. Figure 2 shows the amount of total and out-of-pocket drug expenditures for the MAPD beneficiaries in the study who did and did not reach the coverage gap in 2006. For those who did not reach the gap , both total drug expenditures and out-of-pocket drug expenditures remained stable over time during the year. For the 26 of MAPD patients in the study who reached the coverage gap in 2006 , total drug costs were much higher overall and decreased toward the end of the year as out-of-pocket drug expenses increased. Analysis-of-variance tests of the differences in drug costs showed that the decrease in total drug costs between quarter 3 and quarter 4 of 2006 and the quarterly increases in out-of-pocket costs for these patients were significant ( P &lt; .01 ) . </gap.n.1952><gap.n.1953>-- Younger people are more likely to embrace technology. About 75 percent of adults 18 to 30 went online daily , compared with 40 percent of those 65 to 74 and about 16 percent for people 75 and older. The age gap widened over cell phones and text messaging. About 6 percent of those 65 and older used a cell phone for most or all of their calls; 11 percent sent or received text messages. That 's compared with 64 percent of adults under 30 for cell phone use and 87 percent for texting . </gap.n.1953><gap.n.1954>Wind Gap Used Chevrolet Venture Cars. Use Yahoo !

However , we observed that TI response duration can change dramatically with stimulus conditions. This can be seen in the rate/intensity function shown in Fig. 1 , in which increasing the intensity of acoustic stimulation not only diminished spike counts , but also increased the duration of the inhibitory response. A second factor having a profound influence on TI unit response duration was background noise level. For example , the control PST histograms of the TI unit in Fig. 4 ( top row ) show an obvious decrease in inhibitory duration at higher background noise levels. In quiet , the inhibition ended about 240 ms into the control PST histogram. In the 12 dB S/N condition , the same 65 dB SPL white noise burst produced an inhibitory response which ended about 50 ms sooner . </gap.n.1955><gap.n.1956>generation gap often make some unpleasant between old people and young people.because they often have different idea in the same thing.And usually their 's idea is contrarily , so the generation gap is make . </gap.n.1956><gap.n.1957>Nonfiling and underpayment of reported taxes account for less than 20 percent of the gross tax gap; underreporting on timely filed tax returns makes up the bulk of the gap.

Observing the Gap For our analysis , we will work with an adjusted version of the parties ' support as at 1-Sep-2006 , using polls from 7-Jul-2006 to 20-Aug-2006. Those support figures are Con 37.18 , Lab 32.59 , LibDem 20.86 . We adjust the Con and Lab figures to be equal at their average value of 34.88 .

If rich person A has an income of R100 000 and poor person B has R1000 ( a typical rich-poor ratio ) the gap is R99 000. The gap will be about R10 000 bigger ( R99 000 to R108 900 ) if they both get 10 percent richer ( R110 000 and R1100 respectively ) . </gap.n.1964><gap.n.1965>GAP for MacOS also contains a simple built-in text editor , which is mainly intended to create GAP files.

A key conclusion of the HBS is that the average disposable income of households in the top two quintiles of the earning distribution ( ie with a gross weekly income in excess of EUR 1 , 339.22 ) increased by over 61 between 1994/5 and 1999/2000 , compared with an increases of 37 in the bottom two quintiles ( ie with a gross weekly income below EUR 214.46 ) . The ratio between the average weekly disposable income of households in the lowest income quintile ( EUR 106.23 ) in 1999/2000 , compared with those in the highest quintile ( EUR 1 , 428.71 ) , was approximately 13 to 1 , compared with 11 to 1 in 1994/95 . </gap.n.1973><gap.n.1974>Poverty is prevented by managing your income.

It can be seen from figure 3 that the northern edge of the gap is well defined due to the large thermal contrast across the Mendocino fracture zone. This is not the case at the southern edge where small thermal contrasts , stalled slab pieces and less pronounced clear edges are further complicated by incomplete plate reconstructions due to possible overriding of the North American plate ( Page and Brocher , 1993 ) . The exact boundary is therefore ill defined . </gap.n.1976><gap.n.1977>At the outset we wish to express our strong support for your stated commitment to human rights democracy and the rule of law as well as your determination to address long-standing problems in these areas.

For example , when I say ' 20mm air gap ' ( add the 4mm + 4mm glass ) this would be for a sealed unit with an overall thickness of 28mm. In my view , this is quite an over-hyped subject. Let me explain why I say this. In the early days of double glazing we had a 6mm air gap , and thought that was marvellous compared to single glazing. As things advanced a few manufacturers moved up to an 8mm air gap ( and the salesman could say ' ours is better because ... ' ) . A 12mm air gap followed and became the norm , with scientifically measured fact sheets to prove it performed a lot better than the early 6mm air gap , as it most certainly did . </gap.n.1983><gap.n.1984>Sep 18 , 2009 By exploring the many trails in the Delaware Water Gap area , visitors not only get a chance to Everything was great , service and food , a wonderful family.

However , we do n't want to go around twitching with every insignificant bump , so a place was provided where integration of sensory inputs could occur. That place is called a synapse. It is a physical break , which is crossed by chemicals , which are themselves under control from higher brain centers. The chemical message across the synaptic junction travels at a mere 2mm per minute. Fortunately the gap is only about one-millionth of an inch , so even at slow speed the signal requires only about 0.6 milliseconds to cross. This delay of the synapse allows interneurons time to excite or inhibit the system and upregulate or downregulate the reactivity in sensory and muscle fibers. If there were no input at the synapse , every signal might cause a muscle twitch . </gap.n.2015><gap.n.2016>There are no hard-and-fast rules that determine one gap a Breakaway and another Common , but a few general guidelines can be used to help differentiate between the two. The fist is time-based. If the opening price on a gap to the upside stands as the low after the first 30 minutes of trading , the gap will most likely be of the Breakaway kind. And , on a downside gap , if the open remains the highest price traded within the first 30 minutes , there is a high likelihood that the gap is of a Breakaway nature. Another consideration is the magnitude of the gap. An opening gap level that falls below the levels noted below can generally be regarded as Common. Gap levels that are greater than the ones noted below can be thought of as Breakaway. If a gap level falls between the two we can think of it as having an equal chance to develop as either Common or Breakaway. Remember that these levels are to be used only as a very rough rule-of-thumb.

To date , there are few established guidelines detailing a state 's GAP data sets ' appropriate usefulness at different planning and management scales. We feel the largest issue , which has yet to be clearly examined , is resolution -- both spatial and categorical. The second issue is how the modeling of the species/habitat relations is being conducted. We feel that with the use of simple geographic analysis tools the output of most models can be refined. We will refer to this method as the 'Missouri method ' for lack of a better term. By incorporating more of the specifics of the species niche as well as its view of the landscape , the results of the vertebrate modeling , and therefore the final gap analysis , can potentially be significantly different . </gap.n.2020><gap.n.2021>Today ( Thursday ) was a mixed day at court.

It is well known that particular industries pay more than others , and our results show that these industries , on average , have higher concentrations of men. The opposite occurs for women. Education and age are the most important factors for explaining the wage- and percent-female relationship. If education and age capture personal preferences that influence occupational choice , then solely focusing on expanding occupational choice will result in a small narrowing of the gender wage gap.16 This is because , as shown in our Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions , even after we add the concentration of women in an occupation to the model , the overall gender wage gap is still largely unexplained . </gap.n.2022><gap.n.2023>Economists and professors have also offered proximate explanations for the tax gap beyond these three categories.

Wortmannin pretreatment of U937 cells does not alter GAP activity as assayed from cell lysates. This suggests that membrane integrity is important for PI3-kinase-mediated inhibition of GAPs. Considering that Ras can activate PI 3-kinase through a direct interaction with the p110 catalytic subunit , these data suggest the following scenario. Active Ras could activate PI 3-kinase to induce spatially restricted generation of 3-phosphoinositides. This would promote local downregulation of relevant GAP species and thus allow basal Ras activation ( Rubio , 2000 ) . </gap.n.2030><gap.n.2031>The Revised Regulations provide that , although the 12 months still need not be consecutive , employment prior to a continuous break in service of seven years or more does not need to be counted.

However , the DOL received comments that any cap on the break in service was contrary to the admittedly ambiguous language of the Regulations , and that women who take extended leaves from the workforce to care for children or ill family members might be particularly adversely affected by the change. In extending the permissible gap to seven years , the DOL expressed its belief that it strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of employers , many of whom retain records for seven years , and employees . </gap.n.2031><gap.n.2032>25 of Wind Gap residents report German ancestry , and 11 report Irish.

A lot of people believe the income gap is caused by corruption and illegal income , which are typical of an ill-developed system. At present , the government is trying to resolve a series of problems left over from the old system , especially corruption. The basic definition of corruption is to use public resources for private benefits. Under the traditional Chinese system , this was easily done. Corruption occurs when preference is given. The market-oriented reform aims to restore a large number of private rights. Corruption is not a problem caused by reform. Instead , it is exposed in the process of reform.

In schools with PA , on the other hand , students in high-minority schools engaged in only an average of 0.8 problem behaviors , only twice as many as students in moderate-minority school ( 0.4 ) .

Often the gap will continue to short after the cap voltage has fallen below it 's peak. This happens because the air between the gap becomes ionized when the gap shorts. The ionized air is more conductive and allows the gap to remain shorted. The performance of a static gap can be improved by blowing air through the gap. This is called " quenching " the gap. The goal of quenching is to blow the ionized air out of the gap. I 've used 12 volt computer case fans , other 's have used vacuum cleaner motors.

Our attempt to bridge the gap between the views of culture typical in the disciplines of biology and psychology and to find some common ground between them was therefore destined to be greeted with some skepticism-and indeed it has been. For one commentator , we are much too generous in attributing culture to chimpanzees ( Galef ) , whereas for another we underappreciate the cultural abilities of both macaques and chimpanzees ( McGrew ) . From a modern cultural-anthropological point of view , we are too reductionist in talking of culture as processes of " transmission " ( Ingold ) , whereas from a more biological point of view we complicate things unnecessarily by distinguishing cognitive processes that really amount to the same thing ( Byrne ) .

God created a perfect , sinless earth and placed upon it a perfect , sinless man. This man , Adam , enjoyed close fellowship with his Creator until he sinned and broke the perfect relationship between God and man. Ever since that time , death and degradation have plagued God ' s once-perfect creation , and man has been separated from God. However , the shedding of Christ ' s innocent blood on the cross can restore man ' s fellowship with God and provide him eternal life. Through Adam ' s sin , death entered into the world; but through Christ ' s sacrifice , salvation is made possible ( Romans 5 : 19 ) . Therein lies the gap theory ' s greatest error , the placement of sin and death prior to the existence of Adam.

However , most gender wage comparisons leave out part-time workers and focus only on full-time , year-round workers. A close look at the earnings of women and men who work 40 hours or more per week reveals that the wage gap may actually widen as the number of hours worked increases. Women working 41 to 44 hours per week earn 84.6 of what men working similar hours earn; women working more than 60 hours per week earn only 78.3 of what men in the same time category earn ( Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics ) . Furthermore , women may work longer to receive the promotions that provide access to higher pay. For example , among school principals , women have an average of 3 years longer as teachers than men do ( Source : National Center for Education Statistics ) . So it is hard to argue that women ' s lower earnings are simply a result of women putting in fewer hours per week , or even fewer years than men . </gap.n.2258><gap.n.2259>I was hiking near Delaware Water Gap when I turned the corner and saw this guy staring at me.

In recent times the concept of human rights has come to incorporate the rights of women , of children , of migrant workers and their families , as well as the right to development. This year , we observe the International Year of the World 's Indigenous People as a further example of the scope to which human rights have been extended. But there is , unfortunately , still a wide gap between international aspirations on human rights and the reality of their implementation.

When a suitable voltage is supplied , a spark forms , ionizing the gas and drastically reducing its electrical resistance. An electric current then flows until the path of ionized gas is broken. This happens usually when the voltage drops , but in some cases when the heated gas rises , stretching out and then breaking the filament of ionized gas. Usually the action of ionizing the gas is violent and disruptive , often leading to sound ( ranging from a snap for a spark plug to thunder for a lightning discharge ) , light and heat. The visible spark is light not coming off the electron current , but the material medium fluorescing in response to collisions from the electrons exciting its electron orbitals to high , excited states and dropping them repeatedly.

Besides , the goods produced by the countries of the South become less valuable for the developed countries. Such circumstance enables the poor countries to produce more in order to buy even less products from the rich countries. It reduces the ability of the poor countries to manage the global economy because their products are not needed and their opinion is not counted by the rich countries.

First , fibers that originate from the 2nd and 3rd layer of the entorhinal cortex travel to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus , via the perforant path. This is an odd arrangement because where these fibers travel , there is actually no continuity between the dentate gyrus and the subiculum; the fibers perforate the outer edge of the subiculum , travel through a tiny gap and enter the dentate gyrus. This is the source of the major input to the hippocampus. Two parts of the perforant path can be recognized as lateral and medial paths - given their name from the source of origin in the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex . </gap.n.2527><gap.n.2528>Large gaps ( more than 50 Dax points ) indicate an elongation of the current market.

The nitrogen will now flow through conduit 25L and V1 substituting for the sulfur hexafluoride flow. This again will maintain the pressure across orifices V1 , V2 and V3. As the sulfur hexafluoride replaces the helium in the gap , the standoff voltage rises rapidly and the gap becomes nonconducting in a minimum amount of time. Once the standoff voltage of the gap reaches or exceeds approximately that of VN 2 , the fluidics controller 28 provides a deflecting control jet at the right of switch 24 causing the flow of sulfur hexafluoride to switch from conduit 24R to conduit 24L and to flow through orifice V1 while nitrogen from source 20 flows through junction 25 into conduit 24R and through orifice V3.

When a sufficiently high voltage is applied , a spark will bridge the gap , ionizing the gas and drastically reducing its electrical resistance. An electric current then flows until the path of ionized gas is broken or the current is reduced below a minimum value called the 'holding current'. This usually occurs when the voltage across the gap drops sufficiently , but the process may also be assisted by cooling the spark channel or by physically separating the electrodes. This breaks the conductive filament of ionized gas , allowing the capacitor to recharge , and permitting the recharging/discharging cycle to repeat. The action of ionizing the gas is quite sudden and violent ( disruptive ) , and it creates a sharp sound ( ranging from a snap for a spark plug , to a loud bang for a wider gap ) . The spark gap also liberates light and heat . </gap.n.2597><gap.n.2598>Teller 1 ( Morton 's Gap ) Location : Kentucky-Mortons Gap Become a part of our energetic team as a bank teller !

When the clock gap is valid , it indicates that the clock is invalid; and when the clock gap is invalid , it indicates that the clock is valid. In other words , an equivalent low-speed clock is obtained by combining the clock gap and the clock. The clock gap means that the valid indication of the clock gap is quite uniform. The switchover controlling unit 350 operates in the domain of the high-speed local oscillator clock. When the active/standby selection control is switched to a certain path , the switchover controlling unit 350 locks the current output water line of this path as the phase discriminator water line , and subsequently adjusts to speed up or slow down the read speed of the path RAM units by generating a high-speed clock gap. In this manner , the current water line of the selected working path is ensured to remain at the position of the phase discriminator water line , and the read address itself is added by 1 in each valid high-speed local oscillator clock period . </gap.n.2612><gap.n.2613>Are you having a difficult time getting DSL or cable in the De Water Gap Pennsylvania area ?

This was an advantage when there were a number of stations on the air operating at near the same wavelength. Wireless telegraphy would have been more difficult if all signals had sounded the same. Thus if two or more spark transmitters were operating at the same time , each receiver was likely to get all of them.

The typical large back strap on the Glock grip helps absorb energy by spreading the force out. If you slim down a G21 grip , the perceived recoil will also be affected. For example , the new XD 45 ACP pistol has slightly more felt recoil since the backstrap is smaller.

By stimulating the excitable gap near the core of the circuit , the reentry can be disrupted and terminated. The reentrant circuit is anchored at a functionally or anatomically heterogeneous region , which constitutes the core of reentry. Areas near the heterogeneous regions ( including the region of the core of reentry ) will experience greater polarization in response to an applied electric field compared with the surrounding , more homogeneous tissue. Thus , the region near the core of reentry can be preferentially excited with very small electric fields to destabilize or terminate anchored reentrant circuits.

Lomov points that any activity has an internal and external side and they are related without any gap to each another. The division of activity in Internalization/Externalization is really artificial. Any external activity is supported by processes that are originated inside the subject and internal process appears in one way or another in the external world. The most important for Activity theory should be not make this artificial division and the find out how they are related to each other but while studying the 'external side ' of the activity discover the 'internal side. ' According to Vygotskij internalization is social by its very nature. The range of actions done by a person in cooperation with others comprises the so called 'zone of proximal development. ' Externalization is the opposite of internalization. Mental process manifest themselves in external actions performed by a person , so they can be verified and corrected , if necessary. Activity theory emphasizes that it is not just mental representation that gets placed on someone 's head; it is holistic activity , including motor activity and the use of artifact . </gap.n.2740><gap.n.2741>Gap View Estates by Gibraltor is now open ! 11 lots/homes near Wind Gap Park , shopping , Rts. 33 &amp;512..chose colors..spacious &amp;attractive </gap.n.2741><gap.n.2742>The body has to be trained and skillful.

However , because the city 's household population has consistently outpaced housing production , the estimated basic housing gap has been remarkably stable at approximately 15 , 000 dwelling units per year.

Among the measured characteristics , the two most important factors contributing to a narrowing of the gender wage gap between 1970 and 1995 have been improvements in women 's relative labor market experience and improvements in their relative occupational status. Changes in unionism also benefitted women relative to men , but have played a smaller role. Although substantial , shifts in employment across industries have had relatively little effect on the gender pay gap. Increases in the returns to skill and increasing wage differences across occupations and industries -- particularly in the 1980s -- dampened women 's relative wage gains , since women were disproportionately represented among the less-skilled and in lower-paying occupations . </gap.n.2830><gap.n.2831>Placing a vacancy with gap personnel could n't be easier.

For example , a gap may exist due to congenital malformations , because of ischemic disease , or because a heart has been damaged by a previous heart attack. A gap may also be created when congestive heart failure , e.g. , cardiomyopathy , or some other type of distress causes a heart to be enlarged. When a heart is enlarged , the walls of the heart , e.g. , wall 134 of a left ventricle , may stretch or dilate , causing posterior leaflet 216 to stretch. It should be appreciated that anterior leaflet 212 generally does not stretch. As shown in FIG. 2 b , a gap 220 between anterior leaflet 212 and stretched posterior leaflet 216 is created when wall 134 stretches. Hence , due to the existence of gap 220 , mitral valve 116 is unable to close properly , and may begin to leak . </gap.n.2884><gap.n.2885>The other option is to take the middle one out and connect the 2 remaining middle screws together and the spark source connected to the outside screws.

However , direct adjustment of income for volatility has been overlooked thus far in the poverty debate in China. If rural incomes are considerably more volatile than urban incomes , as is true today in China volatility should worsen the relative poverty picture , not ameliorate it as results from existing chronic-transient decomposition implicitly suggest. Higher rural volatility reflects weather and other features which urban residents do not face. This difference in income volatility between urban and rural residents thus has implications for both the size of urban rural income gap and for other distributional summary statistics , such as the Gini coefficient and the Theil measure if volatility corrected measures of income are used . </gap.n.2890><gap.n.2891>This paper addresses issues related to measurement of the tax gap the difference between tax liability under the current Federal tax law and taxes paid. First , I discuss how the tax gap is defined , review the main components of the tax gap , and discuss how the IRS estimates it. I then review some major methodological issues in estimating the tax gap and some weaknesses of the current estimates. The United States leads the world in tax gap estimation ( some might consider this a dubious honor ) , but estimating that which does not happen ( taxes that theoretically should be paid , but are not ) is inherently much more difficult than estimating observed quantities such as GDP , employment or revenues actually collected. So while tax gap estimates can certainly be improved , there will always be significant uncertainty attached to any tax gap estimate. The final section of the paper includes some brief observations on the use and potential misuse of tax gap estimates and how better compliance data might lead to better tax law administration . </gap.n.2891><gap.n.2892>Since the day we were founded 40 years ago , Gap has remained committed to doing the right thing : for our business , for local communities and for the planet.

In an asynchronous gap , the rotation of the motor had no fixed relationship relative to the incoming AC waveform. Asynchronous gaps worked quite well and were much easier to maintain. By using a larger number of rotating studs or a higher rotational speed , many asynchronous gaps operated at break rates in excess of 400 breaks/second. Since the gap could be fired more often than the input waveform switched polarity , the tank capacitor was charged and discharged more rapidly than a synchronous gap. However , each discharge would occur at a varying voltage that was almost always lower than the consistent peak voltage obtained from a synchronous gap . </gap.n.2895><gap.n.2896>'Teaching Gap ' Exists Among US And Asian Math Teachers , Study Says ( May 25 , 2007 ) Compared to math teachers in the high-achieving nations of Hong Kong and Japan , teachers in the United States offer less of certain supports that could help students learn more.

The minimum voltage drop across the gap is largely determined by electrode materials , gap distance and the gas between the electrodes. The current flowing through the arc channel rises from the moment of break down until a maximum current value is reached. This maximum amount of current is determined by the circuit feeding the spark gap. From the moment of initial break down until the voltage drop reaches its minimum value the V I curve will have a negative slope so this is when the spark gap is said to have negative resistance . </gap.n.2897><gap.n.2898>In the U.S. , seven-in-ten ( 71 ) people ages 65 and older want to shield their way of life from foreign influence , while just over half ( 55 ) of those ages 18 to 29 agree.

The first involves context. It is a platitude that what a sentence means generally does n't determine what a speaker means in uttering it. The gap between linguistic meaning and speaker meaning is said to be filled by " context " : we say that what the speaker means somehow " depends on context , " or that " context makes it clear " what the speaker means. But there are two quite different sorts of context -- call them wide and narrow context -- and they play quite different roles. Wide context concerns any contextual information that is relevant to determining , in the sense of ascertaining , the speaker 's intention. Narrow context concerns information specifically relevant to determining , in the sense of providing , the semantic values of context-sensitive expressions ( and morphemes of tense and aspect ) . Wide context does not literally determine anything.

The spark gap is formed by two wires , approximately vertical but gradually diverging away from each other towards the top. When a high voltage is applied , a spark forms across the bottom of the wires , lowering the voltage by applying load to the electrical power supply. The heated , ionized air rises , carrying the current path with it. As the trail of ionization gets longer , it becomes more unstable , finally breaking. Since the load is removed , the voltage rises and the spark re-forms at the bottom of the device. This cycle leads to an exotic-looking display of electric cyan or blue sparks which is often seen in movies about mad scientists . </gap.n.2997><gap.n.2998>I have been looking forward to this opportunity to address the National Press Club on the gender gap in voting , abortion , affirmative action , and the Radical Right.

Many other steps could and should be taken. The most important thing is to recognise that patronising or token responses to Maori issues are no longer adequate.

This is not an easy transition to make and few people relinquish power willingly. Without such changes , however , the gap between Maori and Pakeha will widen beyond repair , and the legacy of benign neglect to which the above solutions are addressed will erupt into a full-scale confrontation , for which mutually acceptable solutions will no longer be possible.

Experimental methods generate increasing amounts of data. New computational methods , high-performance computer hardware , and powerful software environments are evolving rapidly. As a result , the importance of computational materials science is growing. The following cases illustrate the current capabilities : computed thermochemical and mechanical properties of metal hydrides show trends in the heats of formation and the hydrogen-induced softening of elastic moduli; a study of the effect of impurities on the strength of a Ni grain boundary reveals hydrogen as an embrittler and boron as a strengthener; ab initio phonon calculations for hydrogen impurities in aluminum show a temperature-dependent site - preference; the screened-exchange approach predicts accurate energy band gaps of semiconductors; a computational screening of hydro-desulphurization catalysts points to new combinations. The major current challenges for computational materials science include more accurate total energies , unified methods to deal with multi-phase systems , e. g. , solid/liquid , novel approaches to determine complex kinetic processes , and novel concepts to bridge the atomistic and the macroscopic scales . </gap.n.3032><gap.n.3033>2.

The structure of the system of unemployment benefits with high gross replacement rates at low income and declining replacement rates as income rises implies that the income gaps at the bottom of the wage scale depends almost solely on the level of the unemployment benefits. Thus a change in the marginal tax rate has limited influence on the income gap. This also means that the possibility of using general tax policies to alter the income gaps for low-income earners is fairly limited.

Some states , such as North Carolina , reclassied land cover to a habitat map to show the distribution of broad habitat types. Other states made a subset of land cover that corresponded to natural vegetation to help identify potential conservation opportunity areas.

Analyzing the details of these figures reveals that , rather than the difference between rich and poor within the same generation as shown by the opinion polls , there is a yet greater cause for the growing disparity : Japan 's aging demographics. Comparing the older generation with that of middle-aged and younger generations shows that there has been a sizeable disparity within the older generation from the beginning. The vast majority of the older generation is retired and receives little income. In contrast to this , the wealth of a small number of people from this generation-managers , asset holders , etc.-has resulted in an intra-generational gap more pronounced than that of the younger generations. As the aging of the demographic structure continues , the Gini coefficient 's results reflect the large disparity within the growing older generation. Viewed in this light , the recent increase in the Gini coefficient is miniscule , and moreover the income gap is only slight . </gap.n.3128><gap.n.3129>" The way we see this , " says the AFL-CIO 's Nussbaum , " is , yes -- if you 're right out of school with a college education and no children , then you can earn somewhat near what men earn.

On an issue of such obvious importance as immigration it would be desirable if the country could come to some consensus on policy. This survey suggests that such a consensus is extremely unlikely. If anything , the evidence suggests that the gap between the American people and their leaders is growing. It is unclear how long immigration policy can remain so divergent from public opinion. It seems likely that at some point a politician or group of politicians will attempt to mobilize public support for a reduction in immigration. The evidence summarized in this Backgrounder indicates that if this were to happen , a candidate could expect very strong support from the public , but also very significant elite opposition from politically important groups such as the media , business , and academia , all of whom will play a significant role in shaping policy and the public discourse on the issue . </gap.n.3169><gap.n.3170>These high currents would charge the antenna , then discharge across the sprak gap electrodes to ground.

This spark is a conductive path and current will begin to flow through it. The spark has heat due to the amount of current flowing through it. At around 0.1A there is sufficient heat ( 5 , 000K to 20 , 000K ) to turn the air the spark is traveling through into plasma by stripping off electrons from the atoms and the air becomes ionized. When the air is heated to this temperature the atoms of the air collide with the electrons flowing through the arc and causes electrons to be bumped off of some of the atoms so the air becomes ionized. At the same time ionization is taking place some recombination is taking place where electrons join positively charged atoms to form neutral atoms. While the air is in a plasma state there is a high amount of free electrons and positive ions . </gap.n.3177><gap.n.3178>[ 0011 ] Many problems relating to mitral valve 116 may occur and these insufficiencies may cause many types of ailments.

The average phase is the phase , averaged over all gaps in the symmetric unit , of the reference particle when it arrives at the gap centers. In conventional graded- designs , the reference particle sees cells of increasing length. However , imposing equal cell lengths , optimized near the mid section of the symmetric unit , inevitably results in cells that are the incorrect length at both ends of the symmetric unit. A reference particle sees a longer cell length than preferred in the earlier cells , and a shorter cell length in the later cells. This results in a phase slip , shown in Fig. 2 through the symmetric unit.

The authors estimate that the returns on a college education actually fell from 1915 to 1950 as our universities supplied more grads than the economy could absorb , narrowing the income gap in the process between college grads and everyone else.

Such transients can arise from lightning strikes , motor starts , and other causes. A spark gap uses two electrodes that oppose each other across a short distance in an atmosphere of inert gas , such as neon or argon. If the voltage on the arrestor is below its striking voltage ( avalanche potential ) , the current in the arrestor is close to zero. Once the potential reaches the striking voltage , the voltage across the arrestor suddenly collapses to a level called the glow voltage. If the current increases further , the arrestor voltage decreases to a level called the arc voltage , where it stays until the surge passes. At this point , the arrestor stays conductive until its current falls below a sustaining value , much in the manner of a thyristor. Because the gas needs a certain amount of time for ionization , the ignition voltage depends on the dv/dt applied to the arrestor. The Spice model presented here takes into account the dv/dt effect . </gap.n.3212><gap.n.3213>I have great honor to participate as the President of the GAP Administration in the Southeastern Region Anatolia Project in course of implementation of the GAP Action Plan.

The decisions in Donoghue and Leonard Cheshire create a gap in Human Rights Act protection of vulnerable persons who are subject to the exercise of state power. Those who are directly in receipt of state services are protected by the terms of the Human Rights Act whilst those who are provided by the state with the same services on a contracted-out basis have no such protection vis-a " -vis the service provider. This is as a result of what Professor Paul Craig terms the " major premise " of the Court of Appeal in the Donoghue and Leonard Cheshire cases , that " [ t ] he fact that a body performs an activity which otherwise a public body would be under a duty to perform can not mean that such a performance is necessarily a public function when the self-same activity is undertaken by a private service provider " .

The most common method used is expending the arc out over a series of gaps. Gaps of this type are know as " series static gaps " . " Static " in this use refers to the fact that the gap is not actively quenched. The plasma is formed in several locations , and the voltage at each gap is lowered as more electrodes are placed in series. Heat , hot ions , and voltage are distributed. As the tank circuit loses energy to the secondary coil , the voltage and current in the tank circuit , and likewise across the series of gaps , drops to the point where the arc is no longer self sustaining. The arc breaks , and the capacitors are allowed to recharge for the next pulse . </gap.n.3230><gap.n.3231>Yet news reports about the income gap , while exposing the injustice and hypocrisy of the system , do not focus attention on the real source of the problem.

It is seen from FIG. 3 that these two , the gap and the duration , are in corresponding relations with each other , provided thatthe compression pressure within the combustion chamber is maintained within the normal range. The experiment has also shown that the gap can be measured precisely enough that it is within the range of 0.1 to 0.2 mm with respect to the duration of thespark. These relations can be accounted for from the fact that when the secondary voltage is applied to jump the gap between the electrodes of the spark plug , it breaks down the gap , thus ionizing the air or gas in the gap for producing sparks , but theduration of the jumped sparks is inversely proportional to the lengths of the sparks . </gap.n.3233><gap.n.3234>Instead of trying to find gap costs that have the highest average accuracy , we can find the gap costs that have the highest accuracy for each sequence pair. Therefore , an alternative approach to comparing schemes is to look at the maximum identity produced by each scheme for each sequence pair. Similar to Figure 5 , Figure 7 shows the maximum identities of each scheme plotted by transformed branch length , and box-whisker plots of the data. As we saw in the best cost analysis , the maximum affine identities are similar to maximum log-affine identities , and both are distinct from the maximum logarithmic identities. Identities decrease with increasing branch lengths , only to increase with the largest branch lengths. Furthermore , logarithmic densities are once again very sensitive to increasing branch lengths. Similar to Figure 6 , Figure 8 shows the ratio of maximum identities of affine and logarithmic to the log-affine schemes. Once again , the affine scheme has identities similar to the log-affine scheme and the logarithmic scheme does not . </gap.n.3234><gap.n.3235>[ 0019 ] In the embodiments of the present disclosure , a clock of the working path obtained by using the local oscillator clock and the clock gap is adapted to replace the clock of the working path tracked in a phase-locked loop mode.

The biggest problem was that the maximum power that could be transmitted was directly determined by how much electrical charge the antenna could hold. Because the capacitance of practical antennas is quite small , the only way to get a reasonable power output was to charge it up to very high voltages. However , this made transmission impossible in rainy or even damp conditions. Also , it necessitated a quite wide spark gap , with a very high electrical resistance , with the result that most of the electrical energy was used simply to heat up the air in the spark gap.

The identities produced by the best log-affine gap cost tend to be higher than or equal to the identities produced by the best affine and best logarithmic gap costs. However , there are some sequences for which the best log-affine gap cost produces an alignment that is worse than the alignment produced by the best affine or best logarithmic cost. Nevertheless , the best affine cost compares rather well to the best log-affine cost , especially at lower branch lengths. However , the best logarithmic cost does a poor job compared to the best log-affine cost and the best affine cost. Clearly alignments derived from logarithmic costs are of poor quality , and highly sensitive to the divergence between sequences . </gap.n.3326><gap.n.3327>The depicted switching spark gap features a minimal operating voltage of 1.3 kV and a natural breakdown voltage of about 5 kV; at an operating voltage of 2 kV and trigger pulse amplitudes of 2 to 4 kV , ignition delay times of 0.01 to 0.5 .mu.sand gate-controlled rise times of about 10 ns were determined . </gap.n.3327><gap.n.3328>Most news coverage I ' ve seen about denials of club status and GAP debates have presented both sides , though it ' s likely that media bias is a factor in whether such stories get covered.

Many gaps get filled within the first hour of trade. Other gaps tend to linger , only to get filled later in the day. Still others take days or even weeks to get filled. Why is this ?

In other words , the process of economic growth meant that skilled workers were given priority in employment , but even as these skilled workers were absorbed into the labor market they were expected to quickly climb to the next rank , and thus their income levels did not significantly increase. However , as economic growth progressed it became necessary to employ even low-skilled workers , and in the end the entire labor force was depleted , plunging the country into a large-scale labor shortage. In this environment , even the lowest-skilled strata of workers found themselves on the path to rapidly rising wages. As a result , the economy continued to rapidly expand , the wage growth rate rose for even the low-wage rank-and-file , and disparities in income distribution contracted. This phenomenon can be seen in the economic development of any country , and thus was also present in the postwar high-growth era in Japan . </gap.n.3381><gap.n.3382>Black Friday shoppers may have seemed hardcore in the past , but this year deal seekers ditched the turkey and the Cowboys game to gobble up savings.

The 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo rescued the Albanian Kosovar population from catastrophe , but at the expense of international law governing the use of force. Unlike the Iraq intervention of 2003 , however , a regional consensus supported the action taken in Kosovo and the facts validated the moral claim of urgency. As such , while the intervention may have been illegal , it was politically and morally legitimate. This gap is not desirable , but it is better than ignoring principles altogether or adopting a rigid posture of unconditional nonintervention . </gap.n.3383><gap.n.3384>Bugfixes distributed for GAP will also update the completion files.

[ PubMed ] </gap.n.3385><gap.n.3386>[ 0012 ] In general , a relatively significant gap may exist between anterior leaflet 212 and posterior leaflet 216 ( as shown in FIG. 2 b ) for a variety of different reasons. For example , a gap may exist due to congenital malformations , because of ischemic disease , or because a heart has been damaged by a previous heart attack. A gap may also be created when congestive heart failure , e.g. , cardiomyopathy , or some other type of distress causes a heart to be enlarged. When a heart is enlarged , the walls of the heart , e.g. , wall 134 of a left ventricle , may stretch or dilate , causing posterior leaflet 216 to stretch. It should be appreciated that anterior leaflet 212 generally does not stretch. As shown in FIG. 2 b , a gap 220 between anterior leaflet 212 and stretched posterior leaflet 216 is created when wall 134 stretches. Hence , due to the existence of gap 220 , mitral valve 116 is unable to close properly , and may begin to leak . </gap.n.3386><gap.n.3387>$ 450 million Haut Gap Middle opening on Johns IslandThe 250 students of Haut Gap Middle are moving into their new $ 18 million , 450 student capacity building on Johns Island.

The integration of schools by SEC rather than by race shows promise as an effective way to increase student achievement. Student funding should reflect the level of student need , with high risk students being funded more generously. Districts should identify those teachers most skilled at raising student achievement levels and deploy these teachers strategically in the schools with the highest need. It would n't hurt to pay these teachers more. Students with the most severe needs should receive targeted interventions. In Finland , one in seven teachers is a special education teacher. Struggling students are identified quickly and given the help that they need. This needs to happen in the US. In countries with smaller achievement gaps , the poorest children do not suffer the level of deprivation that is found in the United States. At a minimum , all children deserve access to nutritious food , adequate health care , and safe housing . </gap.n.3389><gap.n.3390>The global competitiveness gap refers to the disparity between student performance in the United States compared to that of other industrialized nations. The U.S. used to be number one in high school and college graduation rates , but that lead has lessened -- because while other nations ' graduation rates have risen , the U.S. rates have stagnated. The equally unfortunate finding is that " 17 countries have higher average ( PISA ) test scores and lower income-based inequality than the United States. " While the U.S. is one of the highest education spenders , it has not found a way to reduce the influence income-based inequities have on student achievement across the entire system . </gap.n.3390><gap.n.3391>Women of all ages and education levels experienced gains in pay relative to their male counterparts. The gender gap varies little across education groups7 but is substantially smaller for younger women ( see figure 4 ) . This was not always the case. In 1969 , the gender gap was similar for those under and over age 40. But the gap narrowed much faster for younger women. The larger gap among older women may be a generational effect , indicating that the current younger cohort of women has made choices more similar to those of men and/or is not facing as much discrimination as the cohort before them. Alternately , the gap for older women could reflect growing differences in accumulated work experience as women age or a " glass ceiling " effect by which women achieve smaller pay gains over time. Indeed , the bipartisan Federal Glass Ceiling Commission found that " in the private sector , equally qualified and similarly situated citizens are being denied equal access to advancement into senior-level management on the basis of gender , race , or ethnicity.

The generation gap widened for financial satisfaction and narrowed for job satisfaction and excitement in life. The young have been consistently the most negative age group in their evaluations of general happiness and job satisfaction and generally ( but not always ) the most likely to rate their health as excellent and their lives as exciting. Marital happiness has tended to be lowest among the middle-aged ( 35-54 ) . The generation gap between the young and old has been small , but has flipped direction with the young being slightly happier in 1973 and 1985 and the old happier in 1997. Over time the young have changed little in their ratings of general happiness , health , or job satisfaction. There was a small decline among the young in financial satisfaction ( - 4.2 percentage points ) and larger decreases for excitement ( -7.3 percentage points ) and marital happiness ( -8.3 percentage points ) . </gap.n.3392><gap.n.3393>We have worked to close the health gap.

Such rapid intensity changes can be modeled using brief silent intervals , or " gaps " in an ongoing stimulus. Behavioral gap detection paradigms are reliable indicators of auditory temporal acuity ( Fitzgibbons 1983; Glasberg et al. 1987; Green and Forrest 1989; Plomp 1964; Shailer and Moore 1983 ) and gap detection correlates well with other , more complex processing , such as speech perception in noise ( Glasberg and Moore 1988; Gordon-Salant and Fitzgibbons 1993; Tyler et al. 1982 ) . In humans , minimal detectable gap durations are approximately 2-3 ms ( Fitzgibbons and Wightman 1982; Green and Forrest 1989; Plomp 1964 ) . Similar behavioral gap thresholds have been found in other species ( Giraudi et al. 1980; Ison et al. 1993; Klump and Maier 1989; Okanoya and Dooling 1990; Walton et al. 1997 ) . </gap.n.3412><gap.n.3413>If there is any concrete dust , gravel , oil , or grease in the opening , use the wire brush and a leaf blower to clear it out of the crack.

The first clue , found in Isaiah 14 : 14 , records the words of Satan at the time of his fall -- " I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. " Since the clouds could not have formed prior to God ' s creation of water on day one , Satan fell after day one. Referring back to Job 38 : 4-7 that Satan was " shouting for joy " as the foundations were being laid , his fall must have occurred after day two or day three. Isaiah 14 : 13 also reveals to us that Satan ' s fall must have occurred after the creation of the " stars , " which occurred on day four.

Rather , our concern was to understand the nature and causes of the changes taking place in American journalism and to discuss these in nonjudgmental terms. Our treatment of the religious attitudes of journalists is part of a comprehensive profile of their backgrounds and attitudes. Bridging the Gap , on the other hand , is a full- scale study of journalists ' religious beliefs and their relation to the coverage of religion. The two studies , therefore , are not strictly comparable. Nevertheless , they can be juxtaposed for the purpose of understanding the differences between some of their findings and ours . </gap.n.3438><gap.n.3439>In general , the Banana Republic stores try to convey a more sophisticated image for an upscale customer , whereas Gap stores appeal to a broader midrange of customers.

The gap between the military and society is exacerbated by the military ' s increasing tendency to recruit from narrower segments of the population ... some 15 percent of new entrants into the military now come from military families. Of greater concern , in the view of some , is the increased role of the military academies as providers of officer candidates. Whereas West Point , Annapolis , and the Air Force Academy produced only 10 percent of new officers during the Cold War , today they produce roughly one-quarter. Cohen suggests solutions such as ' reforming the military academies ( recruiting an officer corps as widely as possible and modeling the military academies along the lines of Sandhurst ) , devise recruiting schemes for the citizen-soldier , and providing a professional military education for the officer corps.

On the other hand , if it is the riskiness of the realized loan losses , then an asset switch ( where NAMA takes bad loans in exchange for a fee or financial claim on bank assets ) is the appropriate response.

Among parents with a child support agreement , roughly 45 are currently divorced. When we look at families with child support agreements , we see that never married parents are far more likely to have an agreement than those that are " separated " from their spouse. This fact may indicate that it is easier for a never married person to achieve some kind of child support agreement than for a separated parent. Since the marital status " separated " is usually temporary , this is not a surprising result. Also , separation often is a pre-cursor to divorce , meaning that the relationship between the parents that ended the marriage may make it more difficult to come to a consensus on a child support agreement. The way parents maintain their relationship after the disruption has a fundamental role in the child support gaps . </gap.n.3474><gap.n.3475>Background noise typically elevates thresholds and impairs perception of complex signals.

By focusing on enforcement , the resolution ignores history and the bigger compliance problem and risks increasing IRS abuses.

A chief of the mammoth-herding Bizogots brings to Nidaros word of a narrow gap that has opened in a supposedly endless wall of ice , revealing new lands and new beasts. Are there new people ? The emperor sends Count Hamnet Thyssen , an old soldier recently , painfully divorced , to explore. Rather than the fabled Golden Shrine beyond the ice , he finds enough blood , toil , and ignorance ( also a few sympathetic women ) to convince him that empire and Bizogots need to develop new defenses fast.

This is because the spark gap , once initiated by the transient , must carry the power source current for the remainder of that half cycle until the tube extinguishes on the next power frequency current zero.

When the function of a protein of the invention is related to a signal transduction pathway , the assays typically involve an assay of events in the signal transduction pathway that indicate GAP activity. Thus , the expression of genes that are up-or down-regulated in response to the receptor protein dependent signal cascade can be assayed. For GAP function , assays typically involve an assay of events in the pathway for example , GTPase activation or inhibition , GTP or GDP binding to a GTPase , and end points such as membrane ruffling and effects on cytoskeletal organization , actin organization , and the like. In one embodiment , the regulatory region of such genes can be operably linked to a marker that is easily detectable , such as luciferase.

The induced oscillation in the antenna circuit was also a damped wave , but the period of oscillation was considerably longer than the oscillation period in the primary , since when the spark ceased , the antenna circuit could continue to oscillate on a frequency determined by the antenna system resonant frequency . </gap.n.3585><gap.n.3586>Shares of Gap , which operates more than 3 , 100 stores worldwide , fell 12 cents to $ 19.47 as of 4 : 04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Although evidence is mixed , some studies find substantial pay differences between men and women working in the same narrowly defined occupations and establishments. One recent and thorough study of this kind takes advantage of a unique data set that matches workers in the 1990 Census to information on the establishments in which they work , using the U.S. Census Bureau Standard Statistical Establishment List. Unlike previous studies of this type , the data include workers from all sectors of the economy. The study decomposes the gender gap into a part that is the result of the concentration of women in particular occupations , industries , establishments , and " jobs " ( an occupation within an establishment ) and a portion due to differences in pay between men and women working in industries , occupations , establishments , and jobs with a similar percentage of female workers.

Complexity of the tax code is also a known obstacle to full tax compliance. The primary group engaging in illegal tax avoidance is individuals , largely as regards their small business income. And while the tax gap has hovered rather consistently between 81 -84 throughout the last few recessions , the income tax hike unique to this recession ( coupled with a lack of increased enforcement ) is cause for suspicion that the gap could rise . </gap.n.3647><gap.n.3648>The sealing gap length L is considerably higher than the sealing gap width W such that a narrow sealing gap 212 is formed.

In the early 1990s , some bankers said , " 10 percent of the people held 60 percent of negotiable securities and 40 percent of bank deposits. " In the mid-90s , some experts and scholars said , " 20 percent of the people owned 80 percent of the savings deposits , this means 80 percent of the people only held 20 percent of the deposits. " At the end of the 90s , someone calculated on the basis of a sampling survey conducted among urban residents , 3 percent well-off people held 47 percent of the residents ' savings deposits. These sayings are only a kind of estimation , because it is not long since the system of using real name in financial affairs was put into practice , it is simply impossible to make clear how much savings deposits and securities a person owns , and so it is naturally impossible to verify the amount.

The standard Part D benefit in 2006 began with partial coverage for the first $ 2250 of total drug costs in 2006 , followed by a period of no coverage until patients reached cumulative out-of-pocket costs of $ 3600 in 2006.5 At the end of the gap , catastrophic coverage begins; patients often pay only 5 of drug costs or a predetermined copayment from that time forward.6 An estimated 18.2 million beneficiaries ( 89 of Part D enrollees not receiving a low-income subsidy ) in 2006 were enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan with a full coverage gap.7 </gap.n.3725><gap.n.3726>The unexplained portion of the pay gap is often interpreted as the result of discrimination. In this view , once differences between men and women in the relevant determinants of wages are taken into account , any remaining difference in pay must be due to discrimination. But this explanation may be too simplistic. To the extent that discrimination affects women 's educational , job , and family choices , the " unexplained " differential will understate the true effect of discrimination. And , to the extent that an analyst can not adequately measure all the determinants of wages using available data , there may be significant unmeasured labor market skills that differ between men and women. For instance , if women 's labor market experience is less likely to be continuous ( for example , due to childbearing ) , then just controlling for years of work may not fully control for the differential effects of experience on male and female wages. In this case , the " unexplained " differential will overstate the true effect of discrimination , because it includes the effect of relevant unmeasured factors that influence the relative productivity of male and female employees . </gap.n.3726><gap.n.3727>Application of spark gaps on DC circuits provide the most challenging applications because of the inherent characteristics of spark gaps to continue to discharge as long as an arc or glow current can be provided. From the general Applications Information of pages 3 and 4 we see that unless the DC supply voltage across the spark gap is reduced to a level lower than the current-voltage relationship for the tube for a given source current , the spark gap will continue to conduct following its initiation by a transient surge. For this reason , for other than low source current DC applications and DC system supply voltages less than the arc voltage of the tube , we must supply supplemental circuit elements to assure that the spark gap will extinguish. Circuits with DC supply voltages below the arc voltage of the spark gap , or with low source currents and voltages below the glow voltage of the tube may be treated as communications circuits . </gap.n.3727><gap.n.3728>Government Spending/Taxes : The generation gap has never been large and has changed little over time ( 10.5 in 1973 , 12.6 in 1985 , and 9.4 in 1997 ) .

Older Americans and Western Europeans are more likely than their grandchildren to have reservations about growing global interconnectedness , to worry that their way of life is threatened , to feel that their culture is superior to others and to support restrictions on immigration. This generation gap is less pronounced in Eastern Europe and is virtually nonexistent in Asia , Africa and the Middle East. Nevertheless , Americans and Western Europeans of all ages are less likely than people in other parts of the world to tout their own cultural superiority and are less wary of foreign influence.

The tower spark gap is the most critical defense against voltage transient damage to the transmitter via the antenna. The spark gap needs a low resistance path to ground , which is why a good ground system at the transmitter site is so important. The spark gap needs to be adjusted to handle the voltage peaks of the carrier with full positive modulation which can be as high as 125 . This is calculated by taking the RF carrier voltage with no modulation and multiplying by 2.25. For example , a 1000 watt carrier has 224 volts rms and 317 volts peak output into a 50 ohm load. At 100 modulation this is 634 volts peak , and at 125 positive peak modulation this is 712 volts peak. To determine the voltage at the tower spark gap the calculation needs to be done for the tower impedance. Impedance can be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the square of the resistance plus the square of the reactance . </gap.n.3789><gap.n.3790>In fact , similar gaps opening up between the two series have been seen several times prior to peaks.

National gap analyses are an important step in describing and addressing this problem , so we sought to determine the representativeness of English PAs devoted to biodiversity conservation by using Natural Areas ( NAs ) , elevation and PA boundary data. We found that National Nature Reserves ( NNRs ) and Sites of Special Scientific Interests ( SSSIs ) cover only 6.3 of England and are generally small , with respective median areas of 1.1 and 0.2 km2. The English PA system underrepresents lowland areas and provides a median level of 2.5 protection for the NA types , with seventy nine per cent of NA types having less than 10 protection. Therefore , we suggest that England 's PA system needs to be expanded , although this would probably entail modification of existing legislation to increase involvement by landowners. We also compare our results with previous appraisals that used species distribution record data and suggest that landscape-level analyses may give a more accurate and less positive assessment.Learn more : </gap.n.3811><gap.n.3812>The Gap is something that happens when we notice the difference between what we want and our actual results.

Broad computational biologist Manuel Garber and his colleagues set out to fix this.

Unlike so-called structural gaps such as duplications with near-identical sequences , these unfinished portions are not amenable to the bacterial clone-based sequencing approaches taken by the Human Genome Project. Garber 's team restricted themselves to three such gaps on chromosome 15 , designed six primer pairs enveloping the genomic gulfs , and applied large-scale , parallel , shotgun sequencing approaches developed by Roche 's 454 Life Sciences to correctly piece together the missing bits . </gap.n.3866><gap.n.3867>We 've got Notches on the AT and Gaps on the AT.

The Census Bureau measures income per household , not per capita , when determining inequality. That means that when some couples divorce but others do n't , inequality decreases. Take two married households where each person makes $ 50 , 000. If one couple gets divorced , that creates two $ 50 , 000 households from one $ 100 , 000 household. The old situation had no inequality , the new one has much more inequality according to the Census Bureau. But not precisely in reality.Increasing divorce rates in a society where marriage is still the norm create a widening gap between richer ( the married ) and poorer ( the single ) even without changing per capita income of inequality at all. Certainly boosting marriage among the poor would help in many ways , but the household inequality statistics perhaps overestimate the true inquality involved . </gap.n.3870><gap.n.3871>As Plutarch wrote almost 2000 years ago , " An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics.

Just as the Candlestick signals have different meanings at different points in a trend , the gaps have different messages at certain points in a trend. The Candlestick signals , signals that have imbedded information in their formation , combined with a gap/window , also a signal that implies a magnitude of buying or selling interest , creates one of the most powerful investment tools found in technical analysis. The major function of technical analysis is to find trade patterns that put probabilities highly in our favor. Hundreds of years of profitable observations have identified the Doji as a prime reversal signal. Gaps have demonstrated many times over that they are the driving force of a trend direction.

This is considerably more difficult than initiating spark breakdown in the gap. A cold , non-firing spark gap contains no ionized gases. Once the voltage across the gap reaches its breakdown voltage , gas molecules in the gap are very quickly ionized along a path , creating a hot electric arc , or plasma , that consists of large numbers of ions and free electrons between the electrodes. The arc also heats part of the electrodes to incandescence. The incandescent regions contribute free electrons via thermionic emission , and ( easily ionized ) metal vapor. The mixture of ions and free electrons in the plasma is highly conductive , resulting in a sharp drop in the gap 's electrical resistance. This highly conductive arc supports efficient tank circuit oscillations. However , the oscillating current also sustains the arc and , until it can be extinguished , the tank capacitor can not be recharged for the next pulse . </gap.n.3934><gap.n.3935>This example shows that both regional inequality and urban and rural inequality have been widened.

Since the entire window is made from highly insulative plastic , the window itself provides much greater insulation than aluminum framed windows , or vinyl windows with glass panes. Additionally , the InnerG window seals air-tightly against the existing window frame and eliminates air infiltration. The dead air trapped in the air gap between the existing window and the InnerG window inhibits heat transfer and controls condensation.

Associated with aging the young and old differ on many traits ( e.g. health , the presence and age of children , job seniority , etc. ) and related attitudes. They also differ in many ways related to cohort differences in historical experiences and socialization. Generation gaps are greatest on items in which the cohort effects augment the life-cycle effects. The size of generation gaps in general will be greatest when social systems accentuate the natural differences related to aging ( e.g. in societies with sharp and rigid age hierarchies ) and when cohort effects are larger due especially to age-differentiated historical events and social change. If age gradients in social organization decline and/or cohort effects diminish , then generation gaps will narrow as occurred in the US over the last three decades . </gap.n.3989><gap.n.3990>A gap up opening based on strong GDP numbers from the US was not sustained as markets extended gains for the fifth straight day in a row.

Only one 45GAP case is required for equivalent ACP standard pressure and +P ACP pressure levels , while the 45ACP requires two cases. One case is rated up to 21 , 000 psi ( most popular ) and the 2nd case is rated up to 23 , 000 psi for +P ammo ( more expensive than 45GAP cases ) . Even though Starline +P .45 ACP looks the same as standard .45 ACP brass , +P brass is stronger because Starline uses a special metal tempering procedure.

Studies have shown that the ideal kernel size is .100 inches. With the same intensity of a spark , the power output from an engine increases as the size of the kernel increases , up to the .100 " . This translates into an ideal spark gap of .100 " . Unfortunately , this would take a coil the size of the engine itself to provide the required energy. Therefore , we must " play " with the gap vs. coil power to obtain the best performance for the system. For a given coil , if we start with a small gap , we only get a small spark. As we increase the gap , the intensity of the spark also increases ... .up to a point where the coil is no longer capable of generating enough voltage.

In sophisticated versions of these devices ( called gas tube arresters ) , a small spark gap breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge , safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the spark gaps help protect the building and internal telephone circuits from the effects of lightning strikes. Less sophisticated ( and much less expensive ) spark gaps are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices , the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark which jumps from lead wire to lead wire across the gap left by the sawing process.

This article was prepared to balance those warnings by compiling independent research and expert opinion on the gap and the theory behind it. The result is considerable information from respected organizations , demographers , and sociologists that raise doubts about the concern and the validity of the theory. Surprisingly , there is an absence of support from independent sources on both subjects. All of this should give HR professionals good reasons to regard the generation gap as an idea that is more myth than reality , so they can focus on the real talent management issues of the 21st century . </gap.n.4053><gap.n.4054>Mr. Greenspan is not alone in concern about the inadequate educations that diminish opportunity for many American workers and open a growing income gap . </gap.n.4054><gap.n.4055>According to the Centre for Economic Performance ( CEP ) at the London School of Economics , it would take 150 years for the income gap between the two genders to close up due to discrimination and ineffective government policies.

The differences in average test scores by gender do not seem to be race-based. By examining those with sufficient incomes to not be in the lunch program , we can see that among all three racial groups there are very modest differences in average scores between genders , with an occasional exception. One exception is among sixth-grade Hispanic students; the second is tenth-grade African-American students. These have 16 and 14 point differences , respectively. Such a difference is odd , since many other years have 2-4 point differences. We attribute this to a small number of students in each of these cells. The basic pattern is that males and females score relatively similarly. Thus , for the most part we must conclude that although middle-income , African-American males score consistently below African-American females with similar incomes in math , the differences are not pronounced , on average , until tenth grade.

Therefore , one can surmise that the linear component to the gap cost function derives from the conversion of a maximum likelihood search into a minimum cost search via shifting and scaling to fit specific substitution costs. Furthermore , this linear component dominates the gap cost allowing the log component to be removed and the gap opening cost re-waited. These results also open the possibility that the gap extension cost can be moved into the substitution matrix and eliminated from the gap cost entirely , potentially speeding up alignment algorithms . </gap.n.4230><gap.n.4231>Thus , the changes in the generation gaps involve a notable amount of movement among both the young and the old.

Alternatively , when the size of gap 908 is significant , and there is a relatively large amount of mitral valve leakage , then a relatively large number of T-bars 904 and , hence , pledgets 905 may be used to reduce the size of gap 908 by reducing the arc length of mitral valve 916 . Some pledgets 905 may be arranged to at least partially overlap. To correct for a regurgitant jet that is centralized to only one section of mitral valve 916 , T-bars 904 may be implemented as plicating elements near the regurgitant jet , and as reinforcing elements away from the regurgitant jet , e.g. , to prevent progression of mitral valve disease from causing a substantial gap to eventually form . </gap.n.4232><gap.n.4233>The copyright of the article Age Gap Relationships in Dating is owned by Victoria Anisman-Reiner.

He wanted to fill the gap between his present position and his aspiration by marrying for money. He lacked the character , willingness for work and achievement needed to acquire it. Money was also an important value for Charlotte. In her case , money represented security , which was her primary drive. Marrying a man of property and wealth was an ideal she aspired for.

But this is , at most , 1 percent of the total tax gap. The IRS has estimated that the tax gap was around $ 300 billion in 2001 and most experts think even that number is an understatement. Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus ( D-MT ) and other Democrats criticized the steps as not nearly enough to address the scope of the problem. This is reinforced by the fact that IRS Commissioner Mark Everson told the Senate Budget Committee last year that he could , in a given year , locate some of these taxes and increase collections by " between $ 50 billion and $ 100 billion without changing the dynamic between the IRS and the people.

We present the results of a study in which we mapped the occurrence of biological reserves in different physical environments across the coterminous United States. We examined the occurrence of these reserves by 500-meter elevation intervals , quintiles of soil prductivity , five-degree blocks of latitude and longitude , and ecoregions. Observed patterns of occurrence suggested uneven distribution within all these coarse-filter features. The areas with the highest level of protection were those that were least productive and/or least accessible.

Figure 1 shows the percentage of the public and opinion leaders who thought " large numbers of immigrants and refugees coming into the United States " was a " critical threat to the vital interests of the United States " in 1998 and 2002. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by foreign-born terrorists seem to have increased the share of the public concerned about immigration. In contrast , elite concern has actually declined since 1998.

As with wages , some of this gap is related to differences between men and women in human capital and job characteristics , and some remains unexplained. Among younger workers , the gender gap in total compensation appears to be smaller than the gap in wages.9 Much of the female-male gap in pension coverage can be accounted for by differences in their labor market histories and is much smaller among younger workers. In addition , among those who have pensions , the gender gap in benefit levels is largely explained by gender differences in income.10 Therefore , lower wages , and hence lower lifetime earnings , result in lower pension benefits upon retirement. For some women , the lack of coverage or lower benefit levels may not be a problem , since they receive benefits through a spouse. For other women , lack of adequate health or pension benefits from their job is a serious problem.

Companies that act on their knowledge also eliminate fear , abolish destructive internal competition , measure what matters , and promote leaders who understand the work people do in their firms.

This can help with quenching by giving more area to cool and the area will not heat up as much since the thermal energy is spread out. The disadvantage of multiple gaps is that there are multiple anode and cathode drops which result in a larger voltage drop over the entire series of gaps. Using a single gap will have a lower total voltage drop because there will be only one anode and one cathode drop rather than several as with a series of gaps. This can result in less loss in the gap due to voltage drop. The single gap will be a bit harder to quench.

As the more efficient transmission mode of continuous waves ( CW ) became easier to produce and band crowding and interference worsened , spark-gap transmitters and damped waves were legislated off the new shorter wavelengths by international treaty , and replaced by Poulsen arc converters and high frequency alternators which developed a sharply defined transmitter frequency. These approaches later yielded to vacuum tube technology and the 'electric age ' of radio would end. Long after they stopped being used for communications , spark gap transmitters were employed for radio jamming. As late as 1955 , a Japanese radio-controlled toy bus used a spark transmitter and coherer receiver; the spark was visible behind a sheet of blue transparent plastic. Spark gap oscillators are still used to generate high frequency high voltage to initiate welding arcs in gas tungsten arc welding [ 1 ] . Powerful spark gap pulse generators are still used to simulate EMP. Most high power gas-discharge street lamps ( mercury and sodium vapor ) still use modified spark transmitters as switch-on ignitors . </gap.n.4405><gap.n.4406>Wed , Mar 3rd , 2010 1 : 03 : 00 am - At 1 : 03am , the Gap Fire Company was alerted by the LCWC to assist Christiana Fire Company for a building fire at 48 Christiana Pike.

Every defender in the nucleus of the defense ( defensive linemen and linebackers ) is responsible for a gap between two offensive blockers. For example , assume that the defensive lineman is poised at the line of scrimmage , ready for the offense to run a play. At the snap of the ball , the offensive lineman initiates a run block ( either a reach block or a cutoff block ) , trying to take over the defensive lineman ' s gap. The defensive lineman must be able to read the block , determine that the play is a run and keep control of his gap. He has to keep his gap-side arm free without giving up too much ground laterally. If a defensive lineman loses control of his gap , either by being reached ( when he is a playside defender ) or by being cut off ( when he is a backside defender ) , a seam opens up and the ball carrier will be able to run through to the safeties . </gap.n.4442><gap.n.4443>A few remnants of the area ' s historic agricultural villages have been preserved under the aegis of the park service , but the main attraction is the oddly named Delaware Water Gap itself , a deep cleft carved by the river into the solid rock of the Kittatinny Mountains.

But innovation and technological change can sustain productivity growth indefinitely. In the equation below , productivity is the only component with no upper limit.

The area near the top of the congestion area is usually resistance when approached from below. Likewise , the area near the bottom of the congestion area is support when approached from above.

We observed a unique , discrete single-stranded gap in unintegrated linear DNA molecules , located near the center of the genome. Oligonucleotide primer extension experiments determined that the downstream limit of this gap coincides with the last nucleotide of a central copy of the polypurine tract found in all sequenced lentivirus genomes. Other retroviruses have only one copy of the polypurine tract at the 5 ' boundary of the 3 ' long terminal repeat , which has been shown to determine initiation of retroviral DNA plus-strand synthesis. We conclude from our observations that the central repeat of the polypurine tract can create an additional site for plus-strand synthesis initiation in lentiviruses. The central single-stranded gap was not found in circular DNA molecules , the vast majority of them carrying only one long terminal repeat. This finding suggests that the generation of such circular molecules is associated with early DNA ligation events . </gap.n.4503><gap.n.4504>When we lie , we force our brain to pretend that the lie is true , that the truth is a lie and simultaneously remember that the real truth is that each is the other.

Firstly , it reduces the current required to get a given amount of power , and since most losses are proportional to I this significantly reduces losses and improves performance. Secondly , energy in the tank capacitor is proportional to V , so using a high supply is a good way to get high energy storage in the tank capacitor. Thirdly , wider spark gaps can be used which tend to run more smoothly without clogging. The upper limit on the supply voltage is usually imposed by the risk of dielectric breakdown of either the transformer itself , or more likely that of the tank capacitor. Above 20kV corona formation starts to become a problem even in some oil filled components , and can quickly degrade insulation leading to failures. The latest coil which I am developing runs with a peak supply voltage of 24kV , and uses an MMC type tank capacitor . </gap.n.4515><gap.n.4516>A gap between how the majority of mental health professionals view religion - as negative or unimportant - and how the general public 's view of religion -as positive and important - can create a barrier which prevents those needing treatment from getting the psychological help that they need.

Various GIS spatial functions were employed to improve the accuracy of these models , and model verification was performed using data from the statewide Breeding Bird Atlas. Species considered are highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. Important forest stands were identified by overlays of individual species distributions , and the management status of these stands was evaluated with overlays of the stewardship layer. In addition , the distribution models for the most sensitive species ( e.g. , cerulean warbler , black-and-white warbler , northern parula , American redstart , Louisiana waterthrush , hooded warbler ) were used to identify high-priority habitat restoration areas that would increase habitat suitability for these species , based on remodeling these species using 'what-if ' scenarios. These scenarios included identifying potential reforestation areas that would add to existing forest stands , closing forest gaps , or providing buffers between stands and encroaching urban development. The process of identifying these potential restoration areas was automated through the use of various GIS modeling functions ( e.g. , selectively expanding forest into only those land use classes that are potentially available for reforestation ) . </gap.n.4546><gap.n.4547> We knew the break wasn ' t going anywhere with him in it , Evans said.

In addition , 91 percent of stand-alone prescription drug plans and 93 percent of Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans in 2006 had tiered cost sharing prior to the coverage gap , under which beneficiaries paid more for higher-tier drugs such as brand-name medications.

The photoconductive switch is connected between a first primary electrode and the mid-plane electrode. The photoconductive switch has an inherent resistance and inductance , as does the entire triggering arrangement. The primary electrodes and the mid-plane electrode are arranged so that a first set of capacitances exists between the mid-plane electrode and the primary electrodes and a second capacitance exist between the primary electrodes. The primary electrode , mid-plane electrode and photoconductive switch are arranged so that a resonant loop formed by one of the first capacitances and total inductance and-resistance of the triggering arrangement resonates at a predetermined frequency. The predetermined frequency has a time period less than the time period necessary to break down the spark gap switch when the photoconductive switch is closed.

Finally , there was increasing mention of a " generation gap " that divided those who came of age during World War II and those coming of age in the Vietnam era. Criticism of the Johnson Administration grew more widespread and strident because of the increasing number of Americans killed in Vietnam. The number of Americans killed in action rose from a monthly average of 172 during 1965 to an average of 770 in 1967 . </gap.n.4675><gap.n.4676>Fernwood Hotel &amp;Resort is a full-service four season 400-acre retreat nestled in the rolling hills of the Pocono Mountains adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.

However , psychophysical thresholds for gap detection closely parallel the temporal acuity of the auditory neurons which possess the shortest minimal gap thresholds ( Klump and Gleich 1991; Klump and Maier 1989; Walton et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 1990 ) . Moreover , even with the improvement brought about by background noise , the MGTs of TI units remain longer than those for TE and other units with excitatory response patterns. Thus , the large improvement in TI unit gap detection thresholds we observed would not necessarily translate into a large contribution to the perception of stimulus gaps. However , these findings do reveal an interesting change in the duration of inhibitory response , strength of inhibitory response , and resulting temporal acuity of TI units that may play a role in other signal processing contexts . </gap.n.4692><gap.n.4693>As we 're a charity we talk about fundraising rather than costs.

A growing gap in the glacier that has formed the Raumsdalian Empire 's northern border for millennia allows Count Hamnet Thyssen and Trasamund the jarl , of the nomadic Northern Bizogot , to become the empire 's Lewis and Clark. They and their entourage , which inconveniently includes Hamnet 's unfaithful ex-wife , Gudrid , depart the empire 's capital city , Nidaris , to explore what lies beyond the glacier and search for the fabled Golden Shrine. On the way , a formidable and attractive ( if unbathed ) Bizogot shaman , Liv , joins the expedition and Hamnet under the animal hides. If the Raumsdalians and Bizogots do n't always get along , their culture clash is nothing compared to the threat they face on the other side of the glacier : the Rulers , a tribe of imperious , mammoth-riding warriors.

For Medicare , it is not clear whether a widening gap would exacerbate the cost increases that will result from increasing longevity.

The theoretical discussions on correlation of crack tip plastic deformation and base metals revealed; 1 ) The degree of restraint of crack tip plastic deformation by base metals depends on yield strength of filler metal in joint gap , stress intencity factor and joint gap. 2 ) Under shear stress , crack tip deformation is restrained when joint gap is smaller than a certain scale , and fatigue life of joint becomes longer. 3 ) Under tensile stress , base metals do not restrain a crack tip plastic deformation , and fatigue crack growth rate depends on stress concentration factor range which becomes greater with the width of joint gap.

As my work progressed I realized that reducing the electrode temperature , while not actually quenching the gap , reduces the amount of metal ions introduced into the arc , and makes the gap easier to quench with an airblast or magnets . </gap.n.4818><gap.n.4819>For Wednesday , November 1st , expect a 37.5 chance of a gap up opening , with an 83 chance of a higher closing.

Logarithmic gap costs perform poorly because they increase slowly ( Figure ( Figure3 ) .3 ) . This causes logarithmic costs to " cheat " during pairwise alignments because two huge gaps , covering the entirety of the sequences may be less costly than three or more moderate gaps. In fact , many logarithmic costs have bimodal distributions; they either work or cheat. However , this may not be a problem because it is easy to tell when logarithmic costs cheat , which can be reflected by posterior decoding [ 9 , 18 ] . Log-affine gap costs are noticeably better than simple affine gap costs , even though the difference may not be enough to justify wide spread usage given the slower speed of the candidate list method. According to the above results , affine gap costs only diverge from log-affine gap penalties at large branch lengths . </gap.n.4820><gap.n.4821>* Minimum 5 years retail experience , Gap Inc. experience preferred * Strong emphasis/experience in the store operations ... * Regular attendance is an essential function of the job * 4-year college degree or equivalent preferred ... </gap.n.4821><gap.n.4822>Recognition of the generation gap : the face of the generation gap , do not evade , to the previous turns.

This reading is buttressed by the context in which this passage appears : the following two paragraphs explain that there is no effective prohibition because Sprint could provide adequate coverage with just one or two towers rather than the three towers it requested in its application. Id. at 643-44. The court 's effective prohibition analysis does not discuss the provision of wireless services by other carriers. Id. at 639-44. Furthermore , its stress on adequate coverage should logically mean that circuit would oppose an " any coverage equals no gap " rule.

While there have been many advances in ablative techniques , these procedures are not without risks. Such risks can include cardiac perforation , esophageal injury , embolism , phrenic nerve injury , and pulmonary vein stenosis. There are also implantable devices currently on the market for the treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Some of these devices apply near-field overdrive pacing , also known as antitachycardia pacing ( ATP ); conventional high-energy far field defibrillation shocks; or a combination thereof. ATP works by delivering a burst of pacing stimuli at an empirically chosen frequency at a single pacing site in order to stimulate the excitable gap of a reentrant circuit , disrupting and terminating the circuit. Although ATP can be effective for slower AFls , the effectiveness of ATP can diminish for CLs below about two hundred milliseconds ( ms ) and can be ineffective for faster AFl and AF. ATP failure can occur when the pacing lead is located at a distance from the reentrant circuit and the pacing-induced wavefront is annihilated before reaching the circuit. This can be a highly probable scenario for faster arrhythmias . </gap.n.4915><gap.n.4916>When actual GDP consistently exceeds potential GDP -- the gap is gone -- inflation accelerates , according to the theory.

Because wage and salary income is subject to third-party reporting : Employers have to report wage and salary payments to the IRS on W-3 and 1099 forms -- and much of the time they also withhold taxes up front.

Chassis sag : This causes a tight door gap and very tight upper window fit. The sag can be caused first by rust or just by age ( on a rust free car ) . The solution is to either replace the rusted panels and/or pull the chassis on a frame machine. We have had to pull several cars to achieve proper door/window adjustment even though these 914s had never been wrecked or rusted. Check door fit carefully starting at the front. Make sure the door aligns with the cowl and the gap is perfectly uniform to the front fender. Make sure the door and fender make one perfect curve ( you can check this with a plastic straight edge ) . If in perfect alignment in the front , check the rear. The door should fit evenly top to bottom with uniform crack ( above the door latch , the gap will naturally be wider ) . Ignore the latch cup fit as the alignment here is always off. Finally , check door to quarter panel smoothness . </gap.n.4965><gap.n.4966>While White and Asian American young people are outpacing previous generations , the gaps for other minority groups are large enough that the current generation is , on average , heading toward being less educated than its predecessor. . . . </gap.n.4966><gap.n.4967>In additional experiments with increasing numbers of graphene layers , the team found that the size of the energy gap decreased with thickness and all but disappeared at four layers.

They generally put out enough " juice " so the vehicle runs pretty good with a warm engine running up to mid-range RPMs. As a secondary cost vs. performance compromise , the factory usually installs steel-tip plugs with a relatively narrow gap. The narrow gap compensates for the weak coil helping to assure a spark at low coil outputs. With a cool engine or high RPMs , the coil does not have the power to properly fire the steel tip plugs. Studies by Jacobs Electronics have shown that stock engines generally mis-fire 3-5 of the time when warm and up to 20 of the time when cold.

Hot electrodes can heat the surrounding air. Heat will cause the amount of voltage needed to breakdown the gap to be less and will cause an arc to continue to a lower current level. This is important with Tesla Coils since a lower breakdown voltage will cause the main capacitors to charge to a lower voltage before the gap breaks down and thus give less energy to the system. Another reason this is important is that a gap needs to quench quickly for efficient operation of the Tesla Coil circuit. A gap that starts at room temperature and heats up as it is operating will cause the Tesla Coil to loose efficiency from the beginning of operation. The efficiency loss can occur over a second or two or over a few minutes depending on power levels and spark gap design. The heating of the gap is not the focus here but it should be noted that cooling of the spark gap may be an important part of the design of a spark gap . </gap.n.4982><gap.n.4983>emphasis on store operations and/or customer service * Gap Inc. experience preferred * Ability to travel as ... office areas * College degree preferred Primary Location US-MA-BOSTON Full-time BANANA REPUBLIC - Store ...

The 1988 data were gathered through an extensive audit process called the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program ( TCMP ) . Data collection was halted in 1988 because of budget cuts and the belief that the program was too intrusive. TCMP audits required randomly selected taxpayers to provide documentation for every item on their tax return. Information collected during the TCMP audit period was analyzed and then used to score subsequently filed returns.

Spark gaps are used in high-voltage switches , for example , in power plants and electrical substations. Such switches are constructed with a large , remote-operated switching blade with a hinge as one contact and two leaf springs holding the other end as second contact. If the blade is opened , a spark may keep the connection between blade and spring conducting. ( The spark ionizes the air , which becomes conductive , allowing an arc to form , which sustains ionization and hence conduction. ) Here , a Jacob 's ladder ( see below ) on top of the switch will pull the arc apart and so extinguish it. You might also find small Jacob 's ladders mounted on top of ceramic insulators of high-voltage pylons. These are sometimes called horn gaps. If a spark should ever manage to jump over the insulator and give rise to an arc , it will be extinguished . </gap.n.5043><gap.n.5044>In Table 2 , I present descriptive statistics on the gap in child support receipts , as well as the average dollar amount anticipated and the average dollar amount actually received by the custodial parent. For all child support agreements in the sample , the average anticipated amount per year is $ 3 , 596 and the average amount actually received is $ 3 , 047. Therefore , the average gap for the entire sample of families with a child support award in place is $ 549. Families holding agreements where the parent 's have joint custody generally have higher anticipated average amounts and lower gaps between expected and actual payments. Anticipated child support awards are also higher for those families with voluntary agreements and for those families whose payments are made directly to the family. These facts may be consistent with the hypothesis in which parents that are more involved with their children are more conscious of the financial needs of their kids and responsibilities to them . </gap.n.5044><gap.n.5045>In the US , Gap said its summer clearance sales generated weaker than expected interest from consumers.

This is calculated by taking the RF carrier voltage with no modulation and multiplying by 2.25. For example , a 1000 watt carrier has 224 volts rms and 317 volts peak output into a 50 ohm load. At 100 modulation this is 634 volts peak , and at 125 positive peak modulation this is 712 volts peak. To determine the voltage at the tower spark gap the calculation needs to be done for the tower impedance.

Alternatively , when the size of gap 908 is significant , and there is a relatively large amount of mitral valve leakage , then a relatively large number of T-bars 904 and , hence , pledgets 905 may be used to reduce the size of gap 908 by reducing the arc length of mitral valve 916 . Some pledgets 905 may be arranged to at least partially overlap. To correct for a regurgitant jet that is centralized to only one section of mitral valve 916 , T-bars 904 may be implemented as plicating elements near the regurgitant jet , and as reinforcing elements away from the regurgitant jet , e.g. , to prevent progression of mitral valve disease from causing a substantial gap to eventually form . </gap.n.5057><gap.n.5058>On average , there are 197 sunny days per year in Gap , PA.

Firstly , whilst the spark gap is conducting there is power being dissipated as heat. This heat errodes the electrodes and reduces the firing voltage of a static gap. Both of these effects are undesirable. Secondly , the average current seen by the components in the tank circuit is proportional to the time that it flows for. If the spark gap can be made to quench at the first notch instead of the third notch , this represents an 80 reduction in the time for which the huge primary current flows. This reduction in RMS current reduces heating in the tank capacitor and extends the life of the components significantly . </gap.n.5060><gap.n.5061>Second , there are substantial factual disputes remaining in the case.

However , to make the wage gap disappear will require that we stop buying into the idea that the rules are gender-neutral and that men just follow them better than women do. One by one , employers must be convinced to re-examine assumptions that unwittingly place higher value on the type of work men do than on the type of work women do.

The Mid-Atlantic GAP projects ( Delaware and Maryland ) , Pennsylvania GAP , Virginia GAP , and West Virginia GAP agreed to examine their distribution data simultaneously in an attempt to establish the current condition of interstate species distributions. Each state provided species distribution maps for all EMAP hexagons intersecting their states. These data were combined to create regional species distributions. Discrepancies between states with shared hexagons were quantified and used to guide further qualitative analysis. The results of this preliminary study will allow the Mid-Atlantic region to better coordinate data and concentrate mapping efforts on specific areas or taxonomic groups . </gap.n.5090><gap.n.5091>The report , Bridging the Gap : The Case for Increasing the IRS Budget explains that IRS staff have been cut back since 1995 and that cuts have been especially severe among the staff who perform audits. Partly as a result of this , the number of audits is down , particularly for those with incomes over $ 100 , 000 and for large corporations -- the very types of audits that usually uncover the most in unpaid taxes. The amount of time spent on each audit has decreased and the audits are less often uncovering unpaid taxes , even though the tax gap remains a major problem . </gap.n.5091><gap.n.5092>We are aware that the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action has been asking for more than two years for a serious and systematic response to the 2003 recommendations of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. Now we have Concluding Observations from the Human Rights Committee with some new recommendations and some repeated ones that require implementation. Further delay on addressing Canada ' s implementation gap with respect to its international human rights obligations is not acceptable. In our view , it is time for the Government of Canada to close the gap and take its obligations under international human rights treaties seriously.

The first two , having aged into Elderhood ( and the least affected by the Boomers ' counter-culture revolution ) , might become enraged if the Boomers ' use of the military were to result in large-scale casualties for vague foreign policy aims. The 13ers , of course , would be expected to be doing the dying if there were to be casualties . </gap.n.5094><gap.n.5095>The Red Dot Trail provides a path to the top of the Kittatinny Ridge , which has views of the entire area.

This trail intersects with the blue dot and red dot trail at the top. The blue dot also goes to the top but is about a 3 mile hike that is less steep than the red dot.

If my grandfather were alive today , as a Holocaust survivor , to see the Holocaust being exploited so that his granddaughter would be accused of being a murderer , on her own campus , there would have been more than overturning tables. They 're calling me a murderer. I 'm the same as the Nazis who killed the Jews ? I 'm the same as the KKK who killed the black people in the United States ? I 'm the same as them because I chose to have an abortion ? I do n't think it 's a matter of freedom of expression. I consider this hate. I consider it hate literature.

According to Louis Chauvel , sociologist at the National Foundations for Political Science , for the first time in recent history French citizens between the age of 20 and 40 can expect a lower standard of living than the one before , largely because the previous generation has decided not to share.

The arc may continue through the zero current crossing by thermal reignition. This is when the arc is still thermally hot enough as the current starts to rise again and the cathode emits enough electrons fast enough to keep the plasma hot. Another way the arc can continue through the zero current crossing is by dielectric reignition. This is when the current momentarily stops because the temperature dropped and the plasma state could not be maintained. But the gas or air between the electrodes is still relatively hot and will have space charges. The space charges in the air will cause the air to have less dielectric strength and the gap can be bridged at a much lower voltage. The heat still in the air will require less thermal energy to return to a plasma state so the arc restarts and there is a very minute time when the current stopped flowing . </gap.n.5148><gap.n.5149>The new policy is intended to stimulate market-driven economic growth in the countryside and to narrow the enormous income disparity between rural and urban Chinese , one of the largest such gaps in the world.

In this case the motor may not start or it may lose sync. When the motor loses sync it will attempt to re-sync. During this time the RPMs will vary slightly as the motor " hunts " for the sync RPM. If this is a problem then a lighter propeller gap is a good solution. The rotational power of a sync motor is called torque and is usually measured in in/oz ( inch ounces ) . Torque can be complicated , so I prefer to use watts when dealing with sync motors. For most rotary spark gaps the motor should produce at least 10 to 15 watts. More is always better. I have not had much success with 5 watt sync motors . </gap.n.5184><gap.n.5185>In actual operation , however , this gap is wider.

The proportional size of the gap in actual operation has thus increased by about half , from 17 to 26 . But as we have noted , we did not consider in Edgewood IV the effect of hold-harmless districts that would have made the gap much larger , and other discounts and factors that would affect these figures did not exist. According to the intervenors ' expert , these elements together contribute at least $ 599 to the present difference.

In excitatory responses , adaptation is thought to alter both the magnitude and the time course of neural response to acoustic stimuli ( Chimento and Schreiner 1990 , 1991; Feng et al. 1994; Harris and Dallos 1979; Kiang et al. 1965; Phillips 1990 ) . In this study , tonically inhibited units also showed signs of adaptation in their response patterns. For many TI units , raising the background noise caused an increase in the spike count during the gap stimulus ( e.g. , Fig. 4 , Unit 84 in Fig. 7 ) , indicating less effective inhibition. Since the intensity of the gap carrier was 65 dB SPL regardless of background noise level , this suggests that factors outside the gap stimulus diminish the inhibitory efficacy of the foreground stimulus to the cell. Adaptation produced by the background noise is a likely source . </gap.n.5223><gap.n.5224>Most Medicare drug plans ( Part D ) have a temporary limit on what they will cover for prescription drugs.

The irritated first order neuron sends its signal toward the cord along a long extension , called the axon , which goes clear to the dorsal region ( back ) of the cord. It enters the cord just beyond where the neuron cell body is located. The pain signal crosses to the other side of the cord , while being influenced by connections with nearby neurons , and then connects via a synapse ( or gap which is bridged by chemicals ) to a second order neuron. Signals in the second order neuron rises to the thalamus , which is behind the eyes and optic nerves.

We propose an automated method for finding relevant citations based on guideline question classification , semantic processing , and rules that match question classes with semantic predications. In this initial study , we focused on a pediatric cardiovascular risk factor guideline. The overall performance of the system was 40 recall , 88 precision ( F0.5-score 0.71 ) , and 98 specificity.

Drinker hoped to connect his line with one into New York , thus improving the marketability of the anthracite coal that had been discovered in the valley. It was not until March 11 , 1853 , however , that the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad was formed from the consolidation of two smaller lines. On January 21 , 1856 , the first train ran from Scranton to the Delaware River five miles below the Gap. It could go no further because the Warren Railroad in New Jersey was not yet open. By May 13 of that year , though , trains could travel from Great Bend ( north of Scranton ) to New York ( actually the route terminated at Elizabethport , New Jersey , opposite the northwest tip of Staten Island ) . The Southern Division of the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad was officially opened on May 27 , 1856. A train leaving New York at 7 : 30 in the morning arrived in Delaware Water Gap at 1 : 15 that afternoon , a trip of almost six hours . </gap.n.5234><gap.n.5235>I have been very pleased with my test results of this design.

Thomas Chalmers ( 1780-1847 ) , a notable Scottish theologian and first moderator of the Free Church of Scotland , is credited with being the first proponent of the gap theory. His proposal of the theory was first recorded in 1814 in one of his lectures at Edinburgh University. Until 1814 , no theologian had put forth the idea of a gap between Genesis 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. Chalmer ' s teaching to a great extent reflected what was happening in the late 1700s and early 1800s . </gap.n.5239><gap.n.5240>Excessive income gap , slow income growth and the expanded low-income area are an important reason for sluggish consumption.

However , in our opinion at a time when the economy is in the doldrums , the main methods for raising the medium- and low-income earnings should not be raising wages in a simplified way , the only correct way to do this is to help urban unemployed and laid-off workers register and gain new jobs as quickly as possible through active financial , monetary and social policies , employment rate is an effective method for raising the earnings of medium- and low-income families. In addition , we should further improve the work of collecting and managing personal income tax.

On visits to bars the declining generation gap came from the young and old moving in opposite directions towards the middle . </gap.n.5242><gap.n.5243>One of the most popular ' quick-fix ' solutions for addressing the conceptual gap involves terminology. Canadians often group any CF activity overseas under the rubric of ' peacekeeping , ' even full-combat operations such as the 1999 Kosovo War. Meanwhile , some soldiers loathe and abhor the term , others debate definitions , and academics deconstruct the mythology. As a result , additional terms have been added to the operations lexicon. For example , the Somalia Commission of Inquiry report describes multiple types of operations under the rubric of ' peace support operations , ' including ' peacemaking , ' ' preventive diplomacy , ' ' traditional peacekeeping , ' ' preventive deployment , ' and ' second-generation multinational operations , ' among others.41 To avoid confusion , DND/CF spokespersons should always use the terms ' peace support operations ' and ' CF members ' in lieu of ' peacekeeping ' and ' peacekeepers.

This usually happens when the voltage drops , but in some cases occurs when the heated gas rises , stretching out and then breaking the filament of ionized gas.

Since the bone is constantly in a state of turnover in a process known as remodeling , the process of healing bone often comes about naturally. In order for the fracture to heal as quickly as possible , without any deformity , the bones must sometimes be first put back in proper position. This is called " reduction " and involves putting the broken bone in a cast , after the doctor manipulates the bone into proper alignment. The use of casts is called external fixation. On the other hand , surgery may be required for more complicated breaks such as comminuted fractures. Surgery is known by the term internal fixation and uses several materials such as wires , plates , nails , rods and screws. When bone is lost in a fracture and a gap needs to be filled in order to promote bone healing , both vascularized and non-vascularized autologous bone is used. Frequently not enough autologous material is available and a bone allograft from a bone bank is required. Some of the drawbacks in the use of allografts are host rejection and viral contamination . </gap.n.5289><gap.n.5290>Whether the task is to increase Maori participation , decentralise services , improve communication , or develop Maori-sensitive organisational structures , there is one set of skills that is paramount above all others , and that is a thorough grounding in Maori cultural beliefs and practices.

Americans between the ages of 50 and 65 who purchase their own insurance typically pay much higher premiums than younger people. Once they turn 65 , Medicare takes over insurance coverage and the premium difference is no longer an issue. Workers who get their insurance through large employers as a rule do not face that premium gap. But for those who buy their own , the difference in price can be 6 or 7 times higher for older workers than it is for the younger generation. The Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers want to reduce the premium price difference , as a handful of states already do . </gap.n.5299><gap.n.5300>A gap trip is the opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and do something completely different.

Some gappers put college on hold because they weren ' t admitted to their top choice schools. Rather than investing in a college for which they have only lukewarm feelings , they want to use their time to beef up their resume and re-apply. Of course , during their time off some of these students realize that getting into their first choice school wasn ' t so important after all. I applied to only one school before my gap year and did n't get in , says Nate , a 2006 graduate of Wesleyan University. I had my heart set on going there and had decided that if I got denied , I would just apply again during the gap year. As it turns out , I realized I really did n't want to go there and did n't end up re-applying.

Education then , serves as a panacea for our nation ' s social ills. Sadly however , the Katrina fatigue that quickly developed over the national concern for the poor has enveloped the debate over educational inequity. And like U.S. poverty , the state of our country ' s educational system remains dire as a result. Statistics reveal that nine-year-olds growing up in low-income communities ( primarily black and Hispanic children ) stand three grade levels behind their peers in wealthier communities. More shocking , half of them will not graduate from high school , and those who do manage to graduate will , on average , read and do math at the level of eighth-graders in high-income communities.

Changes in family composition are also believed to be a partial contributor to the growing divide.

By contrast , black women have experienced disproportionately large gains in life expectancy at birth over the 1950 2004 period. As a result , life expectancy has risen more for black women than for white women , halving the gap between them but still leaving a difference of more than four years.4 Black women now have a life expectancy that is about seven years greater than that of black men , compared with a difference of about four years in 1950 . </gap.n.5380><gap.n.5381>Spark plugs with configuration complies with ISO Standards; we have semi-conductive type , platinum type , multi-ground type , resistor type , projective nose type , V-grooved type , Surface gap type etc; 5 Glow plugs produced ...

Therefore , an alternative approach to comparing schemes is to look at the maximum identity produced by each scheme for each sequence pair. Similar to Figure Figure5 , 5 , Figure Figure77 shows the maximum identities of each scheme plotted by transformed branch length , and box-whisker plots of the data. As we saw in the best cost analysis , the maximum affine identities are similar to maximum log-affine identities , and both are distinct from the maximum logarithmic identities. Identities decrease with increasing branch lengths , only to increase with the largest branch lengths. Furthermore , logarithmic densities are once again very sensitive to increasing branch lengths.

However , we believe it may be a fruitful avenue to pursue. For example , consider the link between the decline in discrimination and rising skills among women : It is conceivable that less discrimination reinforced women 's decisions to invest more in their own human capital , perhaps by furthering their education or pursuing more lucrative occupational paths. The decline in discrimination also could be linked to the selection explanation , in that it may have lured women with high earnings potential into the labor market. The causality between discrimination and labor force attachment could also go the other direction : For example , greater attachment to the labor force may itself help reduce discrimination if the perceptions of women 's attachment to the labor force change as a consequence. Clearly , the phenomenon of the MFWG remains a rich field of research , not only to understand the rapid narrowing of the gap in the 1980s and the slower narrowing in later years but also the persistence of the gap today . </gap.n.5426><gap.n.5427>A triggerable switching spark gap has two main electrodes , which are insulated from each other , and a galvanically controllable trigger electrode , which is configured in the center of a circular opening of one main electrode.

To start in our own level , we might find ourselves practicing or preaching peace education without realizing the very fact. Although in some form or the other it does exist in the prevalent school curricula it is not been given the required attention as it should have been given. Since the main thrust of education so far has been mostly narrowing down to subject matters only relevant to the passing of examination. The gap still lies large in between theory and practice.

Both explanations are plausible. Women 's unmeasured skills may have improved relative to men 's over the 1980s. ( For instance , women have entered elite private universities -- many of which were closed to women before the mid-1970s -- at an increasing rate in recent decades , perhaps increasing the quality of their schooling. ) But reductions in discrimination may also have played a role in reducing the " unexplained " difference between men 's and women 's wages. For example , as women increased their commitment to the labor force and improved their job skills , statistical discrimination against them may have diminished. In addition , reduced discrimination could also have contributed to the decline in the explained portion of the pay gap if earlier anti-discrimination efforts encouraged women to invest more in labor market skills and to move into traditionally male occupations . </gap.n.5455><gap.n.5456>The Oregon Biodiversity Project was initiated in 1993 as a " GAP Implementation Program.

A key finding is the considerable variation among individuals in their application of the status codes. This shows a large degree of uncertainty about the land tracts and the status codes , and suggests the need to develop an objective and repeatable management categorization process.

That ' s a rich pot , but what I found was that the top quintile , or 20 percent , of the roster took home 63 percent of the money , and the top two quintiles earned 85 percent. The Skins ' aren ' t an anomaly , even though they are one of the richest teams.

We use a utility of income function , which is of iso-elastic form ( constant relative risk aversion; CRRA ) , and longitudinal data for rural households to construct measures of certainty equivalent income ( equivalent in expected utility terms ) for rural incomes. We then calculate summary distributional measures for these modified measures for China including the urban rural income gap , Gini coefficient , and Theil measures. We compute measures for both certainty equivalent and observed income. Data only allow us to adjust rural incomes in this way , but it is in the rural sector in China that volatility is most pronounced . </gap.n.5580><gap.n.5581>The GAP is a great one-stop shopping store for the entire family.

Furthermore , the results find that affine gap costs can serve as a good approximation to log-affine gap costs to account for the shifting and scaling often introduced by match and mismatch scores. Because affine gap costs are quick , efficient , and currently nearly ubiquitous , this research strengthens the rational for existing practices in molecular biology . </gap.n.5591><gap.n.5592>Your satisfaction is out top priority !

To better understand the characteristics of gaps and in particular quenched gaps , it is helpful to examine spark transmitters. In the diagram to the right , a simplified schematic is shown. Several hundred volts at approximately 500 hertz is applied to the primary of the transformer. A potential of 15 , 000 volts was common on the secondary. The condenser charges for each cycle , until the breakdown voltage of the gap is reached. The condenser discharges and an oscillation is set up in primary of the oscillation transformer. This in turn sets up an oscillation in the secondary of the oscillation transformer. The primary does not radiate because it is a closed circuit oscillator. However , the secondary , being an open circuit , does radiate . </gap.n.5610><gap.n.5611>A Tesla coil is a resonate transformer consisting of a primary and secondary LC circuit. Power is supplied to the primary circuit through a transformer. A capacitor in the primary circuit will begin to charge. Eventually the voltage across the capacitor will increase sufficiently and short across a spark gap. The spark gap will allow the capacitor to discharge into an inductor called the primary coil. The primary inductor is coupled to an inductor in the secondary circuit , called the secondary coil. Attached to the top of the secondary coil is a top load that acts as a capacitor. As the primary circuit oscillates , power is transferred to the secondary coil where the voltage is increased and arcs of lightning are discharged form the top load. The primary and secondary circuits must resonate at the same frequency to achieve maximum power transfer from the primary to the secondary. The circuits in the coil are usually " tuned " to the same frequency by adjusting the inductance of the primary coil.

The main electrodes each have a flat discharge surface; the two discharge surfaces stand axially opposite each other.

When a suitable voltage is supplied , a spark forms , ionizing the gas and drastically reducing its electrical resistance. An electric current then flows until the path of ionized gas is broken or the current reduces below a minimum value called the 'holding current'. This usually happens when the voltage drops , but in some cases occurs when the heated gas rises , stretching out and then breaking the filament of ionized gas. Usually the action of ionizing the gas is violent and disruptive , often leading to sound ( ranging from a snap for a spark plug to thunder for a lightning discharge ) , light and heat. Spark gaps were used historically in early electrical equipment , such as spark gap radio transmitters , electrostatic machines , and x-ray machines. Their most widespread use today is in spark plugs to ignite the fuel in internal combustion engines , but they are also used in lightning arrestors and other devices to protect electrical equipment from high voltage transients . </gap.n.5644><gap.n.5645>However , whether a violent outbreak will occur also depends on the reaction by the other parties in the conflict.

A strong magnetic field is placed between the electrodes. Since this field alters the field formed by the high voltage prior to breakdown of the dielectric in the gap , it may affect the break-down voltage of a given set of electrodes. Once the gap breaks down however , the field shape changes. The high current flowing through the gap generates a field shape associated with the current. By placing a strong magnetic field in right angles to the current flow , the arc is disrupted. This disruption tears at the magnetic lines of force formed by the high current channel flowing through the gap. The arc is twisted , and broken , without having to remove ions . </gap.n.5652><gap.n.5653>Patients were determined to have diabetes if they had filled a prescription for at least 1 glucose-lowering medication ( eg , insulin , metformin ) at some point during 2005.

The decline over the last 25 years in the fraction of the workforce that is unionized has raised women 's relative pay as fewer men receive union wages. In addition , the share of unionized workers who are female has increased as unions have declined less ( or even grown ) in certain public sector and service-related occupations that have a greater share of female workers.22 These female union members have benefitted from higher union wages. But , overall , the decline of unions has had a relatively small role in the declining gender pay gap; by itself , it would have caused the gender pay gap to decline by about one percentage point over the 1980s . </gap.n.5658><gap.n.5659>Regardless of the reason , the gap theory has gained considerable support from several modern theologians.

METHODS : Following extensive discussions involving both public health and human rights experts , two tools were developed and reviewed in an iterative manner. The Manual provides essential background on human rights and public health , including specific application of human rights concepts in the context of HIV/AIDS prevention and care. The Action Kit translates broad concepts into specific measures and practical actions at the community and national level. RESULTS : The Manual and Action Kit have been well received by reviewers from 25 countries. Workshops using the " AIDS , Health and Human Rights " approach have been successful in bridging the gap between health and human rights around specific HIV/AIDS policy and programmatic issues. The Manual and Action Kit will be widely disseminated during 1994. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS : In order to promote broad concepts , such as the linkage between AIDS , health and human rights , it is essential to provide practical and useful tools for community and national workers. It is possible to foster effective communication between health and human rights workers through this type of process.

For example with 1 round spheres as electrodes my 15KV NST would breakdown the gap as long as the distance was under 0.25 . Using 10 AWG wire tips as electrodes on the same NST the gap breakdown distance was increased to just under 0.75 . The rounded electrodes also tend to stabilize the breakdown voltage of a gap. This is desirable in a Tesla Coil so the energy delivered to the system is more constant. Pipes in parallel to one another are commonly used since they are rounded. The other advantage to this is the increased thermal mass of the electrodes so they can absorb and then dissipate more heat. When air is blown across these for quenching the air can pass through the center of the pipes as well as the arc area. The center of the pipe adds to the surface area of the electrode and it can dissipate heat faster . </gap.n.5680><gap.n.5681>Leave your swords at the door Mates !

NRP estimates that $ 197 billion of underreporting is the result of noncompliance by individual taxpayers. Furthermore , tax evaders are much more likely to understate income than they are to overstate deductions , credits , and exemptions. Understatement stems from income invisibility and the lack of a paper trail. Income that is not reported by taxpayers is difficult for the IRS to discover. But deductions , exemptions , and credits must be substantiated by the taxpayer. Income from business activities makes up the majority of underreported income. In comparison to business income , income from other sources , such as wages or investment income , is more likely to be directly reported to the IRS by third parties , such as employers. Furthermore , income taxes owed on wage income are withheld by employers and remitted directly to the IRS , making the opportunity for underreporting minimal . </gap.n.5687><gap.n.5688>As can be seen from Figure 8 , the first sealing gap 312.1 is bordered by a first wall element 309.4 of the last optical element 309 that is parallel to the first plane , i.e. perpendicular to the first axis of symmetry of the last optical element 309.

Even those who have migrated from the countryside find it difficult to increase their earnings , for there are limited jobs for these workers. Approximately 80 percent of workers are in the low-income category. Some do not even earn enough to be taxed.

Previous projections of gap entry rates were based on assumptions that patient drug spending would stay steady as patients approach the gap , as well as after the gap was reached.20 Our findings demonstrate that total drug costs were decreasing in the latter part of the year as out-of-pocket costs were rising , which suggests that medication use by diabetes patients could be decreasing once they hit the coverage gap. This observation would support the findings of other Medicare Part D studies , which found evidence of decreased drug adherence based on cost , 1 , 18 especially for patients with worse health status such as those with diabetes.19 Because cost-related medication nonadherence is associated with poorer health status , greater rates of cardiac adverse events , and increased use of emergency services , 3 particular attention should be paid to addressing this potential risk for diabetes patients in Medicare Part D plans . </gap.n.5789><gap.n.5790>The mountain is of the Silurian Shawangunk conglomerate.

Only fragments of these primary ecosystems remain today. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) began the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) process to establish the proposed 30 , 000 acre Grand Kankakee Marsh National Wildlife Refuge ( GKMNWR ) during the summer of 1997. Our refuge design strategy involves a landscape approach formulated to complement existing management efforts within the watershed. The Indiana and Illinois Gap Analysis projects provided the mechanism to adopt a data-driven approach to initial reserve design for the proposed GKMNWR. While FWS trust resources drove the analysis , the resource interests of partner organizations were also considered. GAP provided the resources to move beyond the expert workshop approach. Using simple on-screen analysis , we established focus areas that formed the basis for the Environmental Assessment and the Economic Impact Study required under NEPA.

After the incrementor catheter is delivered , the incrementor catheter may be deployed in step 3200 to create a nominal distance or gap between the first anchor location and the working lumen , e.g. , a second section , of the incrementor catheter. Then , in step 3220 , a second permanent anchor may be applied at the nominal distance from the first permanent anchor.

Most significantly , it raises the question of the correctness of the rule adopted by the district court that if any carrier provides any coverage within a purported gap , then there can not , as a matter of law , be an effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services.

This technique can be exploited in an implantable or external device , which , upon sensing an atrial tachyarrhythmia , can apply the low energy stimulation at several different timing intervals until the correct timing can be achieved and the arrhythmia can be terminated. This trial and error approach can be used , as atrial arrhythmias are not immediately life threatening.

Spend meal times together. Parents must be interested in their children ' s activities outside the home and to treat them like barkada. Encourage them to share their experiences and be ready to laugh at their mistakes and be appreciative of their accomplishments. On top of this , pray together as a family. A praying father or mother will always make the children feel loved and cared for , and that will eventually fill in the generation gap. Always spend time on healthy and intelligent discussions with your children on the latest issues or any topic of interest in the newspapers or TV programs. If possible , watch TV with them and try to enlighten them on issues you feel will warp their minds.

However , the incidence of children who worked in the informal sector continued to increase as more children worked to fill the income gap left by ill , unemployed , or deceased relatives. Children often lacked access to necessary safety equipment and training. Children worked in the agricultural sector , as domestics , and as car watchers. In addition there were reports of an increasing number of girls engaged in prostitution.

They grew up in scheduled , structured lives , often with active and involved parents. The emergence of a multicultural society is seen as the norm. They regard the threat of terrorism as a fact of life , and they live in a global community that is connected 24 hours a day , seven days a week. Interestingly , the response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , saw a resurgence of the American hero : police officers , firefighters , and mayors commonly appeared on the news and in print. One result of these acts is an emerging sense of patriotism and political interest.

Another aspect of the gap that bears mentioning is the difference between the role of family and parenting in the lives of academics between now and previous generations. Many young academics and academic couples are committed parents with their partners , and as such , time at the office and in the lab is precious and must be spent very wisely to allow for child-care and school-related events and schedules , sick kids , and parent-teacher conferences. Weekly dinners with other faculty , for example , may be a virtual impossibility for folks balancing parenting and the professorate; even leaving town for professional conferences can be difficult , and travel schedules are often tensely-negotiated and strained by family obligations and the challenges of having a working spouse.

Because the extension cost is not influenced by the distribution of gap lengths , the Zipf power-law distribution of gap sizes appears to be approximated by a discrete uniform distribution. Although this result is rather unexpected , it makes sense in two ways. First , Zipf distributions have fat tails , and sections of the tail can be well approximated by a uniform distribution. And second , the numbers of matches , mismatches , and gapped positions are not independent of one another ( Appendix B ); therefore , matches and mismatches carry information about gap lengths. The uniform approximation for a Zipf distribution may prove to be more useful than geometric [ 17 , 21 ] or mixed-geometric models [ 19 , 28 ] . </gap.n.5932><gap.n.5933>Incredibly , the new data show that the richest 300 , 000 Americans one-tenth of 1 percent of the population devoured as much of the national pie as the bottom 150 million , or half the country !

I share in this anxiety , but my analysis of what plagues us is often very different from John ' s and that of other posters. My number one concern heading into 2008 is that distraction will win out once again , as the basic tenets of economic theory go ignored in lieu of things like the debate over immigration. The problem I have with illegal immigration isn ' t that it deprives jobs from native Americans , but that it lowers wages across the board. Employing illegal immigrants is a crime , and the risk/reward is such that employers are likely to commit that crime because it benefits them in so many ways. The largest benefit to employers is that they no longer have as many obligations to their labor force as they once did. An illegal worker is someone who is scared , and this reality tilts the scales unfairly towards their employer. When this group is exploited in such a way , it adversely effects the wages paid to legal workers.

Neither can all conflicts be traced back to a failing state , bad governance or political manipulation.

However , once polluted , cleaning it up ( remediation ) takes a relatively long time ( years ) , is more technically demanding , and can be much more costly. While this has been recognized for several decades ( Vrba 1985 ) , this important message has not been adequately or consistently conveyed to the policy-makers or the public. To address this gap , groundwater vulnerability assessment methods are being developed. These emerging ' vulnerability maps ' have historically been applied to other risks such as flooding and landslides and they can now be used as direct input to water resources and land planning ( Vrba and Zaporozek 1994 ) . Results of such studies are absolutely critical where aquifers are used for water supplies and have sensitive ecosystem dependencies. In conjunction with other environmental input , they have become effective instruments used to regulate , manage and take decisions related to impacts from existing and proposed changes in land use , ecosystems and sources of water supplies. Large-scale groundwater vulnerability maps ( e.g. France , Germany , Spain , Italy , The Czech Republic , Poland , Russia and Australia ) serve as guidelines for land use zoning at national or regional levels . </gap.n.5947><gap.n.5948>Whites overall seemed to perceive conflicts to be less intense than any other group.

Moreover , the degree to which MGTs improved was directly related to the S/N ratio : TI units were capable of increasingly more sensitive temporal processing in increasingly unfavorable S/N conditions. While pure tonic inhibition is rare in the IC ( Walton et al. 1998 , 1997; Willott and Urban 1978 ) , inhibitory input is observed in the vast majority of IC cells ( Klug et al. 1999 ) and plays a very important role in complex signal processing ( e.g. , Casseday et al. 1994; Fuzessery and Hall 1996; Kuwada et al. 1997; Palombi and Caspary 1996; Park and Pollak 1994 ) .

In a typical transmitter circuit , a high voltage source ( shown in the schematic as a battery , but usually a high voltage transformer ) charges a capacitor ( C1 in figure ) through a resistor until the spark gap discharges , then a pulse of current passes through the capacitor ( C2 in figure ) . The inductor and capacitor after the gap form a resonant circuit. After being excited by the current pulse , the oscillation rapidly decays because energy is radiated from the antenna. Because of the rapid onset and decay of the oscillation , the RF pulse occupies a large band of frequencies . </gap.n.6058><gap.n.6059>Our cross-national analysis indicates that for both periods ( 1995-2000 and 2000-2005 ) , countries with larger gender gaps tend to have higher adolescent fertility rates [ see Figure 1 ] . In both 1995 and 2005 the expected adolescent fertility rate of countries with zero gender gap was roughly equal at about 28 births per thousand female adolescents. The average adolescent fertility at moderate and high gender gaps deviates slightly over the ten year period. In 1995 fertility among moderate-gap countries averaged 71 births per thousand adolescent females , whereas in 2005 fertility among moderate-gap countries averaged 61 births. The difference remains about the same among the large-gap countries; fertility averaging 159 births per thousand adolescent females in 1995 and 169 births in 2005 . </gap.n.6059><gap.n.6060>Generational gaps ?

This paper outlines a project designed to incorporate demographic data into an existing conservation management tool , the aim being to better reflect development pressures upon natural habitat. Spatially explicit secondary data reflecting housing density from Census 2000 are merged with indicators of biological richness from the Utah Gap Analysis Program. The intersection of the two data layers allows identification of biodiversity " hotspots " within Utah , areas characterized by high levels of species richness combined with high levels of housing pressure. Additionally , several areas are identified as potential conservation targets , given their high levels of species richness and relatively low housing density.

In recent years , the GAP protocols used to analyze habitat data have become more scale and species dependent. This research describes the creation of a Spatial Decision Support System ( SDSS ) that applies species-specific parameters of Individual Area Requirement ( IAR ) ( ) , Minimum viable population ( MVP ) , and Reach ( ) to determine critical habitats for animal species , thereby eliminating those areas that are effectively unusable because of size or inaccessibility. The utility of the SDSS , and the three algorithms contained within it ( i.e. , core area , core area growth and aggregate ) , is demonstrated by creating distribution maps of usable habitat for five species ( i.e. , alligator , black bear , bobcat , gray fox and wild turkey ) commonly found in the state of Arkansas.

The central argument is that as the small microplates , Monterray and Arguello approached and slowed near the subduction zone , their downgoing slabs were getting progressively younger and warmer. Obviously if a slab is very young when it is subducted it takes a proportionally short amount of time to heat back up to asthenospheric values as is observed at the present day Juan de Fuca subduction slab. It is argued that instead of a slab window developing west to east ( while also propagating N-S ) there is a slab gap that develops from the east which then also prorogates north and south with the Mendocino and Rivera triple junctions. This is because at a certain time after subduction the slab would become indistinguishable from the asthenosphere surrounding it . </gap.n.6120><gap.n.6121>EXPERIMENTAL Example 1.

And the key hermeneutical principle ' to bridge this gap is biblical theology'. This simply means reading the Bible in the light of God 's unfolding plan , as outlined above. In trying to apply any particular text , we first locate it within the flow of salvation history , see how it is fulfilled in Christ and his people , and therefore how it applies to us. It is the way the Bible itself unfolds and-tells its story ( 'biblical theology ' ) that determines why it is that some aspects of the Old Testament are still valid , and why other aspects are no longer to be followed.

Several other people have also had good success with the filter. The filter is a typical low pass design that consists of several caps wired in series to shunt high frequency spikes to ground and high power resistors to decouple the NSTs from the primary circuit. A spark gap allows high voltage spikes to pass to ground. The spark gap should be set just wide enough so it does not short when connected directly to the NST output. I omitted the MOVs in my filter , although I 'm sure they would help shunt voltage spikes to ground. Each cap has a high resistance bleeder resistor across the leads. The bleeder resistors should not be in direct contact with the capacitor case as arcing can occur. Several caps are wired in series to handle the high voltages from the NST output. The total voltage rating of the series caps should be 3 times the peak voltage of the NST output , although good quality caps can be run at their rated voltage . </gap.n.6168><gap.n.6169>Common firing rates for a synchronous rotary spark gap running in a 50Hz system are 100BPS or 200BPS , although any integer multiple of the supply frequency can be used.

This results in force vectors that by the construction both want to narrow the gap between the V-piston and the apical-diaphragmal region of the heart and also to generate pressure gradients towards the enclosed blood volumes. The tension will create a motion in the fields where resistant against motion is lowest. The hydraulic attachments of the heart to the pericardia and the surrounding tissues creates , as is the case during the atrial contraction , sliding motions of the ventricular muscles along the pericardial sac due to that the resistance to motion of the inside and outside masses are large.

Looking at gender for fourth grade for all three groups sets the general stage. Males , on average , are a bit behind females among African-Americans , Hispanics , and whites. That pattern does not change as the class aged and moved up through the grades. The one difference is that males are a bit further behind their female counterparts as they progressed through school. Thus , African-American males in ninth grade are 16 points , on average , behind African-American females while they were only 8 points behind in fourth grade. White males in ninth grade are , on average , 16 points behind white females while the males were only 4 points behind in fourth. Among Hispanics , the four-point gap that existed in fourth grade averages grew to 12 points by ninth grade. The pattern is clear : males , on average , do not do as well in reading as females , regardless of race.

The high voltage will always jump the smallest gap it can find. Sometimes this gap is , incorrectly , inside the case of the stungun. If the spark is jumping inside the stungun case then there is no voltage available to jump the external gap ( s ) . Note that a normally operating stun gun sometimes has two spark gaps that both must spark , the visible external spark gap ( which is usually two gaps; the default gap and the working gap ) and another gap located inside the case. The internal gap is part of the high voltage generating circuitry. Usually , this internal gap is simply two strips of flat metal that cross each other in an X pattern. These two pieces of metal are designed to arc at a fairly " low " voltage ( probably a few hundred volts ) and supply the switching between the two stages of voltage amplification that most stun guns use . </gap.n.6216><gap.n.6217>There 's been some salacious commentary ( such as WAC 's Like a Vixen ) about Blawg Review 171.

When it is detected that the water line of the selected working path is higher than the phase discriminator water line , the clock gap is switched to a slow gap mode. When it is detected that the water line of the selected working path is equal to the phase discriminator water line , the rapid gap mode and the slow gap mode are alternately adopted . </gap.n.6233><gap.n.6234>Often , consumers owe more to the bank than the value of their car. Consider additional facts to the hypothetical above : in 2008 , at the time the loan is due , the car ' s value has significantly depreciated to $ 5 , 000 , but the outstanding loan balance is $ 8 , 000. Thus , in the event of a total loss with the total motor vehicle physical damage insurance policy in force the consumer would owe the bank $ 3 , 000 out of pocket. If the loss was a result of an accident , the physical damage insurance policy would only pay the actual cash value of the car ( less the deductible ) , and the consumer would owe the remaining balance to the bank. This scenario gave rise to gap waivers , which lenders began to sell. Gap waivers eliminate the debtor ' s obligation to the creditor for the gap , or the difference between the actual value of the property and the amount owed to the bank , when the debtor suffers a loss in value . </gap.n.6234><gap.n.6235>Finally , let us hear what a synchronous spark transmitter might have sounded like.

The primary serves as the inductance in the resonant circuit formed by it and the capacitor. As the spark gap breaks down and conducts , current is dumped into the primary of the O.T. from the capacitor , and passes back and forth between the capacitor and OT primary until the spark gap opens again. Energy is transferred from the " closed " circuit formed by the tank to the secondary of the O.T. The secondary of the OT , together with the distributed capacitance and inductance of the antenna or load , forms the " open " circuit. This is the portion which radiates all of the signal. Both primary and secondary inductances are tapped to permit independent adjustment. By changing the location of the tap on the primary for a given capacitor , the frequency of the radiation can be adjusted. The open circuit is then tuned to resonate at the same frequency as the closed circuit by adjustment of the tap , allowing for an efficient transfer of energy between closed and open circuits. An OT is generally fitted with some means of varying the coupling between the primary and secondary . </gap.n.6239><gap.n.6240>" It 's major project for us so we know it 's going to take some time , " Marubio said.

For those 18-24 in 1973 20.1 gave 2 or more DKs ( to the 100 items ) , this fell to 17.3 in 1985 , and rose to 27.4 in 1997. For those 65+ the DKs levels were 40.1 in 1973 , 32.9 in 1985 , and 40.3 in 1997. The generation gap thus closed from 20.0 in 1973 to 15.6 in 1985 and to 12.9 in 1997.

This revolution involves indifference ( and sometimes hostility ) toward many traditional institutions , including religious institutions. As is the case with other liberal cosmopolitans , criticism from what is perceived of as the left does not seriously bother journalists. Those on the left are believed to have their hearts in the right place , even if they are not always practical. On the other hand , criticism from what are seen , accurately or not , as conservative sources is not to be countenanced , for they are among the seriously misinformed , if not wicked , of the earth.

Most of this excess staff cost is due to errors produced by people.

This will act to prevent air from passing up the center of the gap where it takes up little heat and fewer ions. I use a piece of 3 " or smaller PVC pipe set on the gap base and passing up into the bottom of the gap just under the electrode ring. This forces the air to pass through the electrodes and between the gaps to remove heat and ions and improves the run time. Performance may also be improved by fitting finned , cylindrical heat sinks , available at the electronics surplus or many hamfests , into the center of the copper electrodes. A little heat sink paste here is helpful to assist in heat removal from the electrode and preventing corrosion from the aluminum/copper contact. Oxides formed by contact corrosion are poor heat conductors. For maximum effectiveness the heat sinks should be cleaned of any coating at the contact points. Finned heat sinks installed in this fashion will dramatically increase the surface area of the electrodes. This is especially true in gaps of this design using larger copper pipe and bigger gap rings . </gap.n.6342><gap.n.6343>Even for those who do make it into four-year schools , graduation rates for low-income and minority students were also found to lag across the A2S member systems.

So it includes , but it is not restricted to , the cognitive processes involved in the understanding of perceived actions performed by conspecifics. It is widely recognized that what is distinctive of human social cognition is the human mindreading ability to understand , not just the observable behavior of one ' s conspecifics , but also one ' s own mind ( which we shall ignore here ) and especially the minds of others ( Baron-Cohen , 1995; Leslie and Thaiss , 1992; Frith and Frith , 2003; Saxe et al. , 2004 ) . [ 4 ] Thanks to their mindreading ability , healthy human adults readily explain and predict human actions by representing and attributing to human agents a whole battery of internal unobservable mental states such as goals , intentions , emotions , perceptions , desires , beliefs , many of which are far removed from any observable behavior ( Gopnik and Wellman , 1994 ) . It is also intuitively clear that there is a gap between full-blown human mindreading and the psychological understanding of perceived actions afforded by MNs.

And this gap is impossible to overcome in retirement. It is the result of women earning less than men while working , which means they can not save as much; if they contribute to pension plans at the same rate as men , they are contributing less because the pay their contributions are based on is less; they receive smaller Social Security checks because they earn less while they work and they often have to leave the workforce for periods of time to take care of dependents; and they live longer so what they manage to accumulate has to be spread over more years . </gap.n.6356><gap.n.6357>There are two handles for adjusting the gap between the rollers.

There are as many variations of this theory as there are theologians to support it. Simply stated , the gap theory is the idea that a long period of time existed between God ' s initial creation in Genesis 1 : 1 when " God created the heaven and the earth " and Genesis 1 : 2 when the earth was " without form and void. " Most gap theorists believe that prior to Genesis 1 : 2 the " first " earth was inhabited by angelic creatures , such as Lucifer , as well as the mysterious dinosaurs. A pre-Adamite race of men is also thought to have populated the earth at this time. Many gap theorists teach that the world existed in this manner for millions of years , if not billions. The gap ' s end is believed to have occurred when God , finding iniquity in Satan ' s heart , was compelled to destroy the earth with a flood and make it " without form , and void " ( Genesis 1 : 2 ) . God then proceeded to " re-create " the earth in six literal days as described in Genesis 1 : 3-31.

On the contrary , disagreements are an essential part of everyday life , and the literature reports numerous situations in which it is more important to defend one 's standpoint than to save face ( Kotthoff , 1993; Locher , 2004 ) or where disagreement is in fact the preferred reaction ( Pomerantz , 1984; Kotthoff , 1993 ) . The above-mentioned reflections on the face-threatening nature of disagreement illustrate , however , the delicate nature of this speech act , and therefore help us understand why strategies expressing disagreement are much more complex than those expressing agreement ( LoCastro , 1986; Hayashi , 1996 ) . In any case , speakers have to bridge the gap between their desire to express their opinion and the presumption that this will be an undesired action.

According to Figure Figure5 , 5 , this occurs after the ninety-fifth percentile , which roughly includes all identities associated with branch lengths greater than 0.6 , which is three times the mean branch length. More than likely , branch lengths much larger than 0.6 are responsible for this observation , but Figure Figure55 does not have the resolution to detect a more precise threshold. The observation that alignment identity improves at the longest branch lengths can be attributed to the fact that sequences at long branch lengths , although related , are saturated with indels and thus have very few nucleotides homologous to one another anymore. Therefore , parameters that tend to produce hypothesized alignments dominated by gaps , which cause low identities elsewhere , show high identity to the true alignment at long branch lengths . </gap.n.6593><gap.n.6594>To ensure efficient operation , you should not allocate more memory to GAP than the size of your physical memory.

Darwinian archaeology and cultural evolution ( 2002 ) , and John Robb and Marcia-Anne Dobres 's edited volume Agency in archaeology ( 2000 ) . To overcome this theoretical divide it is necessary to revive the theoretical debate , based upon epistemological principles relevant to archaeology as a historical discipline . </gap.n.6602><gap.n.6603>To resolve this controversy , an attempt must be made to understand the reasoning behind the gap theory. One must understand the history of the gap theory and the Scripture references used by the theory ' s proponents. After grasping what the gap theory entails , one must then use the light of Scripture to attempt to validate or invalidate the theory ( Acts 17 : 11 ) . At the conclusion of this validation process , two questions will then be left to answer : Does the Bible teach the gap theory , and does it really matter whether the gap theory is taught or not ? </gap.n.6603><gap.n.6604>Shiklamanov and Rodda ( 2003 ) conclude that only general predictions and observations have been developed based on the assessments of global warming impacts on water resources to date. They agree with Arnell ( 2004 ) that assessments of future water resources can only be obtained by using estimates of possible regional ( rather than global ) changes in climate ( primarily precipitation and temperature by seasons and months ) . They specify that the existing climate change estimates are extremely unreliable even for the largest regions and river basins. Furthermore , they suggest that the gap in knowledge related to the specific impacts of global warming on water resources is one of the largest scientific challenges in hydrology today . </gap.n.6604><gap.n.6605>The move got into the gap at 1231.20 but , so far , did not fill it.

Here the story is complicated. The overall median black family income in the United States is 61 percent of the median white family income. This very large gap in the income ratio has remained virtually unchanged for more than 30 years. Through both good economic times and recessions , there has been little fluctuation in the overall racial income gap. But , one asks , what is the effect of the increase in the number of blacks going to college on the overall black-white income gap ? Don ' t these gains in college completions tend to close the overall racial income gap ? The simple answer is , no. It turns out that the much greater earnings produced by more blacks who have completed college make little difference to the median income figure ( the person in the middle ) because less than 18 percent of all black adults over the age of 25 have completed a four-year college education . </gap.n.6619><gap.n.6620>GAP , the Gujarat AIDS Awareness and Prevention Unit is the leading non-governmental organization in India in the field of HIV/AIDS and sexual health.

For component manufacturing , a preform is inserted into a mould , then impregnated with a liquid resin , and finally cured. The innovative feature here is rapid impregnation through the creation of a temporary flow gap , followed by the subsequent compression of the impregnated preforms by means of pressing and squeezing. Through the development of an automatic gap impregnation unit in combination with an analysis of the manufacturing process , it was possible for the IKV to impregnate and compress parts measuring 500 x 500 mm2 with a fibre content of 50 per cent by volume in as little as 19 seconds. Accelerated impregnation and compression procedures also make it possible to produce parts within 280 seconds. Including the time for preparatory measures , cycle times of less than ten minutes can then be achieved. This made a key contribution to achieving a production process for continuous fibre reinforced plastic parts that was suitable for series production. The process and plant technology can be used in automotive engineering and also in the aviation and aerospace industries to produce two-dimensional structural and outer skin components . </gap.n.6635><gap.n.6636>Average math scores by race and gender for the Class of 2011 are quite similar in many ways to those of the Class of 2008 ( Tables 23 and 24 ) .

God revealed that Lucifer , in an unfallen state , existed in the Garden of Eden , which was not created until day six. Many gap theorists have tried to explain this by saying that the Garden of Eden in Ezekiel 28 : 13-17 could not have been the one described in the book of Genesis. To preserve their theory , they invented another garden just as they invented another flood. Neither is ever mentioned in God ' s Word. The gap theorists ' opinion comes from the fact that Ezekiel describes the Garden as having " every precious stone , " which , they say , is different from the Genesis account.

Mesenchymal cells proliferate and become tightly packed. The cells become rounded , with prominent round or oval nuclei. Gap junctions are present between the cells. Differentiation into chondroblasts is characterized by the cells secreting a surrounding basophilic halo of matrix , composed of a delicate network of fine type II collagen filaments , type IX collagen and cartilage proteoglycan core protein. In some sites , continued secretion of matrix further separates the cells , and produces typical hyaline cartilage. Elsewhere , many cells become fibroblasts , and collagen synthesis predominates. Chondroblastic activity appears only in isolated groups or rows of cells which become surrounded by dense bundles of collagen fibers to form white fibrocartilage. In other sites , the matrix of early cellular cartilage is permeated first by anastomosing oxytalan fibers , and later by elastin fibers. In all cases , developing cartilage is surrounded by condensed mesenchyme which differentiates into a bilaminar perichondrium. The cells of the outer layer become fibroblasts and secrete a dense collagenous matrix lined externally by vascular mesenchyme. The cells of the inner layer contain differentiated , but mainly resting , chondroblasts or prechondroblasts . </gap.n.6652><gap.n.6653>Rebecca Romijn and Kate Beckinsale were just two of the celebs who showed up for the opening of the Gap 1969 Jeans Shop in LA. hide photo thumbnails </gap.n.6653><gap.n.6654>Just be aware that the spark gaps are a bit slow to limit the voltage enough without some other secondary protection.

The authority figures need to operate in a democratic fashion and make an attempt to bridge the generation gap.

If the arc in the spark gap hangs too long ( NOT quenched ) , it leaves the tank circuit electrically closed. With the gap still firing energy will backflow from the secondary into the primary and create continued oscillation in the tank circuit. The secondary is then supplying energy to maintain the arc in the spark gap. As power levels build , so does the pressure on the spark gap. Engineering more sophisticated gap systems is the only solution in large wave coils and Magnifiers . </gap.n.6745><gap.n.6746>Turning to the policy implications of the study , Jeynes suggested that showing that factors as simple as religious commitment , religious schools , and family structure can reduce or eliminate the gap may inspire educators and social scientists to encourage policies that are supportive of faith and the family so that the gap can be narrowed significantly.

If the unit is constructed from 1 " dia. pipe and the electrodes are gapped at .056 -.06 the arc can be split down two parallel paths ( center electrode tapped ) for a good quench time with a neon power supply of 12 kv rms in the 1.5 kva power range , this is of course intermittent operation but will use only one gap unit.

Associated Press writer Hope Yen examined a recent and relevant study by The Pew Research Center about the current generation gap. In her article , titled " Study Finds Widening Generation Gap in US , " Yen addresses the following findings : " From cell phones and texting to religion and manners , younger and older Americans see the world differently , creating the largest generation gap since the tumultuous years of the 1960s and the culture clashes over Vietnam , civil rights , and women 's liberation. " In fact , almost 8 out of 10 people believe there are major differences between the generations today. That is the highest spread since 1969.

Although God made His Word plain and simple so that all could understand and believe ( Psalm 119 : 130 ) , many theologians interpret Scriptures with a mind clouded by opinions , preconceived ideas , and a bias having been " educated " in heathen schools of thought. Interpretation in this manner causes many theologians to twist the Scripture into agreeing with their " theory. " Feeling the attacks of " science , " Christians began to interpret the Scripture with the preconceived idea that science had determined the age of the earth. God did not write His Word with tricky language. To compromise the simplicity or authority of the Scripture is to accommodate the world ' s current philosophy.

These synapses are routinely used as models of specific types of brain activity responsible for learning and memory. A synapse is the gap between an incoming nerve and its target cell across that gap. Signals pass from one cell on one side of the gap to another cell on the other side. The increased release of excitatory chemicals glutamate and proline due to PRODH deficiency inhibited the ability of the synapse to undergo a change called long-term potentiation ( LTP ) -- a long-lasting strengthening in the connection between two nerve cells.

It is based in part on the faulty " gap theory " long vociferously dinned into our ears by population control adherents. They claim that the economic gap between developed and underdeveloped countries is widening , and that this shows the poor countries ' increasing misery. They further propose to alleviate this misery by planned ( forced ? ) redistribution of wealth on an international scale. However , the facts are that this gap is a very misleading measure of the real economic improvement taking place in Third World countries today. Malnutrition has diminished everywhere except in drought-plagued Africa. Per capita food production world-wide has gone up , and life expectancy , the best indicator of physical well-being , has significantly increased. Further , increased wealth in already wealthy countries does not necessarily mean exploitation of less wealthy countries but may even be helpful to the latter Well-documented studies , for instance by julian Simon in The Ultimate Resource7 , have disseminated all this information.

Then , reviewing the many ways in which the city 's and state 's housing and development policies hobbled New York 's housing market , the report calculated fairly precisely the consequences of these policies in terms of a concept characterized as the city 's " housing gap. " In estimating the housing gap , changes in the housing supply are calculated by tracking annual rates of new housing production , offset by annual housing losses due to abandonment or the withdrawal of dwellings from the residential stock. Changes in demand are calculated by establishing the volume of growth or decline in the household population. Because a truly healthy housing market is one in which the rate of housing production should be high enough to permit replacement of the worst existing dwellings , a quality enhancement adjustment is added to the population-based estimate of demand . </gap.n.6979><gap.n.6980>Windows must also be properly air sealed during installation to perform correctly.

A synchronous gap runs at a fixed speed so that the gap fires in direct relation to the 60 cycle waveform of the line feed to the capacitors. After many failed attempts , I was able to properly set up synchronous gap to fire only at the voltage peaks of the 60 cycle input current. This allows the tank circuit to fire only on the maximum voltage peaks and delivers the pulse from a fully charged capacitor each time the gap fires.

In 1974 developing countries called for a New International Economic Order ( NIEO ) , which appeared out of the threat and the promise of the economic crises. Its success depended on the unity of the Southern countries , credibility of their export products and understanding their vulnerability by the North. The NIEO failed because none of these three steps were completed. First of all , there was a growing gap between the Newly Independent Countries and the least developed countries. Besides , the commodity became less valuable for the North , whose demand for raw materials was declining. Another factor was that the North did not want to make any changes apart from what they were always willing to do. The North offered its help by agreeing to transfer the funds , to offer advice for learning about export strategies , to prevent degradation of the global environment and to reduce the flow of the Southern people to the North . </gap.n.7117><gap.n.7118>The researchers also examined income disparities within demographic groups categorized by education and family type.

Poor people tend to live in areas inhabited by other poor people. When the tax base for your area is made up primarily of rich people , it 's easy for the local government to come up with enough money to run a quality school system.

While race and income-based achievement gaps are frequently discussed , there is less discourse about the latter two.

According to reports from a local union , one 39 year old worker began vomiting and asked her supervisors if she could go to the hospital. The woman was not allowed to leave and was verbally abused for her request. When she was finally allowed to leave , she was too weak to reach the hospital and collapsed outside the factory , dieing shortly thereafter. This incident followed immediately on the heels of a pregnant worker losing her baby after she was not allowed to leave work after going into labor.

The central dogma has been that cardiac cells ( cardioblasts ) do not proliferate after birth , but do in the fetal stage. They grow by hypertrophy in the adult and function in involuntary regulation of pacemaker-generated heart beat by the autonomic nervous system. Muscle spindles are absent , synapses are en-passant and cell junctions at the intercalated disks are present as fascia adherens , desmosomes and gap junctions. The muscle type has intermediate sarcoplasmic reticulum and T tubules at Z disks forming diads with a terminal cirsterma. A , I , H bands and Z disks are present. Contraction occurs when extracellular calcium enters , inducing additional calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and terminal cisternae.

Four years in research , with dozens of examples and case studies , they rigorously establish not only that there is a knowledge gap , but that it matters. They then identify possible causes and suggest solutions. But the real power of this book lies not in the robustness of its construction but in its sometimes shocking , always provocative iconoclastic conclusions.

As a result , while in 2000 the top 1 percent had incomes 20.6 times higher than households in the middle , by 2002 their incomes were just 14.3 times higher.

The last bar , based on a statistical model of the historical relationship between the racial income gap and unemployment , shows the ratio that would have prevailed in 2004 had unemployment remained at 4.0 instead of rising. The result is that the African-American/white income ratio would have been 63.9 , even larger than the 2000 record , and significantly higher than the 62.0 that actually occurred in 2004. That 1.9 percentage point difference translates to an income loss for the typical black family of over $ 1 , 000 in 2004 alone. This finding suggests that unless the very favorable labor market conditions of the latter 1990s return and are maintained , racial income gaps are likely to widen further . </gap.n.7204><gap.n.7205>The average phase of reference particle must bear some relation with the design particle phase. Because the design particle is simply a programmed phase angle , there are a number of ways to approach this problem. Using a reference particle that follows the correct beam dynamics , one can constrain the entry and exit phases of the reference particle through the symmetric unit to be equal. However , if the number of cells in a symmetric unit is small ( 2 or 3 ) , we often encounter a difficulty. The extreme phases ( phase at gap 1 through 4 in Fig. 2 ) do not bracket the design phase. Another approach requires the equal phase angles at the center of first and the last gap in the unit as seen by the reference particle.

The nature of that change in share depends on the percentage change in life expectancy at age 65 for the various categories of beneficiaries. If changes in life expectancy at age 65 were of equal proportion across income groups , the share of total spending for each group would not change. If the widening gap in life expectancy means that high-income beneficiaries would experience a greater proportional change , the share of Medicare spending would increase for that group. For the share of spending on low-income beneficiaries to rise , they would have to experience greater proportional gains in life expectancy at age 65 than high-income beneficiaries; that outcome could occur even with a growing differential in the number of years of life expectancy . </gap.n.7253><gap.n.7254>Freising , Germany : In a new book entitled , " The Race Between Technology and Education " , Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz attribute growing income inequality to rapid technological change : A major driver of the growing gap between rich and poor.

In general , a stock gapping completely above the previous day 's high has a significant change in the market 's desire to own or sell it. Demand is large enough to force the market maker or floor specialist to make a major price change to accommodate the unfilled orders. Full gapping stocks generally trend farther in one direction than stocks which only partially gap. However , a smaller demand may just require the trading floor to only move price above or below the previous close in order to trigger buying or selling to fill on-hand orders. There is a generally a greater opportunity for gain over several days in full gapping stocks . </gap.n.7302><gap.n.7303>Address : 0 Lot 6 1st St , Wind Gap BoroughThis exceptional Bi-Level Home is offered by Gibralter Homes ... the areas finest builder.

A synchronous gap was driven by a synchronous AC motor so that it ran at a fixed speed , and the gap fired in direct relation to the waveform of the A.C. supply that recharged the tank capacitor. The point in the waveform where the gaps were closest was changed by adjusting the rotor position on the motor shaft relative to the stator 's studs. By properly adjusting the synchronous gap , it was possible to have the gap fire only at the voltage peaks of the input current. This technique allowed the tank circuit to fire only at successive voltage peaks , thereby delivering maximum energy from the fully charged tank capacitor each time the gap fired. The break rate was thus fixed at twice the incoming power frequency ( typically , 100 to 120 breaks/second ) . When properly engineered and adjusted , synchronous spark gap systems delivered the largest amount of power to the antenna. However , electrode wear would progressively change the gap 's firing point , so synchronous gaps were somewhat temperamental and difficult to maintain . </gap.n.7366><gap.n.7367>In England , Afro-descent children of British West Indian immigrants show a temporary gap that lasts only until they acculturate.

I think this is not technically a quenching issue , but this reduction in breakdown voltage may often be confused with poor quenching. I do not personally subscribe to the idea that high speed rotary gaps , or compound series rotaries promote an earlier quench. It has been my experience that the primary ringdown has finished long before the rotary electrodes have even fully aligned , so the separation velocity does not influence the quenching action. ( However , a high separation velocity does act to prevent the spark gap from re-igniting after each bang if the capacitor charges quickly before the electrodes have seperated sufficiently . ) </gap.n.7394><gap.n.7395>Second Generation amended its complaint to challenge the ZBA decision as well as the ordinance.

Such compounds , for example , can increase or decrease affinity or rate of binding to a known substrate or effector , compete with substrate or effector for binding , or displace bound substrate or effector. Both a protein of the invention and appropriate variants and fragments can be used in high-throughput screens to assay candidate compounds for the ability to bind to a protein of the invention ( i. e. , 26651 GAP or 26138 GAP ) . These compounds can be further screened against a functional polypeptide of the invention to determine the effect of the compound on the protein activity. Compounds can be identified that activate ( agonist ) or inactivate ( antagonist ) the protein to a desired degree. Modulatory methods can be performed in vitro ( e. g. , by culturing the cell with the agent ) or , alternatively , in vivo ( e. g. , by administering the agent to a subject ) . </gap.n.7445><gap.n.7446>The stunning view of Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area as seen by canoe kayak or raft from the Delaware River is as unspoiled these days as it was for the region 's native Lenape Indians hundreds of years ago.

This is econ 101 , and so few people are taught basic economics 101. I did that monologue last week. I should do that every now and then , because the income gap , rich and poor , was part of that monologue , and I 'll tell you what , to illustrate this , let 's say that instead of five income quintiles , the Democrats succeed in taxing the rich and punishing the rich and instituting a wealth tax so much that we 're reduced to three and that the gap is very narrow and the distance between rich and poor is much less than it is today. That would translate being much less opportunity in the country because the higher you get the more the government is going to take away from you. And so what incentive is that ? It 's why lower tax rates work. Let 's say back when Reagan took office in 1981 , the top marginal tax rate , folks , was 70 .

A long-term contract generally requires the seller to be more involved in the operations of the recently transferred business for a lengthier period of time. Because a generation gap does exist between the seller and buyer each party has a different perspective of the world often causing them to function quite opposite to each other. This generation gap is the natural ingredient for a pot full of conflict. The seller will naturally continue performing the functions of the business in exactly the same method he is accustomed to regardless of the world changing rapidly around him or her. In contrast , the buyer from the younger generation is more conscious of how the current world is operating and has less difficulty adapting to change. This concern not only places a great deal of stress on the seller in determining whether to remain an employee , but also on the buyer. One example of this conflict occurred a number of years ago when two brothers who owned a printing business wanted to sell , yet still remain gainfully employed in the business . </gap.n.7494><gap.n.7495>Have you checked out the size of the HK USP .45 , although the trigger reach is just a tad too long for some , and the Glock 21 grip is a little too thick for some , yet they are both excellent .45 pistols.

Spark gaps are used in high-voltage switches , for example , in power plants and electrical substations. Such switches are constructed with a large , remote-operated switching blade with a hinge as one contact and two leaf springs holding the other end as second contact. If the blade is opened , a spark may keep the connection between blade and spring conducting. ( The spark ionizes the air , which becomes conductive , allowing an arc to form , which sustains ionization and hence conduction. ) Here , a Jacob 's ladder ( see below ) on top of the switch will pull the arc apart and so extinguish it. You might also find small Jacob 's ladders mounted on top of ceramic insulators of high-voltage pylons. If a spark should ever manage to jump over the insulator and give rise to an arc , it will be extinguished . </gap.n.7507><gap.n.7508>The Summer Intern Program combines meaningful work experiences with exposure to different areas of our business to give participants a unique opportunity to expand their knowledge of the retail industry and determine whether they 'd like to pursue a career at Gap Inc. after graduation.

In one embodiment , regulatory sequences are introduced that either increase or decrease expression of an endogenous sequence.

In practice the spark gap electrodes could be set very close together so that only a small voltage is required to initiate breakdown. However , the current is must be increased to maintain sufficient power throughput because of the low voltage.

David Hughes , a British scientist who had previously made several improvements to the wired telegraph , noticed a spark occurring because of a loose wire in his induction balance ( used today in metal detectors ) . Each time the spark occurred , a burst of noise could be heard in his telephone earpiece. He then built a device to regularly produce a spark and , with further testing , was able to detect the burst of noise with respectable range. Hughes never published his findings , leaving Heinrich Hertz to produce his own spark gap transmitter and receiver in 1886. Hertz also verified that the spark gap produced electromagnetic waves. Nikola Tesla further improved the technology by devising a transmission and receiving system that could be roughly tuned. By 1895 , Guglielmo Marconi was able to transmit a signal and receive it almost a mile away. Marconi was able to establish a successful wireless telegraph company , and wireless telegraphy took off from there , with constantly improving technologies and distance . </gap.n.7606><gap.n.7607>Numerous liveries operate along the Delaware River in New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania.

The young were generally the most for civil liberties in 1973 and 1997 , but were mostly towards the middle in 1985. Their net change from 1973 to 1997 was typically quite small except for views on homosexuals. Support for the rights of homosexuals rose by 6.5 to 13.9 percentage points on the three measures from 1973 to 1997 and by 14.7 to 16.8 percentage points from 1985 to 1997. The convergence came mostly from gains in tolerance among the old or , for items on homosexuals , from even larger gains in tolerance among the old than among the young . </gap.n.7637><gap.n.7638>We ' re dedicated to improving the world around us and lessening our impact on the planet.

But there are differences across the years. In the Class of 2011 males exceed females , on average , across grades second through seventh in math. The same pattern holds for Hispanics. This was not true for 2008. But again the differences in scores are often so modest that they are negligible. ( There are a couple of exceptions , but they may well be due to smaller numbers of students. ) The basic point is that over most grades there is not a real gender differential in math between males and females within these two racial groups. Among African-Americans the gender gaps grow and become more substantial by the seventh grade.

In contrast to the focus on geographic concentrations of low test scores as a primary factor for achieving diversity , as presented to the Board of Education this past Monday , an income level indicator more explicitly brings into play some of the fundamental factors external to the school environment that contribute to the achievement gap , such as housing , the relative frequency with which lower income kids change schools , teaching abilities of parents in the home , access to health care , access to tutors for pay , after-school programs , and variance in life experiences based on mobility of family to travel and more . </gap.n.7664><gap.n.7665>Please see below to browse Delaware Water Gap hotels sorted by price.

In general , the incrementor catheter is delivered in a closed configuration to the location of the first anchor , e.g. , the permanent anchor attached in step 3160 , by tracking a first section of the incrementor catheter over the tail of the first anchor. After the incrementor catheter is delivered , the incrementor catheter may be deployed in step 3200 to create a nominal distance or gap between the first anchor location and the working lumen , e.g. , a second section , of the incrementor catheter. Then , in step 3220 , a second permanent anchor may be applied at the nominal distance from the first permanent anchor. It should be appreciated that temporary anchors may be used to facilitate the positioning of the second permanent anchor. Applying the second permanent anchor typically includes retracting the incrementor catheter once the second permanent anchor is anchored into a desired location . </gap.n.7718><gap.n.7719>But the gap did n't result just from citizens who chose not to report some of their income.

Minimal gap thresholds ( MGTs ) of auditory nerve fibers in chinchilla ( Zhang et al. 1990 ) and starling ( Klump and Gleich 1991 ) approximate psychophysical thresholds in the same species. Likewise , the shortest cortical MGTs in starling cortex ( Buchfellner et al. 1989 ) were comparable to behavioral estimates of starling gap detection ( Klump and Maier 1989 ) . Walton et al. ( 1997 ) demonstrated that MGTs of mouse inferior colliculus ( IC ) neurons were comparable to behavioral estimates of gap detection in the same subjects. Similar to Buchfellner et al.

They can be regarded as military by virtue of their aim , but non-combatant because of the way that they pursue this aim. However , they are not members of an armed force , so can not be so-regarded. The problem is that the voluntary human shield falls into a gap between these categories.

Illiteracy was once characteristic of many older African Americans , though now chiefly it is immigrant groups in the United States which have high percentages of persons who can not read or write English. The high school graduation rate for blacks , compared to when the same rate was achieved for whites , closed by 10 years each decade until the 1980 and 1990 census , when they were essentially equal at a national level. Similarly , the rate of college attendance for African Americans lags that of whites , but is measured at a level similar to whites in the 1970s. It can also be observed that while Asian Americans are the most educated group in the United States , large populations in India and China , especially women , do not receive an education beyond elementary school . </gap.n.7726><gap.n.7727>Care must be taken when replacing a static gap with a rotary gap , especially if the firing rate of the rotary spark gap is designed to be lower than the firing frequency of the previous static gap. The forced reduction in firing rate allows more time for the tank capacitor to charge between firings. The result is that the tank capacitor charges to a much higher voltage in order to process the same available power at the reduced firing rate. For example , if the rotary gap fires at half the firing frequency of the original static gap , then the peak capacitor voltage will be approximately 41 higher. This can over stress components , and may also cause problems with racing arcs over the surface of the secondary . </gap.n.7727><gap.n.7728>WQUT helps welcome O'Reilly Auto Parts to Big Stone Gap !

The reason for this is that the U.S.G.A. only allows 14 clubs during play. There are a number of other choices for additional clubs that could possibly benefit the golfer much more such as a hybrid club , 60 wedge , 7 and/or 9 fairway metal and so on. If you start with a 5 iron in your set then there can be room for the gap wedge if you desire. If you do not play with a gap wedge , the distance difference between your pitching wedge and sand wedge can be compensated for by learning to hit pitching wedge shots which are not difficult to master. Gap wedges should be  shorter than the pitching wedge and also be 2 to 3 swingweights heavier than your irons.

You see , women and men no longer are distributed evenly throughout the population. Some 45 of women today live without a spouse in the household -- divorced , separated , widowed , or never married.

These subsidies mostly accrue to urban residents and an urban rural income gap capturing these is also likely to be higher. Besides disparity in the public services as well as income volatility between urban and rural , urban rural differences in the cost of living are a further factor that potentially affects the urban-rural income gap and overall inequality in China. Unlike public services and income volatility , the gap in the cost of living between urban and rural sector will bias the urban rural gap downwards if it fails to be taken into account , as the cost of living tends to be higher in urban than in rural. Sicular et al.

We have seen ( Read the essay at the link : The Anatomy of a Closet Leftist to learn how the ' civilian elites ' of the counter-culture revolution took over the New Age ' ethics ' program at the U.S. Naval Academy ) that the tug of war going on at the Naval Academy regarding the new ' ethics ' curriculum is directly related to this observation made in the TISS study . </gap.n.7895><gap.n.7896>Perhaps , unexpectedly , the debate over the Clinton impeachment precipitated a culture gap within the military.

That $ 300 billion figure is an IRS estimate of the " net tax gap " for tax year 2001. The IRS defines the net tax gap as the difference between the amount taxpayers owe for a given tax year and the amount they pay on time , less what the IRS expects to recover in the future from voluntary late payments and enforcement activities. The apparent focus on the IRS-defined tax gap is the wrong agenda for a tax reform panel. The United States faces two tax gaps : the IRS measure of tax evasion and a second gap that may be called the legal avoidance gap. This second gap - the difference between taxes under an income tax without special preferences and taxes under current law - is much larger than the evasion gap , and there are ways to reduce it substantially , if the political will exists . </gap.n.7900><gap.n.7901>Metal Heavy Duty Magnetic Contact Wide Gap adalah alat yang digunakan untuk proteksi pada pintu , jendela , garasi atau pagar yang terbuat dari besi.
