However , unless the needed cure is introduced , soon , the greatest breakdown-crisis in the history of today 's globally extended European civilization is threatened for some time during the very near future. Only a small fraction of the present world 's population-level would survive such a crisis , were it not to be prevented by the kinds of actions which I continue to propose , still now. Those measures which I outline would work , but only if actually adopted. The practical question is , who has the brains and guts to do what I propose ? That is the crux of the issue confronting all governments , especially the present government of the U.S.A . </threat.n.1><threat.n.2>So it appears that in the short term , the regime is hoping to start a limited war with the USA that it believes it can survive , since they do n't believe that the West has the will nor the means to occupy Iran at this time. This will buy them time for their longer term strategic plans for the world. Why is no taking these threats seriously ? </threat.n.2><threat.n.3>Contact with Ming Dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) China was renewed during the Muromachi period after the Chinese sought support in suppressing Japanese pirates , or wako , who controlled the seas and pillaged coastal areas of China. Wanting to improve relations with China and to rid Japan of the wako threat , Yoshimitsu accepted a relationship with the Chinese that was to last for half a century. Japanese wood , sulfur , copper ore , swords , and folding fans were traded for Chinese silk , porcelain , books , and coins , in what the Chinese considered tribute but the Japanese saw as profitable trade . </threat.n.3><threat.n.4>So mainly we focus on the military options. Why the military ? Because as even the NIE admits Iran continues to develop ways to satisfy its nuclear ambitions. ( People crowed over the fact that they faked one missile out of 4 fired but what about the other 3 ? ) Hezbollah grows in power. Hamas becomes better trained by the day. America is training Fatah and giving Egypt sophisticated weaponry. Jordan can be counted on not to join the Muslim pack until it looks like the Muslims are winning. And Israel has n't thrown off its inept government and shows signs of simply substituting another set of corrupt and ineffectual politicians at the next election. So it is well past the time when the growing threats all aimed at Israel can be nipped in the bud. All we can do is hope Israel acts before Arab and Iranian strength is fullgrown and ready to be used . </threat.n.4><threat.n.5>Further noting that apparent ability includes the ability to carry out the threat at some future date when the person making the threat is incarcerated , Marchiano concluded : It is unreasonable to posit the need to prove an actual intent to execute the threat when the ability to do so can be attenuated by months , even years , before the release of the incarcerated threatener. </threat.n.5><threat.n.6>Whenever any student has been the victim of any crime against the person pursuant to Chapter 4 ( 18.2-30 et seq ) of Title 18.2 of the Code of Virginia including crimes by mobs , crimes by gangs , terrorism offenses , kidnapping and related offenses , assaults and bodily woundings , robbery , extortion or other threats , or sexual assault , and such crime was committed : </threat.n.6><threat.n.7>" supports a ) the principle of net neutrality , through which the freedom of connection with any application to any party is guaranteed , except to address security threats or due to unexpected network congestion. b ) the rights of creators &amp;performers to be rewarded for their work in a way that is fair , proportionate &amp;appropriate to the medium.

To behave in ways different from those expected by an enemy can be simply good tactics , operational art , and strategy. Since asymmetrical merely means different , it is a little hard to understand quite why the notion has been elevated as the latest fashionable Big Idea ( following on from the concept of a revolution in military affairs ) . In this essay I have confined asymmetrical threats to those emanating from an irregular foe. However , with equal , if not greater , justification I might have set out to diminish this Big Idea by pointing out that all of America 's wars have been asymmetrical contests. Even aside from the bloody , two and a half century-long experience of struggle against native American irregulars , when has the country waged a plausibly symmetrical conflict ? Imperial Britain was radically different -- grand strategically -- from the revolting Colonies , as the Confederate States were from the Union , as Germany , Japan , and then the Soviet Union were from the United States in the 20th century . </threat.n.9><threat.n.10>They want McCarthy in.

Iran 's ballistic missile inventory is among the largest in the Middle Eastand includes the 1300-km range Shahab-3 MRBM as well as a few hundred SRBMs. Iran has announced production of the Shahab-3 and publicly acknowledged development of follow-on versions. During 2003 , Iran continued R &amp;D on its longer-range ballistic missile programs , and publicly reiterated its intention to develop space launch vehicles ( SLVs ) and SLVs contain most of the key building blocks for an ICBM. Iran could begin flight-testing these systems in the mid- to latter-part of the decade . </threat.n.12><threat.n.13>Biological information and the issues surrounding it are different. It is not possible to establish even a limited monopoly over microbiology. The field is too fundamental to the improvement of global public health , and too central to the development of important industries such as pharmaceuticals and plastics , to be isolated. Moreover , the list of diseases that pose a threat ranges from high-end bugs , like smallpox , to common viruses , such as influenza.

It has been suggested by some , albeit implicitly , that the government was aware of the threat of the attacks on the WTO even before they occurred. On my part , I do not wish to argue that State officials had any previous knowledge of the atrocities or that they allowed them to take place with a view for gaining some political advantage from the turmoil that would ensue. However , I am fairly confident of the fact that the strategic response of the Bush government to the terrorist challenge was designed less to mitigate and contain the consequences which terrorism had on American society and more as a means to perpetuate and stabilize its pernicious impact upon the function of American institutions . </threat.n.15><threat.n.16>After a sensational rise to prominence in national politics before World War I , Churchill acquired a reputation for erratic judgment in the war itself and in the decade that followed. Politically suspect in consequence , he was a lonely figure until his response to Adolf Hitler 's challenge brought him to leadership of a national coalition in 1940. With Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin he then shaped Allied strategy in World War II , and after the breakdown of the alliance he alerted the West to the expansionist threat of the Soviet Union. He led the Conservative Party back to office in 1951 and remained prime minister until 1955 , when ill health forced his resignation.

Reppert never mentions much less addresses or considers those naturalists who disagree with the only two people that Reppert cites.

And yet he must not only show that ( which he has not done ) , but that all metaphysical naturalists can not have an answer ( which , again , he does n't do ) . But I suppose Reppert intended his quotations of the Churchlands to " represent " an attack on those metaphysical naturalists , even though if that is what he intended he was obligated to discuss at least some of the responses to the Churchlands that must be in print , yet he never even mentions any . </threat.n.18><threat.n.19>The woman suffered minor injuries.

The need for such a request was caused by the following. The Lord answered the first appeal of Moses with the promise not to destroy Israel. In this way its continued existence was guaranteed. But such a promise did not yet mean that the Jews would remain the God-chosen nation. The very frame of mind of the nation raised doubts , for not only did it not reveal a readiness to reclaim for itself the mercy of God , but displayed extreme stubbornness , which placed them under the threat of being fully rejected by God. In view of this Moses begs : Forgive their sin. If forgiveness can not be granted , then he offers his life as a sacrifice : Blot me , I pray thee , out of Thy book which Thou hast written. ) </threat.n.21><threat.n.22>The first threat is at the source of the raw material for nuclear power itself , the uranium mine , processing plant , and transport route.

Commercially-available school-wide screening measures ( e.g. Systematic Screening for Behavioral Disorders2 ) may provide schools a valuable tool for early identification of students in need , and another method for identifying at-risk students before they escalate into disruption or violence. These systems use a variety of rankings , ratings , and observation to identify students with emotional and behavioral needs who may need intervention or support . </threat.n.23><threat.n.24>The British monarchy under dotty Queen Victoria was panicked by these developments. The spread of the " American model " on the continent of Asia , into Japan , and among the states of the Americas , was recognized by the British monarchy led by the Prince of Wales , as the great strategic , long-term threat to the London financial center 's rule over the world through its " free trade " -based , imperial system of monetary-financial power. The British Empire led by Edward VII took a leaf from the advantages the Anglo-Dutch Liberal imperialists had gained by their earlier organizing of the Seven Years War and the Napoleonic Wars , to launch what became known as the First World War , and , then , create the conditions under which Adolf Hitler launched a Second. Edward VII did not live to see the First World War , but he organized it , chiefly by putting his two foolish nephews , the German Kaiser and Russian Czar , and also a wretched Habsburg , against one another 's throats.

More specifically it is a strategy of putting in place incentives for other nations not to engage in certain kinds of military actions , in particular not initiating a nuclear war. These incentives are negative sanctions which are announced , and intended to be taken seriously. Basically , nuclear deterrence is a strategy of promising to retaliate against another nation for some military action with the use of nuclear weapons. The clearest case is a simple threat -- if you use nuclear weapons against me , then I will retaliate and use them against you. The hope , of course , is that by clearly issuing this threat in a credible manner , you will come to the conclusion that it is not in your best interest to use nuclear weapons against me.

Because choices for asymmetric activity merge with common-sense approaches to strategy ( e.g. , doing what the enemy does not expect , generally practicing the precepts advanced by Sun Tzu ) , there is virtue in fencing off for distinctive discussion the phenomenon of hugely irregular asymmetric threats. This is not to suggest that asymmetry in conflict is synonymous with belligerency between regular and irregular foes , or between regular and irregular forces ( regular security communities can license and employ irregular forces and methods ) , but that is the core of our current concern. How do asymmetric threats work ?

Instead , as has been the case for more than a century , the gun and the bomb remain the terrorists ' main weapons of choice. Thus , as fanatical or irrational as even this new breed of terrorists may seem , like their more traditional counterparts , they too have remained remarkably conservative operationally : adhering to the same familiar and narrow tactical repertoire that they both have mastered and equally importantly believe maximizes their likelihood of success.

The pact provided a framework governing the use of United States forces against military threats -- internal or external -- in the region. A special diplomatic task was to assuage the suspicions and alleviate the resentments of Asian neighbors who had suffered from Japanese colonial rule and imperialist aggression in the past. Japan 's diplomacy toward its Asian neighbors , therefore , tended to be extremely low-key , conciliatory , and nonassertive. With respect to the world at large , the nation avoided political issues and concentrated on economic goals.

The first basic distinction is the opposition between locutionary , illocutionary and perlocutionary acts. A locutionary act is a speech act considered from the point of view of classical linguistics : as an abstract phrase consisting of a form and a meaning , devoid of context ( or rather with an in-built conventional context ) and considered in its morphological , syntactic or semantic aspects. When the locution is uttered in a particular speech situation , it becomes an illocution , a communicative act of some kind whereby a social interaction is established between the speaker and the addressee ( an affirmation , an order , a promise ) . In order to occur , a locutionary act must be identified as such by the hearer. A perlocution or perlocutionary act is the non-conventionalized effect the illocutionary act provokes on the hearer. Recognizing that a threat is a threat is an illocutionary maneuver; the fear or laughter which may result from the threat are perlocutionary effects . </threat.n.108><threat.n.109>Jahrling opposes the destruction of the official stocks of smallpox.

Though the attitudes and policies of most irregularly asymmetric foes will be accessible by carefully crafted threats and bribes , usually there is a hard core among the adversary whose mode of rationality literally will brook no compromise. In those instances , the rejectionists ( of any compromise whatsoever ) either have to be killed or placed in permanent detention.

At a press conference in the U.S. Capitol , Murphy stood with Senators John Kerry ( D-MA ) and Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D-NY ) and Reps. Rahm Emanuel ( D-IL ) and Tim Walz ( D-MN ) in support of the National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House last week by an overwhelming bipartisan margin of 397-27. This legislation calls for an increase in troop pay from 3.0 to 3.5 and gives a $ 40 monthly benefit for surviving spouses and military families.

The consequences of sin ( in the afterlife , hell-fire , etc ) have been primarily associated with religions. Retribution for sin worked as a means of reinforcing governance in societies dominated by particular belief systems closely linked to the state -- in fact it provides a useful model for the role of singular threats in future world governance.

Contrariwise , an odd thing seems to be happening at the extremes. Over the last half century , the far left and at least one far right party the British National Party ( BNP ) seem to be exchanging positions on anti-Semitism. Nick Cohen observes that the liberal left appears to have become " Jew-obsessed " and is partnering with Islamists. In contrast , as Robert Locke points out , the once Nazi-sympathizing BNP has forsaken anti-Semitism. Their focus is on reducing foreign immigration to prevent the English becoming a minority in their own country. More and more , this means tackling the huge Muslim immigration and population growth , a problem ignored by most of the other parties.

They say 70 percent. He says what are the chances we are going to be hit with a nuclear attack ? They say 30 percent.

We wrote that the al Qaeda franchises in Yemen had taken a hit in 2008 but that they could recover in 2009 given the opportunity. Indeed , the groups received a significant boost when they merged into a single group that also incorporated the remnants of al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia , which had been forced by Saudi security to flee the country. We closely followed this new group , which named itself al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , and STRATFOR was the first organization we know of to discuss the threat AQAP posed to civil aviation when we raised this subject on Sept. 2 and elaborated on it Sept. 16 , in an analysis titled Convergence : The Challenge of Aviation Security.

Glass51 ) permitting the " dangerous patient exception to testimonial privilege , " the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote : " [ A ] psychotherapist may testify about a threat made by a patient if the threat was serious when it was uttered and ... its disclosure was the only means of averting harm ... " [ emphasis added ] ( Ref. 51 , p 1360 ) . The qualifier " serious " leaves open the question of whether the seriousness of a threat is self-evident or requires clinical assessment. In any case , it is the threat and not the risk that is to be disclosed , although , by the second part of this formulation , the risk of harm would have been appropriately assessed. Thus , there is a subcategory of warning of verbal threats , only after the threat has been assessed as representing an actual danger. Emerging literature13 that advises clinicians how to assess the risk of violence when a patient has expressed a verbal threat further supports this practice. If only those verbal threats deemed to represent actual risk of violence are shared with the intended victim , this second step would limit disclosures and reduce unnecessary warnings with their potential for untoward consequences . </threat.n.279><threat.n.280>The risk is greater when it comes to use of CBR agents obtained or produced industrially and available on the market.

These threats and risks are very real ones and should not be minimised , but the likelihood of an attack of this nature succeeding is slim.

An estimated 60 of the community 's focus , for example , remains on military intelligence pertaining to the standing armed forces of established nation-states.

It is also obvious that differences involving other nations can be readily resolved by the three great powers whenever they arrive at a stable peace among themselves.

Warning practices vary over a spectrum ranging from those that are essentially legally required duties of clinicians to those based on rights of actual or potential victims to be warned of a specific event. These practices can be categorized as follows : ( 1 ) warning of the risk of violence; ( 2 ) warning of the threat of violence; ( 3 ) requested warning; and ( 4 ) criminal victims ' warning mandated by statute. As legal requirements and clinical standards for Tarasoff-type warnings continue to evolve , it behooves mental health professionals to recognize these four different types of warnings.

However , this communication should have been allowed for the jury to determine " whether the patient had communicated to the therapist a serious threat of physical violence to another " ( Ref. 17 , p 873 ) . From this , one might conclude that this opinion suggests that the threat triggers a risk assessment and that the warning is to be issued only after the risk is determined to be serious. The opinion , however , does not say this. Rather , the second critical question in determining when a therapist has a duty to warn , is whether the threat " actually leads him or her to believe the patient poses a risk of grave bodily injury to another person " [ emphasis added ] ( Ref. 17 , p 874 ) .

By late 1943 , for example , American forces were in combat in Italy , New Guinea , the Solomon Islands and the Central Pacific. The war against the U Boat threat and the air war against Germany continued with increasing intensity , and the allied staffs were engaged in planning the 1944 invasion of France. To achieve the nation 's basic political objective-the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan-the United States devised a series of strategic and operational war plans for both the European and Pacific areas of operation. A number of factors including inter-allied and inter-service disputes , logistics , and enemy actions frequently led to results that were quite different from the planner 's expectations.

From a legal perspective , duty and right are not independent; rather , one exists because of the other. Nonetheless , there are differences in the four types of warnings that can be confusing. The emphasis in the clinical literature on a clinician 's duty to warn ( or protect ) can obscure the would-be victim 's right to be warned. Statutorily required notification of a prisoner 's release , not a duty of clinicians , is framed more as victim 's rights law.

Optimism regarding the battle against infectious diseases peaked in 1978 when the United Nations ( UN ) member states signed the " Health for All 2000 " accord , which predicted that even the poorest nations would undergo a health transition before the millennium , whereby infectious diseases no longer would pose a major danger to human health. As recently as 1996 , a World Bank/World Health Organization ( WHO ) -sponsored study by Christopher J.L. Murray and Alan D. Lopez projected a dramatic reduction in the infectious disease threat. This optimism , however , led to complacency and overlooked the role of such factors as expanded trade and travel and growing microbial resistance to existing antibiotics in the spread of infectious diseases.

Terrorists often use threats to create fear among the public , to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism , and to get immediate publicity for their causes. Acts of terrorism range from threats of terrorism , assassinations , kidnappings , hijackings , bomb scares and bombings , cyber attacks ( computer-based ) , to the use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons. High-risk targets include military and civilian government facilities , international airports , large cities and high-profile landmarks. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings , water and food supplies , utilities , and corporate centers. Further , they are capable of spreading fear by sending explosives or chemical and biological agents through the mail.

This perception was shared by those who considered cholera a disease caused by a specific agent , and those who saw it as the result of a broader set of environmental causes. Common too was the notion that cholera amongst the poor was a threat to the health of the wealthy.

But as Zack Lieberberg writes , we 're not willing to actually carry out actions we know we should. Where draconian measures are needed , we are not able to allow ourselves to use them , whether to fight the invasion by aliens , the drug war or the threat from resurgent Islam.

The moral tone of Barker 's attack on social hypocrisy , ' despite the rejection of moral terms in his own narratives , provides a clue to this social role : it is the construction of textual experiences of deviance , alterity and counterculture as safer alternatives to the praxis of deviance in an age of AIDS , gay-bashing , eco-terrorism , abortion violence , litigious political correctness and other forms of fear and threat prevalent in contemporary society.

We have entered the twenty-first century with little vision of the future and less debate about what would constitute the good society than at any time since the French Revolution. The working class has ceased to exist as a political force , and the political sphere has become impossibly narrow as old ideologies appear discredited but no new ideas have replaced them.

Despite prewar nationalistic idealization of the rural village , the government at that time squeezed the farmers for taxes and rice. Political scientist Kent E. Calder observed that " the prewar state took heavily from the countryside , without providing much in return. " Historians describe how many farm families starved or were forced to sell their daughters into prostitution. Responding to the threat of vigorous leftist movements in the countryside , conservative governments after 1945 initiated price supports for rice and other measures that brought the farmers not just a decent standard of living but affluence. By the 1970s , it was not uncommon to encounter group tours of farmers who had never visited Tokyo taking holidays in Hawaii or New York City. In Calder 's view , conservative governments were stoutly probusiness but were also willing to co-opt other interests such as agriculture at the expense of business to ensure social stability and prevent socialist electoral victories.

US and Israeli hostility to Iran and the threat both countries ' nuclear arsenals pose to Iran establish conditions that make Iran ' s acquisition of its own nuclear arms as a means of self-defense a virtual necessity.

It would be impossible to develop human understanding and responsibility in a creative way without leading to an increase in society 's ability to take care of the basic needs of its citizens.

There were no communications suggesting intent to attack , and Adam had not exhibited any interest in school attacks , weapons , or incidents of mass violence.225 Adam had not engaged in attack-related behaviors. Although of adequate physical and mental capacities , according to the court proceedings , Adam had no access to weapons-aside from a box-cutter for his after-school job.226 There was no indication of hopelessness , desperation , or despair , nor was there indication he saw violence as an acceptable way to solve problems. Adam had strong trusting relationships with adults. His depiction of events was inconsistent with his actions , and before the drawing surfaced , no one was concerned about his potential violence. By thus applying the Secret Service questions to Adam Porter 's case , it is clear his drawing did not constitute a true threat to school safety.

In March 2000 , the UK Department of Health published a paper on the subject entitled " Deliberate Release of Biological and Chemical Agents - Guidance to help plan the health service response " and the United States held its " Dark Winter " simulation exercise in summer 2001 . </threat.n.582><threat.n.583>To change your current directory , type cd in the command box , press your Space key , and enter the full directory where the Warning : Spyware threat has been detected on your PC desktop DLL file is located.

In a 2x2x2 factorial design , threat information , coping information and order of information were manipulated. College students read persuasive essays that varied in emphasis on threat of developing breast cancer and effectiveness of breast self-examination ( BSE ) in averting the threat of cancer. Participants who read the high-threat message reported higher intentions to perform BSE , more rational problem solving and more hopelessness than did those who read a low-threat message. The coping information messages produced a similar pattern of results. In addition , those who read the high-coping message reported less fatalism than did participants who read the low-coping message. When threat information was presented first , the high-threat message led to less hopelessness and reliance on religious faith than when the coping information was presented first. These results demonstrate the threatening health information energizes one to act in both adaptive and maladaptive ways , and that coping information decreases the tendency to respond maladaptively to the health threat. They also suggest that the order of presentation of the information may affect the extent to which people respond adaptively . </threat.n.584><threat.n.585>Comedian Gabriel Iglesias -- a former finalist on " Last Comic Standing " -- had to call in extra security to his stand-up show in L.A. this weekend after receiving 2 threats on his safety . </threat.n.585><threat.n.586>Two very different factors complicate the analysis just given.

The same considerations apply to me -- my preferred outcome is a DEFECT play while you play COOPERATE. If either of us can get away with playing DEFECT , while the other plays COOPERATE , there is rational incentive to do this. Indeed , both of us knew this all along in formulating our original deterrent strategies.

In actuality , the formulation of various Tarasoff statutes and appellate court decisions indicate that warnings are triggered by the threat itself. Granted , the threat-triggered warning is typically qualified as " serious " ( e.g. , California33 and Colorado34 ) , " actual " ( e.g. , Indiana , 35 Kentucky , 36 Montana , 37 and Washington38 ) , " immediate " ( Louisiana39 ) , or " specific [ and ] serious " ( Minnesota40 ) , suggesting at least some judgment about the nature of the threat. Follow-up qualifiers further define the threat : for example , Kentucky 's statute requires the threat to be one of " physical violence against a clearly identified or reasonably identifiable victim. " 36 Tarasoff statutes are typically mute on the matter of assessment and refer to threats as triggering events , not clinically established risks of violence. Furthermore , the warning option for protecting an identifiable victim is to " communicate the threat " ( e.g. , California , 33 Indiana , 35 Kentucky , 36 Minnesota , 40 New Hampshire , 41 and Washington38 ) , not the assessed danger or risk , to the intended victim. Likewise , police are to be " notif [ ied ] " of the same threat , not of the risk or danger . </threat.n.593><threat.n.594>A post-offer medical examination may disqualify an individual who would pose a " direct threat " to health or safety.

Warning criminal victims is a matter of victims ' rights , which requires an administrative response , not a clinical one. The victim 's right to be notified of the offender 's release from prison corresponds to the administrative duty to issue such notification in accordance with the regulatory statute. Victim notification occurs without clinical risk or threat assessment , or non-clinical assessment for that matter. If this measure was enacted out of concern for future violence , this concern was based only on the violent act for which the offender was convicted and sentenced. The right of the victim to be warned , therefore , weighs more heavily than either an individual 's right to be protected or a clinician 's duty to protect against future violence; consequently , assessment of risk and alternative safety measures have no role . </threat.n.596><threat.n.597>2.

In debate , the team that begins talk about security threats is actually poisoning our minds , blinding us to the possibility of a truly universal community where nobody is excluded as an " other.

The ambition of the Iran-Syria axis is n't just to destroy Israel , or even to end " American influence in the Middle East. Its true purpose is not only to exist within Shi'a society but also to gain power in Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , and finally ... in Cairo and in Amman. " This is more likely to happen if Iran can make use of a nuclear threat to supplement Iran and Syria 's terrorist resources. Iran and Syria cooperated in creating and training Hizballah , which has made it possible for them to control Lebanon. Moreover , they have cooperated in running Hamas and the Islamic Jihad inside the Palestinian Authority. Amidror deems it a tragedy that Israel did not hack apart the axis by destroying Hezbollah in the Lebanon war last summer. Iran-Syria 's prestige was raised even in Sunni countries e.g. , Saudi Arabia is now holding negotiations with Hizballah. And Israel will pay significantly in the future for not winning decisively in the Lebanon war . </threat.n.647><threat.n.648>For the first time the Department of Health and Human Services is part of the national security apparatus of the United States.

At the same time we were faced with two events that drew our attention to chemical and biological threats. Iraq used chemical weapons on Iran and on its own citizens and appeared to be concealing a biological weapons program.

Clearly programs to prevent tobacco use and encourage cessation are not reaching these populations. Since smoking is implicated in heart disease , cancer and respiratory disease and is thought to be a factor in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome , this pattern is a serious threat to Aboriginal health. Some regional data in FNIRHS identify high levels of sadness and depression in teen-agers , particularly girls. Gasoline and glue sniffing are serious problems in some communities. Suicide rates in the 15-24 age group are 126 per 100 , 000 for males and 35 per 100 , 000 for females.

When man wishes to free himself from the moral lazy and become independent of God , far from gaining his freedom he destroys it. Escaping the measuring rod of truth , he falls prey to the arbitrary; fraternal relations between people are abolished and give place to terror , hatred and fear.

Indeed Osama bin Laden may himself be a totally fabricated exercise in global deception to enable the Taliban to be removed to allow the oil pipeline to be constructed as required by American oil interests -- with a tolerable ( but credible ) level of regrettable collateral damage.

The mere existence of such protection in the form of automatic beliefs and conventional behavior becomes a threat to the search for truth and right , once the individual has faced the fact that he lives in an ignorant and immoral world and has committed himself to the creative task of contributing to mankind 's store of genuine understanding and responsibility. As he separates himself from social intimidations and seductions and the rewards that go with conformity to these forces , he finds he stands alone and exposed to the operation of his own psychological defenses. If the ability to love is to grow , it must start with the recognition of the individual 's own inadequacy , and if power is to expand its responsible influence , the individual must begin by facing his own lack of resourcefulness and flexibility . </threat.n.717><threat.n.718>In 1995-96 , a dark cloud hovered over discussions of federal funding of research.

Christianity by no means teaches that such claims can be disregarded or the corresponding duties neglected , but rather that the discharge of all social and civic obligations will be more thorough when subordinated to , and inspired by , fidelity in the duties that man owes to God.

It contains two paragraphs : the first states that the Japanese people " forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes "; the second states that " land , sea , and air forces , as well as other war potential will never be maintained. " Some historians attribute the inclusion of Article 9 to Charles Kades , one of MacArthur 's closest associates , who was impressed by the spirit of the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact renouncing war. MacArthur himself claimed that the idea had been suggested to him by Prime Minister Shidehara. The article 's acceptance by the Japanese government may in part be explained by the desire to protect the imperial throne. Some Allied leaders saw the emperor as the primary factor in Japan 's warlike behavior. His assent to the " No War " clause weakened their arguments in favor of abolishing the throne or trying the emperor as a war criminal . </threat.n.795><threat.n.796>The word peace , as we have used it in the following pages , describes a permanent , or quasi-permanent , condition entirely free from the national exercise , or contemplation , of any form of the organized social violence , or threat of violence , generally known as war.

Nor is it used simply as a synonym for the political settlement of international differences.

Now they receive a mysterious message from Transylvania which suggests they may not be the only ones of their kind , that another tribe may have survived somewhere in southern Europe. Obviously the chance is worth risking an investigation , and the very fact that someone outside their circle knows of their existence poses a threat that can not be ignored. Their efforts to discover the truth must be accelerated when someone begins murdering members of the tribe , someone who obviously has knowledge they thought closely held , and possibly the ability to use paranormal powers to advance their sinister and deadly agenda.

A threat area is defined as an area expected to receive , currently is receiving or has received a severe weather threat. This study will limit its severe weather threat to hail. While NWS techniques allow the forecaster to draw the polygon , the techniques explored in this study will be locked to a storm motion and motion uncertainity to highlight the warned area. Two warning guidance methods will be explored : the first is done by the forecaster highlighting the current threat area and that area is then translated along the storm motion and uncertainity. The second method is done by an algorithm which highlights the current threat area by evaluating output from a gridded version of the Hail Detection Algorithm ( HDA; Witt et al. 1998 ) . This second method will also explore the capability of classifying the magnitude of the threat and growing and decaying this classification through time . </threat.n.840><threat.n.841>Nevertheless , an effective political substitute for war would require " alternate enemies , " some of which might seem equally farfetched in the context of the current war system.

Poisoning of the air , and of the principal sources of food and water supply , is already well advanced , and at first glance would seem promising in this respect; it constitutes a threat that can be dealt with only through social organization and political power.

Hence the lack of genuine inquiry. And to prove my point about the self being under attack , we need only look at the way Peter Duesberg has been received; not as an inquiring scientist , but as a radical from the lunatic fringe , a right-winger , a homophobic , Satan himself wanting to stop the war against HIV when so many are dying of AIDS.

It is framed , in the case of the dramatic attacks of 11th September , as a 'challenge to civilization ' , and a war against 'evil ' forces -- notably sustained by an 'axis of evil'. The credibility of the challenge and the necessary response is rendered unquestionable through the logic of 'if you are not with us , you are against us ' backed up by the implicit threat to any groups that fail to associate themselves with the logic of that single threat. This has the effect of suppressing dissenting opinion , whether within the world 's superpower , amongst allies variously persuaded of the merits of this logic , and amongst those opposed to this perspective. Those failing to accept this logic can easily be framed as dangerous -- if not 'evil ' in their own right.

Such a non-critical embrace of culture can result in what can often be an over-identification with the group and resultant loss of individual potential. This lack of skepticism and this over-investment in a cultural world-view causes perceived external threats to a culture to seem greater.

Daringly speaking for God , Jesus derailed the public ' s internal space one by one from the legal and religious tracks for clearing their record. Brueggeman describes how Hannah Arendt had discerned that this was Jesus ' most endangering action because if a society does not have an apparatus for forgiveness , then its members are fated to live forever with the consequences of any violation. Thus the refusal to forgive sin amounts to enormous social control. Rather than lobbying for the religious or legal institutions to be more forgiving , Jesus ' prophetic ministry brought the forgiving , liberating words of God directly to the people , making the official authorities and avenues obsolete for a growing portion of the region . </threat.n.917><threat.n.918>Those who are able to break out of the thinking patterns approved by the power centers within society are then able to articulate a strategy by which others may do so , and this is ultimately de-stabilizing to the balance of power in society.

The Cold War approach , according to the Clinton view , had emphasized political and military cooperation to the detriment of U.S. economic interests; with the Soviet threat gone , it was time to get tough on Japan 's trade protectionism. The Clintonites set about demanding that Japan stop running its economy through a system of murky government guidance and instead embrace transparent rules , figuring that this would create a fair playing field for U.S. businesses. But trade confrontation had costs. It forced up the yen , increasing the danger of a banking collapse that would send tremors around the world , and it threatened the political viability of U.S. military bases. In 1995 , the rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by American servicemen caused smoldering anti-American resentment to explode in street protests. The Clintonites concluded that trade friction was not worth it. This history illuminates President Bush 's strange call to Japan 's prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi , on Wednesday.

In 1867 , the year of Canadian Confederation , the new country began negotiating with the H.B.C. for a massive transfer of land. People moving out to the West at that time included in their numbers " Canada Firsters , " who arrogantly declared to the M tis that the future of the West belonged to them and not the " half breeds. " The antagonism was exacerbated by the presence of outsiders surveying land held by the M tis for generations. In 1869 , the M tis took action. A 25-year-old , college-educated man named Louis Riel emerged as their leader. They formed a provisional government and blocked entry of the Canadian governor at the U.S-Canada border. Their government had the support of most people but made the unfortunate mistake of imprisoning , and eventually executing , an especially obnoxious White , Protestant , Ontarian by the name of Thomas Scott , an action that would have dire consequences for Louis Riel . </threat.n.954><threat.n.955>HRL Laboratories , LLC , has been awarded $ 4.3 million for the first phase of an effort to develop a threat warning device that will enable fighting forces to rapidly detect and assess long- and short-range threats . </threat.n.955><threat.n.956>In effect , this point advises asymmetric , even unconventionally irregular , approaches on our part.

If there are cultural barriers on our side to incorporating particularly murderous options into our policy , strategy , or operational intent , then we may need to reconsider some of our attitudes and rules of engagement. After all , war is war.

" </threat.n.961><threat.n.962>Again , in order to grasp what is at stake ontologically , it is important to resist a simple moral understanding of DSNs , as if the mere fact of surveillance in itself is a bad ' thing , a sign of the further medicalisation ' of society. The demonstrated success of the WHO 's network makes such condemnations difficult. And yet , without a doubt , biosurveillance programs such as those in the US are in the process of casting the medical gaze ' further than it has ever been cast before. This is why biosurveillance has to be regarded as a topological problem as well as a political problem. DSNs are caught between the recognition of the need to fight networks with networks , and the insistent need to establish sovereignty within the network. For this reason , we may see the situation of networks fighting networks ' become the rule rather than the exception. In the condition of a normative state of exception , they may remain continually operative , but relatively invisible in terms of its effects. Until , of course , a threat is identified , at which time the network topology may undergo a sudden , even violent contraction ( bioterror alerts , seizure of materials , detention of individuals , Haz-Mat inspections ) . </threat.n.962><threat.n.963>Japan then succeeded in attracting a Western ally to its cause. Japan and Britain , both of whom wanted to keep Russia out of Manchuria , signed the Treaty of Alliance in 1902 , which was in effect until in 1921 when the two signed the Four Power Treaty on Insular Possessions , which took effect in 1923. The British recognized Japanese interests in Korea and assured Japan they would remain neutral in case of a Russo-Japanese war but would become more actively involved if another power ( probably an allusion to France ) entered the war as a Russian ally. In the face of this joint threat , Russia became more conciliatory toward Japan and agreed to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in 1903. The new balance of power in Korea favored Japan and allowed Britain to concentrate its interests elsewhere in Asia. Hence , Tokyo moved to gain influence over Korean banks , opened its own financial institutions in Korea , and began constructing railroads and obstructing Russian and French undertakings on the peninsula . </threat.n.963><threat.n.964>Of course , not all courts use the Dinwiddie test in evaluating threats.238 However , the general principle illustrated by the application of Dinwiddie to the three cases above is that any test designed for adults-as most are-is inadequate when evaluating student threats in a school environment scarred by past violence. Further , reliance on a legal definition of a true threat risks underinclusivity : teenage communications may fail the first threshold of intent to communicate , yet still be important warning signs that should be addressed. In short , it makes more sense-when dealing with teenage speech in the school context-to simply bypass the initial intent threshold to determine if speech constitutes a threat and focus instead on whether actual danger exists . </threat.n.964><threat.n.965>One thing he 's done to help kick off this promotion is put together a collection of his songs for free download.

To put it more bluntly ( as I 've done before ) , the now dormant U.S.-North Korean negotiations of recent years were hardly more than high-stakes blackmail. In essence , they were offering to dismantle their various weapons-buildings programs , and we were offering them the billions of dollars they need to prop up their vicious regime.

Hence , Dinwiddie is used as an example of typical court approaches , and the Secret Service questions provide a superior option.

She assigns error to the denial of her motion to suppress evidence discovered by an officer during a traffic stop after the officer obtained consent to search defendant as a result of a threat to arrest her. Defendant argues that , because the officer lacked probable cause to arrest her , her consent in response to the threat was involuntary. The state concedes that the officer lacked probable cause to arrest and that , as a result , the threat rendered defendant 's consent involuntary. We conclude that the concession is appropriate.

Totalitarian regimes rest primarily on theological bases. The predominant body of knowledge is transmitted to society directly from the source of official authority , by means of vertical , hierarchical structures of dissemination and mediation. In this manner the production and reproduction of knowledge is inextricably bound to the political authority that gave rise to it and any attempt to approach this body of revealed truth with a critical disposition , automatically translates into an attempt to question the source of authority from which official truths emanate.

Man belongs to different communities : the family and professional and political communities , and it is inside these communities that he must exercise his responsible freedom.

To wait until such a threat is imminent is to invite the complete annihilation of humanity or , at the very least , to send it back to the Stone Age. Immediate action is required to establish self-supporting safe zones worldwide to ensure the survivability of humanity through the End of the Age.

The authorities probably have no idea of the magnitude of the hazard , only that a hazard could be possible. Perhaps we have homeopaths at work here ! Generally , they deal in extrapolations of inexact data to minute concentrations , and probably do not know the rate at which organisms take up and excrete such tiny quantities. The problem is that methyl mercury could be a threat , but I have no confidence that the authorities know enough about it to protect the public , only to enjoy the creation of panic.

Must they abandon their faith to accept science and the evolutionary theory ? Not necessarily. It may be the case that adherents to religious traditions who are insistent on a literal reading of their scriptures might have extreme difficulty in accepting the results of scientific inquiry but not those who are willing to interpret the writings found in their scriptures as products of their age and expressing a message found within the literal meanings. There can be a view of Religion and Science that holds that they are not in conflict but can be held to be commensurable ( more on this in chapter eight ) . This theory of the relation of reason to faith as being commensurable leads to the acceptance of well formulated and supported scientific theory such as that of evolution despite the literal reading of sacred scriptures.

WHO declared TB a global emergency in 1993 and the threat continues to grow , especially from multidrug resistant TB ( see figure 4 ) . The disease is especially prevalent in Russia , India , Southeast Asia , Sub-Saharan Africa , and parts of Latin America. More than 1.5 million people died of TB in 1998 , excluding those infected with HIV/AIDS , and there were up to 7.4 million new cases. Although the vast majority of TB infections and deaths occur in developing regions , the disease also is encroaching into developed regions due to increased immigration and travel and less emphasis on prevention. Drug resistance is a growing problem; the WHO has reported that up to 50 percent of people with multidrug resistant TB may die of their infection despite treatment , which can be 10 to 50 times more expensive than that used for drug-sensitive TB. HIV/AIDS also has contributed to the resurgence of TB. One-quarter of the increase in TB incidence involves co-infection with HIV.

Short as this time has been , it has been a period of unusual growth and successful development. As Grayson correctly points out , Korean shamanism , Buddhism , and Confucianism could not play a significant role in hindering the expansion of Korean Protestantism : ( 826 ) Even though it was prevalent throughout society due to its pursuit of secular blessing , Korean shamanism was neither highly regarded nor organized well enough to constitute a significant threat to the new religion. Although Korean Buddhism was a much higher religion than shamanism , it could not hinder the development of the new faith because it was too weak internally to offer much resistance to this form of Christianity. Korean Confucianism , likewise , was unable to constitute an organized threat to the entrance of Protestantism. Moreover , Confucianism was not necessarily in conflict with Protestant Christianity , since the high moral codes taught by the Protestants and their rejection of shamanism as superstitious practices and Buddhism as socially irresponsible must have been in agreement with what many Confucianists thought . </threat.n.1227><threat.n.1228>4. maybe the virus looks at all things alive as a threat to its survival , that would also explain why zeds do n't usually attack each other , because A. they are trying to survive , and B. they may not be able to detect anything living in the undead ... </threat.n.1228><threat.n.1229>That student , who is not being identified , was charged with at least one felony count in connection with making terrorist threats , she said.

Feelings of rage and angst might remain hidden until they make themselves known in more terrifying and tragic ways . </threat.n.1284><threat.n.1285>" Due to the nature of the threat revealed by this investigation , we are prohibiting any liquids , including beverages , hair gels , and lotions from being carried on the airplane.

In this sense , warning of threats comports with ethics guidelines , which are invariably consistent with legal requirements. When clinicians have felt ill-prepared to assess the seriousness of a threat or to conduct a risk assessment , basing the disclosure on the threat alone is at least a consistent , reasonably clear approach. Lacking a standard for effectuating the warning , simply conveying the threat itself may seem sufficient. Since risk assessment is not explicitly required , warning of threats can be seen as more driven by the identified victim 's right to be warned in comparison with a duty grounded in clinically established risk. The corresponding duty to warn of the threat does not explicitly involve a clinical and legal duty to conduct a risk assessment. In some situations and jurisdictions , however , the verbal threat must be followed by a clinical determination of significant risk , before the threat is conveyed to the victim . </threat.n.1287><threat.n.1288>It was in the 1970s that the LDS church as an institution moved definitively into the political arena.

Today , however , the Saxons face an even greater threat to their survival as a separate ethnic entity due to a combination of factors both in Transylvania and abroad. The first are the ruinous economic conditions and the oppression suffered in Romania under the communist regimes which ruled the country since the end of the Second World War. And the second are the generous conditions under which ethnic Germans from eastern Europe are received in West Germany.

Those who get paid by fixed commission on transaction volume are the winners. They see their income rise as the monetary value of the transaction rises. This ranges from sales agents and gas-station operators to real-estate brokers , investment bankers , mortgage brokers , credit-card issuers , etc. This translates into higher aggregate revenue for the economy and explains why corporate profit is up even when consumer discretionary spending slows. It also explains why employment can be up while the unemployment rate remains constant , because the new work goes mostly to those already employed or those newly entering the job market , but not to the chronically unemployed , who remain unemployed. A steady unemployment rate in an expanding labor pool means that unemployment is growing at the same rate as new employment. An unemployment rate of 5.2 - the US rate in April - is within the structural range ( 4-6 ) of what neo-classical economists call a non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ( NAIRU ) , thus presenting no inflation threat . </threat.n.1419><threat.n.1420>In Parkhouse 's defence , the court heard that the threat had " effectively been hot air " and " more symbolic than a genuine threat.

Native to Asia , Europe , North Africa and the boreal regions of North America , this species has been introduced into Australia and temperate regions of North America. Red foxes are generalist predators that attain relatively high densities and negatively impact many native species , including smaller canids and ground nesting birds in North America , and many small and medium-sized rodent and marsupial species in Australia ( Kamler and Ballard , 2002 ) . They also prey on livestock. In Canada , introduced red foxes may have already replaced several native subspecies of red foxes.

This point is even more explicit in The Antichrist , where Nietzsche notes that Christian morality has waged deadly war against this higher type of man; it has placed all the basic instincts of his type under ban ( 5 , emphasis added ) . In other words , the anti-naturalness of MPS is objectionable because the natural instincts MPS opposes are precisely those necessary for the growth of the higher type of man. Thus , underlying Nietzsche 's worries about the anti-naturalness of MPS just as underlying his worries about the threat MPS poses to life is a concern for the effect of MPS on higher men. </threat.n.1426><threat.n.1427>Therefore , the US strategy aims to secure strategic positions in Africa by using the threat of terrorism to gain military facilities and bases to protect its interests.

The body 's President , Deirdre Littlefield , said however , that there were some positives in this deteriorating situation. With far fewer ships in service as the downturn bites deeper , it should ease the problem of finding sufficient numbers of trained and experienced seafarers , although recruitment going forward remains a huge problem when seen against the threats of piracy and the criminalisation of mariners.

After all , the victorious champion of democracy and freedom for small nations had created independent Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia ( remember them ? ) out of the rubble of its European rivals. The oil-wells of the Ottoman empire bestrode the coveted Middle Eastern land route to British India via Persia and Afghanistan. And lo and behold ! out of the wreckage of Turkey Britain built other monuments to the future peace , tranquility and well-being of the world. It created Iraq. It created a Jewish protectorate in Palestine a little loyal Ulster in the Middle East , as it was described. It even put General Pilsudski ( who had fought on the opposite side in the Great War ) in charge of a newly independent Poland. After all , an eastern European buffer was needed against the great new Soviet threat to the British Empire. So surely in the end Britain would do right by Ireland who had given hundreds of thousands of volunteers , at home and abroad , to its Great War ? </threat.n.1538><threat.n.1539>Ibn Rushd traveled to Marrakesh and came under the patronage of the caliph 'Abd al-Mu'min , likely involved in educational reform for the dynasty. The Almohads , like the Almoravids they had supplanted , were a Northwest African Kharijite-influenced Berber reform movement. Founded in the theology of Ibn Tumart ( 1078-1139 ) , who emphasized divine unity and the idea of divine promise and threat , he believed that a positive system of law could co-exist with a rational and practical theology. This led to the concept that law needed to be primarily based on revelation instead of the traditions of the jurists. Ibn Talmart 's theology affirmed that the existence and essence of God could be established through reason alone , and used that to posit an ethical legal theory that depended on a divine transcendence . </threat.n.1539><threat.n.1540>A Tsunami Watch is first issued by the bureau when there is the potential risk of a tsunami in the region and will remain in place while the level of threat is assessed.

Article 51 is meant to regulate relations among states and , since terrorist groups are not states , they can expect no protection. UN Security Council resolutions 1368 and 1373 , written as responses to the attacks of September 11 , each reaffirm " the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence as recognised by the Charter of the United Nations " . In other words , article 51 applies.

Chief Justice Rhenquist recently stated that he agrees with the maxim : " In time of war , the laws are silent. " This is a recipe for tyranny , particularly in this day and age when the definitions of such things as " war " and " enemy " are growing ever more vague and general.

The nuclear facilities are widely dispersed and built-in. Most analysts I 've spoken to agree that to seriously set back operations would require waves and waves of sorties , days and days of attacks. It 's not conceivable the international community would allow the Israeli air force to make those days and days of attacks to accomplish a serious setback.

Once the initial question of whether or not the school possesses jurisdiction is answered , the speech must be analyzed to determine if a danger exists. This Section discusses ( A ) traditional threat analysis-based on the intent and expectation of causing fear-and why such analysis is ineffective and overinclusive in addressing adolescent speech , ( B ) the important role of warning signs and the danger posed by zero-tolerance policies , and ( C ) guidelines developed to help determine when a legitimate danger exists . </threat.n.1598><threat.n.1599>HOT SPOT 5 : JAPAN. The land of the rising sun has been struggling with deflation for decades. The Japanese authorities have fought a seemingly endless battle with zombie banks and bloated construction projects , and by any sane measure they appear to have lost. Japan ' s public debt-to-GDP ratio has reached truly insane levels ( approaching 200 ) as the government pumps out more and more debt in an effort to stimulate a moribund economy that refuses to awaken. Serious observers like the wonks at bond giant PIMCO now argue that Japan must adopt a reflate-or-die strategy , urging them to do whatever it takes to create inflation. Japan has been able to pursue a strategy of utter folly for 20 years now only because it is an incredibly wealthy country. Over the course of two decades it has burned through much of that wealth. If Japan ' s famously patient domestic savers run out of savings with which to continue buying JGBs ( Japanese Government Bonds ) , the Japanese fiscal situation could finally implode. This has been a latent threat for years , but the drumbeats grow louder than ever now. Japan could see real fireworks in 2010 . </threat.n.1599><threat.n.1600>Any increased intrusion on American privacy interests must be justified through an understanding of the particular nature , significance , and severity of the threat being addressed by the program.

Special interest extremists continue to conduct acts of politically motivated violence to force segments of society , including the general public , to change attitudes about issues considered important to their causes. These groups occupy the extreme fringes of animal rights , pro-life , environmental , anti-nuclear , and other movements.

By the use of modern techniques of control , barbarism nestles itself deeper into modernity 's social and psychological fabric. The domination of nature ensures that man 's once primal station in nature is transcended and then forgotten. Thus modernity 's radical humanism , which celebrates humans as unique and deserving especial consideration , carries with it the latent threat of species imperialism which ultimately returns to haunt human relations themselves. Thus , the domination of nature intertwines itself with social hierarchy and control. The resolution of the antagonistic predicament of civilisation and barbarism , Adorno maintains , does not lie in the domination of the object by the imperialising Cartesian subject. There is no final reconciliation of the dialectic of Enlightenment in a perfect unity of subject and object or in a return to an original , primordial state . </threat.n.1606><threat.n.1607>We continue to receive a stream of credible reports indicating that terrorists are in the advanced stages of planning attacks against a range of targets , including in Pakistani cities.

In a sense , the victim 's right to know compares with the government 's right to know of terrorists ' plans to commit atrocities. From this perspective , the intended victim has a right to be warned of the threat regardless of how great or little the risk of violence in fact is . </threat.n.1660><threat.n.1661>Also to ensure that policy clients take strategic warning seriously , analysts have to be better prepared to address with distinctive intelligence value-added the so-what of their assessments.

We fear them as unknown , and associate them with a kind of death. To reach Self from feelings involves wandering among these unconscious elements , seeming to pose a real threat to consciousness itself , a walking through the valley of the shadows. We now see that we have , after a manner , experienced death of a kind. The person we were before is gone forever , and although traces may remain , we can never return to that person and identify with personality as we did before. We are not feelings : we have feelings. By making conscious use of feelings and thoughts through awareness of Self we can use the personality in the service of later stages . </threat.n.1662><threat.n.1663>However , according to this fascinating and symbolic story , the first Archon was warned by the Spiritual Light as a voice ' came down ' and said , ' You are mistaken Samael , that is blind god , there is an immortal man of light who has been in existence before you and who will appear in your modelled forms; he will trample you to potter ' s clay. ' 12 So we can see from this that the light of the true spirit represented a threat to the lawmaker ' s ' modelled ' or ' conditioned ' forms; those humans whose consciousness had become brainwashed into believing the lie of the illusion - this false god and his false truth , perpetrated through religion. We can also see that immortal man the perfect soul - was here before the ego and before this false god was created . </threat.n.1663><threat.n.1664>The real threat is violence from the GIs and Korean customers. Many drunken GIs and Koreans have struck the bar girls for any number of reasons. The GIs and Koreans universally treat the prostitutes with a low regard that does not recognize their humanity.

However , we view these as isolated incidents rather than a prevailing condition . </threat.n.1664><threat.n.1665>By invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter to create the Tribunal , the Security Council also revealed an arresting philosophical assumption. Chapter VII provides for the Security Council to take measures designed to re-establish international peace and security. By implication , the alleged violations of human rights in Yugoslavia were deemed to constitute a threat to peace. The corollary of this is the neo-Kantian view that peace can be achieved only through justice , or when everyone is subject to the same laws administered by international organisations. In fact , of course , peace can often be bought at the price of considerable injustice , such as when millions of Germans were displaced after World War II and when half of Europe was subjected to Soviet domination . </threat.n.1665><threat.n.1666>The attacks , and the action against terrorism that resulted from them thus provided the Bush Administration with the necessary pretext for conflating a number of different threats ( terrorism and weapons of mass destruction ) and ending up with a new military doctrine ( pre-emptive strikes ) 19.

The congressional enactment stated , " no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation , tribe , or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty. " ( 71 ) This legislation represented not only a retreat away from a tradition of domestic law within the United States. It also represented a move away from the nascent international law of Aboriginal and treaty rights. It represented a move away from multilateralism towards the unilateralism that would become such a dominant theme in US foreign policy at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Hence there were many global implications in the retreat by the future superpower from the rule of law towards a doctrine preoccupied with the manipulation of force. As John R. Wunder has written , " The Resolution of 1871 not only represented an end to pretense in Indian relations , but it also meant a serious modification and violation of international law and a threat to the diplomacy of the United States.

In a country where carrying weapons or daggers is a tradition , security guards at airports are taking no chances.

As these become more powerful and refined in their discriminations , the contact experiences to which they respond are delayed , and possibilities of adjustment and of choice in response are thus increased. In the innervations of the attitudes that distant objects call out the animal feels the invitation or the threat they carry with them. He experiences his own repressed responses in his response to the distant stimulation. His responses to his own tendencies to act provide the control that organizes all his responses into a coordinated act , so that these inner feelings wax in importance in the development of the mechanism. Of equal importance is the separation , involved in the distance stimulation , between the content of the experience and the immediate response. It is here that we first meet the stuff of ideation. Of course in itself the distance stimulation is just that and nothing more.

For targeted threats , or attacks along the lines of that in Tokyo , national resources were ample , especially since , when it came to health infrastructure and civilian protection services , capital cities and major urban centres were particularly well-endowed. Civil defence resources were quite adequate to combat the effects of a CBR attack , other than where a weapon of mass destruction was employed or where there was widespread use of large quantities of toxic substances over an extensive area.

The period of the bitter struggle between the Church and the Empire , under the Arianizing Caesars of the fourth century , was also the period of Monastic expansion. It was a kind of a new and impressive " Exodus. " And the Empire always regarded this " Exodus , " the flight into Desert , as a threat to its claims and to its very existence , from the times of St. Athanasius to the cruel persecution of monks by the Iconoclastic Emperors. It is often suggested that people were leaving " the world " simply to escape the burden of social life , with its duties and labors. It is difficult to see in what sense life in the wilderness could be " easy " and " leisurely. " It was , indeed , a strenuous life , with its own burdens and dangers.

The times were very poor and the prostitutes of A-town were " praised " by the government for bringing in foreign currency from the GI trade. In addition during the 1970s , the cash-strapped government was trying to limit the birth rate of the rural community and posters of " birth control " were pasted on every building to encourage the traditionally large farm families to reduce in size. Up until the late 1980s , these posters were still seen on the buildings outside of the A-town walls.

While fewer than 1 million people ( less than 1 percent of the population ) consider themselves Christian in the early 1990s , Christianity is respected for its contributions to society , particularly in education and social action.

Much more dangerous is the second idea , that the state and private citizens should coerce people into adhering to the correct religious approach.

Then the warning may be of the threat or danger , even if based only on the believed threat. Unless risk assessment was implied , however , such a warning is not actually a warning of the risk. On the other hand , warnings of risks may or may not have been prompted by a threat , and in court decisions the nature of the risk assessment is typically not addressed , perhaps because little or no formal risk assessment was done by the clinician and offered in his or her defense . </threat.n.1770><threat.n.1771>As soon as Warning : Spyware threat has been detected on your PC desktop registry key appears , you can delete the Warning : Spyware threat has been detected on your PC desktop registry key by right-clicking it and selecting Modify , then clicking Delete. </threat.n.1771><threat.n.1772>4.199 The South Australian CFS uses SEWS whenever lives are at threat or when a fire is burning out of control on a very high to extreme fire danger day.252 SEWS precedes each bushfire warning message.

If there is any doubt about the effects of the fear of radioactivity , the psychological effects and " loss of trust " described by the President 's Commission , and subsequent studies of the accident at Three Mile Island , should provide ample evidence.

In such a climate , schools must be prepared with clear policies that outline roles and actions in response to threats of school violence.

Although the various substitutes proposed for this function that are modeled roughly on the Peace Corps appear grossly inadequate in potential scope , they should not be ruled out without further study. Slavery , in a technologically modern and conceptually euphemized form , may prove a more efficient and flexible institution in this area. Motivational function. Although none of the proposed substitutes for war as the guarantor of social allegiance can be dismissed out of hand , each presents serious and special difficulties. Intensified environmental threats may raise ecological dangers; mythmaking dissociated from war may no longer be politically feasible; purposeful blood games and rituals can far more readily be devised than implemented. An institution combining this function with the preceding one , based on , but not necessarily imitative of , the precedent of organized ethnic repression , warrants careful consideration . </threat.n.1784><threat.n.1785>Angelina Jolie has donated $ 1 million to Afghan refugees in response to the United Nations ' appeal for aid. Jolie , who is a goodwill ambassador for the United Nation 's , has given the money as part of the agency 's bid to raise $ 268 million to meet the humanitarian needs in and around Afghanistan. High Commissioner Ruud Lubbers thanked the actress for her help saying , " This significant contribution from a concerned young American reinforces my belief that , despite the trauma of recent events in her country , a strong sense of humanitarian responsibility toward innocent civilians suffering in far-off places continues to animate the spirit of caring individuals everywhere. " Jolie travelled to Pakistan in August to visit some of the 3.5 million Afghans who fled the Taliban regime and are living in camps there and in Iran. Refugee officials are now bracing themselves for the arrival of a further 1.5 million people as the threat of American retaliation increases following the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington . </threat.n.1785><threat.n.1786>Finally , civil defense , particularly crisis relocation ( evacuation ) , has been presented as a complementary element in nuclear strategy. It is ineffective at best. Its purpose is to minimize human destruction and thus purports to strengthen the basis for the possibility of successfully enduring a " limited " or even urban-oriented nuclear attack. This argument is tenuous. First , it is hard to believe that in a period of extreme tension , a full-scale urban evacuation by the U.S. or Soviet Union would be perceived as anything but a signal of intent to pursue a nuclear strike. Since an effective evacuation takes at a minimum four to five days to complete , certain actions are likely to be taken by the other side. Among the possibilities : a threat to attack if the evacuation is not stopped; an attack during the evacuation phase when the population is most exposed; and of course , the adoption of a strategy of " launch on warning , " creating a hair trigger in a clearly dangerous situation. Ironically , a launch on warning would defeat the whole purpose of a first- strike strategy . </threat.n.1786><threat.n.1787>Certainly , now that the Cold War is over and U.S.-Russia relations have changed markedly for the better , Russia presents far less of a military threat to the U.S. However , it would not be prudent to consider that Russia presents no military threat whatsoever. In addition , biological weapons technology can possibly proliferate from Russia to other countries less friendly to the U.S. For these reasons , it is important that we continue to analyze the situation with biological weapons in Russia . </threat.n.1787><threat.n.1788>The Real Dirt : It is not hard to imagine that some future enemy might threaten our nuclear hegemony by constructing the radioactive equivalent of a car bomb -- what Mike Davis has termed " the poor man 's air force " -- in some cave or bunker. It is harder to imagine why war planners think that the development of a new class of bunker-busting bombs would be a " deterrent , " or that we can meet the threats we face by blowing up nuclear warheads above bunkers and tunnels. Do war planners seriously think we could use our nuclear weapons " preventively " on underground targets without horrific consequences to regional populations that would unleash such hatred and condemnation as well as the desire for revenge and violence as to render such a strike as impractical as it is immoral ? </threat.n.1788><threat.n.1789>What is more , the concept of " limited " nuclear war is illusory and thus dangerous. It propagates a notion that no Soviet and no U.S. planner should be encouraged to accept as a basis for policy-making -- that is , that damage from a military attack would be benign or " acceptable. " As we have shown , damage to the fabric of civilian society from any effective attack against ICBMs and/or substantial numbers of military targets would create an imperative to retaliate and escalate. Thus the possibility of a controlled , rational " limited " nuclear war would be undermined. The perception of threat and vulnerability generated by this damage would eliminate the political option of control. Moreover , a number of commentators have raised the serious possibility that in a technical sense , the command and control structure would be so physically vulnerable that even purely mechanical communication requirements for controlling a nuclear response will not be available. [ 25 ] The combination of these two elements makes the viability of a " limited " nuclear war strategy highly doubtful . </threat.n.1789><threat.n.1790>At a rate of 20 million tons per decade , how can any rational argument be made that , when safely applied , they pose no threat ? The chemical and cellular processes within the body 's cells can not react to the passing whims of chemists without disturbance in function. It took thousands of years for the body to adjust itself to changing environmental conditions. When these conditions are suddenly altered by the actions of men , the cells can not make the adjustment -- disease is the result. Industrial leaks , accidents and completely unregulated emissions throw billions of pounds of gases , particles and vapors into the air. Not only do we breathe them into our bodies , but they are deposited on farm lands , in water reservoirs used for drinking water and for crop irrigation , etc. They are in our food chains , thousands of different toxins in the air , from Los Angeles to Utah; from Washington State to Chicago; from Louisiana to Minnesota; from Ohio to Maine . </threat.n.1790><threat.n.1791>The threat came despite frantic negotiations by South Korean and Afghan officials who have travelled to the insurgency-hit southern province of Ghazni to lead the efforts to save the hostages , who are mainly women. ( * ) </threat.n.1791><threat.n.1792>Of the many influences on contactee thought , perhaps the most significant was the 1951 movie The Day the Earth Stood Still. The movie portrays humans as warlike and the peaceful alien , Klaatu , as possessing an advanced technology that can end disease for humans. Klaatu has a proto-ecological message : If Earth continues on its aggressive , warlike path , its atomic technology will endanger the community of planets; therefore , the Earthlings must renounce war or the alien will use his robot , Gort , to blow up Earth and end the threat to the planetary confederation 's peace . </threat.n.1792><threat.n.1793>Lastly , I think again of the fate suffered by the Mormons and even the Freemasons in America. In that fertile new ground , the mysticism and secret societies of our European ancestors flourished , and despite modernity and industrialism , the land still inspires its own wild magic. Yet groups that have publicly promoted their private revelations , such as the Mormons , have been met with brutal violence and persecution in American culture. Times have changed , to be sure , but there are still dangers. Those following private revelations are considered a threat not least because all parties take their revelations and myths literally. The Abrahamic religions take their own revelations literally , as absolutely true , and have trouble tolerating those who refuse to believe literally. Moreover , their adherents are usually experiencing their revelations vicariously , through books and stories rather than through their own active imagination. A true understanding of imagination and revelation must lead to tolerance of the beliefs of others. It will surely love books , but it will not idolize and fetishize them . </threat.n.1793><threat.n.1794>The results of the analysis carried out on the business strategies of McKinsey and Co. indicated very significant effects , even amidst the threats of unrest. Therefore , we could conclude that the business strategies of McKinsey and Co. could still be expected to improve faster than average . </threat.n.1794><threat.n.1795>Today there is emerging an environmental crisis and humanists seem to be divided over the proper response to it. Some argue that human population should be limited even though there is strong disagreement how this could be done. Others argue that the standard of living should be reduced and if we go back to the standard of living of a century back then the threat to the environment from population growth would be reduced. [ Note 20 ] An active population policy like the one-child policy in China is rarely advocated on the ground that it violates a fundamental human right . </threat.n.1795><threat.n.1796>First and foremost , the left must acknowledge we are at war like the Supreme Court did and that some grant of executive authority must be vouchsafed the President in order for him to do his job. The war is not some gigantic political ploy that Karl Rove is using to win elections. The threat is real and immediate. And to date , I have yet to see even a hint from the netnuts and even many in Congress that this threat is taken seriously . </threat.n.1796><threat.n.1797>A final and serious deviation from the Program requirements involves drug sharing.

The program is designed to provide unclassified national security threat and warning information to U.S. corporate security directors and executives , law enforcement , and other government agencies. It also focuses on the " response " capability unique to the FBI 's jurisdiction in both law enforcement and counterintelligence investigations . </threat.n.1804><threat.n.1805>In particular , the emerging digital environment has significant implications for this issue. It has become commonplace to observe that information is the currency of our economic age. That puts a premium on designing a legal schema that creates sufficient incentives to maximize investment in data collection -- to expand the available universe of information -- without putting in place unjustified obstacles to competition and innovation. Moreover , digital technology permits the creation and distribution of a large number of perfect copies of data files at the touch of a button and therefore expands dramatically the risk that , in the absence of adequate legal remedies , piracy , or the threat of piracy , will deter investment in database creation. For all of these reasons , it is important to calibrate new private rights carefully -- to optimize overall economic and social benefits , to prevent unfairly undermining investments and agreements premised on the current law , and to preclude new opportunities for thwarting competition . </threat.n.1805><threat.n.1806>" I do n't think there is any higher biological threat to this nation than smallpox , " Jahrling said to me , in his office , a windowless retreat jammed with paper.

In the consensual environment of representative democracy , cultural hegemony rests on the power to determine the boundaries and framework within which legitimate intellectual and political debate takes place. Yet , coercive as it may be , this model of hegemony relies for its operation on internalized obedience. By contrast , the repressive cultural paradigm denies even the legitimacy of this intellectual debate. While the consensual model conceives of the qualified exchange of ideas as its basis of authority , the repressive paradigm views it as a threat for the foundations of its power which rests on unconditional support and ' organic ' identification with the objectives promoted by the elite.

However , you must make slight changes to reduce the chance of biological contamination. Do not build your shelter in depressions in the ground. Aerosol sprays tend to concentrate in these depressions. Avoid building your shelter in areas of vegetation , as vegetation provides shade and some degree of protection to biological agents. Avoid using vegetation in constructing your shelter. Place your shelter 's entrance at a 90-degree angle to the prevailing winds. Such placement will limit the entry of airborne agents and prevent air stagnation in your shelter. Always keep your shelter clean . </threat.n.1905><threat.n.1906>Hezbollah is a cancer that has metastasized , expanding its operations from Lebanon , first to strike regional targets in the Middle East , then far beyond.

Despite some well-publicized disruptions , we believe he could still strike without additional warning. Indeed , Usama Bin Ladin 's organization and other terrorist groups are placing increased emphasis on developing surrogates to carry out attacks in an effort to avoid detection. For example , the Egyptian Islamic Jihad ( EIJ ) is linked closely to Bin Ladin 's organization and has operatives located around the world including in Europe , Yemen , Pakistan , Lebanon , and Afghanistan. And , there is now an intricate web of alliances among Sunni extremists worldwide , including North Africans , radical Palestinians , Pakistanis , and Central Asians . </threat.n.1907><threat.n.1908>Mohammed Ahmed Issa Yassen , 20 , lives in the occupied West Bank village of Bilin , where he works in his family ' s car garage business as a mechanic.

He rapidly abolished numerous enemy daimyo houses , reduced others , such as that of the Toyotomi , and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western daimyo , but his assumption of the title of shogun helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base , Ieyasu was confident enough to install his son Hidetada ( 1579-1632 ) as shogun and himself as retired shogun in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat , and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615 the Toyotomi stronghold at Osaka was destroyed by the Tokugawa army . </threat.n.1909><threat.n.1910>According to Israeli sources , ministers who wish to visit the UK in a personal capacity have begun asking the Israeli embassy in London to arrange meetings with British officials.

For example , the inhabitants of Andhra Pradesh in India often wear scarves around their necks , whereas members of the neighboring group , the Telanganas , do not. Between Croats and Serbs , dialect differences such as the Croat mlijeko ( milk ) vs. the Serb mleko carry a heavy political-cultural load. In times of stress and violent outbreaks , identifying minor differences may have deadly implications. Sinhalese mobs in the Sri Lankan riots of 1958 , for example , relied on a variety of subtle indicators such as the presence of earring holes in the ear or the manner in which a shirt was worn to identify their enemy Tamils , whom they then attacked or killed ( Horowitz , 1985 ) . </threat.n.1916><threat.n.1917> The gospel ' s most dangerous earthly adversaries are not raving atheists who stand outside the door shouting threats and insults.

Este ( 1999a ) cites Porter 's ( 1965 ) interesting observation on xenophobia , which is , quite literally , a fear of strangers that is thought to be instinctive and deeply rooted in the human race. It is thought to stem from a reactive fear , deeply rooted in the subconscious , from a time when people clearly different from oneself may well constitute a threat to an individual , an individual 's family , or an individual 's community. Related to this notion is simple prejudice , where members of a majority culture may feel their culture to be superior; consequently , members of society belonging to any other must therefore be inferior or even primitive.

In accounts of the civil war of 1871 and the revolutionary government of the Commune , these potential political dangers became explicit. Although there was considerable evidence that pointed to men as the incendiaries who had set fire to Paris during the upheaval , contemporary opinion , fueled by rumor and sensational press reports , latched tenaciously onto the figure of the petroleuse , a " hideous and fierce but sexually compelling female figure , " as the vengeful perpetrator who allegedly set the fires , enacting literally the latent female threat to overturn the political order. Contemporary social scientific literature similarly cast women as agents of political upheaval. In the words of one crowd theorist , " by its routine caprice , ... its credulity , its excitability , its rapid leaps from fury to tenderness , from exasperation to bursts of laughter , the crowd is woman , even when it is composed , as almost always happens , of masculine elements.

Coercion is compulsion of one person by another through force or threat of aggression. Fraud is any attempt to profit by deceiving a person into making a choice intended to cause him economic harm relative to what would have been his undeceived choice. Deception is the statement of demonstrable falsehoods or the omission of relevant truths that has the intentional effect of encouraging a false belief in another person. Theft is the unjust and non-consensual taking of property from its rightful owner. Anti-competitive monopoly is the intentional control or denial of a person 's participation in an industry by the coordinated action of the person ( s ) controlling that industry.

There was considerable continuity -- in institutions , operating style , and personnel -- between the civil service before and after the occupation , partly because MacArthur 's staff ruled indirectly and depended largely on the cooperation of civil servants. A process of mutual co-optation occurred. Also , United States policy planners never regarded the civil service with the same opprobrium as the military or economic elites. The civil service 's role in Japan 's militarism was generally downplayed. Many of the occupation figures themselves were products of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal and had strong faith in the merits of civil service professionalism.

If we look closely , we see that these are not essential to what Erikson ( 1956 ) called the ego identity and what I call a core identity. If a psychiatrist , for example , changes his profession and becomes a book publisher , he may do so without much anxiety unless this change becomes unconsciously connected to an internal danger , such as the loss of a mothering person or her love , castration , or a lowering of one ' s self-esteem ( Freud , 1926 ) . Likewise , a social democrat can usually become a conservative republican without much internal turmoil. Unlike losing such sub-identities , the loss or threat of losing one ' s core identity creates extreme anxiety , even terror , in an individual. Of course , these days , in psychiatric clinical practice it is customary to numb the terror of adults on the verge of developing psychosis through extensive use of psychotropic drugs . </threat.n.2039><threat.n.2040>U.S. Army War College &gt; &gt; Strategic Studies Institute &gt; &gt; Publications &gt; &gt; Chinese Information Warfare : A Phantom Menace or Emerging Threat ? </threat.n.2040><threat.n.2041>In a recent series of addresses to nearly 2 , 000 employees of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory months before the discovery of the London car bombs , Turchie reminded some of the nation 's premier scientists and engineers that the threat from international terrorism is real and that America is the prime target.

Especially in an age of " asymmetric force " ( where the greatest threats come not from states but from individuals and non-state terrorist groups ) , America 's bulky conventional military is too large and tactically too conservative to protect Americans well. The reason policy makers favor a large , conventional military is that it still serves their purposes well : bullying leaders of foreign countries into compliance through threats of bombing or economic sanctions. These policy makers are , contrary to the popular imagination , not particularly attached to America at all but are more interested in advancing their conceptions of historical grandeur on a world stage.

That is , we have direct experience not merely of the Humean succession of events in the external world , but of a very special class of such successions : those in which the earlier event is an action of our own , performed in circumstances in which we both desire the later event , and believe that it is more probable given the act in question than it would be otherwise. To put it more simply , we all have direct personal experience of doing one thing and thence achieving another. It is this common and commonplace experience that licenses what amounts to an ostensive definition of the notion of ' bringing about ' . In other words , these cases provide direct non-linguistic acquaintance with the concept of bringing about an event; acquaintance which does not depend on prior acquisition of any causal notion. An agency theory thus escapes the threat of circularity.

FDI may also be undertaken for the purpose of defusing a protectionist threat. Such quid pro quo investments are motivated by the belief that the added cost of producing in the foreign market is more than compensated by the reduced probability of being subjected to new import barriers on existing exports to that market. There is evidence , for example , that the perceived threat of protection had a substantial impact on Japanese FDI in the United States in the 1980s , and that these investments reduced the subsequent risk of being subjected to contingent protection resulting from anti-dumping and escape clause actions . </threat.n.2153><threat.n.2154>Threats are morally equivalent to violence.

Both types are commonly called gases , but they are actually liquids that are not remarkably volatile. These agents were designed specifically to harm people by any route of exposure and to be effective at low doses. Mustard gas was used in World War I , and the nerve agents were developed shortly before , during , and after World War II. Our perception of the potency of chemical weapons has changed , as well as our concern over potential effects of prolonged exposures to low doses and potential target populations that include women and children. Many of the toxicologic studies and human toxicity estimates for both mustard and nerve agents were designed for the purpose of quickly developing maximal casualties in the least sensitive male soldier.

Understanding how the risk of catching a mosquito-borne infection varies depending on the environment is an important step in planning and implementing effective control measures. The rate at which humans become infected is determined by how often they are bitten by mosquitoes and the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious. It is often assumed that if the percentage of infectious mosquitoes increases , so will the rate at which humans get bitten. But in a new study published in the open access journal PLoS Biology , David Smith , Jonathan Dushoff , and F. Ellis McKenzie challenge this assumption. Using a mathematical model , the authors show that the rate at which humans are bitten and the proportion of infectious mosquitoes peak at different times and places , revealing that the standard metric of estimating the risk of infection -- the average number of times an infectious mosquito bites a person per day -- is flawed . </threat.n.2239><threat.n.2240>The threat to their identity comes from another quarter.

Clearly standardization had nationalistic motives , yet I would suggest that such nationalism was not solely " romantic , " but pragmatic as well. Each of Bulgaria 's modem tragedies have ended with territorial losses and the desire to thoroughly " Bulgarianize " the current territory is less a reflection of frustrated greater ambitions of romantic nationalism than it is a rational policy to ensure that further losses do not take place. The more the country succeeds in creating a standardized Bulgarian population , the less the perceived threat of further territorial retrenchment coming from political changes in the area.

Thus , when a large-group identity is threatened , such as by an imminent enemy invasion , everyone in the large group feels danger directed not just to the collective large-group identity , but to their individual core identities as well. Thousands or millions of people , most of whom will never know or see each other , thus react to a threat against their large-group identity and join together to create shared responses to such threats. The members of the group combine their efforts to repair , protect , and maintain the threads that make up the canvas of their large-group tent.

The latter merits some attention here as it connects the alien other as viral infestation to issues of sexuality and procreation. Superficially , the film 's plot seems familiar enough : an alien species wants to take over Earth by " snatching " human bodies from their proper owners , depriving them of control , intelligence , and ultimately life. The story begins when an astronaut returns from a failed mission and no one notices he has been infected. In the course of the next few months , he impregnates his wife and , since their offspring are also infected , the alien other threatens to begin to spread over the world. As the astronaut 's wife slowly begins to realize what is happening , the contamination of her husband effectively disrupts their normal love-life and the trust they shared. By portraying ( unguarded ) sexual intercourse as the cause of infection , The Astronaut 's Wife aligns the alien other even more directly with the HIV virus than does the Alien saga . </threat.n.2278><threat.n.2279>Be that as it may , one of the first assessments American intelligence and the U.S foreign policy team need to ascertain is the degree to which President Sarkozy 's military independence schemes and civil nuclear ambitions and proliferation ( i.e. to unreliable countries especially ) are threatening to U.S interests and world peace. If confirmed that there is a Sarkozy threat , the U.S. ambassador to France would need to find courteous , but strong arguments the French Nation would understand to persuade the Sarkozy government to participate more effectively in certain regional conflicts like in Afghanistan while ceasing to prepare schemes to duplicate NATO and spreading civil nuclear technology to potentially dangerous States . </threat.n.2279><threat.n.2280>Khomeini had taken power , not by a constitutional process , but violent revolution that ultimately claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.

For instance , if a woman says yes or even feigns sexual enthusiasm in order to keep a knife-wielding attacker from becoming angry and hurting or killing her , it would be absurd to regard her behavior or utterance as consent ( or at least as meaningful consent ) . The question is what other contextual constraints and pressures may also undermine the validity of a woman 's ( apparent ) consent. To put the point another way , having granted that no always means no , we must recognize that , in some cases , yes also means no. There are many kinds of explicit and implicit threats that render a woman 's consent to sex less than meaningful : the man may threaten to sue for custody of their children , to derail her green card application , to evict her , or simply to sulk and make her life miserable for days should she refuse to have sex.

Both also elicit resistance to change. We can even see an analogy between identifying individual childhood traumas ( personal historical images ) in the development of a borderline personality disorder and identifying a mental representation of shared historical traumas ( chosen traumas ) that keeps two large-group neighbors emotionally apart. Just as clinicians need to interpret the meanings and influences of childhood traumas and their reflections in the treatment of borderline patients , policy-makers and others need to identify political strategies that tame the influence of chosen traumas ( as well as chosen glories ) in order to aid two separate large groups in coming together ( Volkan , 1999c ) . </threat.n.2295><threat.n.2296>Credibility of Atheism : Threat to Religious Belief " To say that atheism is credible is to suggest that the atheist may be right; to say that the atheist may be right is to suggest that the Christian may be wrong; to say that the Christian may be wrong is suggest that faith may be an unreliable guide to knowledge ...

If people wish to return to the past in this way - in whole or in part - they could be given territory to do so. State formation , based on the reconstruction of a preferred past , is a feasible way of dividing territory - 'nostalgia states'. For instance , when the territorial integrity of Italy seemed under threat during the last 20 years , proposals for the reconstitution of the Papal States surfaced. The Italian nation state has proved more durable than expected , but the political consequences of a revived Papal state are interesting.

For Vizenor , the creation of text requires the interaction of opposing ideas , and from this opposition new paradigms are created. More than any of the other Native American critics , Vizenor deftly manipulates both the oppressor ' s language and his own. He often creates his own words , subtly altering the connotations that certain English words carry with them. An example of this is his use of the word survivance as opposed to survival. The connotations of survival suggest something that results when there is an immediate threat or danger. Survivance connotes an activity that is sustained because the threat or danger is always present. Also , implicit in survivance is the idea of manipulation and appropriation. Vizenor is essentially using the language that was forced on his culture , but with just enough difference to make it his own creation and to perhaps impede complete understanding. Vizenor ' s use of language highlights the destruction of Native languages and the subsequent enforcement of English.

Officials of the Ronald Reagan administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their common security and international outlook. Nakasone reassured United States leaders of Japan 's determination against the Soviet threat , closely coordinated policies with the United States toward such Asian trouble spots as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia , and worked cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The Japanese government welcomed the increase of United States forces in Japan and the western Pacific , continued the steady buildup of the SDF , and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States against the threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued to cooperate closely with United States policy in these areas following Nakasone 's term of office , although the political leadership scandals in Japan in the late 1980s made it difficult for newly elected President George Bush to establish the same kind of close personal ties that marked the Reagan years . </threat.n.2399><threat.n.2400>Officials at Hocking College in the U.S. , a campus carved into a forest in the Appalachian foothills , say they are taking seriously a threat scrawled on a bathroom wall warning that black students would be killed Feb. 2 . </threat.n.2400><threat.n.2401>Faced with the global recession and declining revenues , the newspaper business is reeling - one major paper has already folded this year and several others are seeking bankruptcy protection.

Originally , spirituality and mysticism were terms created by elite nineteenth-century Western intellectuals , poets , and scholars , mostly of a Whitmanian or Emersonian orientation , and then later became part of a variety of Quaker , theosophical , human potential , and New Age lineages. I am not quite comfortable with these terms myself , but will use them because they are current in English language discourse. For me , the spiritual incorporates the transformative possibilities of the human psyche : total love without a trace of hate , selflessness carved out of the psyche 's normal self-centeredness , a fearlessness that is not a counterphobic reaction to the fear that is an innate part of the human psyche. Yet spiritual transformation is not a once-and-forever achievement , even for enlightened spiritual masters and saints. It remains constantly under threat from the darker forces of the psyche. One is never not human " Twice I almost hated the Chinese.

An activity usually involving torture to force victims to change their beliefs and/or actions. The effects of brainwashing are normally short-lived when the torture ( or threat thereof ) is removed.

They bring happiness only to the extent to which they are capable of improving these conditions and within the limitations of the individual ' s response to them. They do not touch the inner , subjective life of man. It is there that he needs comfort and assurance , a refuge from the ever-present threat in the sturm und drang of life. Accidents , disease , the failure of the faculties , and finally old age and death are not to be prevented by the social sciences , so that they , too , can never be a substitute for religion. Man , who is something more than an animal requiring only creature comforts , needs to be informed concerning his purpose and destiny , and the need is so strong in him that for centuries he has been ready to accept even the most improbable theories in the name of religion , rather than nothing at all. Science has made it more difficult for him to do so , but has not been able to provide a satisfactory replacement for the beliefs it has destroyed . </threat.n.2539><threat.n.2540>What we get is the following : Definition number one : " Terrorism is a modern barbarism that we call terrorism.

The targets of the recent wave of administrative detentions and deportations suggest , in fact , that violent or military operations do not pose the greatest " security threat " in the eyes of the Israeli authorities. Almost half of the administrative detainees are students or university lecturers , including most of the elected student council members. Approximately one-quarter of the detainees and deportees are union leaders. Other targeted categories are journalists , professionals and bookstore owners. Since administrative detention entails no formal charges and evidence presented against the detainee and a potential deportee is " secret , " one can not determine the precise reasons for orders against such people. In their communities , they are known as those who are working to build local institutions in order to establish a sense of community.

But I remain convinced that restrictions of civil liberties should be a last rather than a first resort in our response to this danger. Many more Americans have died to protect our liberties than would likely die in even the worst imaginable terrorist attack. Moreover , we are about not only survival , but survival in a certain way. If we value our liberties , and I do , we should do everything possible to avoid sacrificing them unnecessarily.

Because the threat of such international action has dire economic consequences , some countries have been reluctant to admit the existence of local flu epidemics.

First of all , the existence of a society as a political " nation " requires as part of its definition an attitude of relationship toward other " nations.

It can do this in a credible manner only if it implies the threat of maximum political organization for this purpose - which is to say that it is organized to some degree for war. War , then , as we have defined it to include all national activities that recognize the possibility of armed conflict , is itself the defining element of any nation 's existence vis-a-vis any other nation. Since it is historically axiomatic that the existence of any form of weaponry insures its use , we have used the word " peace " as virtually synonymous with disarmament.

Strain typing studies show one major strain. BSE can transmit to many species experimentally e.g. sheep , pigs and macaque monkeys. Strain typing studies have confirmed that domestic cats , big cats and exotic ungulates have been infected by eating tainted beef. About 2 years ago a new variant of CJD was recognized in the British population. At the time of writing 39 cases have been confirmed. People have developed this form of CJD at strikingly early ages of 17-55. The neuropathology and early clinical symptoms are also very distinct from classical CJD. The CJD Surveillance Unit at Edinburgh and the committee charged with giving the government recommendations to deal with the threat to human health , SEAC , Spongiform Encepahalopathy Advisory Committee , concluded that the most likely cause is ingestion of infected beef. Strain typing studies of NV-CJD as described above have confirmed that this is very probably the case . </threat.n.2601><threat.n.2602>The development of an inner identity requires the ability to choose attachments worthy of idealization and exploitation.

It is within the area of romance , friendship , and creative productivity that the individual finds room for the kind of independent honesty and courage which permit new truth and right to come into being.

But in number 78 , Publius is trying to score rhetorical points with those who fear the judiciary , and he therefore emphasizes the weakness of the court by emphasizing its independence. Publius goes on to say that the best way of maintaining the independence of the judiciary , and therefore preventing it from become a powerful threat , is the permanent tenure of its judges. In this way it is much less likely the court will have an incentive for collusion with the legislature.

Playing COOPERATE after your play of DEFECT is not a particularly happy move for me -- it results in my next worst payoff -- but it is clearly better than playing DEFECT , which would doom to me to my worst payoff. It seems , therefore , that the strictly rational move is always to let you get away with playing DEFECT. And since you know this just as well as I do , why would you ever take my threats seriously ?

Without a doubt , the practical establishment of this world of struggle would not succeed so completely without the complicity of all of the precarious arrangements that produce insecurity and of the existence of a reserve army of employees rendered docile by these social processes that make their situations precarious , as well as by the permanent threat of unemployment. This reserve army exists at all levels of the hierarchy , even at the higher levels , especially among managers. The ultimate foundation of this entire economic order placed under the sign of freedom is in effect the structural violence of unemployment , of the insecurity of job tenure and the menace of layoff that it implies. The condition of the harmonious functioning of the individualist micro-economic model is a mass phenomenon , the existence of a reserve army of the unemployed . </threat.n.2727><threat.n.2728>Bird-keepers ( pet bird owners and poultry producers ) should be aware that some avian diseases can be transmitted to humans.

Seagrasses like all green plants must have sunlight to grow. Disturbances can be natural , such as hurricanes , algal blooms , or high runoff from rivers during floods. Man-made disturbances include : dredge and fill , nutrient loading , and propeller scarring. Dredging can remove the grasses directly , cover them up by depositing spoil on top of them , and limit light penetration from resulting turbidity. Excessive nutrient loading leads to algal blooms which limit sunlight. Prop scars on an individual basis may seem minimal compared to other threats , but when multiplied by the thousands may be considered a serious impact as well. This threat can be readily addressed by simply changing the way we utilize the shallowest areas of the flats . </threat.n.2732><threat.n.2733>Protection Motivation Theory ( PMT ) ( Rogers , 1983; Prentice-Dunn and Rogers , 1986; Rogers and Prentice-Dunn , 1997 ) provides a model for understanding the contradictory impact of threatening information on BSE by detailing the cognitive processes involved in health decisions. Information about a health threat initiates a threat appraisal and a coping appraisal that then influence the individual 's decision to react adaptively or maladaptively to the information. For example , threat appraisal is influenced by information about the severity of breast cancer and one 's vulnerability to it . </threat.n.2733><threat.n.2734>" Clark 's conclusion has real force and its power has yet to be sufficiently appreciated by fellow Christians , " says the Reverend Andrew Linzey.

An employer is not required to hire or retain an individual who would pose a " direct threat " to health or safety ( see below ) .

Generalized " blanket " exclusions of an entire group of people with a certain disability prevent such an individual consideration. Such class-wide exclusions that do not reflect up-to-date medical knowledge and technology , or that are based on fears about future medical or workers ' compensation costs , are unlikely to survive a legal challenge under the ADA.

The reason for this state of affairs is that when imagination and myths were thrown out with the bathwater , Christianity saved itself as the dominant religion by insisting that its myths were no such thing , but were accurate accounts of historical events. The claim has worn pretty thin by this time , but it has served well to maintain such corrosive myths as the privilege of patriarchy , the divine right of kings , and a whole host of petty tyrants or prophets claiming to be the mouthpiece of God. The threat of being abducted by Faeries was abolished in the Early Modern period , but the threat of Hellfire and damnation has been passed on to the present day among considerable numbers of believers . </threat.n.2741><threat.n.2742>Israel ' s counter-terrorism bureau warned Sunday night of a concrete , high-level threat that the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group planned an attack against Israelis to avenge the February 2008 assassination of Imad Mughniyah , its deputy leader.

For instance , knowing someone might easily call forth amorous , competitive , envious , or empathic aspects of self that then have to be integrated in an organized conversation. Being known by another person also calls forth the matter of having to deal with how that person sees you ( eg , as competitive , envious , inadequate , attractive ) . While such exchanges might result in different experiences if one lives through a monological , barren , or cacophonous self-organization , in each case it seems likely that rich , interpersonal contact would be experienced as a threat and intimacy avoided. And this , in turn , could lead to its own lines of self-experience such as abandonment and alienation , which might complement or even intensify the self-experiences associated with compromised intrapersonal dialogue . </threat.n.2743><threat.n.2744>With General Abernathy in charge , the administrative costs for Sigma 6 were properly routed through the correct secret channels and a significant budget was immediately allocated to face the secret new threat of COBRA.

Harris and Klebold had a history of making threats , but their threats were neither directly communicated nor conditional and , therefore , do not qualify as threats under this factor.237 Consequently , applying the Dinwiddie analysis suggests a threat risk only marginally greater than that posed by Adam Porter and slightly lesser than that posed by heart-broken , rap-loving eighth grader Josh Mahan . </threat.n.2776><threat.n.2777>Al-Qaeda organization.

In the United States , this shift was reflected in questions about which was the more serious , the military threat from the Soviet Union or the economic challenge from Japan. In a series of polls in 1989 and 1990 , most respondents considered the challenge from Japan the more serious. Similarly , poll data from early 1990 showed that most Japanese considered negative United States attitudes toward Japan a reflection of United States anger at " America 's slipping economic position. " Meanwhile , Japanese opinion was showing greater confidence in Japan 's ability to handle its own affairs without constant reference -- as in the past -- to the United States.

These same analysts also must prepare talking points for senior managers , give briefings and attend endless meetings. Often much of their time is spent getting their work into the proper format , dealing with a balky printer or negotiating adverbs -will the situation become " significantly " more serious , or " slightly " more serious ? Talented though these individuals may be -- and managers often assign their most capable analysts to current duties on important accounts -- the pace of work does not permit reflection , research , or the application of methodological techniques that might help them weigh alternative hypotheses in processing new data . </threat.n.2780><threat.n.2781>The lessons learned from the heat wave that overpowered Europe , especially France , during the summer of 2003 are also useful when considering action to be taken in the face of the threat of a major CBR attack.

Kido had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874 , and several proposals that provided for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. The oligarchy , however , while acknowledging the realities of political pressure , was determined to keep control. Thus , modest steps were taken. The Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed Council of Elders ( Genronin ) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The emperor declared that " constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages " as he ordered the Council of Elders to draft a constitution. Three years later , the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority , these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level , and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns.

In view of the very real threat to the West from such militants , who are sworn enemies of the State of Israel , one would have thought that anti-Semitism among conservative Christians would now be a thing of the past. Could its resurgence indicate an unconscious admiration by some conservative Christians for the Islamicists , who are willing and able to go to war in the name of religion albeit by evil and essentially anti-religious means against the same modernity that conservative Christians hate , but feel powerless to effectively oppose ?

Based on the credibility of the threat , the WMDOU will coordinate the appropriate response by federal assets.

Sulla distrusted him , but Lepidus reached the consulship in 78 BC with help from the rising Pompey and by his own considerable popularity. As consul on Sulla 's death he made a bid for personal domination by proposing a popular programme of legislation which undermined the Sullan settlement and appealed to its many opponents. He was opposed by his conservative colleague Catulus , but both consuls were sent to suppress a revolt in Etruria which had been provoked by Lepidus ' propaganda. At this point Lepidus broke with the government , and sided with the rebels. He posed a considerable threat to the regime because of his substantial military support in Cisalpine Gaul ( his province ) , where he had extensive family connections inherited from his grandfather , Lepidus.

As a result , they analyze rape as one of multiple forms of men 's sexual violence and exploitation , looking at their interconnections and how they work in concert to maintain and reinforce women 's oppression. Second , they expand the definition of ' rape ' to encompass more than just overt physical force and violence ( or the explicit threat thereof ) . Recognizing the ways in which broad patterns of male power systematically compromise women 's bodily and sexual freedom , and challenging the equation of female submission with meaningful consent , they tend to see a kind of continuum ( rather than a bright dividing line ) between rape and much normal heterosexual activity.

Were the collective eyes and attention of the CIA on provincial concerns rather than on ballooning clandestine foreign threats to our security ? A real investigation of these matters is required.

A preemptive war or a preemptive strike is a self-defensive measure which is taken against a foreign country that poses an imminent and inevitable threat because it is about to invade , or is threatening to attack shortly. A preventive war is rather a war of choice or a war of aggression that is launched in anticipation of a loss of security or strategic advantage in a more or less far away future , or to gain foreign territories and resources. While a preemptive war is essentially defensive in nature , a preventive war is fundamentally imperialistic. In McCain 's vocabulary , the two notions are confused since he says that he would not rule out launching preemptive wars , when in fact he means launching preventive wars of aggression against future enemies who pose no immediate threat to the United States . </threat.n.2966><threat.n.2967>Step 2 : Use Windows Command Prompt to Unregister Insecure Internet activity.

The only bizarre point is that the threat of Iranian ICBMs to the United States is even more far-fetched. Up to this day , the U.S. , Russia , and China have been the only countries capable of building their own ICBMs. Iran can not even cope with producing medium-range missiles. Its technological level will not allow it to build nuclear-tipped ICBMs even in the distant future. Even if we assume that Iran obtains such missiles somehow , why would it wish to attack the United States ? For all the peculiarities of the Iranian regime , there are no grounds to think that it consists of suicidal fanatics. It is perfectly obvious that a single strike against the United States would cause , quite legally , a massive retaliation that would completely destroy Iran. There are no goals for which the Iranian leaders would pay such a price.

Nonetheless , it is equally clear that there has been a tendency to exaggerate the dimensions of the threat and the strategic impact that terrorist violence has actually wrought.

Much scholarly interest has focused on the increased use of physical incapacitation as a means of exerting regulatory control over , for example , illegal immigrants , pretrial detainees , or the mentally ill.

Because mating is inherently permanent and uncompromising in qualify , the right to dissolve mated attachments can only exist where the development of the ability to mate is at question. Where responsibility for the psychological constructiveness of mating is taken away from the individual and invested in socially reinforced beliefs and institutions , the exposure of the individual to failure can only bring the threat of serious depression.

Because the two worlds are radically disparate in actions , expectations , roles , relationships , morality , order , and predictability , figures of actors and acts look nonordinary and disordered.

These impressments having taken place under aggravated circumstances , have excited , as they ought , a very general indignant feeling.

Under these circumstances rumours of an engagement off our Capes have reached us , which we present to our readers as they follow , barely observing , that it is well understood that the commanders of our public vessels are generally instructed to submit to no question from any foreign vessel which shall wear the semblance of a threat , in manner or words. </threat.n.3053><threat.n.3054>It is suspected that in an unprovoked attack a kayak or a kayaker 's activity in some way lures the predator to believe food will be found or that its territory is being threatened. Kayaks have been known to be upset by an alligator it has " run over " in the mud. It is true , however , that where a natural food source has disappeared for these fellows the danger exist that they will reach out to any available prey. One case in point is Australia 's Lake Macquarie where it appears a change in local commercial fishing rules resulted in an increase of shark sightings with one unprovoked assault capsizing an outrigger canoe. So one thing we will discuss here is how to recognize areas of concern as well as avoid any behavior that may lead predators to false assumptions about us and our kayaks being a threat or on the menu . </threat.n.3054><threat.n.3055>An analysis of the external environment requires more than just a summary of what the competition is doing. The external environment is comprised of two elements -- the societal environment and the industry. The societal environment includes a review of major trends in society affecting organisations across all industries. These trends include political , economic , social and legal. An analysis of the industry takes a look at factors that have a more direct bearing on the business. Hence , in addition to analysing the competition other groups must be similarly evaluated to ascertain that no opportunities or threats within the environment are overlooked ( Buhler 1997 ) . On the other hand , internal situational analysis focuses on the identification of the company ' s distinctive competencies , expected growth , their assets as well as their liabilities. The internal analysis also illustrates the core values of a company , and in what ways can these values be enhanced or beneficial to the market plan ( Cooper 2002 ) .

In the perceptual world the future that is already there in the moving present is built out through the purposive responses of conscious organisms. The distant object thus comes to be what we can do to it or with it or by way of it or what it can do to us. To say that it exists instantaneously as we perceive it is but to demand confirmation of what is given in the perception. These purposive responses are there in the organism both as tendencies and as the results of past responses , and the organism responds to them in its perception.

It might be envisaged that if the state attacked were itself a nuclear state , the response might be of a similar order with the risk of escalation. Control over nuclear proliferation thus becomes an essential instrument in parrying the threat of nuclear terrorism. If , whatever the initial justification ( traditional territorial defence ) , states continue to acquire weapons of this kind , which are , moreover , increasingly becoming easier to develop ( not to mention the whole issue of control , security , stockpiling and means of delivery ) there is an abiding risk of a nuclear warhead one day falling into the hands , directly or indirectly , of a terrorist group . </threat.n.3088><threat.n.3089>Two strikingly different but simultaneously accurate pictures of al-Qaeda have dominated recent discussion of the terrorist group : one , a resilient foe still determined to attack the United States and its interests abroad , and the other , a wounded organization whose leaders are being hunted down and killed.

[ 33 ] Increased regulation does not necessarily enhance security , however , and may undermine it by addressing the wrong threats . </threat.n.3116><threat.n.3117>This paper examines the threat of modern maritime piracy , specifically in Southeast Asia , where the problem has been endemic for hundreds of years. The region has led the world in the number of maritime piracy incidents for the last decade , accounting for 56 of in 1999. Statistics indicate piracy attacks are increasing rapidly both in the numbers of incidents and the violence with which they are executed. Numerous sources responsible for tracking reported attacks estimate there were approximately 1 , 600 actual or attempted incidents internationally in the 10 years with an average cost to the shipping industry of $ 1 billion per year. The cost of piracy is not measured by economics alone , but also is a severe human , political , and environmental threat. Maritime piracy is no longer just a problem for those in the shipping business or in one specific region. It is now a global issue . </threat.n.3117><threat.n.3118>To go back to the " planes not falling out of the sky " argument.

They 'd go to your city , and they 'd say , " Here 's a map of your city. Here 's what 's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.

Thus , most of the specific issues that Wiener dealt with are cases of defending or advancing such values.

Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The shogun 's advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit , more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts , suppression of Rangaku , censorship of literature , and elimination of " luxury " in the government and samurai class. Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of sonno-joi ( revere the emperor , expel the barbarians ) , which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions.

Violence , the word , must be modified and illustrated to be useful for discussion. In this essay violence against animals , plants , and inanimate objects will be distinguished from violence against humans. Violence , unmodified , will always mean direct violence , actual bashing of people , and will be distinguished from the threat of violence , as when laws are passed with violent penalties attached. Also distinguished will be economic violence , as when economic activity leads to physical harm to humans , such as starvation or disease. Other methods of categorizing violence need to be distinguished , such as violent self-defense against violent predation . </threat.n.3257><threat.n.3258>Corruption : As with crime , this threat has remained a non-starter as a singular threat because of its omnipresence -- from the highest to the lowest levels of society.

Significant global campaigns have emerged from within the trade union movement and from the critics of globalization to confront the new global realities ( Hogan &amp;Greene , 2002 ) . However , trade unions remain , for the present , largely nationally institutionalized , and they do not afford much of a threat to existing organization of the relations of production , especially as their recruitment and penetration of the post-industrial services economy is far lower than was the case in the era of industrial labour and society. Also , they are increasingly irrelevant because their leadership is largely male and the domain of their traditional membership female. Thus , the biggest issues that unions face today on the membership front are low female and ethnic minority participation rates such that the people doing the representing rarely share either gender or ethnicity . </threat.n.3261><threat.n.3262>All scriptures in world religions have something to say about the environmental problems caused by such natural disasters as floods , droughts , and earthquakes. God not only creates but also destroys through natural disasters. However , there is little reference in the scriptures to human-caused environmental destruction , except during times of wars and other hostile human engagements. Although most scriptures draw connections between human faith and its ability to bring about action , the idea that human environmental behavior is determined by religious beliefs and values is alien to traditional religious thought. Such a linkage between environmental problems and religion is modern , for traditional civilizations did not pose a threat to life through the pollution engendered by the wasteful use of resources . </threat.n.3262><threat.n.3263>This simplistic and demagogic narrative overlooks the fact that Nazism was based on the military power of the industrially most advanced European state; and that Stalinism was able to mobilize not only the resources of the victorious and militarily powerful Soviet Union but also had worldwide appeal through its Marxist doctrine. In contrast , most Muslims are not embracing Islamic fundamentalism; al Qaeda is an isolated fundamentalist Islamist aberration; most Iraqis are engaged in strife because the American occupation of Iraq destroyed the Iraqi state; while Iran though gaining in regional influence is itself politically divided , economically and militarily weak. To argue that America is already at war in the region with a wider Islamic threat , of which Iran is the epicenter , is to promote a self-fulfilling prophecy . </threat.n.3263><threat.n.3264>If , after weeks of trying , we actually got past the idiot children , we 'd get one of the excuses to do nothing listed below.

The right to scream profane threats at passersby is arguably closer to the text of the First Amendment than is the right to publish on the Internet a statement of political support for a presidential candidate; the former is literally " speech , " while the latter neither employs vocal chords nor a printing press. Yet no one would seriously argue that protection of the latter implies protection of the former. To the extent that talk of penumbras and emanations leads us to think that constitutional interpretation in hard cases is a matter of measuring the distance from the text , it is simply another unsuccessful effort to banish value judgments from constitutional interpretation.

By delineating clear boundaries for school authorities regarding permissible and restricted speech , thereby affording greater freedom to student speech , schools will attain a greater degree of security than is otherwise possible since the free flow of student speech will likely include warning signs that would otherwise go unspoken or remain underground for fear of punishment . </threat.n.3289><threat.n.3290>Given this mixed picture of terrorist patterns and trends and the inherent uncertainty in attempting to predict future terrorist behavior , what should we do or , perhaps more apposite , what can we do to counter effectively the terrorist threat today and in the future ?

FDI and the trade of home and host countries are , as has been noted , generally complementary. In this connection , liberal trade and investment policies boost FDI and strengthen the positive relationship between FDI and trade. In contrast , high tariffs , threats of contingent protection and financial or tax-based subsidies can create strong incentives to substitute investment for trade , including - in the case of countries with large domestic markets relative to their neighbours - for the diversion of investment by neighbouring firms into the protecting country. As is true of all tariff-jumping FDI , such beggar-thy-neighbour investment diversion not only harms other countries , but also adds to the stock of internationally uncompetitive firms in the new host country . </threat.n.3379><threat.n.3380>This trend is also applicable for development of products according the Unified Threat Management ( UTM ) concept , that provide unified approach to preventing different threats , not depending on what protocol or data is processed.

Under stressful conditions , such as , for the Palestinians , the occupation of the Gaza Strip , even adults in a group may use tangible objects in a developmentally regressive ( externalized ) way , or they may establish new suitable reservoirs so as to refortify group bonds. During Israel ' s occupation , for example , many adult Palestinians carried small stones painted with the colors of the Palestinian flag in their pockets ( where they were hidden from Israeli soldiers ) . These stones acted as a shared reservoir and kept aspects of Palestinian large-group identity safe by invisibly maintaining it among group members. To reiterate , under ordinary circumstances , adults abstract and internalize large-group identity and render suitable reservoirs to be ordinary ( like the Scottish kilt for the adult Scot ); in the Palestinians ' case , however , the large group collectively perceived a threat , causing a reactivation of the childhood need to use shared reservoirs for externalization , reservoirs that were not experienced as ordinary but were contaminated with hot affects . </threat.n.3382><threat.n.3383>An additional jus in bello principle covers the moral status of innocent citizens and bystanders.

Nevertheless , the moral status of citizens , including children , of the nation against whom the deterrent threat is issued continues to occupy the attention of moral philosophers.

To succeed in that mission , the commander is responsible for maintaining a trained and ready force. Accordingly , the commander has the inherent authority to take appropriate measures to ensure the readiness , health , safety and protection of the force. ( NOTE : The civilians are not questioning his authority to impose such actions , but they are questioning his rationale.

Attempts to compartmentalize the perceived threat by accepting the fiction that a " political wing " is qualitatively different from a " military wing " are self-defeating. This is a distinction without a difference . </threat.n.3450><threat.n.3451>It follows , from the patterns of human behavior , that the credibility of a social " enemy " demands similarly a readiness of response in proportion to its menace. In a broad social context , " an eye for an eye " still characterizes the only acceptable attitude toward a presumed threat of aggression , despite contrary religious and moral precepts governing personal conduct. The remoteness of personal decision from social consequence in a modern society makes it easy for its members to maintain this attitude without being aware of it. A recent example is the war in Vietnam; a less recent one was the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [ 21 ] In each case , the extent and gratuitousness of the slaughter were abstracted into political formulae by most Americans , once the proposition that the victims were " enemies " was established. The war system makes such an abstracted response possible in nonmilitary contexts as well. A conventional example of this mechanism is the inability of most people to connect , let us say , the starvation of millions in India with their own past conscious political decision-making. Yet the sequential logic linking a decision to restrict grain production in America with an eventual famine in Asia is obvious , unambiguous , and unconcealed . </threat.n.3451><threat.n.3452>Threat-related information must be forwarded to the Office of Student Affairs , or in an imminent situation directly to the Department of Campus Safety.

Deep ocean buoys detected tsunami waves for some hours , as did tide gauges along the coast. The level of threat for south-east Australia was confined to the marine interface and this was communicated well in warnings. For this event , the warning centre only ever issued a marine warning for eastern parts of Australia. That warning was justified. A small tsunami was experienced on the coast with waves up to 55 centimetres larger than the normal tide level. Although this may seem a small wave , tsunami are different to wind-driven waves and have much greater energy because they involve water all the way to the sea floor and for long distances out to sea. So far there have been no reports of damage , but there were unusual currents and waves close to shore , as predicted in the warnings . </threat.n.3455><threat.n.3456>THE AUDIOTAPE attributed to Osama bin Laden that the satellite TV channel Al-Jazeera played yesterday may be valuable as evidence that he is still alive and still exhibiting his megalomania.

It is the quality of stillness. The soul becomes completely quiet , for it has entered into the realm of deaththere to begin the task of learning how to be awake and fully conscious. It is a test. The aim of this test is to find whether the force of love , no longer arising from attachment to things in the day-world , can be born out of the soul itself. In other words , can love arise where there is nothing to love ? 3 According to Sardello , our task in facing the threat of total annihilation is to find a way to regenerate our world , both inner and outer , psychic and physical , through the power of love born not of existential security but of the inescapable presence of annihilation. Here , as well as in the example of Holocaust survivors , the presence of a lethal , traumatizing condition prompts and demands the emergence of an even greater vivifying force. A traumatic condition begs a bio-psychic genesis , an instinctive and spiritual arising of new life . </threat.n.3460><threat.n.3461>Security breaches can occur between mismatched technologies , so when possible , layer your approach to security.

Earlier this year , Congress passed an amendment , the so-called Wyden amendment , which substantially restricts TIA development and deployment. That restriction applies broadly to all programs under development by DARPA. That 's a mistake. The right answer is not for Congress to adopt a blanket prohibition. Rather , Congress should commit to doing the hard work of digging into the details of TIA and examining its operation against the background of existing laws and the existing terrorist threats at home and abroad . </threat.n.3462><threat.n.3463>Vilks said in a telephone interview he received those threats shortly after Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard - who also faced extremist Muslim death threats for his 2005 depictions of Muhammad - was threatened when a Somali man wielding an ax broke into his home in Denmark on Jan. 1.

At its most basic level , it is a danger to the lives and welfare of the populace. Death , injury , or at least trauma to crews and seafarers are usually the result of an attack. Indicative of the recent rise in violence is a particularly brutal incident that took place in 1998.

Anti-Kissingerism is the principal contribution of Neo-Conservatism to American foreign policy. Neo-Conservatives scored their first important triumph challenging Nixon and Kissinger 's realism. The Nixon-Kissinger strategy was aimed at drawing the Soviet Union into a new " structure of peace " through the balance of power with China and exchanging trade for diplomatic and military cooperation. The Kissinger had a secret religious right conspiracy agenda that he implemented without the consent of anti-Semite President Richard Nixon. Neo-Conservative foreign policy rested on illusions about the imminent Soviet threat and the window of vulnerability that would open if the United States did not rapidly accelerate its strategic weapons development. Neo-Conservatives also played a role in postponing rather than accelerating the end of the Cold War , which is not to be confused with the end of the Soviet Union itself. Neo-Conservatives focused on their opposition to Senator George McGovern and President Jimmy Carter and opposed the amoral iconoclast policies of Secretary Kissinger , Secretary Brzezinski and secretary Madeleing Albright , which was very important to their development as a vital Republican political force and their impact on American foreign policy . </threat.n.3552><threat.n.3553>H.E.A.T. comes to the rescue , along with a military unit commanded by Major Hicks , and the two conceive of a trap to capture the Sphinx , while Godzilla engages the stone kaiju in battle.

Guides for implementing early warning signs recommend a core consultation team that includes mental health professionals.

In evaluating early warning signs , collaboration with teachers , staff , and parents is important , especially in developing appropriate intervention strategies. In the case of imminent warning signs or threats , more expedited decisions may require a smaller group of decision-makers; but even here , close communication with community mental health , child service agencies , law enforcement and parents will yield more appropriate and well-considered decisions.

The issue was whether to modify a consent decree that had been entered in 1981 sharply restricting the authority of the Chicago police department to investigate terrorist activity.

The fetish is often an inanimate object a leather boot , a stiletto heel , a PVC corset. According to Freud , the fetish " remains a token of triumph over the threat of castration and a protection against it " ( 154 ) . The fetish object serves to repair the imagined mutilations of the mother; it masks lack , and thus protects the fetishist from his fears of castration. In the Freudian interpretation , when the woman wears the fetish she becomes the " phallic woman " in the fetishist ' s imagination. The fetish provides a magical protection from the horror of castration signified by female genitalia and thus enables the fetishist to maintain a heterosexual orientation that would otherwise be too frightening to contemplate . </threat.n.3712><threat.n.3713>Tuesday was the fourth recent bomb threat reported by school personnel.

Yet if a compelling interest overrides a right in nearly every circumstance in which the right may be exercised , one might as well say that there is no right. One of the main arguments against finding in the Second Amendment an individual right to firearm possession is that such a right would endanger public safety. If a court were to find that , notwithstanding the threat to public safety , the Second Amendment protects an individual right to firearm possession , it is highly unlikely that the same court would go on to find a compelling interest that would justify strong gun control measures. Thus , it makes a great deal of practical difference whether or not the advocates of the individual right view prevail in the courts . </threat.n.3781><threat.n.3782>At least three US federal laws should concern all Americans and suggest what may be coming mandatory vaccinations for hyped , non-existent threats , like H1N1 ( Swine Flu ) .

This is the faded Christianity of modernity that is dressed in the guise of a theology of self in its attempt to claim the soul as exclusively its own.118 What is needed , Hillman implies , is a means of apprehending the soul that allows for its diversity of expression , and a psychology based in a polytheistic paradigm can do just this . </threat.n.3792><threat.n.3793>However , switching costs is moderate for customers giving a breathing space for niche players like eBay to exploit auctioning markets or Wal-Mart to merely use their website to highlight real shopping experience at affordable prices.

This is called the " Contaminant Candidate List " .15 There are primary drinking water regulations which contain enforceable standards to protect public health.

Should the therapist say , for example : " After assessing my patient , who is your live-in partner , I am convinced that he presents a substantial risk to your life. In other words , he could kill you. " ? Would the potential victim be helped or unnecessarily shocked if the therapist quoted the patient 's threats or other statements that substantiated the risk ? Rather than just paraphrasing the patient 's threat or giving an absolutistic warning ( e.g. , " Your life is endangered. " ) , conveying estimated degree of risk ( high , medium , low ) may be helpful. Should the therapist offer any advice about self-protective measures ? Or does it suffice simply to state , " I believe John Doe is a danger to you. " But then how should the therapist respond to questions evoked by such a chilling warning ? The best practices for how clinicians should issue warnings is an important topic that warrants more discussion than current space allows , but now we shall see that warning the victim of the risk is by no means the universal standard for discharging a protective duty via a warning . </threat.n.3915><threat.n.3916>Terrorist groups seeking to secure full Puerto Rican independence from the United States through violent means represent one of the remaining active vestiges of left-wing terrorism. While these groups believe that bombings alone will not result in change , they view these acts of terrorism as a means by which to draw attention to their desire for independence. During the 1970s and 1980s numerous leftist groups , including extremist Puerto Rican separatist groups such as the armed forces for Puerto Rican National Liberation ( FALN -- Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional Puertorriquena ) , carried out bombings on the U.S. mainland , primarily in and around New York City.

Without something else , such as a threat , a person does not have a right to be warned just because the person asked to be warned and , therefore , the clinician has no duty to issue a warning. A more appropriate clinical response would be to inquire about the basis for the person 's concern and then follow up with the appropriate risk or threat assessment to be repeated before the patient is released The anxious individual may believe she or he has a right to be warned , however , and the clinician may share this belief , and also believe that he or she has a duty to warn. Such assumptions do not correspond to actual legal requirements and accepted clinical standards. At least in the case of requested warnings , however , there is no guessing as to whether the would-be victim wants to be warned. Similarly , the clinician can readily imagine that the victim or the victim 's family will have wanted to be warned afterward if the feared individual is released from confinement and then harms the victim . </threat.n.3939><threat.n.3940>Sure the site was a bit ratty , but clearly it wasn ' t a real threat to kill someone.

Because the would-be victim already feels endangered , no notification that the subject is dangerous to her or him is needed; rather the person simply wants to know when the subject is released into the community and would therefore be free to attack the victim. To what extent the would-be victim 's request for advanced warning of the subject 's release is formal or in writing is undoubtedly variable. In some cases , the clinician may simply respond to the victim 's obvious fear and promise notification out of a sense of compassion and desire to protect. Yet , the agreement itself could trigger a legal duty to protect not yet fully acknowledged in Tarasoff jurisprudence concerning clinicians , the legal basis for which is illustrated in the following case not involving a clinician . </threat.n.3945><threat.n.3946>National Security Emergencies In addition to the natural and technological hazards described in this publication , Americans face threats posed by hostile governments or extremist groups.

The hypothesis that any given society will be better able to preserve its democracy without an individual right to firearms than it can with one can not be proven in any strict sense. Nonetheless , the factors identified above suggest that this is the safer bet. Although there are recent examples of democracy giving way to military rule in our own hemisphere , typically it was the existence of armed revolutionaries or the perceived threat of disorder that was used as a justification for the coup. It is therefore quite possible that a formal right of firearms ownership would have only increased the frequency of these occurrences. In any event , the fragility of Latin American democracy in the twentieth century seems much more a product of weak traditions of civilian control over the military than a product of the status of firearms rights.
