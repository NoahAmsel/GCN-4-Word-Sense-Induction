In the westernmost Sable Subbasin , sedimentation took place primarily above listric growth faults , where more than 2.5 km of shale dominated strata were encountered by Evangeline H-98. For the first time , shelf clastic systems also prograded beyond the edge of the Jurassic shelf NW of Parcels 1 and 2 , renewing sediment input into deepwater from this direction. Recognition of several broad slope canyons is consistent with sediment input from both the Sable Subbasin region and from across the NW Abenaki margin. Thin-skinned extension associated with increased sedimentation on the upper slope near Evangeline was balanced down-slope by contraction.

Since to calculate its value precisely is NP-hard , it is important to obtain the bounds of the all-terminal reliability efficiently. In this paper , we propose the polynomial time algorithm that can derive the lower bound by transforming any graph to the graph in which the degree of all the nodes is more than two and by using of edge-packing.

The deepest of the submarine canyons easily rival the size of the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River in Arizona. Sometimes , submarine canyons begin at the outer edge of the continental shelf. Most often , they form down-current from major rivers that flow into an ocean. Geologists believe that some submarine canyons may have been carved during a time in Earth 's past when sea levels were lower than at present , and rivers were able to flow out to the edge of the shelf.

If both endpoints of a contracted edge are terminals , then the contraction reduces the number of terminals by one. As soon as we reach a situation with only one terminal , we are done.

Industrial grade diamonds , though similar in hardness to gemstone quality diamonds , are typically the by-product of the diamond mining industry. Their quality is inferior only due to flaws , color inconsistencies , or other characteristics that render them unsuitable for jewelry. Also , in the process of cutting and polishing gemstones significant waste is produced. These are the diamonds that become abrasives. When crushed to a fine powder they form perfectly irregular edges that serve ideally as cutting edges and being harder than any other substance they hold those edges longer than any other material. This diamond powder is what does the actual work of sharpening . </edge.n.102><edge.n.103>with being the portion of the GR boundary associated to node I and the summation extends over the two boundary edges connected to node I.

On condition 3 , the dull bevel , this is fairly straightforward. Bevel formation is finished as soon as the entire length of the edge passes the thumbnail test or the shave arm hair test. The thumb pad test also can be used , but this test is more demanding of skillful interpretation. With conditions 1 , 2 and 4 things are more complicated. The edge may yield false readings on all those tests. Experienced honers have a fair idea of the bevel condition , upon rehoning their own razors. They know if they should expect a degree of convexing , and the approximate amount of work it ' ll take. For those that have no idea what kind of work to expect , dulling the edge just enough to loose all ambiguous readings greatly simplifies the plan of action. Once the razor starts out , even barely , dull enough to duck the tests , we only need to work on a bevel-setting hone , till it passes the tests , as described above . </edge.n.123><edge.n.124>Let ' s apply these ideas to mowing and trimming a lawn.

One etching operation is used to form an opening through the plurality of dielectric layers to expose a portion of the underlying substrate between the two die. Subsequently , a top dielectric layer of the plurality of dielectric layers is used as a mask to form a doped region in the substrate through the opening followed by forming metal layers on the doped region and abutting outside edges of the dielectric layers that are exposed within the opening.

Carroll has thus far failed to engage Behe ' s actual arguments. Carroll does make an attempt to tackle the origin of a couple complex biological features. Yet these attempts fail because they confuse the evidence for common descent from sequence similarity with evidence for natural selection.

From a logical perspective , Courcelle 's theorem establishes a sufficient condition , or an upper bound , for tractability of MSO-model checking. Whereas such upper bounds on the complexity of logics have received significant attention in the literature , almost nothing is known about corresponding lower bounds. In this paper we establish a strong lower bound for the complexity of MSO. In particular , we show that if C is any class of graphs which is closed under taking sub-graphs and whose tree-width is not bounded by a poly-logarithmic function in fact , log^c n , for some small c suffices then MSO-model checking is intractable on C under a suitable assumption from complexity theory.

The computational system deals with several connected domains and both isotropic and anisotropic meshes ( i.e. directionally stretched meshes ) . In this work , only isotropic triangular meshes were considered and generated through the advancing front technique ( Peraire et al. , 1987 ) , with the concepts of using a background grid to define the spacing , gradation and directionality of the mesh and of generating simultaneously points and triangles during the triangulation. As any conventional unstructured mesh generator the mesh data delivered consists of the physical coordinates simply listed by node numbers and a list of the connectivity of each element ( topological information ) . Our mesh generator gives also a list of boundary edges connectivities , which are very helpful for the implementation of certain boundary conditions . </edge.n.218><edge.n.219>Submissions by Confuzzled : Choose below  A Confuzzled.tk Short !

We consider one tree node at a time and route all given demands through the network in that node. If two paths intersect in an edge , two new subproblems are generated one of which no longer allows the demand of the first path to use this edge while the other one does so with the other demand.

Our approach is distinct in its use of multiple multilevel features in the required processing. Adaptation is provided by a careful analysis of these multilevel features , based on shot variability. We consider three levels of adaptation : at the feature extraction stage using locally-adaptive edge maps , at the video sequence level , and at the individual shot level. We show how to provide adaptive parameters for the multilevel edge-based approach , and how to determine adaptive thresholds for the shot boundaries based on the characteristics of the particular shot being indexed. The result is a fast adaptive scheme that provides a slightly better performance in terms of robustness , and a five fold efficiency improvement in shot characterization and classification. The reported work has applications beyond direct video indexing , and could be used in real-time applications , such as in dynamic monitoring and modeling of video data traffic in multimedia communications , and in real-time video surveillance.

The etching agent may be selectively chosen according to the material of the deposition film to etch. Examples of etching agents may include , without limitation , ionized NF3 , O2 , F2 , or SF6. To prevent the diffusion of the etching agent toward a central region of the substrate 220 , the purge gas source 208 provides an inert gas that enters the process volume 216 via the second entry port 210 and gas conduit 280B , and then flows radially on the top surface of the substrate 220 from its central region toward its peripheral edge region. Suitable inert gases may include , without limitation , Ar or He. The radial flow of the inert gas acts to limit the action area of the etching agent to the peripheral region of the substrate 220 . </edge.n.372><edge.n.373>The Sophie measures 3.5 " inches wide.

Saturation refers to the dominance of hue in the color. On the outer edge of the hue wheel are the 'pure ' hues. As you move into the center of the wheel , the hue we are using to describe the color dominates less and less. When you reach the center of the wheel , no hue dominates. These colors directly on the central axis are considered desaturated. These desaturated colors constitute the grayscale; running from white to black with all of the intermediate grays in between. Saturation , therefore , is the dimension running from the outer edge of the hue wheel ( fully saturated ) to the center ( fully desaturated ) , perpendicular to the value axis ( Figure 9 ) . In terms of a spectral definition of color , saturation is the ratio of the dominant wavelength to other wavelengths in the color. White light is white because it contains an even balance of all wavelengths . </edge.n.412><edge.n.413>The unique Chef sChoice EdgeSelect Diamond Hone Sharpener is designed so that you may sharpen each knife according to your intended use , such as gourmet food preparation , butchering , dressing of game or filleting of fish. You can sharpen knives with either straight or serrated edges. This three ( 3 ) stage sharpener has two percision conical sharpening/honing stages with fine 100 dimaond abrasives and one polilshing/stropping stage using proprietary flexible abrasive disks. These stages can be used in different sequences to give you either an astonishingly sharp , smooth faceted edge for effortless cutting and presentations or one with a selected amount of residual " bite " along the facets. The edge is ultra sharp and non-serrated. This residual " bite " is created by precisely polished micro flutes that are formed on the facet surface by the ultra honing action of the stropping disks in Stage 3. You will find that these sharo flutes on each side of the ultra sharp and non-serrated cutting edge aid substantially in those difficult sutting chores expereinced with fibrous foods , meats , stalky vegetables , dressingn of game or household chores such as cutting cardboard , leather , carpet , etc . </edge.n.413><edge.n.414>Product Manufacturing Information ( PMI ) Version 19 delivers the functionality needed to produce 3D-annotated designs in compliance with world standards such as ASME Y14.41.

According to the step jump characteristic of the image edge gray degree and grads , it can determine the pixel boundary of the CCD image through edge automatic detecting algorithm. Based on this , we can use the polynomial fitting method to make sub-pixel subdivision of the edge position of the image , and carry out polynomial fitting of the edge signal. Finally , use the least square method to compare the second order curve which is obtained by fitting with the threshold level , and then use it to get the formula. We can use the formula to work out the accurate position of the edge point , thereby achieve the sub-pixel edge positioning precision. The experimental results and analysis show that , compared with the threshold level comparison method , the straight line fitting method has more advantages , such as high repeated precision , good stability and so on. It can restrain the influence of random noise effectively , so it can detect the edge position of one-dimensional image effectively . </edge.n.450><edge.n.451>Welcome to Alpine Base and Edges Toko Ergo Speed " TOP " Ski Edge Sharpener The Toko Ergo Speed " Top " is a small , handy tool for sharpening beveled side edges at 1 or 2 .

In the photo above , you will see that the stone angle is steeper than the edge angle. If you want to duplicate the factory angle , adjust the stone to match. For this we like to use a Sharpie and stain the edge. Then we stroke a 1000-Grit Ultra Fine Water Stone or Polish Tape very lightly along the edge to mark where the stone or polishing touches the edge. Using this method , it is easy to duplicate the factory edge.

Thus , upgrading all of the cell sites in a major city takes only a few weeks , allowing operators to launch EDGE services quickly.

In A-2 , the hardening process forms carbide particles in the steel which has a high wear resistance. It will stay sharp longer than that of other steels , but it will require you to sharpen it at usually no less than a 35 degree bevel angle in order to maintain an edge that won ' t fail. In other words , If you attempt bevels of 30 degrees or less with A-2 , the effect will often result in the edge failing and crumbling. This is due to the very carbides that form to make it wear resistant. It also takes longer to sharpen than High Carbon , or O-1 Steel. As such , this steel is not the best choice for low bevel angles where paring is desired. A-2 is far better lasting where the tooling will be struck with a hammer like in mortising , or for people who prefer a lot of chopping with their bench chisels , or when used to plane in abrasive woods like many tropical hardwoods . </edge.n.585><edge.n.586>Take your character 's power and add the power of each edge between you and the target.

In this case , the nozzle orifice is offset from the edge of the wafer by about 1.5 to 4.5 millimeters. This embodiment is particularly effective at eliminating streaking and reducing the taper of the wafer. The angular and translational positions of the nozzle can be controlled using conventional actuators , such as screw actuators . </edge.n.668><edge.n.669>Classically , Edge detection algorithms are implemented on software.

That 's because commercial edge banding requires no clamping , produces no glue squeeze-out , and is less noticeable than solid strips that are 1/4 " -or-so thick.

It 's always more interesting when relationships are one-sided rather than two-sided. For example , if Knight and Aliana both love each other , that 's less interesting than if Knight loves Aliana and she does n't care about him ( or hates him ! ) .

It can be difficult to know the exact quality of the steel. Some knifemakers declare what quality of steel they use in their production , while others do not. The main issue is really : is my knife blade stainless steel or not ? It is a question of the hardness of the blade. Non-stainless steel is softer and must as a rule have a steeper angle to its whetting edge if it is to retain its sharpness , whereas a stainless steel blade is harder and can tolerate a lower angle. Special steel can take a very shallow grinding angle. This is a simple way of trying to find out the quality of your own knife - but of course it is not the whole story. Steel can have many different qualities and be tempered in different ways , and this is a whole science in itself.

The bevels are at 90 degrees to the plane of the cutting surface. The bevels are no more than 0.25 to 0.35mm in width. When the cutter is closed the bevels form a V-shaped groove along the length of the cutting edge. This beveling results in a fine but very rugged interface between the two edges. In many applications a semi-flush Tronex cutter can produce hundreds of thousands of cuts before resharpening is necessary. However the lead or wire being cut will have a raised surface , or " pinch " , exactly in the shape of the V-shaped groove . </edge.n.822><edge.n.823>Tons of people have hit on this and I want to join the chorus : doing this at the Knesset was gravely wrong.

It has EDGE for data as well as 3G , and the faster HSDPA flavor at that. It 's sold unlocked , which means you can use it with any carrier 's SIM. HTC 's network settings wizard detected our two SIM cards ( T-Mobile and AT &amp;T ) and offered to create the correct settings for each. No need to find APN , MMS server and other settings and enter them yourself -- nice. You will have to remember to turn off HSPDA if your carrier does n't offer it or if you 're not in an HSDPA coverage area. This is a somewhat odd device to use for voice calls given the distinctly non-phone ergonomics. That said , voice quality is excellent and signal strength on the 850 and 1900MHz bands is quite good. If you make or receive a call with no wired or Bluetooth headset connected , the Advantage uses speakerphone mode , which is both louder and clearer than most phones.

( DHG ) is subject to investment risk. Short sales - which involve selling borrowed securities in anticipation of a price decline , then returning an equal number of the securities at some point in the future - could magnify losses and increase volatility. Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate and credit risks. When interest rates rise , bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investments in lower-quality and non-rated securities present greater risk of loss than investments in higher-quality securities. Stocks may decline in value. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity , leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increased volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses . </edge.n.840><edge.n.841>Cutting Edge Laser by Summerwood cuts out parts for manufacturing ID plates , whole products and joining parts.

This is thought to be the ideal geometry and serves as a reference for this study. Contact height is calculated for when the cutting edge is flush with the sole ( ie. zero depth of cut ) . The contact height is a measure of how well the plane can support the blade. If the force at the cutting edge is causing the blade to rotate or bend around the contact point then a lower contact height will reduce the torque and therefore reduce the bending. Contact height is also a measure of how well the blade can support the edge because a lower contact height means more blade metal behind the cutting edge . </edge.n.845><edge.n.846>decorate , pie , edges , crust , roped , fluted , forked , leaf Once the dough is in the pie pan , trim the edges with kitchen shears to leave a 1-inch overhang.

This phenomenon often results in the separation of species over time as they become more specialized to their edge of the niche , called niche differentiation. The species do not have to be in separate habitats however to avoid niche overlap.

However , the linear chopper guitine style did not crack any components including those placed 0.025 " off the score edge.

Admittedly , the character options are a mixed bag , but it must be remembered just how complex a thing the human voice is , and that what TC-Helicon are attempting is extremely ambitious. Despite this sort of technology still being in its infancy , the Voice Pro 's Character processing can , if used with care , produce some very convincing results that will make a vocalist appear bigger or smaller , and certainly transform them far enough to sound like a different singer. The Breath and Growl effects certainly need to be used sparingly , but they can add a little edge to a voice.

Now we increase the cost of each of these conflicting edges by a certain amount and subsequently we start the next iteration which computes shortest paths with respect to these new edge costs. As the former conflict edges are now more expensive , they have a tendency to be avoided by the new shortest paths.

With no odds , you must win about 1.4 percent more than the statistically expected number of line bets to see daylight. Taking single odds ( $ 10 odds , $ 10 line ) , 0.8 percent over the expected win rate zeroes out. At double odds ( $ 20 odds , $ 10 line ) , the necessary deviation drops to 0.55 percent. Triple odds ( $ 30 odds , $ 10 line ) lowers it to around 0.4 percent. And five-times odds ( $ 50 odds , $ 10 line ) only requires an upshift around 0.3 percent from expected results to overcome the edge.

Once an image has been acquired and cropped to a region of interest , the image is filtered and Canny edge detection [ 59 ] is used to identify the aliasing boundary. Pixels with gradients at points of local maxima , that meet specified threshold requirements , are linked to form a set of edge records , and edges that are less than a specified number of pixels in length are removed. In the automation process , which is described in the next chapter , corrections are performed to join or trim edges so as to avoid identification errors. An automated task is then used to extract the edge corresponding to the aliasing boundary from the set of edge records. To identify the aliasing boundary , points on each edge record are inspected to determine if a blue/red colour shift , corresponding to the aliasing boundary , is present in the original image. Once identified , the dimensions of the PISA envelope are returned so that flow rate can be calculated. To perform image processing on clinical images , the images are first be rotated so that the flow direction is parallel to the vertical axis . </edge.n.978><edge.n.979>Every Ford Edge comes with a 3.5-liter V6 rated for 265 hp and 250 pound-feet of torque.

In this excellent investigation into the state of the Republican Party , he credits Newt Gingrich for the deft organizational skills that led to the Republican resurgence with the takeover of the House after decades of Democratic control. The Republicans maintain their edge , in no small part , through pork-barrel politics and redistricting , tactics that Republicans complained about when the Democrats did the same. The author shows that the edge has been bolstered by Bush 's post-9/11 foreign policy ( despite failings of the Iraq war ) , the increasing conservative judicial rulings of all courts , and small-government , low-tax policies. Despite this , Taylor concludes that the Republican Party will not achieve the dominance for which it aims because of the flexibility of the Democratic Party to adapt to its constituents ' needs , the deteriorating conditions in Iraq , and growing fissures in an overconfident Republican Party.

A slanted part 353 of the upper surface of the upper arm 350 is slanted diagonally upward such that it faces the radial inner edge of the curved belt 200 , and the upward elastic return of the upper arm 350 is regulated by the contact between this slanted part 353 and the lower surface 331 of the upper guide member 330 . </edge.n.1026><edge.n.1027>As far as Competition goes , our system has proven to be extremely efficent.

The more base edge bevel , the easier it will be to pivot or slide from side to side. Once you set the base edge angle , you ca n't go back to the original because of the base material. If the skis hook up on turns , increase the bevel by a quarter or half degree. Side edge beveling will give the skis more grip on the snow surface. Higher angles should be reserved for experienced racers; if the angle is too high the ski can " rail out " on a less experienced racer. Typical angles are 1.0 to 3.0 degrees. Less angle equals less grip. Slalom angles can be 3.0 to 5.0 degrees; downhill up to 3.0 degrees. A racer should start at 3 degrees.

It can bend or deform , it can chip , or it can abrade or wear away. The first two cause premature loss of sharpness , making a freshly sharpened edge perform badly after only a few cuts. I consider deformation and chipping to be edge failure , in contrast to loss of sharpness due to abrasion. Abrasion happens more slowly and allows the blade to perform well for a considerable amount of work. Since no material exists that will hold an edge that never dulls , loss of sharpness due to abrasion is as good as it gets . </edge.n.1103><edge.n.1104>If you 'd like to know more about Edge and what we 're doing and receive our quarterly newsletter , simply fill in your details. * Required </edge.n.1104><edge.n.1105>After he experienced " The Ultimate Challenge " at WrestleMania VI from a seat in Toronto 's SkyDome and saw his hero Hulk Hogan battle Ultimate Warrior , Edge swore to one day headline WrestleMania.

Doubling , you have an edge with the hand as dealt using next best alternative usually hitting but in cases like ace-seven versus six , standing; doubling then gives you a greater edge. When splitting pairs , three situations may occur. 1 ) The initial hand has an advantage , the split pair more so. 2 ) The initial hand is at a disadvantage , the split pair is at an advantage. 3 ) The initial hand is at a disadvantage , the split pair is also unfavorable but less so . </edge.n.1126><edge.n.1127>Compatible ANT+ wireless power meters can communicate with the Edge 500 to relay valuable data on how hard the rider is working.

This method of locating an edge is characteristic of the " gradient filter " family of edge detection filters and includes the Sobel method. A pixel location is declared an edge location if the value of the gradient exceeds some threshold. As mentioned before , edges will have higher pixel intensity values than those surrounding it. So once a threshold is set , you can compare the gradient value to the threshold value and detect an edge whenever the threshold is exceeded. Furthermore , when the first derivative is at a maximum , the second derivative is zero. As a result , another alternative to finding the location of an edge is to locate the zeros in the second derivative.

Another , more systematic way , to find better solutions , is to perform k-swaps instead of two-swaps. A k-swap removes k edges and glues the resulting k subsequences again together in any of the ( k - 1 ) ! different possible ways. In the given example , the optimum solution is obtained by a three-swap : remove the edges ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 4 , 8 ) and ( 3 , 7 ) and replace them by ( 1 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) and ( 8 , 7 ) . </edge.n.1173><edge.n.1174>Santa Clara University  s seventh Annual GSBI competition will open on Social Edge on Jan 6.

Operation 304 is typically carried out at about 150-400 rpm , more preferably 200 to 250 rpm for 200 mm wafer and 175 to 225 rpm for 300 mm wafers . This rate of rotation helps ensure that the entire edge exclusion area is covered by the EBR etchant. It is preferred to maintain the same pre-rinse and EBR speed to prevent the wafer from slipping off the support pins and de-centering during any acceleration/deceleration. During these operations the wafer is not held at a centering position. The rate of change in rotational velocity prior to the EBR step results in movement of the wafer on the support pins. Pins with greater friction coefficent are preferred as long as they do not flake or generate particles. Therefore , this parameter should also be controlled. It is preferred that the rate exceed about 150 rpm/sec when using typical plastic support pins ( e.g. PPS or PVDF ) . </edge.n.1176><edge.n.1177>Other Cutting Edge F/X can be applied to the base mesh object with nice results.

Our focus is on making each player faster in every skating skill required to play the game of hockey. Hockey is a transitional game. Skaters are continuously challenged to make adjustments in positioning , balance , stride and edge control. At Edge Advantage we concentrate on the athletic principles within each skill. An example of this is in our focus to make the skater faster when stopping. When a skater is able to apply proper positioning of the feet , the stick and loading of the legs when stopping , they automatically put themselves in a position to produce explosive starts. This means they are faster when stopping. Not coming to a stop , but stopping for a fast paced transitional game. Remember skating is not the game ... . hockey is the game . </edge.n.1179><edge.n.1180>In order to compute the edge fluxes described by Eqs.

Variation in film overlay in the edge exclusion region can lead to yield-limiting defects. Edge Bead Removal ( EBR ) metrology or Edge Exclusion Width ( EEW ) metrology describes a topside surface measurement of the wafer edge exclusion region relative to the wafer center and the wafer edge. This measurement is typically made at several points along the wafer 's edge and often ranges between 0 mm and 6 mm in width. In photolithography , EBR metrology data can be used to determine the repeatability of wafer alignment and the accuracy of EBR dispensing nozzles on the coat track . </edge.n.1184><edge.n.1185>To change the collar on this vest , I knew I ' d have to change the body of the garment as well.

This is a key aspect of ST; you can dimensionally or parametrically drive part shapes and sizes , but without the overhead of a history tree. Driving , locked dimension values are red , and they control the size , orientation , and location of an element. Their value is not changed when a connected face is resized or moved. Driven , unlocked dimension values are blue and dependent on the value of other dimensions or elements. The unlocked value is controlled by the element it refers to , or by a user-defined formula or variable. When faces connected to a dimensioned edge are modified , the unlocked dimension value changes.

As acutance is related to image sharpness , one possible approach to image enhancement is to apply enhancement techniques in such a way as to increase the acutance of the ROI. Then , we may expect the perceived sharpness of the ROI to be increased as a result. A new image sharpening method designed on the basis of acutance is proposed in this paper. In this method , one-dimensional operators are applied to sets of pixels along the normals at each boundary pixel of an ROI. It is shown that the method can improve sharpness without creating significant artifacts . </edge.n.1319><edge.n.1320>However , in general terms , the " edge " typically denotes the point at which traffic exits the " core network " .

Razors have to be rinsed with clear water and thoroughly dried after each use. When not in use for longer periods , it is recommended that the razor be rubbed with light oil. Likewise , the razor should not be stored in a damp and unaired state. There is no generally valid rule for the whetting ( stropping ) of straight razors; in many cases , it is sufficient to draw the razor lightly over the ball of the thumb , especially when it has been left unused for several days between shaves. Wet shavers of the old school know that the facet ( blade ) " grows " , i.e. the microscopically discernible and extremely fine " fin " on the cutting edge changes during the shave but returns to its old position afterwards; it stretches and again becomes extremely fine.

" A modest , even parsimonious , beginning , " Paul Conkin says ( F.D.R. and the Origins of the Welfare State ) , but the sight of federally subsidized housing projects , playgrounds , vermin-free apartments , replacing dilapidated tenements , was refreshing. The TVA suggested exciting possibilities for regional planning to give jobs , improve areas , and provide cheap power , with local instead of national control. The Social Security Act gave retirement benefits and unemployment insurance , and matched state funds for mothers and dependent children-but it excluded farmers , domestic workers , and old people , and offered no health insurance.

It 's fine to weaken something that is already well-weakened ( creating , for example , " Cyborgs ! ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Emma Craven ( Joanne Whalley in her first starring role ) is a young environmental activist killed in mysterious circumstances. Emma 's father Ron Craven ( Bob Peck in a star-making performance ) will not be silenced and , as a police detective , is uniquely positioned to pursue his own unofficial investigation. He moves from grief to a determination to find the truth , all the while advised and comforted by Emma , but is she a ghost or a manifestation of his haunted psyche ? Craven digs deeper , uncovering labyrinthine conspiracy in the nuclear industry and , as the body-count rises , encounters the garrulous CIA agent Darius Jedburgh ( a superb Joe Don Baker ) with a mysterious agenda of his own.

This installment of Bridget 's journal finds her dealing with the growing pains of a new relationship with Mark Darcy , her crush from the first film ( stilted but passionate Colin Firth ) . Though wildly in love with him , Bridget , a TV producer , worries off and on that Mark and his stuffy attorney crowd may not be quite her cup of tea. When she attends an important law function as Mark 's date , she manages to embarrass herself and offend his snobby colleagues. To top it off , Mark 's gorgeous and willowy coworker Rebecca ( Jacinda Barrett ) seems to have a knack for showing up at just the wrong time. To further complicate matters , her cute and caddish former love Daniel Cleaver ( Hugh Grant ) asks her to join him on-location in Thailand for a TV shoot -- another chance at romance for Bridget Jones . </edge.n.1389><edge.n.1390>Most lines will work with groups-often at reduced rates-depending on how many people are involved.

When in normal forward flight , the air flow over the wings , indicated by the arrows 16 splits at the leading edge of the wing into air flowing past the upper surface ( arrows 161 ) and air flowing past the lower surface ( 1611 ) . Between these is a point where the air neither passes over nor under the wing known as an attachment point , which is at a relatively high pressure. The locus of the attachment points spanwise along the leading edge defines the attachment line which is indicated by the dotted line 18 in FIG. 1. Air impinging on the leading edge of the wing also tends to move spanwise along the wing in the direction of sweep. Such flow may be laminar but may become turbulent due to discontinuities at the wing root or at a pylon , or simply due to small surface discontinuities or debris on the wing leading edge . </edge.n.1453><edge.n.1454>6.

The hold percentage is the ratio of chips the casino keeps to the total chips sold. This is generally measured over an entire shift. For example if blackjack table x takes in $ 1000 in the drop box and of the $ 1000 in chips sold the table keeps $ 300 of them ( players walked away with the other $ 700 ) then the game 's hold is 30 . If every player loses their entire purchase of chips then the hold will be 100 . It is possible for the hold to exceed 100 if players carry to the table chips purchased at another table. A mathematician alone can not determine the hold because it depends on how long the player will sit at the table and the same money circulates back and forth. There is a lot of confusion between the house edge and hold , especially among casino personnel . </edge.n.1490><edge.n.1491>The EDGE has been in our system for several weeks now , and my wife and I love its performance.

As you might expect , the quality of the SD channels ranges somewhere between tolerable and miserable when viewed on the large screen , so we hoped to see improvement there. We were not disappointed , and in fact were genuinely surprised to see how much the EDGE improves SD image quality.

But when the action hits , it 's all serious and plenty exciting.

While it is generally a straightforward matter to shield unwanted areas from an electroplating solution , the same kind of shielding can not be so easily and precisely done with PVD.

This is quite simple and an easy , effective " add on. " The sharper the original radius , the more effective the modification will be. For example , Steve Wittman gained some 10 mph on his " Tailwind " with a " sharp " original leading edge , whereas on a Zodiac CH-600 , which already had a blunt nose , the gain was negligible. Note that this " drooped " nose also increases the curvature and , unless it is movable , there will be a drag penalty in cruise ( small angle of attack ) . Note also that this modification alters the wing chord and as a result the center of gravity range so be careful . </edge.n.1495><edge.n.1496>The direction of the background or large-scale mantle flow ( or similarly , the differential motion of the continent-craton relative to the upper mantle ) can retard or wipe out an EDC instability. King &amp;Anderson ( 1998 , Figure 3 ) show that large-scale mantle flow that moves from the oceanic plate toward the craton can overwhelm the upwelling return part of the EDC cell , effectively wiping out the EDC flow. The EDC upwelling will separate into distinct , 3D quasi-cylindrical upwellings. When aligned with plate motion , as in the case of the Bermuda swell discussed by Vogt ( 1991 ) , it is possible that the upwelling planform would be more of an elongate upwelling ( i.e. , sheet ) perpendicular to the direction of plate motion. The shape of the observed seismic velocity anomaly beneath Iceland ( Foulger et al. , 2000 , 2001 ) is consistent with the shape expected from EDC flow generated by the Greenland and/or European craton edges; however , there are no fast seismic velocity anomalies in the upper mantle tomography models of the North Atlantic region below these craton boundaries . </edge.n.1496><edge.n.1497>... any database on iPhone.

This is then rounded to the nearest value represented in the array , and the corresponding entry in the histogram array is incremented. Thus each point in the edge map transforms into a number of points in the quantised [ r , q ] space , or we can say that each point " votes " for a number of lines . </edge.n.1638><edge.n.1639>One of the main difficulties involves the precise application of the etchant to the edge bevel region without allowing it to contact the active circuit region of the wafer. Physical shielding of the active circuit region is an option , but it is undesirable because contacting the wafer in this manner causes particle generation from the surface of the wafer. In addition , it is highly desirable to apply the etchant in a very narrow , confined region at the outer boundary of the wafer , so that the interior active circuit region is defined as expansively as possible. Other difficulties in designing an etching method and system include precise alignment of the wafer on the wafer chuck for rotation , proper pre-wetting , rinsing and drying procedures , and adequate clamping of the wafer in situations where undesired movement is possible. Since backside etching of the wafer is often necessary and desirable at the time of edge bevel removal ( EBR ) , an invention addressing these needs should also be able to perform the back side etch . </edge.n.1639><edge.n.1640>Also , along the edge of the woods and on the sides of the larger barn are bat houses.

O'Rourke displayed a class of triangles requiring 2n/7 edge guards for full domination. These classes of triangulations , however , can not be realized as polygons which actually require that many edge guards. In all known cases , realization would require the polygons to self-cross in order to impose the same visiblity restrictions as implied by the combinatorial domination of the triangulation . </edge.n.1733><edge.n.1734>Gudauri Heliski : For 2010 the edge is focusing heliski operations around Gudauri ski-resort , Mt.Kazbegi and Svaneti areas.

Edges only appear between two vertices that are in two different partitions. So , at most one vertex from each partition ( of the n vertices ) could be in a clique of the graph. Therefore , to find a clique of size k , there will be nk possible ways for choosing the clique vertices. For each possible way , the algorithm needs O ( k2 ) time to check if it constructs a clique of size k. Therefore , this gives an algorithm of time O ( nkk2 ) for the maximum common subgraph problem. We call this algorithm ALG-COMMON SUBGRAPH for the convenience of the following discussion . </edge.n.1738><edge.n.1739>Next , determine how deep the recess will be.

Then , with a T-bevel set to the sole angle of the dovetail plane , scribe a line from this bottom corner up to the face. This establishes the shape of the joint at the back edge.

Effective on large wire and for light usage. When the rivet joint loosens the hand shear must be discarded.

A dark , brooding , bite-able poet. If Ted loved her in the beginning , it faded as the competitive Brit realized that Sylvia could write as well as , perhaps better , than him. And if they began their life together as a new version of the Brownings , he soon was having affairs and eventually left her and the two children for another woman. Edge allows Sylvia to draw the parallels between the two men in her life she tried so hard to please , and there are many. However , this is when the script runs into problems. In much the same way a comedian tells a joke and then explains the punch line , the audience is reminded repeatedly that Sylvia married a man just like her father. Instead of letting the words tell the story , less and less subtle signposts are waved until finally Sylvia tells us I married my father ! , and the audience wonders Are you just figuring this out on the last day of your life ?

Now you need to 'rough out ' the scarf cut to remove the bulk of the wood and to reduce the amount of effort you have to make with small planes or sanding blocks later. Remove wood to within about 1/8 " of the scarf lines , being careful and going as slow as necessary. A very good hint to how well you are making your scarf is to observe the laminations in the plywood in the scarf cut. All the lamination lines should be parallel to each other and to the end of the plywood. You can use a block plane to remove a little wood in selected areas now and then to 'fix ' areas that need it. I usually alternate between a power hand plane and a block plane , while many others will do all the work with a belt sander. Just make sure you check things often ( visually and with a straight edge ) as you go , and work conservatively ... you can hurry on some other part of your project !

This stresses processing capability and , at most , only 180 can be viewed. If the whole wafer is viewed , it must be turned around to get at least two pictures. Then there is the question of the resolution at which defects can be determined. It also becomes difficult to use low-incidence light in scattering , because the edge itself becomes a scattering surface. Some rotate around the chamber to get a picture around it. However , resolution is limited by half the wavelength of the illumination light; thus , at DUV , 157 nm or so , the best obtainable resolution is on the order of 75 nm. Typically , most do it at ~1 m , sometimes 0.8 or 0.7 m . </edge.n.1899><edge.n.1900>In 1997 when we were brainstorming Blue Collar , we talked about the " Microsoft Mom " which referred to the notion of a woman who had kids and was out of the workforce for a while.

Back then we recognized that with the low cost of telecommunications , and emerging technology tools , with excellence in decentralized management , we could make that " Microsoft mom " a valuable Blue Collar contributor and help her to minimize the work/quality of life compromise. Another example that we dreamed of was granting access to talented humans who may have a disability which hampers their mobility. Having a decentralized environment and management discipline we could provide access to the disabled in win/win fashion : leveraging the talent where it exists , and allowing the individual to maximize their comfort. Furthermore , we realized that companies that figured out how to succeed with this new workplace early would have an edge in the search for talented individuals ... it would be a competitive edge . </edge.n.1900><edge.n.1901>Using a pencil , draw small lines on the wall all along the wall where you will be placing the paper , by putting the flat edge of your board on the floor , ( standing the board upright ) and marking along the top edge.

They are simply as is and that will include a wide range of variants between the so called soft and sharp position. In fact , many things in the natural world are not ' sharp ' at all , but instead actually have a rather rounded edge , especially when viewed at a very close range , such as during macro 1 : 1 , or closeup photography. Not everything is ' razor sharp ' with clearly defined crisp lines and detail. Take a closer look at a leaf , a blade of grass , or flower petal under a magnifying glass and you will see that in reality these objects are often quite fuzzy edged with little or no highly contrasting dark outline to separate the image from other parts of the photograph. This current concept that everything should be ' uber sharp ' is merely the result of our modern day HD ( high-definition ) mentality , which now makes us come to expect that every single thing we view must have that big screen , IMAX type persona in order to be good . </edge.n.1982><edge.n.1983>Hello , and welcome to COLLEGE EDGE !

From the velocities at the outer edge of the boundary layer on the upper and the lower side of the wing the bound vortex lines in the lifting surface were determined. A comparison with former investigations concerning laminar boundary layers shows the influence of the status of the boundary layer on the vortex formation. Investigations of the flow downstream of the wing trailing-edge indicate , that the trailing vortex sheet rolls up into a vortex , the rotation of which is opposite to that of the leading-edge vortex. The axis of this so called trailing-edge vortex forms a spiral within the leading-edge vortex.

Smaller than a full size SUV , less seating than a minivan , this niche offers good looking , sporty vehicles that can haul some gear. The newest player is the attractive 2007 Ford Edge which combines a sporty look and feel with a healthy dose of utility. In fact , the Edge offers more utility than the FX-35 that we spent time with earlier this year . </edge.n.2019><edge.n.2020>What really hits you while playing at MotorStorm : Arctic Edge is the intense sense of speed , and the fact that it s all happening on a PSP !

If this is true and 0.5 micron paper would perform better in the same tests that Fine Woodworking did then potentially 0.5 micron paper might produce a better edge than 0.5 u diamond paste on maple. Also , when stropping , the leather is compressed under the blade but not beside the blade. This rounds the edges which increases the included angle.

For instance , with some modifications , it can test analog gauges and speedometers. The strategy for inspecting gauges is straightforward; you calibrate the full range of the gauge by drawing a line profile along the needle at the minimum reading and at the maximum reading. In so doing , we determine the center point about which the needle swings and the perimeter of the area of swing. After the calibration , we can detect the needle position with line profiles. If the needle is black with a white background , the line profile with the lowest value is the location of the needle. Overall , edge detection and line profiling are very common and simple to understand. They are imaging techniques that can be used in a wide range of inspection applications from mechanical assembly , electronic packaging inspection , quality of markings , and electronic connector inspection . </edge.n.2095><edge.n.2096>We are very lucky to have discovered this wonderful , homely B &amp;B.

Most large mass movements or debris flows originated on the lower slope at water depths greater than 1 , 000 m and have involved stacks of strata as much as 300 meters thick. During movement , the displaced masses broke apart and were delivered to the rise as debris flows. Debris-flow deposits show up in the GLORIA images as relatively bright , reflective areas of sea floor , but individual flows are difficult to distinguish because most lack well-defined edges ( mosaics 5 and 7 ) . Individual deposits include large , flared sheets having wispy distal borders and elongate , linguloid bodies resembling mudflows.

However , it would not be unusual for the white shirt of a person writing on a White Board to have his white shirt match the white of the white board in both luminance and color ( hue ) . In'this case the difference matte is defeated in its attempt to separate the subject from its background. However , since a shirt and a white board are made of different materials , there is a high probability they will differ in either their infrared or ultra violet reflection. The need for using more than the RGB parts of the spectrum may not occur frequently , but a fourth channel significantly improves subject edge detection. A fourth and fifth channel are treated as a fourth and fifth color in both the clear frame and the current frame.

Three main facies zones are shown , corresponding to an inner low energy shelf , an outer high energy shelf , and the steep foreslope that extends into deepwater ( see Kidston et al. , 2005 for further details ) . Coeval with the development of the carbonate bank was the deposition of the Upper Jurassic Mic Mac Formation and its equivalents , consisting of a mix of clastics and carbonates that are thickest in the NE corner of the figure. Significant growth faulting and salt mobilization took place while the Mic Mac Formation was deposited. In the areas of Parcels 1 and 2 , a time-thickness map for the J350 and J280 markers shows the distribution of the earliest minibasins above autochthonous salt. The minibasins are assumed to contain Jurassic strata composed of the deepwater equivalents of the Mic Mac Formation , as well as strata equivalent to the Mohican Formation. Sediment input into deepwater is presumed to be normal or sub-normal to the steep Abenaki slope. Salt outlines on this map are highly schematic.

Thus , we can approximate the amount of motion using the differences between adjacent frames ( e.g. , by analyzing the FD-sequence ) , rather than direct computation of the motion vectors. A similar observation has been made by Tao and Orchard [ 37 ] , where they noticed that the residual signal generated after motion-compensated predication is highly correlated with the gradient magnitude : the motion compensated error is larger for pixels with larger gradient magnitude on average. They thus suggested that the gradient ( from one frame to the other ) could be estimated from the reconstructed image using the motion estimates. In this work , we are interested in the reverse procedure; given the gradient information ( as captured by the edge response vectors ) , we wish to estimate the amount of motion in the shot , without explicit motion estimation . </edge.n.2361><edge.n.2362>[ 0096 ] When the upper portion 12q is removed from the lower portion 14q by detaching along the detaching element 24q , the lower portion 14q is left with an upper end which is disposed a distance above an upper rim of a pot.

We can prove that this filtering is in fact equivalent to collecting the gradient along the shape boundary. Moreover , since the responses are averaged over the neighborhood of the contour , our method is more robust than merely summing up the gradient magnitudes. Errors in shape position and response estimates averaged over boundary pixels are reduced proportional to the size of the operator. In our filtering approach , edges with weak responses can contribute to the shape response , so that an object having very low contrast on all or some portion of its boundary can be correctly detected. By shifting the sampling of operator values , we can estimate the positions of objects having very small numbers of pixels , with sub-pixel accuracy . </edge.n.2377><edge.n.2378>16.

The plate 20 has a width 29 sufficient such that it extends far enough , normal to the leading edge of the aerofoil body , for the attachment line 18 to coincide with the plate 20 over the envisaged range of angles of incidence of the wing. Thus , the region of the leading edge coincident with the attachment points , where impinging air flows neither above nor below the wing , changes with respect to the angle of the wing during flight and the width of the plate 20 extends across all possible regions of the leading edge coincident with potential locations of the attachment points during flight . </edge.n.2448><edge.n.2449>Like the Bass singer , the Contralto is often a thicker voice. One factor in achieving register balance is accomplished by training the thin edges of the vocal folds in the middle and chest registers , and is especially important in the higher chest register. Training the thin edge function in the upper chest register often requires a lighter feeling as in speech. When a Contralto vocalizes from middle voice down into chest register , she must feel a ' drinking sensation ' at the transition of registers in order to smooth the break or transition point. At the same time , as the singer transitions into the chest register , there must be a feeling of tremendous lift and width in the soft palate. Working the thin edge function of the vocal folds makes for a smoother transition from chest to middle register when descending or ascending in music , a goal that most female singers wish to achieve. ( Note : When working with the thin edge function , it is critical to keep the pharynx or acoustical space very open . ) </edge.n.2449><edge.n.2450>40.2 x 51.9 cm. Original outline colour.

( In other words , edge convexity is not defined for non-manifold edges. ) The convexity of an edge is defined with respect to the normals of the faces upon which it lies. Edges are typically classified as tangent , concave , or convex. If two faces meet tangentially , their common edge is termed a tangent edge. Tangent , concave , and convex edges are depicted in Figure. Tangent , Concave , and Convex Edges. If the convexity of an edge changes over its length , the edge is said to have mixed-convexity. An edge with mixed convexity is depicted in Figure. A Mixed-Convexity Edge. This edge is concave on its upper half and is convex on its lower half. If the two faces ( or the face on both sides ) of an edge meet tangentially and the directions into the face from the edge are parallel , then the edge may be called a knife edge. Such an edge is depicted in Figure.

Resection has been described to help decrease heaviness of the upper lid and lateral brow. The sub-brow fat pad can be repositioned during wound closure with use of eyelid suspension sutures. This can be done with two to three absorbable sutures that incorporate the orbicularis from the lower and upper edge of the incision along with the superolateral arcus marginalis [ [ Figure 3 ] , bottom left ] . These sutures might result in early over-correction of the upper eyelid leading to lagophthalmos , which improves within days after the surgery. The transconjunctival approach has very limited application in upper eyelid blepharoplasty.

Destined to become one of the most coveted works of this exciting genre and already garnering rave response from listeners of over 300 top radio stations countrywide , they have been touted by Jim Brenholts - Ambient Visions as " a gem ... a harbinger of great things to come "; Bill Binkelman - Wind and Wire - " Friendly and warm but also forlorn and mysterious ... may just be the ideal soundtrack for a trip beyond the rim of our galaxy - or even further "; and have also elicited praise from other members of the music media , ranging from " evoking a latter-day Star Trek " and " so Ziggy Stardust " to " sublime , serenely rhapsodic , other-worldly " , " terminally hip in the true sense of the term " , and more . </edge.n.2476><edge.n.2477>During this thesis , we have developped an accurate and robust lip segmentation algorithm. First , the mouth is found in the first image by using a new kind of active contour : the " jumping snake " . Unlike classic snakes , it can be initialized quite far away from the final edge and the adjustment of its parameters is easy and intuitive. To achieve the convergence of the active contour , we use the " hybrid edges " ( which combine the color and intensity information ) . Then , a parametric model composed of several cubics is fitted on the outer lips boundary. This model is flexible enough to reproduce the specificities of very different lips shapes. Compared to existing models , it brings a significant accuracy and realism improvement. The segmentation in the following frames is achieved by an interframe keypoints tracking. Moreover , in order to compensate the tracking errors , we propose an adjustment process that enables a robust tracking even for long sequences. The results for several speakers are very good. It makes this method very suitable for applications which require a high level of precision , such as lipreading or high quality clone synthesis . </edge.n.2477><edge.n.2478>To get started , you will need to compile all the data collected about your target market trends , customers , products and competitors.

Because TCP continually increases its window sizes , which is especially noticeable in long sessions ( such as large file transfers ) , constraining bulk data to its own class alleviates other data classes from being dominated by such large file transfers. Bulk data is identified by DSCP AF11 ( or AF12 in the case of dual-rate policing at the campus access edges ) . DSCP-based WRED can be enabled on the Bulk Data class ( and also on the Critical Data class ) .

These plates were originally of high quality. The rolled and roped border on the edges of the plates are tall , squared , and even. The roping is deep and crisp. The roll on the bottom plate is terminated cleanly with a step to allow the upper plate to overlap it. The bottom edge of the upper plate is cusped and beveled . </edge.n.2532><edge.n.2533>Every edge in a water tight solid model has exactly two faces that touch it , one on either side. Moving the edge ( which is what happenned in the figure above ) affects both faces and they are trimmed or extented as necessary. If one of the faces is deleted ( as was the case when I deleted the middle box ) the other face spills over the edge and proceeds to find a face that will trim it. When all such faces get trimmed we end up with a watertight solid once again. Even if one of the faces does not get trimmed , the software reports a modeling error . </edge.n.2533><edge.n.2534>Figure 7 illustrates how USM finds areas of high local contrast. Image 1 shows an edge that is less than completely sharp. Image 2 shows a copy of Image 1 that has been blurred. Image 3 shows the original image sandwiched with the blurred image. The values of these two images were then subtracted. As can be seen in Image 3 , areas of little contrast show up as dark. Areas of high contrast ( the edge ) show up as lighter. Thus , image 3 shows the edge as a lighter line down the middle of the image. Once the areas of high local contrast have been identified by this technique , USM can increase the contrast , of those areas , on the original image -- thus , increasing the acutance . </edge.n.2534><edge.n.2535>Well , now that you can reliably put an edge on a tool , you ' ve lifted yourself to a different category of work.

" </edge.n.2563><edge.n.2564>Since fringe expression is not limited to the edge of the wing , how is it that its effects are felt only at the edge ? The answer to this question comes from a study of the effects of mutant apterous clones on wing morphology. Clones of cells mutant for apterous in the dorsal region of the wing disc form ectopic wing margins along clone borders , a phenotype resembling clones of cells mutant for fringe. Clone borders ( juxtaposing cells expressing apterous and not expressing apterous ) simulate the edge of the wing. The ectopic wing margins are composed of both wild type and mutant cells , with the clone boundary always splitting the middle of the ectopic margin. Such clone boundaries should also create a boundary of fringe expression , since Apterous regulates fringe expression. It is concluded that the juxtaposition of cells possessing and lacking fng expression can induce wing margin formation , and implies the existence of a signaling process between such cells ( Irvine , 1994 ) . </edge.n.2564><edge.n.2565>The Large Cap Value Edge Strategy seeks to outperform the Russell 1000 Value Index over the long-term while maintaining comprehensive risk controls.

In addition , the movement of such droplets is somewhat unpredictable , and they can flow in from the front edge of the wafer , where the fluid is dispensed from the nozzle , back toward the center. The inertial regime is undesirable because in this regime the fluid tends to fly off the front edge of the wafer , due to the radial component of the fluid 's velocity , rather than flowing over the side edge. This radial velocity is a result of the exit velocity of the fluid from the nozzle and to a smaller degree the centripetal acceleration of the rotating wafer. The viscous regime is the regime one wishes to operate in because in this regime the fluid evenly covers the front edge of the wafer where the etchant is applied.

Effectively , , where is simply the number of blocks at the kth level. This makes the features from the lower levels of the decomposition to become more important. As the number of decomposition levels L increases , the lower-level features will dominate in the computation of the overall difference , and hence this will become very sensitive to small spatial differences in the frames.

The case ( a ) is solved by inserting the mid-point at the boundary edge. Since the obtuse angle is smaller than 120 ' , no diagonal interchange is necessary. For the case ( b ) and since the insertion of a point on the longest-boundary edge keep the obtuse angle in the new triangle with two boundary edges , we propose to insert two points so that the new boundary triangle with two boundary edges is isosceles. A triangle with three boundary edges ( case ( c ) ) is a very rare case.

For searching evolutionary related proteins , there are also hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) profile-based methods such as HMMER ( Eddy , 1998 ) or SAM ( Karplus et al. , 1998 ) and PSSM-based methods such as PSI-BLAST ( Altschul et al. , 1997 ) . These methods successfully work for the prediction of function and/or detection of distant homologs. However , for accurate assignment of the edges and their types in the graph of gene/protein universe , it is important to measure relationships in evolution between pairs of proteins , not relationship among members of families or groups. Furthermore , we have to prepare the definition of protein families for HMM profile-based methods. For PSI-BLAST , we need to iterate homology search to construct the PSSM and we also need to manually refine candidates of homologs at respective steps of iteration to obtain the best result. Thus , these methods are not really suited to the detection of orthologs in a large scale. Therefore , the SW algorithm is useful for sensitive and accurate homology search , and it is still required to speed up SW search . </edge.n.2762><edge.n.2763>Once you finish attaching the outside , attach the inside in the same manner.

Usually this is the result of frequent stropping on abrasive pastes. As such this is a valid option for getting a keen edge , but once the decision has been made to ( re ) sharpen with hones , the bevel needs to be brought in its flat state again. It is clear that this can require the removal of a fair amount of steel. A convex bevel is not easy to spot. Visual inspection , whether magnified or not , is not very reliable for detecting convexity. The way light reflects off the bevel panes can reveal something , but it is difficult to be certain. The magic marker test is a better choice of unmasking convex bevels. Another problem with convex bevels , is that the keenness often is still more than adequate to allow the razor to pass the Thumbnail test , which makes it impossible to tell when the last trace of convexity is cleared.

At first this will not be visible , but in time a narrow grind will appear at the very edge. Each touch up will start to take slightly longer than the last as the additional bevel widens and eventually the Edge Pro will have to be used to reset the edge , removing this additional bevel. This process can in fact be avoided completely and the Edge Pro used to do the touch ups. If this is the case , the system should probably be left setup , and the stones soaking to insure that it is ready to be used. In general though , this is overkill unless the demands for sharpness are very high. The ceramic rod does a very nice job at freehand touch ups , and a simple mount can be easily made to set it at a known angle.

However the time will now be significantly longer. How much time depends on the length of the blade , the nature of the steel and how much of an angle change is required. For example fifteen minutes of honing would make a major angle change on a small folder , even if it had a hard and wear resistant steel blade. Life can be made easier here if blade aesthetics can be abandoned. Use of a very large bench stone and some lapping compound will allow much faster reshaping of an edge , extreme care in angle consistency is n't required here as this is n't actually sharpening , just shaping. The goal is to hog off enough metal to get a rough shape. The Edge Pro will then very quickly refine the shape.

Between these is a point where the air neither passes over nor under the wing known as an attachment point , which is at a relatively high pressure. The locus of the attachment points spanwise along the leading edge defines the attachment line which is indicated by the dotted line 18 in FIG. 1. Air impinging on the leading edge of the wing also tends to move spanwise along the wing in the direction of sweep.

The environmental conditions produced along these edges may modify habitat values that are important to interior forest dwellers. Many landscape ecologists have voiced concern about this habitat disruption and about the potential loss of landscape-level biodiversity that may ensue if interior habitat ecosystems and processes are not sustained. Preserving sufficient interior habitat is therefore important to protect these species and maintain biodiversity . </edge.n.2928><edge.n.2929>In most cases , one micron or smaller diamond sharpening pastes are more than capable of sharpening a razor which has become dull through normal use. By starting with an even coarser grit - in the one to ten micron range , depending on how dull the beginning edge is , you can refine the " not quite shave-ready " edge typically found on a new , out-of-the-box razor. Before sharpening a new razor you should first try shaving with it. If it pulls , drags , or is in any way uncomfortable , sharpening is required. By testing it before sharpening you can evaluate how close to shave-ready it is and use this information to guide you in how much sharpening to do. Generally , 20 round trips on each side of the diamond pasted strop will get it right. If after sharpening and again trying to shave it needs more work , repeat the process. Though you may have heard of many different ways to test the sharpness of a razor - the hanging hair test , the standing hair test , shaving your forearm , etc. , the only true test is actually shaving with it . </edge.n.2929><edge.n.2930>When hit songwriter Kye Fleming first heard Edens Edge , she didn ' t know that she and the rootsy country band had a home state , Arkansas , in common.

Edges in images are areas with strong intensity contrasts a jump in intensity from one pixel to the next. Edge detecting an image significantly reduces the amount of data and filters out useless information , while preserving the important structural properties in an image. There are many ways to perform edge detection. However , the majority of different methods may be grouped into two categories , gradient and Laplacian. The gradient method detects the edges by looking for the maximum and minimum in the first derivative of the image. The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image to find edges. An edge has the one-dimensional shape of a ramp and calculating the derivative of the image can highlight its location.

Jung wrote : " Like the alchemical end-product , which always betrays its essential duality , the united personality will never quite lose the painful sense of innate discord " ( 1985 , par. 400 ) .

However , the Edge has a different six-speed automatic transmission than the Mazda , along with a simpler , viscous-coupling all-wheel-drive system. Additionally , with only two rows of seating , the Ford rides on a slightly shorter wheelbase and is 14 inches shorter nose to tail. Passenger room is generous in both the front and rear seats , and features like a telescoping steering wheel and reclining rear seats ensure long-haul comfort. The overall interior design is fairly bland , but families will find it functional day-to-day , and a full set of side airbags keeps everyone safe. Out on the road , the Ford Edge is one of the quicker SUVs in its class and manages to provide both sporty handling and a smooth , quiet ride. As with most of its peers , off-roading is not really within its grasp , but equipped with AWD , it should make a fine winter-weather vehicle.

The features that are seen in the Solid Edge ST Path Finder ( the equivalent of the traditional feature tree ) are very different from the features we see in the traditional parametric modelers. In a traditional parametric modeler , you can edit a feature by specifying new values for it 's parameters. For example , for an extrusion feature , you can modify the extrusion distance and the feature will be updated. You can not do this with a feature in Solid Edge ST. This is because the features here are dumb and have no parameters to edit. The only way to change the extrustion distance is to pull/push the face you extruded in the first place or set up a dimension and edit the dimension. The features in Solid Edge ST are merely a collection of related faces that make up the feature. They do not even know which sketch was used to create them.

However , if the element has a nonzero top padding and/or top border , or is the root element , then the content starts at the top margin edge of the topmost child. ( The first case expresses the fact that the top and bottom margins of the element collapse with those of the topmost and bottommost children , while in the second case the presence of the padding/border prevents the top margins from collapsing. ) Similarly , if the element has a nonzero bottom padding and/or bottom border , then the content ends at the bottom margin edge of the bottommost child . </edge.n.3155><edge.n.3156>One way to do this is to consider the image as being a graph where the vertices of the graph are the pixel corners and the edges of the graph are the pixel cracks.

The problem of finding an optimal boundary through as set of possible pixels thus becomes a simple minimal-cost path , graph-searching problem.

In the flowchart , the packetanalyzing unit 239 determines in step S101 whether the source address ( IP SA ) of the received packet matches the address of a preregistered emergency call destination. If it is determined in step S101 that the source address ( IP SA ) does not match theaddress of any preregistered emergency call destination , in step S102 , the process proceeds to step S64 in FIG. 6. On the other hand , if it is determined in step S101 that the address matches the address of a preregistered emergency call destination , the packet analyzing unit 239 reports the IP address of the emergency call destination to the ICMP transmit unit 242. In step S102 , the ICMP transmit unit 242 stores the IP address information of the emergency call destination in the data field of anICMP ( Internet Control Message Protocol ) packet in order to report the IP address of the emergency call destination to other edge switches , and broadcasts the packet to all the edge switches . </edge.n.3216><edge.n.3217>The edge blend is accomplished by placing a polygon with the edge blend function above represented as a grey scale 1 dimensional texture.

The betweenness hypergraph of a metric space is the 3-uniform hypergraph on the points such that three points form an edge if one is between the other two. In any 3-uniform hypergraph , we can define a line to be a set of edges with a common pair of vertices; this reduces to the previous definition of line when the hypergraph is the betweeness hypergraph of a metric space. Now we impose the condition on 3-uniform hypergraphs with n vertices that every line has at most n-1 vertices in its edges and ask what is the minimum number of lines in such a hypergraph. The authors prove that this minimum is less than every power of n , so this generalization will not prove Conjecture 1. They also study the minimum number of lines in a 3-uniform n-vertex hypergraph such that every line has at most k vertices in its edges . </edge.n.3279><edge.n.3280>The materials on Edge Line Tech , LLC.

When this happens , you must swing the barn door out of the way and use one of the freestanding masks discussed below. Sometimes you can compromise by using a gooseneck flag. This is a paddle-shaped metal card attached to a flexible arm about two feet long with a clamp at the bottom end. Clamp the arm to the light or the light stand and bend the gooseneck until the paddle stands up in the path of the light. Since this extended barndoor is as much as a foot or more away from the spotlight , it creates a somewhat harder edge. Gooseneck flags are also very useful when you need extra masking at an odd angle that regular barndoors ca n't handle . </edge.n.3294><edge.n.3295>The International EDGE Advantage course series goes beyond the basics of diversity and sets the stage for a truly inclusive work environment that not only understands , but values and leverages the differences among an international workforce.

For video in particular , this becomes very important. Although some variations ( such as panning , tilting , and illumination ) in the video could be global with respect to a particular frame , object motion and some other camera operations ( such as zooming ) are more easily modeled as a local phenomenon. ( Note , although zooming could also be global over the video frame , the direction of the motion vectors will vary from one area of the image to the other ) . We capture global information by using information from the lower levels of decomposition ( smaller values of k ) . With higher levels , we can obtain information about more localized structures in the frame. Such localized structures could be treated differently for improved performance . </edge.n.3317><edge.n.3318>A slower taper to the deeper water jutted off the other side of the shelve , which was made even more attractive by a band of low-growing fringe weeds outside the wall of cabbage.

Heat transfer was measured in the stagnation region of four models with elliptical leading edges with ratios of major to minor axes of 1 : 1 , 1.5 : 1 , 2.25 : 1 , and 3 : 1. Four geometrically similar , square bar , square mesh , biplane grids were used to generate free stream turbulence with different intensities and length. Heat transfer measurements were made for the following ranges of parameters : Reynolds number , based on leading edge diameter , 37 , 000 to 228 , 000; dimensionless leading edge velocity gradient , 1.20 to 1.80; turbulence intensity , 1.1 to 15.9 ; and length scale to leading edge diameter ratio , 0.05 to 0.30. Stagnation point heat transfer augmentation by free stream turbulence can be predicted using a modified version of a previously developed correlation for a circular leading edge. Heat transfer augmentation was independent of body shape at the stagnation point. The heat transfer distribution down-stream from the stagnation point can be predicted using the normalized laminar heat transfer distribution . </edge.n.3352><edge.n.3353>21.

The corresponding numeric value ( 0-9 ) is then assigned to the display inspected. In the final step , we compare this number with an expected value that is fed to the DUT through a serial line.

If the sense of the edge is forward ( that is , the edge is the same direction as its underlying curve ) , then the parameterization of the edge is identical to that of its underlying curve. If the sense of the edge is reversed ( that is , the edge is the opposite direction as its underlying curve ) , then the parameterization of the edge is the negation of its curve 's parameterization. For example , if a point on the curve has a parameter value t , then the corresponding parameter value on a reversed edge would be t. If a curve is defined over a range ( a , b ) and has a reversed edge defined over this portion of the curve , then the range of the edge would be ( b , a ) . </edge.n.3415><edge.n.3416>Jerry , thanks for visiting the Thin Edge blog.

A hone can preserve the edge , but bigger is not necessarily better. Too large a hone - relative to the size of the uncut chip or feed rate - increases cutting forces and tool temperatures. Not until the hone is half the size of the feed , or less , does its impact on cutting forces and tool temperatures become minimal. Effective hones are usually one-third to one-half the size of the feed. For example , when an edge with a 0.002 " hone feeds into the workpiece at 0.004 ipr , the hone is half the size of the uncut chip yet effectively protects the tool 's edge . </edge.n.3417><edge.n.3418>Based on this one-dimensional analysis , the theory can be carried over to two-dimensions as long as there is an accurate approximation to calculate the derivative of a two-dimensional image. The Sobel operator performs a 2-D spatial gradient measurement on an image. Typically it is used to find the approximate absolute gradient magnitude at each point in an input grayscale image. The Sobel edge detector uses a pair of 3x3 convolution masks , one estimating the gradient in the x-direction ( columns ) and the other estimating the gradient in the y-direction ( rows ) . A convolution mask is usually much smaller than the actual image. As a result , the mask is slid over the image , manipulating a square of pixels at a time. The actual Sobel masks are shown below : </edge.n.3418><edge.n.3419>The locking action of the top is due to the fact that the tension and compression on the respective panels making up the top surface are acting in a direction toward the respective fold lines against which the force is exerted. When the top which is being folded and closed is pushed below the plane of the polygon forming the rim of the container , the tension on the smaller panel is exerted in a direction to cause further closing of the top. The upper edge 20 comprised of lines 21 and 27 between apex 24 of the internal fold 34 also containing the external folds 32 can be of a variety of shapes or can be notched to facilitate a center opening when the top is locked. The shape of this upper rim is dictated by the design desired. However , having a longer external fold as shown best in FIG. 3 , has the effect of helping to limit the amount of downward travel the panels will reach when completely folded. They thus limit downward movement of the top panels and provide a secure stopping point for the motion . </edge.n.3419><edge.n.3420>[ 0055 ] FIG. 7 shows another embodiment of the invention , wherein the optical unit 40 is subdivided in a rotatable first module 100 and a stationary second module 110.

Surgery is performed through an incision made 4-6 mm below the lid margin through the conjunctiva and lower eyelid retractors [ [ Figure 5 ] , top right ] . This can be done by sharp dissection with scissors , radiofrequency monopolar cautery , or laser. Gentle pressure on the eyeball prolapses the fat compartments and aids in identification of the medial , central , and lateral fat pads. Conservative fat removal is achieved using radiofrequency monopolar or bipolar cautery [ [ Figure 5 ] , bottom left and right ] . Care is taken not to damage the inferior oblique muscle that separates the medial from the central fat pocket. The endpoint for excision is reached when gentle pressure on the globe results in the anterior aspect of the orbital fat being flush with the orbital rim. The tarsoconjunctival incision is left unclosed , but the inferior and superior edges of the conjunctival epithelium are well apposed to avoid overlap. The incision usually heals within a week to give an aesthetic result [ [ Figure 6 ] , top left and right ] . </edge.n.3426><edge.n.3427>Another test for sharpness is to press the edge lightly on your thumbnail at about a 30-degree angle.

On seismic profiles , the O-marker defines a break in the progradational character of the outer shelf that is consistent with a period of increased shelf accommodation , followed by a period of continued progradation as the sand-prone Upper Missisauga Formation advanced across it ( Figure 15 and 16 ) . Above the O-marker , the transition from flat-lying moderate amplitude topsets to inclined lower amplitude foresets defines a shelf-edge that can be recognized locally between the Abenaki carbonate bank edge and Alma ( Figure 16 ) . This Upper Missisauga shelf-edge advanced abruptly seaward , extending the shelf more than 10 km south of its Lower Missisauga position ( see also figure 15 of Cummings and Arnott , 2005 , and figure 10 of Cummings et al. , 2006 ) .

Essentially the development of a strategy based upon added values will normally require a more segmented approach to the market. When a company scrutinizes markets closely it frequently finds that there are distinct " value segments " . In other words , different groups of customers within the total market attach different importance to different benefits. The importance of such benefit segmentation lies in the fact that often there are substantial opportunities for creating differentiated appeals for specific segments. The one way of getting the competitive edge and sustainable competitive advantage is through technology breakthroughs. The other way of getting sustainable competitive advantage is by focusing upon service as a means of gaining a competitive edge.

It is less sensitive to isolated high intensity point variations since the local averaging over sets of three pixels tends to reduce this. In effect it is a small bar'' detector , rather than a point detector. Secondly , it gives an estimate of edge direction as well as edge magnitude at a point which is more informative and is of considerable use in later processing. A disadvantage of the Sobel edge detector is that the response to a step edge is present over either two or three pixels width , dependent on the precise position of the step relative to the pixel grid. This necessitates the use of post-processing in the form of edge thinning'' and thresholding'' in order to reduce the computational complexity of further processing. Figure 2 shows the magnitude response of the operator before any thresholding or thinning has occurred . </edge.n.3454><edge.n.3455>In a world of cheap coordination , the edge - the boundary between the firm and the external - is the new core.

When two continental ( land ) plates converge , the crust bends and breaks from the collision , forming complex mountain ranges and very high plateaus. When a continental plate and an oceanic plate converge , the oceanic plate ( which is thinner , yet denser ) bends and plunges at an angle into the asthenosphere beneath the continental plate. As it does so , its leading edge begins to melt because of high temperature and pressure in the mantle. This forms thick , flowing magma ( molten rock beneath the planet 's surface ) . Less dense than the rock that surrounds it deep underground , the magma rises toward Earth 's surface , forcing its way through weakened layers of rock. In most instances , the magma collects in underground reservoirs called magma chambers. It remains there until enough pressure builds up to eject it onto the planet 's surface through vents called volcanoes.

In the westernmost Sable Subbasin , sedimentation took place primarily above listric growth faults , where more than 2.5 km of shale dominated strata were encountered by Evangeline H-98. For the first time , shelf clastic systems also prograded beyond the edge of the Jurassic shelf NW of Parcels 1 and 2 , renewing sediment input into deepwater from this direction. Recognition of several broad slope canyons is consistent with sediment input from both the Sable Subbasin region and from across the NW Abenaki margin. Thin-skinned extension associated with increased sedimentation on the upper slope near Evangeline was balanced down-slope by contraction. The Newburn fold-and-thrust belt developed as a consequence , and folding of existing structures in Parcels 1 and 2 was rejuvenated . </edge.n.3655><edge.n.3656>Mark out the edge around your patio based on the size of your edging material , using the line , sand or paint.

Benade comments " Until recently there has been a tendency ... to confuse the sounds produced by blowing a narrow air jet against a sharp edge when the edge forms part of a flute or an organ pipe ( air reed behavior ) with those produced when the system is run in isolation ( edge-tone behavior ) . In the latter case a type of repetitive eddying called vortex shedding takes place on alternate sides of the air jet , and a sound is produced if a sharp edge is used to separate the two sets of vortices. Vortex phenomena have only a secondary influence on flute-type sound production; moreover , at ordinary musical blowing pressures the edge-tone frequencies are so high as to be nearly inaudible . </edge.n.3729><edge.n.3730>[ 0012 ] A customer edge ( CE ) , e.g. , a CE device such as an Internet Protocol ( IP ) router , associated with a customer site provides a customer with access to a service provider network.

A value of " node " causes packing at the node and edge level , with no overlapping of these objects. This produces a layout with the least area , but it also allows interleaving , where a node of one component may lie between two nodes in another component. A value of " graph " does a packing using the bounding box of the component. Thus , there will be a rectangular region around a component free of elements of any other component. A value of " clust " guarantees that top-level clusters are kept intact. What effect a value has also depends on the layout algorithm. For example , neato does not support clusters , so a value of " clust " will have the same effect as the default " node " value . </edge.n.3743><edge.n.3744>Campo- Area residents and Border Patrol remain on edge after the murder of an on duty agent.

The height of the duct entrance ( 27 ) above the leading edge of the aerofoil body is greater than the depth of the boundary layer BLt and thus a fresh laminar boundary layer is established on the outer surface ( 20 ) of the duct which propagates spanwise along the surface to rejoin the leading edge of the aerofoil body.

Any industry strategist , market analyst or even a knowledgeable layperson can tell when a company has the edge in an industry. But how exactly is competitive advantage defined ? While the study in this area of strategy management goes back some thirty years or more , debate continues as to the definition of competitive advantage , and the actions required to achieve and sustain it. Is it efficiency , as in the case of Southwest Airlines , or industry domination , as with Wal-Mart , that is the defining factor for competitive advantage ? </edge.n.3914><edge.n.3915>After that , we turned the structure over and did the same from the other side , again installing about five or six rivets.

After half an hour , every rivet was in place , flat and flush , and visually the edge looked straight. Eye-sweet as my Granddad would of called it. The secret really seemed to be continually turning the rudder , so the rivets were riveted from alternate sides . </edge.n.3915><edge.n.3916>Macquarie Edge ( www.macquarieedge.com.au ) takes advantage of the Web 2.0 world and offers share trading in a social networking style.

This has its advantages , in particular for shaving hollow parts of the face and neck. Setting a hollow bevel can be tricky , for the obvious reason that it can ' t be done with the regular X-stroke. The remedy is called the Rolling X stroke . You have to look at the blade as a section of a much larger half round disk. For sharpening such a moon-shaped object , you need to rock it. The stroke starts with the heel resting on the hone together with its opposite part of the spine , but the razor is tilted a bit , so that the toe is a bit higher. During the X-stroke , the razor is rocked over the middle part and ends with the toe touching the hone while the heel is tilted a bit upwards. If you keep an eye on the wave of water in front of , and running up , the edge , then you can adjust your stroke to reach a nice and even curve. It takes some persevering practice to get the hang of it . </edge.n.3925><edge.n.3926>Overall 34 x 45.5 cm. Uncoloured.

By simply varying the weights , we can completely ignore the contribution of any particular feature. For the weights above to be meaningful however , we need to be sure that the range of values for the individual distances will be similar. Thus , we either have to normalize all the features to the same range of values , or we can compute the distance such that the overall distance from each feature is normalized. We take the later approach , and perform normalization at the time of distance computation , based on the model-data feature pairs ( 18 ) where again and are weights , with . The normalized distances can then be used with the weights in ( 17 ) to obtain the overall distance between the frames . </edge.n.3948><edge.n.3949>EDGE has 4 discrete digital audio inputs ( 3 optical and 1 coaxial ) and 1 analog audio input ( L/R ) each of which can be assigned to any of the video inputs.

Sometimes the arrangement of the cells on both sides of the leaf is similar , as occurs in leaves which have their edges presented to the sky. In very succulent plants the cells form a compact mass , and those in the centre are often colourless. In some cases the cellular tissue is deficient at certain points , giving rise to distinct holes in the leaf , as in Monstera Adansonii. The fibro-vascular system in the leaf constitutes the venation. The fibro-vascular bundles from the stem bend out into the leaf , and are there arranged in a definite manner. In skeleton leaves , or leaves in which the parenchyma is removed , this arrangement is well seen. In some leaves , as in the barberry , the veins are hardened , producing spines without any parenchyma. The hardening of the extremities of the fibro-vascular tissue is the cause of the spiny margin of many leaves , such as the holly , of the sharp-pointed leaves of madder , and of mucronate leaves , or those having a blunt end with a hard projection in the centre . </edge.n.3998><edge.n.3999>[ 0048 ] FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of an inspection device 3 for wafers , wherein the device according to the invention is used.

Furthermore , the laser/chemical etch formation of second channel 56 does not require use of a separate mask for second electrode 32 but instead uses second electrode 32 itself as a mask because it is not etched by sodium hydroxide. Thus , this process lowers the cost of producing the EC lens because a separate mask is not needed for each different prescription and shape of lens used.

Hones are usually applied uniformly along a tool 's edge , but cutting conditions vary greatly along a single cutting edge. At the leading edge , the uncut chip thickness is heaviest and the edge requires maximum protection. At the tool 's trailing edge , however , uncut chip thickness decreases to near zero while the hone remains the same size. Chip thickness at the trailing edge is smaller than the hone , so the cutting edge removes material inefficiently , which increases friction , cutting forces , temperature and wear rate . </edge.n.4076><edge.n.4077>Keep in mind that a large tube ( dispensing spray diameters approaching the dimensions of the edge to be etched ) could be used , but would not be as efficient as the approaches described here because of the large amount of fluid needed.

For example , about 1-2 of the surface flow may be caused to be laminar by means of this invention , achieving a reduction in wing skin-friction of 3-6 . This is because the skin friction of turbulent flow is very high around the attachment line. If the invention is used in conjunction with known suction methods along the remaining surface of the wing , a larger proportion of the flow might be kept laminar. To achieve this , several ducts may be provided at intervals along the leading edge of the aerofoil or wing. For example , about five ducts might be suitable for a medium sized transport aircraft . </edge.n.4089><edge.n.4090>A standard stable atmosphere gets cooler with increasing height and the air density falls smoothly and monotonically.

The " Ring of Fire " around the margins of the Pacific Ocean is due precisely to the subduction zones found around the edges of the Pacific plate. Subduction also is the cause of the volcanic activity in places like Japan : as the downgoing slab goes deeper beneath the overriding plate , it becomes hotter and hotter because of its proximity to the mantle. This causes the slab to melt and form magma , which moves upward through the crust and eventually forms volcanoes ( island arcs ) in oceanic crust or huge intrusive masses ( plutons and batholiths ) in continental crust. The Aleutian Islands are another example of a surface expression of subduction . </edge.n.4110><edge.n.4111>This heat travels down the iron , with some being picked up by the cap iron.

We determine how the probability of mutant survival to different time points is modified by its initial location and also assess how the frequency and spatial extent of surviving mutants may vary according to where and when they first occurred. We then run two sets of simulations to assess how landscape structure might modify the dynamics of mutations occurring during range expansions. In the first set of simulations , a single block of habitat is made unsuitable within the centre of the lattice , whereas in the second a short , narrow corridor provides the only migration route between two large areas of intact habitat. We discuss the implications of our results for populations expanding their ranges across complex landscapes and highlight some directions that future studies might pursue . </edge.n.4126><edge.n.4127>Fine grits are for honing and polishing. Once you have established bevels and flatness on the backs , you will want to polish it. Removing coarse scratches in steel with finer ones is what creates finer sharpness. Sharpness actually is where the intersection of the two planes formed by the bevel and the back meet. The finer they are polished , the sharper they will be. the act of creating the wire or feather edge happens when the bevel side of the iron or blade is abraded until the dullness has been honed away. This is required to establish a fresh edge on the tool , and can be done with any number of the different honing or grinding grits . </edge.n.4127><edge.n.4128>Oliver has a first-rate reputation as a manufacturer of highly efficient , low maintenance separators , destoners , sizers and more.

The edge seal normally included a metalization layer that was formed near an edge of the semiconductor device. Typically , several processing steps were required to form such edge seals.

Also for programming convenience the two bounding vertices are directly stored as slots on the Edge class. This mechanism efficiently supports the most typical case of straight edge geometry.

Ideally , there should be no such assumptions , but programming efficiency rewards some deviation from rigor. The superiors of an edge are a set of OneChain ( s ) , where a OneChain is an ordered sequence of edges. Again the Edge is a subclass of TopologyHierarchyNode to support the topology hierarchy.

The reverse happens when the stream moves to the top side of the edge and then the process repeats itself. As a result , a periodic flipping of the airstream from side to side can produce a sound called an edge tone. More efficient edge tone instruments can be created by coupling a slit , an edge , and an air column. When such an instrument has been produced , the frequency is determined primarily by the air column resonant frequencies which will control the rate of oscillation of the air across the edge. The edgetone effect in such an instrument serves to help initiate and sustain the tone , and can help make the transition to a higher harmonic of the air column . </edge.n.4234><edge.n.4235>14.

Because the etchant is also generally applied with a radial velocity component , and because of the centripetal acceleration effects of the rotating wafer , the thin viscous layer flows outward , down over the side edge and a few millimeters onto the backside , thus accomplishing removal of the PVD copper from all three of these areas.

The non-maximum suppression of edges removes the edgels which present an edgel of weakest intensity next to them ( in a direction orthogonal to their own direction ) . For each edgel pe , the edge intensities of its side neighbours ( in the direction of its gradient ) is computed.

As anticipated , periodic boundary conditions do not lead to any change in the shape of the range front across the entire width ( Figure 4a ) . For both absorbing and reflective boundary conditions , the shape of the range becomes more pronounced as the time since range expansion occurred increases , although the change in shape with time is greater for reflective boundary conditions ( Figures 4b and c ) .

The reflections correspond to mixed sandstone and shale topsets , locally truncated by erosional channels or the heads of canyons that extended back onto the shelf. The O-marker oolitic limestone member also produces a high amplitude seismic reflection within the topsets , and defines the boundary between the Lower and Upper divisions of the Missisauga Formation ( as defined by Jansa and Wade , 1975 ) . Topsets , including the O-marker , pass seaward into discontinuous , generally low amplitude seismic reflections corresponding to mud-prone prodelta clinoforms of the Verrill Canyon Formation ( Wade and MacLean , 1990 ) . The approximate maximum progradation limit of shelf depositional systems presented in Figures 10-13 is based on a combination of well data and recognition of seismically-defined clinoforms , where present. In the Upper Missisauga to Logan Canyon interval in particular , upper slope clinoforms are commonly offset by numerous listric growth faults that make identification of the paleo-shelf edge , and correlation of shelf stratigraphy into deepwater , challenging ( Figure 15 ) . </edge.n.4312><edge.n.4313>[ 0027 ] If the pixel 's chroma ( U and V ) values fall within the detection area 101 , the pixels is blue stretched according to the full value of the blue gain factor.

All image rows are of equal length , as are all image columns. By treating the alpha channel as a visual " mask " the rectangular image may be given a " shape " by treating the alpha channel as a cookie-cutter for the image. This is done by setting the pixels within the shape to be opaque , with pixels outside the shape set as transparent. Pixels on the boundary of the shape may be between opaque and transparent in order to provide antialiasing ( visually smooth edges ) . The description of the composition operators use this concept of image " shape " in order to make the description of the operators easier to understand. While it is convenient to describe the operators in terms of " shapes " they are by no means limited to mask-style operations since they are based on continuous floating-point mathematics rather than simple boolean operations . </edge.n.4331><edge.n.4332>The EDGE has tried to balance the ability to compete with the enjoyment of the game and the camaraderie of friends and family.

They can not , therefore , be cities , because they do not have political boundaries ( indeed , Garreau -- and others who have used the concept of edge city in their research -- have lamented problems of defining where Edge Cities area ) and therefore do not have political authority or the ability to regulate activity or guarantee rights and privileges . </edge.n.4341><edge.n.4342>Value : EDGE is packet-based , which is a more efficient way for operators to provide services.

Ford is n't giving out any details about this engine , however , as it wo n't come on stream until the end of this year , six months after the 2011 Edge goes on sale. The most the company will allow is that the EcoBoost engine will be the fuel-economy leader in the segment and that it will be bolted , like the other Edge engine options , to a six-speed automatic transmission. If , as Ford claims , the EcoBoost returns 15 percent higher fuel-efficiency than the current 3.5-liter V6 , that would give it something on the order of 21 mpg city and 30 mpg highway . </edge.n.4345><edge.n.4346>1. 1.

Shelving used in libraries and archives should be adjustable and easy to clean , with at least 1 inch of airspace above the tallest book and no rough edges or protrusions that might damage bindings. In unpolluted areas , bookshelves should be open , except at the ends , to allow maximum air circulation. In heavily polluted areas , shelves with closed backs and glass fronts are preferable and may provide some protection against fire.

The skirt comprises a remote ( in terms of distance from the fluid impinged surface ) laterallyextending portion and a close portion which extends from the outermost edge of the remote portion towards the fluid impinged surface. The remote portion of the skirt is disposed around the nozzle of the fluid supply so that the fluid supply extendsthrough a hole in the remote section. The close portion of the skirt extends closer to the fluid impinged surface than the nozzle. The skirt controls the outward movement of the fluid and deflects the fluid towards the fluid impinged surface. Theskirt allows the fluid to efficiently wet the impinged surface and provides a measure of control over the outward velocity of the fluid as it progresses outside the skirt along the impinged surface. The momentum of the fluid tends to keep it moving in astraight line , radially outward along the fluid impinged surface . </edge.n.4538><edge.n.4539>IONX LLC , a business unit of Amsted Rail , offers the Edge asset monitoring system for railcars a technically advanced , robust fleet tracking and monitoring product.

The requirements of the next-generation network can only be met with more control and functionality at the edge of the network. For example , security must be enforced regardless of when , where or how the user connects at the edge of the network via a wired office connection , a wireless LAN connection or from a remote location via an ISP. New applications will require QoS , traffic conditioning and rate limiting to allow them to all coexist on one network. Such control must be established at the edge and maintained across the network. In the case of mobility , as a user moves from one location to another , the edge must preserve the connection as appropriate from wired to wireless , in and out of the office and back again.

Cutting ability in general depends on a lot of other factors , but for any particular blade the greater the sharpness the higher the cutting ability. A coarse finish should be checked on a hard material like poly rope. The knife should cut aggressively with no slippage and progress evenly though the cord , sinking in an even manner under a light load. If the blade is left with a high polish it should be able to push cut straight through newsprint , again with a smooth cut , no snags or tears. If a more quantitative approach is required , the push cutting ability can be measured by the how much force is required to cut light thread , and the slicing aggression tested by how much edge length is require to cut some hemp using a specific amount of force. These simple tests only require the use of a regular bathroom scale and a simple spring scale . </edge.n.4577><edge.n.4578>40.8 x 49.2 cm.

A fantastic retro psych alternative to the original Beatlesesque round collar shirt. When Brian Epstein put four young Scouse lads in to suits and Chelsea Boots , he also put them in to some smart and stylish tailored style shirts - often with the Mod favoured Round Collar ( as opposed to the usual pointed collar ) . These shirts remained fashionable in different more psychedelic mod guises throughout the sixties which is where 'Camberwell ' comes in. Picking up vibes from the mod freakbeat/psycehdelic sixties scene 'Camberwell ' draws inspiration from a host of sixties stars such as Syd Barrett , Keith West , Brian Jones and Keith Moon. The Camberwell polkadot shirt is very reminiscent of the psych fueled mid to late sixties era.

With a rectangular shape the two side edges , which extend between the spanwise upstream duct entrance and the spanwise downstream edge of the plate , are arranged to discharge flow substantially normal to the spanwise flow direction of the boundary layer flow. In FIG. 4 the plate 33 is somewhat shorter. This tends to increase its angle of slope , which tends to cause flow separation at the upstream end and thus turbulent flow over the exposed surface of the plate 33. Accordingly in this embodiment the upstream end 35 of the plate 33 may be drooped or curved towards leading edge as shown in FIG. 5. Alternatively the sectional shape of the plate 33 may be cranked as shown in FIG. 6 so that the upstream end region 37 is generally equispaced or parallel to the leading edge and the downstream end portion 39 is sloped with respect thereto . </edge.n.4702><edge.n.4703>Indeed , people who are " edgy " come into therapy or analysis , and the attempt is to put an edge on their edginess , i.e. , to hone it.

A CE is typically located at the edge of a customer network , and is in communication with a PE of a service provider of an MPLS network. Customer routes between the CE and the PE are generally stored in a VPN routing and forwarding table ( VRF ) of the PE. The storage of all customer routes associated with a CE into a VRF of a PE allows the PE to locate a suitable route over which to route a received packet to a customer. However , the storage of all customer routes associated with a CE into a VRF is resource-consuming , particularly when a CE has a relatively large number of associated customer routes.

The transition is abrupt. This is seen as a sharp edge. The second histogram shows the tonal distribution of the edge as captured by a digital camera. The edge transition is now more gradual ( due to the reasons covered above ) . This has caused a loss of acutance. The edge would now appear unsharp. The third histogram shows the edge after sharpening. The sharpening has made the dark side of the edge even darker and the light side even lighter. Even though there is still some transition from one side of the edge to the other , the acutance had been significantly increased. The eye will now see the edge as being sharp again.

The shot complexity depends directly on this shot variability. To estimate the shot variability , we use the mean and standard deviation of the frame-difference sequence ( the FD-sequence ) within the shot. We compute this for each of the MERV features , and use a weighted average to determine the shot variability. Given two time instants , and , ( ) , we compute the shot variability as follows. Let be the duration. Let be the frame difference sequence using a particular multilevel feature , say ( 22 ) Similarly , we compute for color , edge response , edge-response at edge points , and the phase angle.

In the sense " that by which someone or something is bound , " it is attested from 1126 , from O.N. band " thin strip that ties or constrains , " from P.Gmc. *bindan ( related to Mod.Eng. bend and bind ) , from PIE *bendh- " to bind " ( cf. Goth bandi " that which binds; Skt. bandhah " a tying , bandage , " source of bandana; M.Ir. bainna " bracelet " ) . Most of the fig. senses of this word have passed into bond ( q.v. ) , which originally was a phonetic variant of band. The meaning " a flat strip " ( late 14c. ) is from O.Fr. bande " strip , edge , side , " via O.N.Fr. bende , from O.H.G. binda , from P.Gmc. *bindan ( see above ) . In M.E. , this was distinguished by the spelling bande , but since the loss of the final -e the words have fully merged. Meaning " broad stripe of color " is from 1470; the electronics sense of " range of frequencies or wavelengths " is from 1922.

This is a real-life behavior , called the " Fresnel " ( pronounced FREH-NELL ) effect. This increase of reflection is easy to see in real objects around you if you study them. Even a normal piece of white paper becomes quite reflective when you hold it up level with your eyes and stare across it; you can easily see lights reflected when it 's at this very glancing angle. ( Try it sitting in front of your computer; the screen is bright enough to see. ) Another good example is asphalt , which you do n't normally think of as being reflective. But think about driving at night , when you can see the taillights of the car in front of you reflected in the pavement. ( Some people believe this is a heat mirage effect , but it happens no matter what the temperatures of the pavement and air are. ) Specular highlights are also stronger when they 're at the edge since they are just a kind of reflection. The Fresnel effect also changes transparency , but it decreases the transparency at the edge . </edge.n.4829><edge.n.4830>White A-line cotton dress skillfully detailed with excess stitching , frayed edges , and ruffled detailing along the bust area is styled with a 4 button closure , and drawstring tie.

Though various methods of evaluating the sharpness of cutting edge have been developed in these several decades , the measuring with the accuracy of the order of micron or less could be obtained only by the direct observation of tool through SEM , which is not convenient for practical machining operation. In this study , a relatively simple method with reasonable accuracy is proposed for evaluating cutting edge sharpness : Cutting edge is pressed against a thin wire of soft metal at right angle , and the indentation transcribed on the wire is observed. Two ways of sharpness evaluation can be used : The one is to measure the minimum load required to make a recognizable indentation , and the other is to reproduce the cutting edge cross-section from the contour of the indentation. The cutting edge with the chamfered width of about 0.1 m can be discriminated by this method . </edge.n.4837><edge.n.4838>PhotoFrame Pro ( Win/Mac ) " When you want to add that extra finishing touch to your favorite digital photos , use what the professionals use - PhotoFrame Pro.

A punter can back as many " winners " as he likes , but if he fails to take into account the bookmaker 's prices , it may not be enough to return a profit. There will always be some losers. Really , the argument about value betting is a hypothetical one. The " back winners , not losers " philosophy is itself inherently all about finding a betting edge. If a punter is finding winners and making a profit with them , it means simply that he is winning more bets than the bookmaker believes the punter ought to be winning , according to the odds the bookmaker had set. If this is the case , the punter has found value and established a betting edge , whether he quantitatively set out to do so or just followed his hunches. Successful betting , then , is really all about understanding and managing probabilities. Know the true chances of a sporting win , and there may be profitable opportunities waiting at the bookmakers.

For example , about 1-2 of the surface flow may be caused to be laminar by means of this invention , achieving a reduction in wing skin-friction of 3-6 . This is because the skin friction of turbulent flow is very high around the attachment line. If the invention is used in conjunction with known suction methods along the remaining surface of the wing , a larger proportion of the flow might be kept laminar. To achieve this , several ducts may be provided at intervals along the leading edge of the aerofoil or wing.

They suggested that in order to effectively detect intensity changes ( edges ) , the operator needs to have two characteristics. First , it must be a differential operator , taking either a first or second spatial derivative of the image. Second , it should be capable of being tuned to act at any desired scale so that large filters can be used to detect blurry shadow edges , and small ones can be used to detect sharply focused fine detail in the image. This led to the so-called Laplacian-of-Gaussian edge operator. This is a compound operator that combines a smoothing operation , using a Gaussian-shaped , linear-phase FIR filter , with a differentation operation , using a discrete Laplacian. The edges are identified by the location of zero crossings ( recall that the second derivative changes sign in the vicinity of maxima of the first derivative ) . </edge.n.4881><edge.n.4882>TRAINERS EDGE Advantage Acidophilus formula contains advanced probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus , a bacterial that helps cleanse and detoxify the gastrointestinal tract.

The rods are abrasive so they will clean up the edge on a microscopic level , removing bent and broken steel , refreshing the edge leaving it much stronger than if just a smooth steel had been used. However the ceramic rods will leave the edge with their grit finish and thus can change the nature of the cutting performance by altering the size of the micro-teeth on the edge. A smooth steel leaves the edge tooth profile almost unchanged , with just a light polish from the slight smearing out effect. The sharpness produced by the smooth steel however is temporary as the edge will relax over time back to the deformed state. The sharpness of the ceramic rod is more stable. Since the smooth steel does not remove any metal , it does n't decrease the lifespan of the knife , however fine ceramic rods remove material to a depth of about a few microns , it would take hundreds of such sharpenings to remove one millimeter of blade steel which is a little more than one thirty second of an inch . </edge.n.4886><edge.n.4887>Advertising agencies add value to their services by offering clients a centralized self-service access point to all of their creative images , logos , media files and other digital assets.

Some casino games have a skill element , where the player makes decisions; such games are called " random with a tactical element. " While it is possible through skilful play to minimize the house advantage , it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage ( the house edge or house vigorish ) in a casino game. Such a skill set would involve years of training , an extraordinary memory and numeracy , and/or acute visual or even aural observation , as in the case of wheel clocking in Roulette . </edge.n.4952><edge.n.4953>The polar vortex edge is thus determined as the surface of in degrees of equivalent latitude , which is approximately 3.3*10-5 K m2/kg/s of Ertel 's potential vorticity at 450 K potential temperature , from the TTD result.

However the available wheels do not produce the finest quality cutting edge. Even the Tormek with 6000 grit on the leather buffing wheel did not produce the best edge in Fine Woodworking issue 157 which compared nine honing methods. Stropping on leather is discussed more below. Also the 10 " wheel on a Tormek produces a geometry very close to a single bevel so the geometry advantage is minimized. A smaller wheel would be better. So for the time being , with available equipment , hollow honing is out. ( N.B. You ca n't be sneaky and follow this method with flat honing. This would make a bigger included angle. If you want to follow by freehand flat honing then you must grind the hollow at a different angle. And if you are going to do that you do n't need to use a Tormek.

She was of Swedish descent and had a huge voice , and like many with large voices , she was suffering from imbalance in registration. Her major issue was breath pressure , and the cause was a lack of the thin edge function of the cords in the middle voice. In fact , she had never heard the term thin edges ' in her history of vocal study. I immediately placed her on staccato thin edge exercises in the middle voice and chest registers and suddenly her registers began to blend. Almost immediately her wobble or wide vibrato began to disappear , something that had plagued her for years. Then we began the process of balanced cross registration exercises or speaking from chest register through middle register and into head register. This had previously been a daunting and threatening concept for this singer. But after having felt the thin edge function and after removing the tremendous breath pressure , the instrument spoke perfectly through the registers . </edge.n.5036><edge.n.5037>Use 6 " or 8 " files for side edges ... these files are thinner and flex more easily than longer models so they 'll conform to the sidecut of the ski or snowboard better.

With Scary Sharp you do not have to worry about keeping stones flat. But the paper can wear unevenly and result in curved blade edges which you may want for some applications. The paper " dulls " and that means it cuts slower the longer it is used. Some think scary sharp is less messy than other methods. Some think its more messy. It depends if you like a water mess , oil mess or a steel dust mess. No matter what there will be some mess. However unless you use PSA backed abrasive paper you will have to deal with glue for attaching the paper to glass and probably use solvent to clean the glass after removing the paper. In place of the glass you can use a granite surface plate , jointer or table saw surface.

I have yet to find a skater who can not benefit from having someone look closely at every aspect of their abilities. A skater may be fast yet have a high heel kick. This is an indication that they are not retracting the leg along the 45 degree angle as they should. This is wasted effort and as such can be corrected through proper drills and repetition. It is imperative that the skater is able to apply these traits in fast paced game situations. Edge Advantage looks to make every skater 10 faster than they were prior to taking instruction. 10 may not sound like much , however , in the game of hockey , one wants to create separation when carrying the puck , win a race or close a distance.

In this way , loads , material properties , boundary and initial conditions are initially associated to the geometry and then transferred to the topological data to get the finite volume model for the analysis.

Correlations also were made to other nearby borehole lithologic logs published by Cederstrom ( 1945a , b , 1957 ) and Brown and others ( 1972 ) and to unpublished VDMR , VDEQ , and USGS data.

The voxels which lie inside an ellipsoid ( a 3D ellipse ) are identified ( Figure 2 ) . For each voxel inside the ellipsoid , the distance to the nearest edge of the ellipsoid is calculated. The voxel is assigned a intensity value which depends on this distance - to simulate a blurred edge , the intensity linearly decreases to zero at the edge of the ellipsoid. The number of voxels over which this decrease occurs determines the sharpness of the edge . </edge.n.5171><edge.n.5172>One piece german morion. High crest. Typical brim pointed at the front and back.

" One company has a formal yield management program , " said Cory Watkins , August CTO. " They 've studied edge defect types , excursions and process issues.

This is too loosely toleranced. The analysis concluded that the smallest yield loss occurs when the entire edge is inspected. They 're now also doing it at 200 mm , while others are specifying the actual bevel profile. " Bevel profile influences yield loss , because layers do not adhere equally on a full round as they do on a t/3 or t/4.

While toolmakers have honed the edges of cutters in some manner for thousands of years , edge " honing " became a standard in the 1970s with brush honing and polishing. Edge configurations went from sharp ( as-ground ) , honed ( radiused ) , chamfered , and chamfered and honed , to those with a variety of lands adjacent to the edge. Correct finishing of cutting-tool edges reduces edge chipping and flank wear , resulting in longer tool life. The correct cutting edge also reduces plowing in the workpiece ( which results in smaller forces ) , improves surface finishes , and reduces residual stresses in the machined product. Correct edge preparation depends on the cutter material properties , workpiece properties , machining parameters , and the many variations in coatings . </edge.n.5334><edge.n.5335>Tk_Fill3DRectangle is somewhat like Tk_Draw3DRectangle except that it first fills the rectangular area with the background color ( one corresponding to the colorName used to create border ) .

What occurs outside of this 'ring ' of circles is more or less inconsequential ... it is easy enough insure that the packing is saturated outside of the ring. The trickiness of constructing this ring of circles about a central circle is that one must find a compromise between packing as many circles as possible while making sure that each circle , in fact , contributes an edge to the resulting Voronoi Cell about the central circle. The danger is that a particular circle 's neighbors may 'cut off ' it 's contribution if these neighbors are positioned too closely ( for example ) to the central circle. And , of course , one can not use an arbitrarily large number of circles in the ring since geometrically the resulting ring might leave too much space vacant , violating the saturated condition . </edge.n.5341><edge.n.5342>I gave only three stars because I expected a big improvement from DVDO EDGE for the images in SD , such as those from DVD players or SKY boxes.

When working with an assembly , you might find it useful to work with a simplified version of a complex part. For example , a part that contains numerous round chambers and holes will process more slowly than a part from which these features have been temporarily removed. The commands in the Simplify environment allow you to reduce the complexity of a part so it processes more quickly when used in an assembly. The goal of parts simplification is to reduce the number of surfaces that make up the part. You can also control whether the simplified version or the designed version of the part is displayed in the assembly ( figure 3 ) . And , unlike more traditional tools , the Simplify feature in Solid Edge does not break or remove any assembly relationships that rely on those features . </edge.n.5427><edge.n.5428>feel free to travel through the online sales guides. in here you will find white papers , demonstration movies and heaps of information on most of Edge Software products . </edge.n.5428><edge.n.5429>Shaffer said a milling tool has a primary and secondary cutting edge.

Pixels having a luma value greater than a specified fraction of the maximum possible luma value are deemed bright enough to be blue stretched. To determine the amount of blue stretch to be applied to such a pixel , a detection area having a transition boundary is defined in the UV-plane. Pixels that fall within the detection area are blue stretched the most. Pixels that are outside the detection area but within the transition boundary are blue stretched to a lesser degree , with the amount of blue stretch decreasing as the distance from the pixel to the edge of the detection area increases. The detection area is properly limited in order to avoid blue stretching pixels in specified color ranges. Options are provided to help prevent overshooting maximum allowed blue values . </edge.n.5430><edge.n.5431>The reason we consider the surface area of the entire mass of mercury , including the part of the surface that is in contact with the glass , is because mercury does not adhere at all to glass. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area , including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass , the tube were made out of copper , the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube , the level of mercury at the centre of the tube will be lower rather than higher than at the edges ( that is , it would be a concave meniscus ) . In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container , we consider the part of the fluid 's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container . </edge.n.5431><edge.n.5432>Leaf made its bid to regain the performance lead in medium format cameras on Thursday by introducing the AFi 10.

This method also allows low contrast lines to be detected , without an excess of false alarms , because the spurious isolated noise pixels marked as edges in the first phases will not be validated in the following phases. The method is mostly based upon simple filter computations which should be able to produce fast results in hardware embodiment . </edge.n.5433><edge.n.5434>Quickly and easily find quality used Ford Edge SEL parts !

Also the finest quality edges are possible so with available equipment it is the best we can do in a practical sense. A single bevel is slower to sharpen by hand because the entire bevel must be honed. An electric platter sharpener like Lee Valley 's Veritas Mk. II Power Sharpening System could speed this method. However , Lee Valley only sells abrasive discs up to 1200x. With such a course abrasive I would either cut out finer abrasives to use on the machine or follow sharpening by honing a micro bevel with another method ( paper/glass or water stones ) . But the latter option means changing honing guides or freehand honing. The Makita 9820-2 Blade Sharpener is another platter sharpener that is used by Steve Knight with a 120x Zirconia PSA disc for freehand grinding . </edge.n.5464><edge.n.5465>If one were to apply " Inverse Henry George " outside the Clear Edge , the first step would be to find an equitable way to treat land improvements that support economic activity such as farming and forestry , as opposed to scatering urban uses such as subdivisions and retail clusters.

Pitney , Jr. have all weighed in to agree with the premise. Taylor 's incisive analysis of contemporary American politics argues that although the contemporary Republican Party is not the majority party , inherent Constitutional , political , and organizational advantages have made it the governing party. Taylor points to the Senate 's rural bias , the Republican 's superior organization , the creation of conservative think tanks , the emergence of overtly conservative media outlets , and the rightward drift of public opinion as reasons for the Republican edge. This edge , in Taylor 's view , will offer the Democrats only transitory opportunities to control either the presidency or Congress.

If the border turns a corner it will be all the more satisfying to the eye. Choose the south and east walls wherever possible , for the sun. If the shade is there , or only the west or north wall is available , you can always get around the difficulty by using shade-loving plants.

Preferably the sections are standard-shaped windows or mirrors. In addition , odd- or custom-shaped sizes may be cut from the substrate. The cut and separated section will have a central region and an edge region , or perimeter , extending completely around the section. A channel is then formed in the edge region of the separated section to electrically isolate the layers in the central region. An electrical contact is connected to the first electrode and another electrical contact is connected to the second electrode in the edge region to complete manufacture of the electrochromic device. The benefits of this process allow large substrates to be coated and thereafter physically cut to specified dimensions. This process decreases pump down cycles of the coating machine.

The problem with a value approach to investing is recognizing when the company 's situation is beginning to turn around. Many value stocks have gotten a lot cheaper before making a comeback with a large percentage falling into bankruptcy. To identify value stocks , which are making a transition , we turn to technical analysis ( TA ) . TA is not a method of predicting the future. Rather , it tracks the transactions of the smart money crowd that typically have advanced information concerning the company 's prospects. The methodology assumes that both the public and insider information is priced into a stock and that this combination is expressed through the relationship between the stock 's price and volume pattern over a period of time. By using TA to time entry points for long positions , much of the risk associated with value investing can be eliminated.

In addition , barrier 50 contacts edge region 26a of substrate 12 and first electrode 28 from subsequently to-be-applied layers , continuously around the rest of substrate 12. In this manner , barrier 50 electrically isolates first electrode 28 continuously throughout edge region 26a. As a further benefit of using a lacquer isolation barrier , barrier 50 is typically thicker than the layers coated on the substrate so that the lacquer thickness compensates for any layer roughness which may result in an electrical short. For example , contact 46 may be comprised of gold which has a very rough surface. The rough surface may penetrate through subsequently applied layers , resulting in a short , if the lacquer was not used. The thickness of the lacquer also may compensate for various shaped substrates which have various edge thicknesses or roughness . </edge.n.5597><edge.n.5598>This soft suede leather hat has the look of a true prospector.

A key idea of the design is the ordering of the structures according to intrinsic dimension and set inclusion. In earlier designs from the Geometer era , it was discovered that a fully cross-referenced network of topology elements presents difficulties in maintaining the consistency of the structure. For example , if a Vertex is deleted from the object then all the pointers from higher elements , e.g. , Edge , Face and Block have to be altered. Such maintenance can be very expensive and it is difficult to design mutation algorithms which are guaranteed to maintain correct topology. By imposing an ordering on the topological elements it is easy to insure consistency at the expense of some access efficiency. In the current design , the alteration of a Vertex is signaled by notifying the superior element , the Edge. The Edge , in turn , notifies the OneChain and etc . </edge.n.5696><edge.n.5697>Particular examples praised by Edge include the County Council 's doubling the number of Apprenticeships available and a partnership in Blyth with a master craftsman working with eight Year 10 students.

Peter G. W. Keen names this phenomenon the " process paradox , " a modern industrial problem that he deconstructs and defeats in his book The Process Edge. The basis of business acumen is common sense , Keen reminds us , but it must be combined with a rigor that measures pure worth. Processes -- not only in customer service and quality assurance , but in larger , abstract notions such as acquisition and cultural initiatives -- need to be approached in this basic manner. Using a broad , multidisciplinary approach ( Keen was an English literature major in college but has since taught management science at Stanford and MIT ) , he immerses the theory of business processes in an economic bath , refining previously overlooked processes and debunking " magical " ones. Methods that businesses institute , after proving advantageous , can still build in value , and then must be incorporated into the entire business strategy. Keen substantiates his points with real-life cases and examples , from Dell and IBM to Wal-Mart and Boeing. Managers who wish to examine their businesses holistically and within sound theory will appreciate The Process Edge , but it will prove most valuable to managers who need to enact change now . </edge.n.5740><edge.n.5741>The Edge Pro sharpening systems were developed by Ben Dale through an extensive professional sharpening experience.

If the smallest absolute difference value is greater than Tl and less than the edge values of the other two edges by an amount exceeding Th , the edge value associated with the smallest absolute difference is applied to ST filter to reconstruct the single targeted value in the second field. Preferably , the threshold values are set according to factors such as the noise level in the video signal , the amount of motion expected , and the contrast expected in an image.

A plurality of optical sensors is arranged nearly to an edge part of the wafer. Each optical sensor comprises a light emitting unit for illuminating the angle of the wafer. Furthermore , each sensor comprises a receiving part for receiving the light reflected from the angle of the wafer. The apparatus suggested in this Korean patent application , however , is not suitable for capturing single images of selected defects. The apparatus serves merely for finding defects on the edge of the wafer . </edge.n.5825><edge.n.5826>Horizontal tears or rips in the side of the foam Block. These splits are either horizontal to the plane of the foam conveyor or slightly angled. They may appear intermittently or continuously along the side of the slab. The edges of the tear are not separated to any large extent , and consequently the tears are often difficult to see. Two common causes are an excessive speed of the blowing reaction in relation to the gelation reaction and too steep an angle of rise . </edge.n.5826><edge.n.5827>Rough edge : The rough edge is the leftover product of grinding and whetting. It consists of soft metal from the cutting edge that curls in towards the whetstone when the material in the cutting edge has got too thin. The rough edge must be removed after whetting. It is removed by running a rounded piece of steel a few times along the edge on the right and left sides alternately. The rough edge crumbles and falls off. Check by running the edge of your fingernail outwards from the grinding edge and over the whetting edge. The nail should not " stick " on the rough edge : if it does , you still have the rough edge . </edge.n.5827><edge.n.5828>Acutance has to do with contrast. In particular , the contrast of adjacent , or near adjacent , pixels. The human eye and brain interpret light pixels lying next to dark pixels as an edge. The quicker the transition from light to dark ( i.e. , the greater the contrast ) , the sharper edges appear to be. This is demonstrated in Figure 1. In both Image 1 and Image 2 , there is a light gray rectangle next to a dark gray rectangle. In Image 1 , the transition between the light gray box and the dark gray box , as well as the transitions between both boxes and the green background , is quick. In this image , the contrast , and therefore the acutance , is high. As can be clearly seen , the edges appear sharp and well defined. Image 2 has the same configuration of boxes except that the transitions between the boxes , and the boxes and the background , have been made more gradual. The contrast along the edges has been lowered. Image 2 has a low acutance. This low acutance is interpreted by the eye as a lack of sharpness . </edge.n.5828><edge.n.5829>In the campaign , Obama has taken advantage of his record and used it as evidence of superior judgment.

Also as illustrated in FIG. 2B , the differences in polishing pressures on the leading edge 104a andthe trailing edge region 104d are significant. Therefore , through independent control of fluid pressure under the regions 104a d , the polishing pressure , especially under regions outside the area of the wafer 104 , may be adjusted to provide optimal andconsistent polishing pressures over the different regions of the wafer 104. Consequently , embodiments of the present invention independently control the polishing pressures outside the area of the wafer in addition to areas within the area of the waferto optimize the wafer polishing process . </edge.n.5836><edge.n.5837>Winning Edge Athletics is affordable !

To do this , the opened razor is held with thumb and three fingers so that the opened holder points away from the face. Lathered with good shaving soap and thus made supple , the skin must be tightened; the razor is moved at an angle of approx. 30 firstly in the direction of growth of the beard and then against the direction of growth. If held too flat , the razor rips the stubble; if held too upright , it cuts the skin. Always move it in the direction of the cutting edge and never horizontally ( danger of injury ); always draw it through evenly and hold it a little more upright at corners , dimples and at the upper lip. If the razor gets damaged by being dropped or when being put into its holder , it should not be used further.

This causes flow to exit laterally either side of the plate 20 from the exit openings 23 defined between the plate 20 and the wing leading edge 22. The upstream end of the plate 20 is spaced above the turbulent boundary layer BLt. A laminar boundary layer flow BLt may thus be initiated on the outer surface of the plate 20 at the upstream edge 24 of the plate , and may propagate spanwise along the surface of the plate 20 to rejoin the leading edge 22. This establishes a laminar flow on the leading edge of the body downstream spanwise of the plate 20 . </edge.n.5891><edge.n.5892>To me , the lovely leftovers of underlying painting layers are beautiful to look at if you get up close to a painting.

You know that when a given amount of air is accelerated ( its speed increases ) , the pressure drops. It follows that if we guide air through a narrowing slot ( a funnel ) it must go faster and faster to get through and if the exit is smaller than the entrance we have a definite suction at the exit. So , if we cut a slot near the leading edge with a funnel shape and further orient the exit lips so that the fast air runs out tangent to the air foil , this will help reactivate the boundary layer and will allow us to in crease the lift on our wing up to CL equivalent to 3 to 3.1 , which is over twice the original plain airfoil value of 1.5 . </edge.n.5893><edge.n.5894>I have created a part , rectangular with pins on the left , right and bottom sides.

For only $ 249 at Hobby Lobby , including several prop adapters , this motor will be hard to beat for reducing the cost of giant scale conversions to electric power. The AXI 5330 motor runs at 87 efficiency for just under 2000 watts. This means that little power is being lost as heat. I expect to easily have 3000 watt burst power levels which will provide 150 watts/lb. on my Edge 540.

This is similar to the flow pattern that forms deep-water masses at the edges of the polar ice shelves. ( The deep-water-mass formation problem is more complex because the freezing and melting of seawater affects not only the temperature but also the salinity of the water. ) Because this is a short-wavelength flow pattern , the endothermic 660-km phase transformation acts as an efficient barrier to the flow ( Tackley , 1996 ) . Given the nature of convective instabilities ( Turcotte &amp;Schubert , 1982 ) , the flow would naturally adopt a horizontal wavelength similar to ( i.e. , 1-1.5 times ) the depth ( ~ 600 km ) .

The lack of a clamp permits the blade to be rotated as the hone is drawn , the goal being to keep the hone perpendicular to the edge. This is an easy task as judging a ninety degree or " square " angle is n't difficult and it allows a constant angle to be ground from choil to tip and permits the sharpening of blades with significant curvature.

Additional work items were finalized in 3GPP Release 8 in March 2009. EDGE Evolution is also referred to as EDGE II or Evolved EDGE by some industry sources. EDGE Evolution will boost data speeds by up to 300 percent and will significantly improve latency , coverage , and spectrum efficiency of existing GSM-EDGE equipment. This improved data performance in GSM will be as important as high-speed HSPA is today and LTE will be in tomorrow ' s networks . </edge.n.5951><edge.n.5952>Four runs are scored if the ball bounces before touching or going over the edge of the field and six runs if it does not bounce before passing over the boundary in the air. These events are known as a four or a six respectively. When this happens the runs are automatically added to the batsman 's and his team 's score and the ball becomes dead. If the ball did not touch the bat or a hand holding the bat , four runs are scored as the relevant type of extra instead; but six runs can not be scored as extras , even if the ball clears the boundary ( which is in any case extremely unlikely ) . </edge.n.5952><edge.n.5953>[ 0014 ] According to a preferred embodiment of the invention , the gradient image is generated by coupling a first directional gradient image with a second directional gradient image. The first directional gradient image is created in that gradients in the gray value image are determined in a first direction and the second directional gradient image is created in that gradients in the gray value image are determined in a direction perpendicular to the first direction. A procedure of this kind is advantageous , for example , with the use of a Sobel operator. With a gradient determination of this kind , the direction of the gradients can be detected at edges to be identified. This is advantageous because line areas around edges with closed paths can be determined. When such paths are determined , then the threshold value for the binarization as mean value of gray values of the gray value image can be computed in the line areas around edges . </edge.n.5953><edge.n.5954>This is a complete refresh of the Edge Portfolio Analyzer.

He flattens the back of the blade on the 800x and 1200x stones. However his method is very different on the back of the blade when he uses the 8000x stone. I would have to repeat the article to explain his " ruler trick " well. Essentially when working on the back of the blade on the 8000x stone , he puts a 1/32 inch thick ruler between the blade and the stone. The ruler is parallel to the cutting edge and back from the edge by about 2 1/2 inches at the start of the stroke and 1 3/4 inch at the end of the stroke as he pulls the blade across the stone and ruler. This angles the blade to the stone surface and produces a 1 degree back bevel on the blade which he says has no real affect on how the plane functions. This is much like Brent Beach 's method but Brent goes a little further with this idea and never flattens the back of the blade even with course abrasives . </edge.n.5969><edge.n.5970>" This was the first time in two years that the ranking of the top five edge router vendors has changed , said Shin Umeda , Vice President at Dell ' Oro Group.

I have to say , I really love them both ... and actually like this one better. This was a great suspense story involving a high-society news reporter name Jillian , a mysterious stalker , and ( what else ? ) a BODYGUARD named Nolan. Nolan is a great character ... with a gorgeous body , a bit of baggage from being in the Army Rangers , and a wonderful heart. I loved watching the animosity between Nolan and Jillian turn into sensual tension and then , of course , love. And , of course , this lug-head Nolan fights it as he feels he is not good enough for her. THIS BOOK IS A REAL PAGE TURNER ! ! </edge.n.6021><edge.n.6022>StereoTimes reports from the 2005 T.H.E.

Since so little was known about the fuzzy boundary , he began studying it to see if he could find some properties that could be exploited. Using a computer , he began sampling lunar orbits , searching for the place where the instability and chaos began. What he quickly found was that nature could be kind as well as complex. Even though the structure inside the fuzzy boundary was impossibly complicated , Belbruno recalls , I found that the chaotic region itself began at a very well defined place. That clearly demarcated edge was the last stable lunar orbit , a gravitational path that was barely attached to the moon and yet didn ' t disappear into the fuzzy boundary. There was a similar weakly bound terrestrial orbit leading from Earth to the sharp outer edge of the fuzzy boundary. Finding those two orbits was the breakthrough Belbruno needed. An almost unbound lunar orbit can be easily connected with an almost unbound Earth orbit , he says. The two orbits have nearly the same velocity , so almost no rocket power is required to switch from one to the other. </edge.n.6023><edge.n.6024>A To enhance the attractiveness of the EDGE program to potential investors to ensure Newfoundland and Labrador remains at the forefront of the competition in encouraging new business investment within the province.

For example , if you bet $ 100 by placing the 6 and 8 on yourself and on others , you can never win at the game if you play with more than three random rollers at your table. Let us say that you are able to get a 5 percent edge on your throw. You bet $ 100 on yourself by placing the 6 and 8. Since the house has a 1.5 percent edge on these bets , you win $ 3.50. Now , you bet on a random roller. You lose $ 1.50 on the first one , $ 1.50 on the second , and $ 1.50 on the third. You are now down one dollar. With each subsequent random roller , you go down for $ 1.50 more.

Since Matousek 's lower bound on monotone paths is larger than our known upper bound on minimum spanning trees , there are some monotone paths that do not correspond to minimum spanning tree sequences. I tried a simplified example in which m lines are partitioned into sqrt m " cables " of sqrt m lines each , with an additional m lines connecting up the intersections of pairs of cables in such a way that each intersection contributes sqrt m vertices ( both convex and concave ) to the monotone path. It is possible to represent this monotone path as a lower envelope of a simple family of concave chains , however when I tried to translate this family back into graph-theoretic terms I ended up with " coat-hangers " ( triangles with a dangling edge ) instead of paths . </edge.n.6044><edge.n.6045>A method for operating a video tool to perform precision edge detection in an image.

Extreme skiers who drop into ultra-steep or icy chutes will graduate the bevel along the length of their skis , such as a 2 degree side bevel underfoot that changes to a 0 or .5 degree bevel at the tips and tails. Conversely , they 'll start with a 2 degree base edge bevel at the tips and tails , then taper down to a 0 degree base edge bevel underfoot. This allows their skis to get great grip underfoot ( handy when you 're perched above a cliff or crevasse ) , while allowing the tips and tails to turn easily in narrow chutes . </edge.n.6099><edge.n.6100>As an agency , we are extremely proud to have been chosen to host such a prestigious event that is primary designed to represent and showcase the multiculturalism of the Borough of Croydon in terms of its businesses and populace.

Twenty degrees is very close to 22.5 and will work as a guide to create a secondary bevel . </edge.n.6160><edge.n.6161>We now satisfied the installation requirements.

This varies from game to game , and to some degree , from place to place. It is expressed as a percentage. A 5 house edge means that , on average , you will receive back 95 of the money you bet over a period of time. For example , if you were to bet $ 100 ( 20 bets of $ 5 each ) , you would , on average , have $ 95 left when you finished the run. Nevada Gaming Regulations limit the house edge to no more than 25 ; other gaming locations may or may not have such a restriction . </edge.n.6168><edge.n.6169>Brad Nichol , President and CEO of Edge Resources explains what the above facts mean in much simpler terms , " In less than four months , during one of the worst market cycles in a decade , the Company has created more than $ 12 million in value with less than $ 3 million of capital.

This method operates on a set of boundary fragments that are produced by edge detection. Boundary extraction identifies a subset of these fragments and connects them sequentially to form a closed boundary with the largest saliency. We encode the Gestalt laws of proximity and continuity in a novel boundary-saliency measure based on the relative gap length and average curvature when connecting fragments to form a closed boundary. This new measure attempts to remove a possible bias toward short boundaries. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the most-salient closed boundary. We also present supplementary preprocessing steps that facilitate the application of ratio contour to real images. We compare ratio contour to two closely related methods for extracting closed boundaries : Elder and Zucker 's method based on the shortest-path algorithm and Williams and Thornber 's method based on spectral analysis and a strongly-connected-components algorithm.

The first and second entry ports 406 and 410 are formed through a lid assembly 420 that is supported on walls 415 of the process chamber 402. The walls 415 also include the assembly of a liner 422 through which a process volume 416 of the process chamber 402 may be evacuated by a vacuum pump ( not shown ) .

In an edge processing mode of operation , the plasma generation volume 370A receives an etching gas from the etching gas source 304 via the first entry port 306. In the meantime , the gas bowl 362 may be grounded , such that RF power supplied by the RF power source 375 to the electrode 373 excites the etching gas present in the plasma generation volume 370A between the exposed surface 380 of the electrode 373 and the inner side 382 of the outer wall 365. To facilitate the ionization of the etching gas , the inner side 382 may include a slant portion 388 that is inclined relative to the exposed surface 380 of the electrode 373. An etching agent in a plasma phase is thereby formed from the etching gas in the plasma generation volume 370A. The etching agent then is flowed via the slits 372 into the process volume 316 to etch a portion of the deposition film at the peripheral edge region of the substrate 320 . </edge.n.6182><edge.n.6183>voice over for radio and television commercials , elearning , infomercial , narration , .

This took careful measurement and cutting ( and a bit of shimming and filling ) to ensure a proper fit. Also , since I wouldn ' t be using the kit ' s tower deck , I had to fabricate a new deck from thin styrene sheet. After cementing the styrene deck to the tower lower structure ( ahead of the grafted upper gun platform ) , the entire deck surface was flat , seam-free and level.

Why are green flashes green ? Blue light is refracted more strongly than green or red and the sun 's upper edge might be expected to be rimmed with blue outside a band of green. This rarely happens because so little blue light remains in the rays of the setting sun. Blue light is strongly scattered by air molecules , small dust and aerosol particles out of the direct rays. There is a further effect , traces of ozone absorb the orange light which makes the contrast between the red sun and green flash even more dramatic . </edge.n.6229><edge.n.6230>Jianhua Xuan , T.

In addition , a curve 204 shows a dynamic ( when the wafer is spinning ) polishing profile , and a curve 206 shows an average of thepolishing profiles for the trailing edge and the leading edge. As can be seen , the trailing edge profile curve 208 has a lower and flatter normalized polishing removal than the leading edge profile curve 202. To alleviate the large differential in edgepolishing , embodiments of the present invention utilize fluid pressures applied by a platen in regions outside of the contact area between the polishing pad and the wafer to increase polishing consistency during the CMP process. Therefore , the presentinvention may be utilized to flatten out the curves 202 and 208 to generate more consistent polishing on the edges of the wafer . </edge.n.6309><edge.n.6310>Importing the Edge Subscription file will establish an authenticated communication channel as well as complete the Edge Subscription process by beginning an initial replication.

One of another technique , make a cutting movement parallel to your arm , trying to cut a few hairs not directly above the skin surface , but 3-5 mm above. A sharp edge will bite into the hair , a blunt knife will not. If the hair test is positive but shaving not , the blade may be irregularly sharpened or the hardening process might be done incorrect.

Otherwise , if the base is convex , you 'll get too much bevel ... and if concave , too little bevel. Sometimes those expensive stone grinds change your edge bevel , and your favorite skis just are n't the same. To measure the amount of bevel on an edge , I darken the edge surface using a marking pen. I put a fine diamond stone in the beveling tool , set it for the angle I want to test , and make a light pass over the edge. If the stone removes marking pen ink across the entire width of the edge , the bevel angle is the same as what the tool is set for. If it removes ink from only the inside of the edge ( next to the p-tex ) , then the bevel is greater than what the tool is set for. If it removes ink from only the outside , then the angle is less. The same test can also be done on side edges as well.

All week Industry chatter focused on whether the director , unquestionably brilliant behind the camera , can regain the star status he enjoyed before that July 2006 drunken anti-semitic rant damaged his public image. But how this new pic performs may relate more to Mel 's present day status as an aging action star whose appeal now lies mainly with older males. Produced and financed by GK Films , the Martin Campbell-directed Edge Of Darkness on Friday debuted exactly as Warner Bros expected. It received a " B+ " CinemaScore and opened to $ 5.6 million Friday and $ 7.4M Saturday ( +30 -- maybe Mel fans who spent Friday night at Shabbos dinner were first in line Saturday ) from a wide release of 3 , 066 theaters.

An edge in a wire has only one coedge; however , one edge can be used by many faces. When an edge is used by two or more faces , its coedges are ordered around the edge. If only two faces meet at an edge , the two coedges from those faces point to each other through the coedge partner pointers. ( If there is only one coedge , its partner pointer is NULL. ) If more than two faces meet at an edge , the coedges partner pointers form a circular linked list. The order of the list is important , because it represents the radial ordering of the faces about the edge in a counterclockwise direction. The following figure shows a sheet body that contains a non-manifold ( more than two faces incident ) edge. The edge is directed such that it is coming toward the reader and the coedges are ordered counterclockwise about it in the partner list as indicated by the arrow . </edge.n.6361><edge.n.6362>It should be noted that if the distance is not very much larger than the baffle size , the baffle step will not be a full 6 dB.

The longer distance combined with the distance law will reduce the sound pressure produced by the edge sources relatively more at close range.

I believe that the reason for that is the fact the lottery commissions consider the players to be both wimps and mathematical idiots. But we are neither , are we ? We know the fundamental truth , we have science on our side. Let 's make our voice heard. Otherwise , the lotteries will turn worse , and worse , and worse for the players. Just recently , Pennsylvania Lottery introduced a new game ( Super 6 ) with extremely high odds : about 120 million to one ! Even worse , the player is only allowed to choose his/her own numbers for one out of three tickets. Well , that basically means that your odds worsen by two-thirds ( 66.7 ) ! You should never , ever play games in which you may not select your own numbers ! For this reason alone , I always strongly advise against playing the casino slot machines. Still , the one-armed bandits are ruled by a 10 house advantage , while the state lotteries punish us with a 50 to 90 + house edge ( 5 to 19 times worse ) ! </edge.n.6377><edge.n.6378>Color lithograph poster , 40 x 25 inches.

The mull is wider than the book is thick , and must be sufficently wide to allow the overhanging part to be glued to the inside edge of the covering boards. The pastedown end paper is then attached which hides and further secures the attached mull to the covers.

Lateral contacts between undisturbed stratigraphic units and syn-impact ( at the time of the impact ) units are complex. A narrow band ( 2.5 to 8 miles , generally less than 5 miles ) of Exmore tsunami-breccia deposits is preserved around the outside of the crater 's outer rim and is affected by the bounding fault zone and other faults that were apparently produced or reactivated by the impact.

As time since introduction increases , the percentage survival of deleterious mutations is minimal except in the case of mutations introduced at a reflective boundary ( Figure 5a ) . The percentage survival of neutral mutations is dependent on where the novel mutant is introduced and the boundary condition employed ( Figure 5b ) . The point of origin of the novel mutant and boundary condition leads to less variation in percentage survival for beneficial mutations ( Figure 5c ) . For all three fitness types , mutants that survive for 200 time steps also have a high probability of surviving for up to 300 time steps ( Figure 5 ) . This effect is especially pronounced for deleterious mutants that first arise at a habitat edge with reflective boundary conditions . </edge.n.6625><edge.n.6626>Part present/not present applications are typical in electronic connector assembly and mechanical assembly applications. The objective of the application is to use line profiles and edge detection to determine if a part is present or not present. An edge along the line profile is defined by the level of contrast between background and foreground and the slope of the transition. Using this technique , you can count the number of edges along the line profile and compare the result to an expected number of edges. The method of limiting processing to lines , known as line profiling , offers a less numerically intensive alternative to other image processing methods such as image correlation and pattern matching . </edge.n.6626><edge.n.6627>Companies that out-perform the competition systemically develop IC management capacities.

Big props for the tilt and telescope wheel too , it 's about time American automakers got hip to that feature. Ford still has n't caught on to the automatic window craze though , because only the driver 's side window is one-touch down.

Canny edge detection [ 59 ] is then performed to identify the aliasing boundary in the image by marking the local maxima of the gradient using a non-maxima suppression technique. The magnitude of the gradient at these local maxima is scaled to the range [ 0 , 255 ] to produce an edge magnitude map that is returned as the destination image. Pixels that are not local maxima have values of zero in this map. The Canny edge detector provides excellent results and has the advantage that it thins edge gradient maps down to edges that are a single pixel in width. These pixels can then be linked to form an array of points corresponding to the spatial coordinates at each position along an identified edge. A description of the Canny edge detection algorithm can be found in Jain [ 2 ] . </edge.n.6637><edge.n.6638>Broker Pilots Electronic Signatures to Get Clear Competitive Edge : 'We want to do everything we can to implement a paperless file.

Although image segmentation is important in many applications , it remains one of the most difficult tasks in image processing such that even the most advanced , state-of-the-art , algorithms to date produce only reasonable results. These algorithms are usually based on one of two approaches : Patch-based ( similarity based ) approach or Boundary-based ( dissimilarity based ) approach and therefore , enjoys the benefit of one ( and suffers from its shortcomings ) while not enjoying the benefits of the other. This work focuses on a new segmentation algorithm , which combines patch-based information with edge cues under a probabilistic framework. We use multiple Gaussians for building a statistical model ( GMM ) with colour ( L*a*b* ) and location features , and we incorporate edge information based on texture , colour and brightness differences into the EM algorithm. We examine several edge detectors ( and their modifications ) and edge inclusion methods.

Pixel 1 receives white light from the white part of the flower. The pixel accurately records this as a white point. Pixel 2 receives little or no light from the black background. The pixel accurately records this as a black point. However , Pixel 3 has a problem; the edge crosses through this pixel. Part of the pixel receives white light from the white part of the flower , and part of the pixel receives little or no light from the black background. Unfortunately , the pixel can not record part white and part black. It can record only one shade. Therefore the pixel records a gray tone. When the eye looks at the flower , it sees a crisp white/black edge. What the sensor sees is a softened white/gray/black edge. In essence , the pixels have lowered the acutance of the edge . </edge.n.6656><edge.n.6657>In PowerPoint 98 , the boundaries of a shape are calculated based on the assumption that the shape has no border.

If it has a border , the border extends past the edge of the slide.

The second derivative of the filtered image is determined. The zero crossing a points of the second derivative image are identified as potential border pixels. Combining these three steps together , a Marr 's theory based edge is defined as the zero-crossings of the Laplacian of the Gaussian operator ( i.e. , the Gaussian function behaves as a low pass filter ) applied to the image for various values of sigma , the standard deviation of the Gaussian function.

The edges of these panels which are uppermost when the container is open may be described as " falling " or " rising " in the preferred form. The tucked panels have falling top edges , that is , they decrease in height from the container rim in a direction from the external fold to the internal fold. The quadrilateral exposed panels have a rising top edge from the internal fold to the external fold. The number of the internal and external folds used is determined primarily by the number of panels chosen for the top of the closed container . </edge.n.6728><edge.n.6729>The Outside Edge expedition is also carrying a scroll from South African National Parks with a message encouraging a conservation partnership with its neighbours in Africa.

Opposite positioning also reduces the possibility of a short circuit. Furthermore , remote positioning reduces the bulk of system 14 in a single region of edge region 26a so that lens 12 may be easily placed in an eyeglass frame. A stacked , adjacent positioning of the contacts may be desirable to hide contacts 46 and 48 within a frame when the frame only covers a portion of the lens perimeter , such as sports lenses wherein the frame only covers the top portion of a single long lens covering both wearer 's eyes.

The difference between stropping and a sharpening steel is the direction the blade travels. With the steel , you are running the knife edge along the steel.

An optical depth of unity is that thickness of absorbing gas from which a fraction of 1/e photons can escape. This is what defines the visible edge of a star since it is at an optical depth of unity that the star becomes opaque. The radiation reaching us is closely approximated by the sum of all the emission along the entire line of sight , up to that point where the optical depth is unity. When we look near the edge of a star , we can not " see " to the same depth as when we look at the center because the line of sight must travel at an oblique angle through the stellar gas when looking near the limb. In other words , the solar radius at which we see the optical depth as being unity increases as we move our line of sight towards the limb . </edge.n.6808><edge.n.6809>Black Zilla , Edge juice w/attitude , 8.5 lift , 37x13.5 toyos , egr &amp;dpf deletes , mega cannon intake , 3.5 innercooler tubes , isspro guages , southbend cluth , every recon light available , 2x10 probox , 2x1000 kicker zx amps , kenwood dvd , infinity refrence highs . </edge.n.6809><edge.n.6810>We are a small and upcoming kennel located in Wilmington , DE that strives to produce the best in American Pitbull Terriers.

Big deal. The paper then adds a lot of evolutionary gloss , but that 's all it is : inference based upon assumptions , not hard evidence. It in no way demonstrates the power of random mutation and natural selection , and at best provides an example of how " Darwinists point to evidence of common descent and erroneously assume it to be evidence of the power of random mutation " ( Behe , Edge of Evolution , pg. 95 ) ( and even then , this assumes that sequence similarity is necessarily evidence for common ancestry ) . </edge.n.6812><edge.n.6813>I runnin both your products The Edge juice with the A2 Monitor Along With the Edge Evolution.

As a result , EDGE customers are assured of having some level of packet-data service at home and when traveling.

The algorithm first finds all of the vertical bars of the displays by drawing a horizontal line at levels that are 1/3 and 2/3 the height of the ROI. The line slices through the activated segments and returns the position of each vertical segment by using an image processing function called edge detection. An edge along the line profile is defined by the level of contrast between background and foreground and the slope of the transition. Using this technique you can determine if any of the seven segments are defective active at the wrong time or inactive at the wrong time. This method of limiting processing to lines , known as line profiling , offers a less numerically intensive alternative than other image processing methods such as image correlation and pattern matching. Once the position of the vertical segments is known , the algorithm next locates horizontal segments by inspecting the pixels along a vertical line profile drawn between the location of the vertical segments . </edge.n.6847><edge.n.6848>Any discussion of head voice and falsetto involves a basic consideration of vocal phonation. Resonance , of course , has an effect on phonation in these areas , as it does in all areas of singing , but the primary differences between falsetto and head voice are phonational. The modern definition of falsetto is a voice production in which the vocalis muscles ( for simplicity 's sake the thyro-arytenoids ) are inactive and lengthened greatly by the action of the crico-thyroid muscles which are at their nearly maximum contraction. The sound is produced by the air blowing over the very thin edges of the thyro-arytenoids and the pitch is controlled mostly by a regulation of the breath flow. If , at any time , the thyro-arytenoids began to resist this extreme lengthening of themselves and provide some resistance to the action of the cryco-thyroids , the vocal mechanism begins to move into head voice . </edge.n.6848><edge.n.6849>Sharpening stones generally need oil or water to help work the steel , a few drops of either applied to the stone during the sharpening process help to achieve a sharper edge quicker.

While it is easy to increase the back bevel angle , it is much harder to decrease the back bevel angle. The proper procedure for removing a large back bevel is to grind the front primary bevel until the entire back bevel has been removed , then start honing. This is slow , involves regrinding through the existing edge , and shortens the blade. It is much better to dedicate a blade to the steeper back bevel . </edge.n.6868><edge.n.6869>The only drawback of the Apex is that it can not handle extreme curvatures such as found on a Hawkbill. Essentially the curvature can not be of such an extent that the blade changes shape significant over the width of the hone , about an inch. For the blade that are so radically shaped , optimal sharpeners are rod based systems of which the Spyderco Sharpmaker is the current flagship model. Serrations also can not be honed except to give the back a light lapping. This will maintain the edge for awhile , cut eventually they will have to be fully sharpened , this is again one of the strengths of rod sharpeners such as the Sharpmaker . </edge.n.6869><edge.n.6870>NASA EDGE is different.

( 1975 , p. 231 ) Many more poetic testimonies to an edge-psychology might be invoked if time permitted. There is , for example , the striking figure in Matthew Arnold 's poem , " Dover Beach , " of the " edges drear " of a contemporary life poised between the demise of one modality of meaning and prior to the coming of a new one , like das Zwischen of Heidegger , between the gods that have fled and those that are to come ( Arnold , 1959 , p. 836; Heidegger , 1962 , pp. 142 , 170 , 276 , 425-427 , 442; Heidegger , 1949 , p. 288; compare Richardson , 1967 , pp. 6 , 11 , 101 , 155 , 447 , 160 , 589 ) . Such examples could be multiplied , but for now let Stevens and Roethke suffice to indicate the psychological point that , not only the patient , but also the analyst , may appropriately say : " The edge is what I have " in every sense of the word " edge.

The normal liver is smooth , with no irregularities. When the liver can be felt , it is usually due to : ( 1 ) increased diaphragmatic descent; ( 2 ) presence of a palpable caudate or Riedel 's lobe; ( 3 ) presence of emphysema with an associated depressed diaphragm; ( 4 ) thin body habitus with narrow thoracic cage; ( 5 ) fatty infiltration ( enlarged with rounded edge ); ( 6 ) active hepatitis ( enlarged and tender ); ( 7 ) cirrhosis ( enlarged with nodular irregularity ); or ( 8 ) hepatic neoplasm ( enlarged with rock-hard or nodular consistency ) . </edge.n.7088><edge.n.7089>To eliminate an over-honed edge , draw the razor backward in a diagonal line across the hone , using the same movement and pressure as in regular honing.

However , an often overlooked , but critical component to designing service provider edge platforms is tight integration with an element management system ( EMS ) from design inception. While the lack of network management in core routers is common , at the edge , service provisioning is too complex to relegate solely to complex scripts. In addition , tight coupling of element management with the architecture of the device is critical as service providers move to next-generation management structures where hundreds or thousands of customers may be accessing device data. This must be thought out from the beginning of product development , as integrating scalable network management into the device is extremely difficult . </edge.n.7116><edge.n.7117>On the Edge : Parody Parody is considered one of the " fair uses " defined in the Copyright Act , but just calling something a parody or satire is not enough to keep you out of court.

" Owners of well-known works are not likely to appreciate the parody , and also are likely to have the will and the resources to take you to court. Even if you prevail , it can take years.

Schematic paleogeography map for the Jurassic , showing the Abenaki carbonate platform along the edge of the stable continental margin. Three main facies zones are shown , corresponding to an inner low energy shelf , an outer high energy shelf , and the steep foreslope that extends into deepwater ( see Kidston et al. , 2005 for further details ) . Coeval with the development of the carbonate bank was the deposition of the Upper Jurassic Mic Mac Formation and its equivalents , consisting of a mix of clastics and carbonates that are thickest in the NE corner of the figure. Significant growth faulting and salt mobilization took place while the Mic Mac Formation was deposited. In the areas of Parcels 1 and 2 , a time-thickness map for the J350 and J280 markers shows the distribution of the earliest minibasins above autochthonous salt. The minibasins are assumed to contain Jurassic strata composed of the deepwater equivalents of the Mic Mac Formation , as well as strata equivalent to the Mohican Formation. Sediment input into deepwater is presumed to be normal or sub-normal to the steep Abenaki slope. Salt outlines on this map are highly schematic.

The body of the driver is 6A4V titanium , which is used in most titanium drivers. The crown , however , is made of 15-3-3-3 beta titanium , which is very thin ( 0.4 mm ) and light , and helps keep the driver 's center of gravity very low. Instead of using a welding process to attach the crown to the body of the driver , Tour Edge uses a unique ( some would say " exotic " ) combo-brazing process. This is proprietary chemical bonding process that creates a permanent bond using a vacuum heat-curing technique. According to Tour Edge , the advantage of combo-brazing is eliminating the relatively heavy metal used in traditional welds , while improving feel and energy transfer due to the integrity of the bond between the crown and the body . </edge.n.7149><edge.n.7150>While wider than the lower wear bevel , the upper wear bevel appears to be much flatter.

The duct 36 takes the form of a plenum chamber , with the entrance being an aperture opening onto and extending around the leading edge surface. The downstream spanwise end of the aperture 38 defines a free edge 40 for initiating a laminar boundary layer flow. The plenum chamber 36 is arranged to draw off the turbulent boundary layer BLt flowing along the attachment line 18 upstream spanwise of the entrance aperture 38 to prevent contamination of the laminar boundary layer downstream. In this embodiment a suction pump 42 may be employed to draw the turbulent boundary layer into the plenum chamber 36 and to discharge it along a channel 44 to an exit opening aft of the wing. Alternatively the flow may discharge naturally due to the lower pressure at the exit of the channel 44 . </edge.n.7166><edge.n.7167>Many implements have a cutting edge which is essentially straight.

The point is , as Kafka wrote , that psychologically " auf dieses Messers Schneide leben wir " [ we live on the razor 's edge ] ( 1958 , p. 158-59 ) . Analytic material lies on the edges of experience , and psychology 's work , if successful , gives the person , as Baynes witnessed , an experience of a psychological edge.

If you already know what angle your knife is sharpened at , you probably wish to sharpen at this angle again. If you do n't know your angle but wish to , ask the manufacturer of your knife or inquire at a knowledgeable knife shop to determine what angle is appropriate for your knife. Otherwise , you must make a decision : choose an angle of 10 -30 per side; shallower angles make a sharper edge that does n't last as long , steep angles are more durable , 17 is a good compromise : select an angle that matches the use the knife will receive. When shopping for a sharpening system , make sure it provides an edge guide mechanism that supports at least a couple of different angles . </edge.n.7190><edge.n.7191>Testing by shaving can be misleading if the blade has a burr or wire edge. Steel naturally forms a burr - a thin bendable projection on the edge - during the sharpening process. A blade with a burr will shave but will not stand up to hard use. To test for a burr , slide your fingertips lightly from the side of the blade over the edge. You will feel the burr drag against your fingers. Test from both sides , because burrs are usually bent over one way or the other. As your sharpening improves you will be looking for smaller and smaller burrs . </edge.n.7191><edge.n.7192>We can easily verify whether the first synchronization pushed the expected information to the Edge server.

As long as you stroke to the side and not back , this happens almost naturally. The force generated by the completed stroke on the opposite leg pushes your hips laterally across the midline of your direction of travel. The landing skate is then slightly crossed under your body when you first set it down on its outside wheel edges. As you initiate the new push , this skate tips across its center edge and then onto the inside edge as you complete your leg extension.

So the whetting edge gives no support to the whetstone and has to be whetted free-hand - which is very difficult , since you can never whet an edge free-hand and keep the exact same angle all the way along. The angle is likely to vary by up to 5 degrees , but this will not be evident since the whetting edge will be slightly rounded. You will notice the problem when you use the knife , because it will not have the " bite " you want. Whet the whetting edge in the same way but with less pressure , in small circles. Begin with a fine whetstone , then use a superfine and round off by polishing , removing the roughss edge ( see below ) and running a superfine whetstone lightly along the edge once or twice. As a final measure you can run the edge against a piece of leather , such as the back of a belt. Begin from the back of the knife and draw the blade away from the edge - never the other way , unless you want to cut the belt ( or your fingers ) . </edge.n.7253><edge.n.7254>In today 's marketplace , there are thousands upon thousands of products and services available to fulfill the needs of individuals and businesses.

While it 's possible to mount different rear sights on an Edge , each of them will be adjusted differently than the AirForce Adaptive Rear Target Sight the gun was designed for.

Emma 's father , Ron Craven , ( Bob Peck in a star-making performance ) will not be silenced and , as a police detective , is uniquely positioned to pursue his own unofficial investigation. He moves from grief to a determination to find the truth , all the while advised and/or comforted by Emma , but is she a ghost or a manifestation of his haunted psyche ? Craven digs deeper , uncovering labyrinthine conspiracy in the nuclear industry and , as the body-count rises , encounters the garrulous CIA agent Darius Jedburgh ( a superb Joe Don Baker ) with a mysterious agenda of his own. Accompanied by a haunting musical score by Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton , Edge of Darkness builds on the legacy of Tinker Tailor , Soldier Spy and Smiley 's People to become quite simply the best television thriller ever. Originally shown in six , 50-minute episodes , this tape presents the first half of the groundbreaking environmental-espionage shocker , tightening the ratchets of suspense to levels which would have turned Hitchcock himself green ... with envy. -- Gary S.

Most right-handed mechanics , for example , will unconsciously bear down harder with their right hand.

Adding one or more borders to a portrait image adds drama and draws the viewer to the subject. This CD contains 35 individual borders that can be used as is , over your digital portrait or transformed in Photoshop to better fit your subject image size. Each border uses the ''Paste-Into'' function to place the portrait into the border. We also include a 36th image on the CD that demonstrates a montage of 5 Digital FX borders on one 8x10.

The distance between the edge of the craton and the ocean ridge is varied from 400 to 1 , 600 km in a series of calculations to study the pattern of the small-scale flow as the width of the ocean basin is increased. When the ocean basin is narrow ( Model A , Figure 3 top ) , an upwelling forms along the edge of the computational domain , which represents the central spreading axis of the ocean basin. A downwelling forms beneath the craton , slightly craton-ward of the craton-ocean margin. As the width of the ocean basin increases with time ( Model B , Figure 3 bottom ) , the upwelling moves off the spreading axis while the downwelling remains fixed with respect to the craton-ocean boundary. The resulting EDC cell is at most 800-1 , 000 km wide regardless of the location of the craton. EDC reaches a peak velocity of about 30 mm/yr after about 80-100 Myr. After 100 Myr the vigor of the flow slowly decreases ( compare Figure 4 top ( 20 Myr ) and bottom ( 100 Myr ) ) . </edge.n.7379><edge.n.7380>In the event of your or others ' access to or use of the Site , Services or Materials in connection with the transmission of spam newsgroup postings or unsolicited e-mail in violation of these Terms of Use , you acknowledge and agree that EDGE would be irreparably harmed thereunder and that monetary damages would be an insufficient and ineffective remedy; therefore you agree that EDGE is entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against any such transmission ( in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity ) .

More recently , a two-dimensional , density-dependent , solute-transport model was developed by the USGS , in cooperation with the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission ( as part of the Chloride Monitoring Project ) , and a no-flow boundary was placed a few miles inside the outer rim of the crater ( Smith , 1999 ) . This was an attempt to account for the possible effect of the crater 's outer rim on the ground-water flow system. At present , there is not enough information to identify the type , if any , of flow boundary that exists along the crater 's outer rim and whether the faulting at the edge of the crater causes flow barriers and/or conduits. There also is not enough information to define the flow regime inside the crater or to determine the permeabilities of the Exmore tsunami-breccia or the CBIC megablock beds. This information is needed to more accurately model and evaluate the potential movement of salty water within and around the crater to nearby well fields . </edge.n.7437><edge.n.7438>The NEW Diafold Magna-Guide is the next logical step in knife sharpening technology.

Hanging the end off the bench allows the socket board to be slipped on for trial fitting without unclamping the pin board.

You could use a belt sander ( or bench grinder ) to grind the primary bevel. But the common wisdom is you can not use a belt sander to hone the final edge because the belt rises off the support surface as it moves past the cutting edge. This rounds the bevel near the tip ( " it dubs the tip " ) . Perhaps common wisdom is correct but maybe the results are satisfactory or there could be ways around the problem. For example , if your belt sander only rounds the edge a little bit then you could think of this like a double bevel where the rounded portion is the microbevel. Also , fine enough abrasive belts may not be available to finish with a belt sander . </edge.n.7503><edge.n.7504>Using your fingernail , feel through the collar stands to where the garment edges end.

The Sensor Edge Mobile service runs entirely on the handheld device , and can communicate with other applications or services that are external to it , or operate entirely offline , collecting data for later synchronization with an outside application. The flow of events goes from the collection device to the driver. The queue collects events until the dispatcher can process them.

FIG. 1C shows a linear polishing apparatus 10 illustrating edge effect non-uniformity factors. In thisexample , a wafer 16 is attached to a carrier 18 , which applies pressure 13 to push the wafer 16 down on the polishing belt 12 that is moving over the platen 24. However , the polishing belt 12 deforms when the wafer contacts the polishing belt 12. Although the polishing belt 12 is a compressible medium , the polishing belt 12 has limited flexibility , which prevents the polishing belt 12 from conforming to the exact shape of the wafer 16 , forming transient deformation zones 22 and 26. As a result , edge effects occur at the wafer edge 16a and 16b from a non-flat contact field resulting from redistributed contact forces. Hence , large variations in removal rates occur at the wafer edge 16a and 16b. Consequently , due to the fact that the prior artpolishing belt designs do not properly control polishing dynamics , uneven polishing and inconsistent wafer polishing may result thereby decreasing wafer yield and increasing wafer costs . </edge.n.7623><edge.n.7624>The first signals of what U2 could do differently were heard on their 1980 debut album , Island Records ' Boy.

It is therefore of interest to identify possible edge electron acceleration mechanisms and suggest measures to limit these. One possible acceleration process described here depends on mode overlap in the antenna electric field spectrum and on the presence of high- modes , resonant with the ambient ( eV ) edge electrons. These electrons then diffuse throughout the globally stochastic region of -space whose upper bound is given by the last overlapping mode. It is shown that the described acceleration is seriously aggravated by the presence of higher order waveguide modes generated at sharp waveguide-plasma transitions and that rounding-off the waveguide septa can considerably reduce the fields and electron acceleration associated with these higher order modes. Additional antenna field non-uniformities arising from a grill modular structure and random fields generated at the plasma edge through parametric decay and scattering of the LH slow wave from plasma density fluctuations can further enhance the edge electron energy . </edge.n.7633><edge.n.7634> the 1999 flick is about $ 6M less then Edge of Darkness and Mel was ALOT more popular back in 1999 and less scandalous. but $ 21M vs 15M is not like a 50 PR disaster , especially with a B+ movie no less and meeting studio expectations.

Limb darkening occurs as the result of two effects : The density of the star diminishes as the distance from the center increases The temperature of the star diminishes as the distance from the center increases. Crucial to understanding limb darkening is the idea of optical depth. An optical depth of unity is that thickness of absorbing gas from which a fraction of 1/ e photons can escape. This is what defines the visible edge of a star since it is at an optical depth of unity that the star becomes opaque. The radiation reaching us is closely approximated by the sum of all the emission along the entire line of sight , up to that point where the optical depth is unity. When we look near the edge of a star , we can not " see " to the same depth as when we look ... </edge.n.7652><edge.n.7653>Driven in this photo by his friend Peter , this is Colins first buggy.

Formed in 2006 , the band began writing music , drawing from a diverse pool of musical influences to create their unique twist to the world of rock and roll. The band started honing their skills and building a fan base , quickly putting them on the radar. They signed to Liquid Static Records and released their debut album " Faded " in 2008. Over the course of touring , they have shared the stage with many great artists , and have developed a relationship with the media; having been broadcasted via radio and television nation wide. Altered Paradigm is currently in pre-production , writing and recording the follow-up to " Faded " with eager anticipation. Each of the band members is extremely excited about releasing the new record and reaching out to their fans on the road once again.

The Jet Edge water jet is created by pressurizing water up to 90 , 000 psi ( 6 , 200 bar ) with a Jet Edge waterjet intensifier pump. The waterjet cutting action takes place as a result of the ultra-high pressure ( UHP ) water being forced through a pre-mounted orifice as small as .005 inches. In many applications , an abrasive material such as garnet is added to the waterjet to create an abrasive waterjet ( also known as an abrasivejet ) that can cut cleanly through virtually any material . </edge.n.7722><edge.n.7723>But soon , what started out as a skinny strip of nothing turned steadfastly - by default - into a scarf.

Carroll equivocates over the term interaction motifs : Behe is talking about the kinds of protein interactions that build enzyme complexes or structures like the ribosome or the cilium or the replication machinery of the cell. These kinds of interactions are stabilized by many amino acids , not the short motifs studied in this paper.

Voice production can be thought of in terms of three components : generation of airflow , vocal cord vibration that produces sound and shaping of the sound to produce various resonances.2 The lips , tongue , teeth and palate provide the distinct sounds of speech. The lungs first supply adequate airflow to overcome the resistance of the adducted vocal cords. The vocal cords are finely tuned neuromuscular units that adjust pitch and tone by altering their position , length , tension and mass. Sound production occurs as a result of the vibration of the mucosa at the medial edge of each vocal cord. Thus , any structural , inflammatory or neoplastic lesion of the vocal cord affects voice production and quality. Final modification of speech occurs in the oropharynx and nasopharynx , where the tongue , palate , cheek and lips are involved in articulation. The integrated anatomy of voice production requires the physician to consider that a change in the anatomy or function of any of the structures involved in voice production , from the lungs to the nasopharynx , may result in dysphonia ( Table 4 ) . </edge.n.7782><edge.n.7783>Examples of brands include Chef 's Choice ( Diamond Hone ) , Smith 's Edge ( Diamond Edge Pro ) , Shun , McGowan ( Firestone , Diamondstone ) and Wusthof.

The XV flawlessly sharpens contemporary double bevel or single bevel traditional Asian-style knives as well. Featuring multi-stages , 100 diamond abrasives and patented flexible stropping discs , the XV creates the Trizor EdgeSelect edge which helps prolong the life of quality knives by applying a triple-bevel arch-shaped edge that resists dulling longer than conventionally sharpened hollow-ground or V-shaped edges.

I have played Cobra and Callaway drivers but will remain with Tour Edge as long as they stay in the driver market . </edge.n.7872><edge.n.7873>Jul 18 , 2007 .

Just to show me my place , " Lex continued , his voice still light and cool. " But there was a stone in his ring , and an edge caught me the wrong way. " He stroked his fingers over his lips again , then dropped his hand. " Sixteen years old , and bloodied by a grown man -- you 're pretty much automatically in possession of the moral high ground. So I did what he 'd always taught me to do , and took advantage of my tactical position. Used the opportunity to call him a lot of nasty but technically accurate names.

Typically , substrate 12 includes a front surface 16 , a rear surface 18 and has a thickness 20. Front surface 16 is referred to herein also as outer surface 16. Rear surface 18 is referred to herein also as an inner surface , an expanse , or a generally flat region 18 of substrate 12. Substrate thickness 20 is on the order of 2.0 millimeters ( mm ) for typical eyeglass lenses. Thickness 20 typically may be between 1.0 and 100 mm for camera lenses or between approximately 1 to 6 mm for a plastic film. However , as is known by those skilled in the art , such dimensions vary widely depending upon the use of substrate 12 and do not inhibit the effectiveness of system 14. Lens 12 further includes an outer bevel region 22 , an inner bevel region 24 and a bevel point 26. Bevel regions 22 , 24 and bevel point 26 are herein collectively referred to as edge region , or perimeter , 26a . </edge.n.7875><edge.n.7876>As noted above , further robustness improvement is achieved by applying the edge detection for a target construction pixel pairs. As shown in FIG. 3 , X and Y form the pixel pair. The above-mentioned absolute difference calculation for reconstruction of pixel X ( i.e. abs ( A F ) ) shown in FIG. 2 is replaced by the sum of absolute difference in an edge direction. For example , abs ( A F ) is replaced by ( abs ( A F ) +abs ( B H ) ) for the left edge direction. When an edge direction is determined , spatial temporal ( ST ) filtering along that direction applies to both X and Y positions . </edge.n.7876><edge.n.7877>A cold shield 59 is bonded to the outer edge of the upper surface of the cold end plate 39 to baffle unwanted radiation from impinging on the focal plane array.

The upper and lower lips meet at the corners ( or angles ) of the mouth which , in anatomy , are called the oral commissures. The oral commissure normally lies in a vertical line below the pupil . </edge.n.7879><edge.n.7880>Thank you for you interest in the RIVERSIDE PAPER 00316 Tru-Trim Scalloped Edge Corrugated Border Paper Rolls 2-1/4IN x 50 ft.

I drew an arbitrary line after shot 108 , but a shooter on the line would not have a chronograph to record all the velocities like this. So the shooter is safe if he stops after shot 100. If he does that , the fastest recorded shot went 530 f.p.s and the slowest went 518 f.p.s. , a difference of only 12 f.p.s. across 100 shots . </edge.n.7882><edge.n.7883>In the 2008 TIGER/Line Shapefiles release we have identified 1 , 159 counties that contain new features that are distorted. These features appear to be pulled away from their position to a point and returned to their correct location forming a distorted edge. The problems are a result of the efforts to automatically integrate new data with existing positionally accurate features. We have not identified wide-spread issues in other counties but it is possible that there are additional counties with some distorted edges . </edge.n.7883><edge.n.7884>aligned Powell-Sabin .
