Neurons with sample period shape selectivity were generally different neurons than those showing shape selectivity during the delay period. Only 10 of neurons ( 4 of 42 ) with significant shape selectivity during either the sample or delay period showed shape selectivity during both periods. This nonoverlap of shape-selective neurons between the sample and delay period was also true for comparisons between other task periods : only 15 of neurons ( 7 of 47 ) with significant shape selectivity during either the sample or eye movement period showed shape selectivity during both periods. Similarly , 21 of neurons ( 10 of 48 ) with significant shape selectivity during either the delay or eye movement period showed shape selectivity during both periods. And last , only 5 of neurons ( 3 of 65 ) with significant shape selectivity during any of the three periods , were shape selective across all three periods. Combining neurons that were shape selective during either the sample , delay , or eye movement periods resulted in 36 ( 65 of 181 ) of recorded FEF neurons that showed shape selectivity during the DMTS task . </shape.n.9><shape.n.10>She runs with Sharon , who uses that she thank another use; and converts Jack on the shape , buy viagra with pay pal.

Although there is no mathematical definition of fairness , many feel that the use of second derivative or curvature techniques hold the solution. These two techniques are variations of each other since curvature is based on the second derivative of a curve or surface. What these techniques do is to magnify and define all of the bumps , wiggles , and inflection points of a curve or surface so that the designer can alter the surface shape to achieve his/her own criteria of fairness. What would be an invisible unfairness of the lines of the surface on the computer screen , become clearly visible when using one of these derivative techniques. All surface design programs approach this fairness magnification in different ways and each technique greatly influences how easy it is to fair a surface . </shape.n.13><shape.n.14>There are five pairs of larger sacs belonging to the pulmonary system : - ( 1 ) prebronchial or cervical , extending sometimes far up the neck , even into the cranial cavities; the throat-bags of the prairie fowls ( Cupidonia and Pedioecetes ) are a further development; ( 2 ) subbronchial or interclavicular; ( 3 and 4 ) anterior and posterior thoracic or intermediate; ( 5 ) abdominal sacs. Most of these extend through narrow apertures foramina pneumatica - into the hollow bones , sometimes , e.g. in hornbills and screamers , into every part of the skeleton , or , in the shape of innumerable pneumatic cells , even beneath the skin. There is also a naso-pharyngeal or tympanic system of air-sacs , restricted to the head ( cf. the siphonium described in connexion with the mandible ) , but filling also such curious organs as the frontal excrescence of Chasmorhynchus , the Brazilian bell-bird , the throat-bag of the adjutant stork , and the gular pouch of the bustard . </shape.n.14><shape.n.15>These miniature TETwalkers , when joined together in " swarms , " will have great advantages over current systems. The swarm has abundant flexibility so it can change its shape to accomplish highly diverse goals. For example , while traveling through a planet 's atmosphere , the swarm might flatten itself to form an aerodynamic shield. Upon landing , it can shift its shape to form a snake-like swarm and slither away over difficult terrain. If it finds something interesting , it can grow an antenna and transmit data to Earth. Highly-collapsible material can also be strung between nodes for temperature control or to create a deployable solar sail . </shape.n.15><shape.n.16>A super-fast-track paper ornament that is a wonderful container for a small gift is a paper cone.

In this sense arches are segmental , round ( i.e. semicircular ) , or pointed. A flat arch is a member constructed of stones cut into wedges or other shapes so as to support each other without rising in a curve. Scientifically considered , the arch is a means of spanning an opening by resolving vertical pressure into horizontal or diagonal thrust. The simplest form of an arch is two almost vertical supports lent inwards against one another . </shape.n.19><shape.n.20>Avoid parallels such as a flat curve against another flat curve or straight line creating nearly parallel shapes.

The MR imaging features assessed included tracheal shape , tracheal location , and tracheal-wall signal intensity ( mucous membrane , cartilage , adventitia , and posterior membranous portion ) . Tracheal shapes were assigned to one of three classifications : horseshoe , elliptical , or circular configuration; trachea with a locally straightened wall; and trachea with an inward concave deformity. The horseshoe definition was used when the trachea was slightly elongated in the anterior-posterior dimension relative to the transverse dimension. The elliptical or circular configuration was assigned when the anteroposterior and transverse dimensions of the trachea were close to being equal. The locally straightened shape was defined as being when the trachea was locally flattened along the anterior curve. Tracheal location was expressed as the shortest distance between the center of the trachea and the midline of the spinal body . </shape.n.23><shape.n.24>Shapeshifting is a common theme in mythology and folklore , as well as in science fiction and fantasy.

This act is usually performed by a religious figure , such as a priest or shaman , and involves the performing of rituals. Various cultures including the Greeks , Babylonians and Egyptians all had forms of what we term today as exorcism. For instance , the Babylonian exorcism consisted of the formation and eventual destruction of a clay doll fashioned in the shape of the demon. Supposedly , with the destruction of the doll the Devil or demon would be forced from the mortal body. Many cultures and religions practice the act of exorcism to this day. It is known that the current Pope of the Roman Catholic Church has participated in an exorcism although he refuses to divulge the exact details . </shape.n.29><shape.n.30>Three areas of concern involve body image distortion : neurologic disorders , in which patients exhibit a perception of their body ( e.g. , in neglect syndromes ); eating disorders; and BDD.1 Patients with BDD have an excessive preoccupation with a slight or imagined defect of a specific body part that results in impaired social , academic or occupational functioning.2 , 3 BDD must be distinguished from eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa that involve a preoccupation with overall body shape and weight.

However , representation of variation in the transform relating one 3-D coordinate system to another can be computationally intractable [ Brinkley1988 ] . For this reason we have explored the possibility of probabilistic measures of variation [ Altman1993a ] .

In one investigation exploring this information processing paradigm , Williamson ( 1993 , as cited in Jackman , 1995 , p. 342 ) speculated that " obsessions with body size may cause individuals to selectively attend to body-related stimuli , and that it may cause them to misperceive or distort information related to body size and shape " ( a factor of body image disturbance ) ( p. 342 ) . It was also proposed that nebulous body- or food-related stimuli may serve as premises for patients with eating disturbance to mentally manipulate those stimuli ( Williamson et al. , 1995 , as cited in Jackman et al. , 1995 ) .

The properties that we are aware of in color experience are qualities in the mind. By contrast , it might be thought that the features that we are directly aware of in spatial experience size , shape , distance , etc are features that external objects really do have , independent of perception.

Related circumscribing circle ( CIRCLE ) uses smallest circumscribing circle instead of the smallest circumscribing square despite the raster data format because it is much simpler to implement. In contrast to the linearity index , related circumscribing circle provides a measure of overall patch elongation. A highly convoluted but narrow patch can have a high linearity index if the medial axial skeleton is close to the patch edge , but have a low related circumscribing circle index due to the relative compactness of the patch. Conversely , a narrow and elongated patch can have a high linearity index as well as a high related circumscribing circle index. This index may be particularly useful for distinguishing patches that are both linear ( narrow ) and elongated . </shape.n.79><shape.n.80>Vertices look like tick marks on a Shape 's intersections ( see Figure 7 ) .

Mongini ( 1975 ) , for example , stated that the correlation between the morphologic appearance of the condyle and dental attrition clearly shows that these two elements depend on the functional pattern adopted by the masticatory apparatus. Granados ( 1979 ) and Richards and Brown ( 1981 ) also detected severe alterations in the condyle of skulls with teeth presenting marked wear. Richards ( 1987 ) and Wedel et al. ( 1978 ) also reported the relationship between attrition and the rates of change in condyle shape. This discordant result may possibly be attributed to the difference between the samples analyzed in the present study and those evaluated in previous studies. As mentioned earlier , these ancient collections of dry skulls are from ancestors whose alimentary habits were quite different from present ones , a fact that led to exaggerated tooth wear with an effect on the morphology of the osseous components of the temporomandibular joint.

One main challenge in Augmented Reality ( AR ) applications is to keep track of video objects with their movement , orientation , size , and position accurately. This poses a challenging task to recover nonrigid shape and global pose in real-time AR applications. This paper proposes a novel two-stage scheme for online non-rigid shape recovery toward AR applications using Active Appearance Models ( AAMs ) . First , we construct 3D shape models from AAMs offline , which do not involve processing of the 3D scan data. Based on the computed 3D shape models , we propose an efficient online algorithm to estimate both 3D pose and non-rigid shape parameters via local bundle adjustment for building up point correspondences. Our approach , without manual intervention , can recover the 3D non-rigid shape effectively from either real-time video sequences or single image. The recovered 3D pose parameters can be used for AR registrations. Furthermore , the facial feature can be tracked simultaneously , which is critical for many face related applications. We evaluate our algorithms on several video sequences. Promising experimental results demonstrate our proposed scheme is effective and significant for real-time AR applications.Real-time non-rigid shape recovery via active appearance models for augmented reality </shape.n.103><shape.n.104>If you are someone who is just planning on getting started with a health regimen , or if you are somebody who has always been on the lookout for your own health , well then , you have come to the right place to get free and effective fitness advice.

One solution is to zoom in on the area you wish to edit , but then , the curvature curve will be too large to be visible and you really can not see what you are doing. We solved this problem by implementing the Move and Ooch Point commands. The Move command works just like the Move Point command except that the edit point only moves 1/100th of the distance towards the cursor point. The Ooch point allows you to move any edit point in any direction by some very small predefined distance. This means that you can perform detailed fairing with the curvature curve turned on without having to zoom in close. This keeps zooming in and out to a minimum.

Because the system tends to reach a steady state , it elicited the wall-following behavior. In this subsequent phase , the physical boundaries of the environment determined the subjects ' routes of progression , providing information about the layout of the room. However , as in the case of the spider building its web , subjects performed a further behavior of step-counting in order to determine the dimensions of the environment in which they could move. The acquisition of the geometric and metric properties of the environment acts as an order parameter that brings the system to a steady state the formation of a cognitive map. The phenotype of the steady state was free travel , and its emergence was clearly marked by the first cross-cut. The acquisition of a cognitive map was also expressed in the ability of all subjects to sketch the shape , locate landmarks and provide the dimensions of the test environment. The present study thus validates the dynamics of cognitive mapping according to the SIRN model and provides a conceptual framework for the dynamic interplay of internal and external representations . </shape.n.133><shape.n.134>We can see from this formula that the curvature at every point of this simple two-dimensional surface always has the same sign as the discriminant 4ac - b2 .

Scoliosis is the usual type of spinal curvature , and in extreme cases it may lead to a pronounced form of hump-back. The pelvis may remain small ( _justo-minor pelvis_ ) , or it may be contracted in the sagittal plane ( _flat pelvis_ ); when the bones are unusually soft , the acetabular portions are pushed inwards by the femora bearing the weight of the body , and the pelvis assumes the shape of a trefoil , as in the malacia of women. The shaft of the femur is curved forwards and laterally; the bones of the leg laterally as in bow-leg , or forwards , or forwards and laterally just above the ankle. The deformities at the knee ( genu valgum , genu varum , and genu recurvatum ) , and at the hip ( coxa vara ) , will be described in the volume dealing with the Extremities . </shape.n.135><shape.n.136>To use the shape memory property once the part is fabricated , it needs to be shape set.

The strong version states that phenomenological descriptions of consciousness and cognition provide something like a template that defines what we need to find on the sub-personal ( syntactic , physical ) level of explanation. On this view , if the intentional process looks like &lt; ABC &gt; then the sub-personal process that we need to find should look like &lt; abc &gt; , and if it does n't , it ca n't be right. The weaker version simply states that if we are to seek explanations of consciousness and cognition on subpersonal levels , we need to start with a precise description of what it is that we are trying to explain so that we can recognize a good explanation when we see it. This claim would not place strong limiting constraints on the shape of the subpersonal mechanism -- it would not require that the subintentional mirror the intentional , and if it happens that the subpersonal process is isomorphic with the structure of intentional experience , it does not mistake this fact for an explanation . </shape.n.146><shape.n.147>Faceted Sillimenite , Oval Shape , first Quality , fine Green yellow color with good luster , 3 Pcs.

While my access to literature is somewhat limited , I am discouraged by the fact that while I found that considerable effort has gone into surrogate predictive models and measures such as five year survival statistics , Kaplan-Meier survival curves , progression-free survival , and time to progression , I could find no information regarding the statistical distribution within any of these measures of survival - are they normally distributed , skewed , bimodal , or ... ? Because it is not possible to know exactly when a metastases first developed ( it can be weeks , months , or years between that point in time and when it is detected ) directly determining the underlying distribution is a daunting problem; however , the distribution of the surrogates can reasonably be expected to reflect the distribution of the underlying reality , sufficient at least to explore the general shape of the distribution.

The 1 and 2 lenses showed good correlation between labeled and measured base curve radii with extremely low shape factors , confirming the presumption that they are single-vision designs. Lens 3 was clearly a different design , showing a shape factor more consistent with aspheric multifocal designs and a slight difference between the sagittal and tangential radii. Two multifocal lenses ( 5 and 6 ) had significantly higher shape factors , but 5 appeared to be a true asphere , while 6 showed more properties of a single-vision design ( i.e. , minimal difference between sagittal and tangential radii and an arcuate profile ) . The 4 contact lens had properties of a true asphere ( large difference between sagittal and tangential radii and a conicoid profile ) , but with a low shape factor , could be considered for a single-vision or early presbyopic application. The presentation and analysis of these topography patterns is completely preliminary and requires extensive investigation and verification to understand all of the variables involved in the design of aspheric contact lenses.

This type of change is called elastic because when the stress is eliminated the rock goes back to its original shape , like a squeezed rubber ball. If more stress is applied to the rock , it will eventually bend plastically. In this instance , the rock bends , but does not return to its original shape when the stress is removed. If the stress continues , the rock will fracture; that is , it breaks. When a material changes shape , it has undergone deformation.

Under the conventional bifurcation of visual processing into a ventral " what " stream and a dorsal " where " stream , such shape representation in a dorsal structure such as FEF is not expected , although it is consistent with a number of previous reports of shape selectivity in other dorsal stream structures ( Murata et al. 2000; Nakamura et al. 2001; Sereno and Amador 2006; Sereno and Maunsell 1998; Sereno et al. 2002; Shikata et al. 1996 ) .

Macroscopic shape-information is generated by the combination of the elements of shape and expresses the whole characteristics of shape. By the conventional design support system , it is impossible for designers to control macroscopic shape-information , though it seems to be useful in the curve design which is greatly concerned with the whole characteristics. We suggested importance of macroscopic shape-information in design process and defined curvature entropy as macroscopic shape-information based on information entropy and markov process. The result of statistic analysis , the curvature entropy expressed " complexity " of the shape and was different in the characteristics from microscopic shape-information in the curve profile. By applying curvature entropy to the curve design support system , we suggested that curvature entropy was useful as a design index . </shape.n.212><shape.n.213>The Lens is shaped just like a round magnifying lens. It is located behind the Pupil and Iris , and is attached to the Cilliary Body by hundreds of thread-like Zonules. The lens works together with the Cornea to focus light on the Retina.

Cataracts are present , at least to a small degree , in virtually everyone over 60 years of age , but can occur in people of any age , even in newborns. Remarkably , the lens also has the ability to accommodate. Accommodation is the process by which the lens changes its shape ( thickens ) , thereby changing its power , which allows us to focus on near objects. Between ages 42 and 65 , the lens slowly hardens and loses its ability to accommodate. This process is called Presbyopia. People with Presbyopia need glasses to read.

The shape number of a curve is derived for two-dimensional ( 2D ) non-intersecting closed curves that are the boundary of simply connected regions. This description is independent of their size , orientation and position , but it depends on their shape. Each curve carries within it its own shape number. The order of the shape number indicates the precision with which that number describes the shape of the curve. For a curve , the order of its shape number is the length of the perimeter of a discrete shape ( a closed curve formed by vertical and horizontal segments , all of equal length ) closely corresponding to the curve. A procedure is given that deduces , without table look-up , string matching or correlations , the shape number of any order for an arbitrary curve. To find out how close in shape two curves are , the degree of similarity between them is introduced. Informally speaking , the degree of similarity between the shapes of two curves tells how deep it is necessary to descend into a list of shapes , before being able to differentiate between the shape of those two curves . </shape.n.223><shape.n.224>As you finish this stage , you 'll find that to interact with the shapes , you 've created , you can simply drag the sliders of the custom parameter set back and forth.

Similar to previous studies , 8 the RV-to-LV mass ratio in our study was close to unity and decreased only insignificantly toward term. The interventricular septum was included in measurement of both the RV and LV. This may have diluted any obvious preponderance of one or the other ventricle. Separating out the septum while making measurements was found to result in such small volumes as to increase inaccuracy. The LV seemed to be minimally larger in volume and mass through all gestational ages. This may be in slight variance with previous literature in which 2D-estimated RV volume was slightly larger. This difference is likely to be due to the greater degree of overestimation that applies to 2D methods that assume similar shape for both cavities , resulting in more overestimation of the RV than the LV . </shape.n.278><shape.n.279>Osseous surgery is a type of operation performed on the bone and overlying tissues of the teeth to purposely correct the teeth or gums in the mouth so as to enable the teeth lie in good shape by holding them together.

Fossils of marine plants and animals are a major part of the historical record; they give evidence of past oceanic living conditions and the evolution of life forms in the sea. Sediment particles eroded from land and carried to the oceans by rivers and winds provide insights into past climates on continents. Changes in ocean currents and in seawater chemistry have left their mark on the sediment record; the possible causes of these changes are explored. Plate tectonics and seafloor spreading have rearranged the shapes of ocean basins and repositioned continents over time. These processes are reflected in the record in marine sediments still present on the ocean floor and also in those now uplifted to form part of the continents.

For example , the generic representations simple contour , combination of contours , and complementary contours are the only generic representations that deal with the shape and place of the building edge exclusively. They constitute a theme , which is called " shape. " In the same manner , other themes can be established. The generic representations in a theme develop independent from generic representations in other themes. By combining generic representations from themes it is possible to establish more complex generic representations that deal with more sophisticated design decisions. Themes that are found on the basis of generic representations are : " shape , " " system , " " structure , " and combinations of themes " shape and system , " " shape and structure , " " structure and system , " and " shape and system and structure.

For many of the Indian languages , several different fonts have been designed each with a different Glyph arrangement ( see section on " A tutorial on fonts for Indian languages " ) . As an example , the string shown below in Devanagari , will have many different internal representations depending on the font used.

Color information is processed in a pathway that will be considered in Part 3 of this unit. Color information also appears to come to its final sensory analysis in the inferior temporal lobe , but in different cells from those for shape.

Rv , therefore , depends on both the cross-sectional area and the shape of the ET lumen and can be used to quantify the degree of opening , where a large Rv indicates minimal ET opening. Calculation of Rv via Eq. 2 requires a reasonably uniform cross-sectional lumen shape and area along the length of the ET. Previous histological measurements ( 25 , 26 ) have demonstrated that axial variations in the lumen 's cross-sectional shape and area , within the deformable cartilaginous region , are minimal , and therefore the use of Eq. 2 is justified. Note that Rv is consistent with the standard definition of resistance , i.e. , the ratio of pressure to volumetric flow rate , and can therefore be compared with active flow resistance measurements obtained experimentally during the force-response test ( 3 , 6 ) . </shape.n.329><shape.n.330>Without changing the shape of the surface , we can elevate the sphere so the South pole is just tangent to the xy plane at the origin by adding R to all the z values.

In every case ovaries dissected from these animals appeared grossly normal. Moreover , compared to wild-type females that were examined in parallel , they laid normal numbers of eggs that had no defects in shape , size , or position of appendages. To test for sperm penetration , we mated mud4 virgin females to males carrying a GFP-marked transgene that is expressed in sperm tails ( SANTEL et al. 1997 ) . In more than two-thirds of the eggs examined we detected a fluorescent signal of the expected shape ( FITCH and WAKIMOTO 1998 ) , leading us to conclude that the mutants are readily fertilized. However , even when inseminated by wild-type sperm , mutant eggs never proceed through normal development to produce hatchling larvae. Thus , mud mutants are best described as fully penetrant maternal-effect lethals. In contrast , males that are hemizygous for each of the classical alleles are fully fertile and produce normal numbers of motile sperm ( K. F. OSBORNE and H. A. NASH , unpublished observations ) . </shape.n.333><shape.n.334>Tarr , M. J. , &amp;Pinker , S. ( 1989 ) . Mental rotation and orientation-dependence in shape recognition.

An overview of existing approaches to digital preservation related to shape modeling is presented and corresponding problems are considered. We propose a new digital preservation paradigm based on both constructive modeling reflecting the logical structure of the objects and open standards and procedures. Constructive Solid Geometry ( CSG ) and Function Representation ( FRep ) are examined and practically applied as mathematical representations producing compressed yet precise data structures , thus providing inter-operability between current and future computer platforms crucial to archiving. Examples of CSG reconstruction of historical temples and FRep modeling of traditional lacquer ware are given. We examine the application of fitting of a parameterized FRep model to a cloud of data points as a step towards automation of the modeling process.

The key is to determine and mark precisely on the skin both the path of the subcutaneous tunnel and the position of the superficial cuff in relation to the exit site. To this end , the surgeon may curve the catheter to the desired shape and lay it over the skin or may use a stencil designed for this application. A short incision , no longer than the diameter of the catheter , is made at the exit site , and a tunneler or a similar device is advanced into the subcutaneous tunnel , with care taken to follow the curvature of the tunnel. The end of the catheter is attached to the tunneler and brought through the exit site [ see Figure 19 ] . The exact position of the superficial cuff is then confirmed.

Though it is perhaps not easy , it seems to be much easier to conceive of material objects as lacking the phenomenal color properties that we experience than to imagine that they lack the phenomenal spatial properties.

There is little doubt that the various central and mid-peripheral topographies will ultimately influence the final contact lens parameters. Therefore , it is imperative that we appreciate the diverse symmetrical and asymmetrical presentations seen in keratoconus. This is best accomplished through quantitative corneal surface analyses by photokeratoscopy and/or video keratography mapping techniques. Through this analysis the steepest and flattest portions of the cornea can be identified and this will help to clarify many of the peculiar fluorescein patterns noted during our diagnostic lens evaluation.Alternately , the three keratoconus topographies ( nipple , oval , and globus ) can be visualized through a technique called photodiagnosis. Using photodiagnosis , the red fundus reflex is viewed through a direct ophthalmoscope at a distance of approximately two feet ( 60 cm ) and/or photographed using a fundus camera. ( Figure 18. ) The technique allows for direct visualization of the size , shape and location of the conical area for classification of nipple , oval , or globus keratoconus.

Furthermore , information about familiar object categories ( e.g. , chairs , scissors ) is contained in the pattern of response across the ventral visual pathway ( Haxby et al. 2001 ) . These results suggest that IT cortex may be organized in terms of object category. However , most prior studies have measured fMRI responses only to familiar object categories. Thus , it is impossible to determine if the resulting functional organization reflects object shape , evolutionary significance , familiarity , meaning , type of processing , or associated eccentricity biases. Each of these properties has been proposed as an explanation for the specificity for object category found in the ventral visual pathway ( Chao et al. 1999; Haxby et al. 2000; Kanwisher 2000; Tarr and Gauthier 2000; Beauchamp et al. 2002; Malach et al. 2002 ) . </shape.n.374><shape.n.375>Apply a one-step blend between the two horizontal lines and notice the blend path is not the shape you need.

To call it a myth that it has been considered pleasing is to introduce your non-neutral point of view. I suspect that what you are trying to say is that the pleasingness is a myth. That is closer to the truth , but because the pleasingness of the aesthetic is debatable does not make it a myth , it just makes it debatable.

Stimulus duration for each flash was 400 ms with an ISI of 150 ms. The monkey performed no behavioral task other than passive fixation during stimulus presentation and was rewarded at the end of the trial when the fixation spot extinguished if the animal had maintained central fixation throughout the trial. There was one trial for each of the eight possible shapes presented per block ( i.e. , 8 trials per block ) .

Central vision was found to be more sensitive than peripheral vision at all spatial frequencies. Peak contrast sensitivity was 10 times greater in central vision but the cutoff spatial frequency was only twice that of peripheral vision. To compare the shapes of the two functions we first drew a smooth curve through the foveal data and then translated this template curve downward and to the left to match the peripheral data. Clearly the shapes of the two functions are different , primarily because of the long tail on the peripheral function which extends across the aliasing zone of spatial frequencies from the resolution limit to the detection limit. Although an aliasing zone exists also in foveal vision ( Williams , 85 ) , it could not be studied with the present apparatus because of low-pass filtering by the eye 's optical system . </shape.n.428><shape.n.429>The hydatidiform mole is a living organism and undergoes a certain amount of growth.

Others contort themselves into horrible shapes , wrap one leg around the bottom limb and yank the top limb east by west. You can spoil a good bow by bracing it improperly. The ways just mentioned will spring the lower limb all out of shape and the result is usually a bow that will no longer bend evenly. More bows are broken or spoiled by improper bracing than by any other abuse. The proper method is an easy , simple , graceful maneuver. The bottom of the bow has the string permanently attached to it. Place it on the floor , inside the instep of your left foot . </shape.n.430><shape.n.431>The next step is to arch the top and back.

Using calipers to measure the thickness of the top and back , the maker carefully planes and grinds wood away from the front and back of the top and bottom to create the arch of the instrument 's body. She uses gouges and smaller scrapers for the cello 's edges and corners. When most of the body is scraped down to the right thicknesses , she uses a drill press or small gouge to thin out the edges even more , up to about inch from the edge.

If we look back at the shape of the monks with their trumpets , we can see that they formed exactly one quarter of a circle , with all their sound pressure directed at the bowl depression in the ground that the stone sat in. Once the stone had reached a relatively pure level of sound resonance inside of itself , which took several minutes , a gateway for the aetheric energy to flow into our reality would be opened up , and a polarized spherical consciousness unit field would form around the object. Then , like water drifting into a whirlpool , the gravity would simply absorb into stone without pushing it down to the Earth , while the weaker levity or pressor force coming up from the Earth would win out , causing the stone to gradually rise. If you ' ve ever seen a bubble of air slowly , slowly rise through a thick liquid , then you can see how these differences in pressure could create a slow levitating effect . </shape.n.433><shape.n.434>A hyperbolic universe is described by hyperbolic geometry , and can be thought of locally as a three-dimensional analog of an infinitely extended saddle shape.

It is particularly valuable for the economical production of complex shapes , from mass-produced parts to one-of-a-kind items or even large machinery. Three principal techniques of casting were successively developed in prehistoric Europe : one-piece stone molds for flat-faced objects; clay or stone piece molds that could be dismantled and reused; and one-off clay molds for complex shapes made in one piece around a wax or lead pattern ( cire perdue ) . Every metal with a low enough melting point was exploited in early Europe , except iron and steel , was used for casting artifacts . </shape.n.436><shape.n.437>My objection in both of these cases is that the ocean is not a nice face.

I show that this definition can handle some pathological'' computational situations better than the other definition. I also propose a heuristic combination of the conventional acceptance'' criterion and a rejection'' criterion for probabilistic acceptance of models.

The most common larval type in bryozoans is the cyphonautes larva which is somewhat triangular in shape and has an apical tuft of cilia. Upon settling , larvae attach via adhesive sacs and undergo metamorphosis to the adult form. The first zooid in a colony is called the ancestrula.

However , the eyes of the Chinese subjects showed a greater and more uniform relative expansion of the posterior retinal surface in their more myopic eyes , and this was associated with larger optic disc crescents. The changes in the eyes of white subjects displayed a nasal-temporal axial asymmetry , reflecting greater enlargement of the nasal retinal sector. Myopia is associated with increased axial length and a prolate shape. This prolate shape is consistent with the proposed idea that axial and transverse dimensions of the eye are regulated differently. The observation that ocular shape changes are larger but more symmetrical in eyes of Chinese people than in eyes of white individuals warrants further investigation . </shape.n.476><shape.n.477>Their physical fitness seemed irrelevant to the action that was filmed.

A generic representation provides preconditions for more elaborate generic representations if one or more of its constituent graphic units provides such preconditions. A generic representation implies more schematic or less specific generic representations if one or more of its graphic units implies more schematic or less specific graphic units. For example , before the particular length of a wing is decided upon , the decision has been taken that the shape of the building actually consists of a number of wings. In terms of graphic units this means that the contour ( a shape with no particular dimensions ) is established before the specified form ( a contour with particular dimensions ) . By analysing graphic units , it is possible to identify such sequences. These are called " successive graphic units " . Applying successive graphic units to generic representations of a theme results in sequences of generic representations that develop a particular issue ( shape , system , structure , etc. ) from general to specific ( less defined to more strict defined ) . </shape.n.496><shape.n.497>In a circular arch , the downward pull of gravity on the bricks does not correspond to the line of pressure along the arch.

Even though it encloses the greatest area with the least perimeter , its height is a function of its width , and the line of pressure does not conform to the circular curve [ See Figure 5 ] . The only way to enclose a taller area , is to widen the arch , which in turn decreases the overall stability of the structure , because the downward pressure from the upper bricks pushes the sides of the arch outward.

This paper presents a novel approach to model 3D faces automatically from still images or video sequences without manual interactions. Our proposed scheme comprises three steps. First , we offline construct 3D shape models using Active Appearance Models ( AAMs ) , which saves large computation costs for online modeling. Second , based on the computed 3D shape models , we propose an efficient algorithm to estimate the parameters of 3D pose and non-rigid shape via local bundle adjustment. Third , we employ the recovered 3D face shape to deform the high resolution face mesh through scattered data interpolation , and extract the face texture maps for rendering the reconstructed face model from various viewpoints. Since the correspondence is built by AAMs fitting , the 3D face model can be constructed effectively even from a single image.Automatic 3d face modeling using 2d active appearance models </shape.n.521><shape.n.522>FIG. 7.

From these it appears that Celsus was well acquainted with the windpipe and lungs and the heart; with the difference between the windpipe and oesophagus ( stomachus ) , which leads to the stomach ( ventriculus ); and with the shape , situation and relations of the diaphragm. He enumerates also the principal facts relating to the situation of the liver , the spleen , the kidneys and the stomach.

The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus ( PPTN ) of the brainstem receives afferent inputs from reward-related structures , including the cerebral cortices and the basal ganglia , and in turn provides strong excitatory projections to dopamine neurons. This anatomical evidence predicts that PPTN neurons may carry reward information. To elucidate the functional role of the PPTN in reward-seeking behavior , we recorded single PPTN neurons while monkeys performed a visually guided saccade task in which the predicted reward value was informed by the shape of the fixation target. Two distinct groups of neurons , fixation target ( FT ) and reward delivery ( RD ) neurons , carried reward information. The activity of FT neurons persisted between FT onset and reward delivery , with the level of activity associated with the magnitude of the expected reward. RD neurons discharged phasically after reward delivery , with the levels of activity associated with the actual reward. These results suggest that separate populations of PPTN neurons signal predicted and actual reward values , both of which are necessary for the computation of reward prediction error as represented by dopamine neurons . </shape.n.537><shape.n.538>To closer imitate real world shapes , Inkscape can randomize ( i.e. randomly distort ) its stars and polygons.

For example if a line having 64 positions was used the presence or absence of the various shapes of patterned platelets in their assigned spaces would simulate a 64 bit line of computer code. When the position can contain the correct platelet or no platelet the system is binary.

The generic representations in a theme develop independent from generic representations in other themes. By combining generic representations from themes ( addition of graphic units ) , it is possible to establish more complex generic representations that deal with more sophisticated design decisions. Themes that are found on the basis of generic representations are : " shape , " " system , " " structure , " and combinations of themes " shape and system , " " shape and structure , " " structure and system , " and " shape and system and structure.

Temperature output is usually provided at each output node for a specific set of discharge and meteorological conditions. By plotting temperature against distance , you can generate a temperature profile for the segment ( or multiple segments ) for each set of input conditions. Look at the shape of the temperature profile and your temperature suitability curves. If the temperature is changing rapidly within a sensitive range of the target species , output nodes should be close together ( i.e. , about a kilometer apart ) . If the temperature changes slowly or the area of rapid change is outside the sensitive range for the target species , a wider spacing of output nodes is acceptable. It is a small matter to insert additional output nodes. It is not a small matter , however , to redo the entire analysis because the original output nodes were too far apart . </shape.n.597><shape.n.598>Making the rail end cuts first is important because both sides of the rails are still flat , unlike after cutting the template shape.

The structural cross-section may likewise be varied along the length of a component to meet varied structural requirements for different portions of the component in its final " shape memory " or determinate form. Cross section variation allows not only for the device to meet structural requirements in its final deployed " shape memory " or determinate form , but permits design of the individual helical elements in interdigitating configurations 72 , preferably yielding a small cross section of the device in its low temperature pre-deployment or indeterminate form.

By manipulating solids and being asked to think about them , children learn that the faces ( the sides , top and bottom ) are composed of two dimensional shapes including rectangles , circles or triangles. They also learn that the size and shape of each face are dependent upon the size and shape of the other faces. There are a number of ways to find out how children think about shape. Two of the best ways are to draw and build shapes . </shape.n.602><shape.n.603>Abstract. This paper proposes a novel shape representation scheme Interior Angle Chain ( IAC ) which is invariant to translation , rotation and scaling. The proposed method first approximates the contour of a planar shape with an equilateral polygon and then makes a representation using the polygon ' s interior angle chain. The difference between two shapes is measured by the distance between their IAC ' s. An algorithm to obtain equilateral polygon approximation and its associated IAC is proposed in this paper. The proposed shape representation scheme has been tested on two benchmarks and applied to lake recognition in SAR ( Synthetic Aperture Radar ) images. The results show that IAC is an effective shape representation scheme . </shape.n.603><shape.n.604>Deformable modeling is a powerful alternative to control point manipulation and skinning.

If we assume that the Higgs-Virgin Vacuum Torus particle has the ability to change its Torus shape by 90 degree Hinge ROTATIONS. The Torus is supposed to be equipped with one splitting point and three Rotational hinge points. These 4 points are placed regularly over the ring with a spacing between each other of a quarter part of the ring , which was reason to call these particles Quatron Particles . Each hinge can rotate two adjacent ( quarter shaped ) ring pieces relative to each other into 4 positions. With a 90-degree rotational " click position " for each hinge , thus there are four positions possible for each hinge. As a consequence , 100 combinations are possible originated by different rotational click positions. These different rotational positions can be coded . </shape.n.606><shape.n.607>Chelsea-ewer shape; creamers were small and generally described in contemporary records as " boats " or " ewers " .

Star volume is defined as the mean volume of all parts of an object , which can be seen in all directions from a particular point without any interference from other structures ( 14 , 135 ) . The measurements are performed in the same manner as for point-sampled intercepts , and it is a very efficient detector of changes in volume and shape of complex structures. The estimate is taken over a uniform sample of points. If the object is convex , the star volume is equal to the number-weighted mean volume. A straight tubular structure will get a smaller star volume if it bends , and a marrow separated by trabeculae will get a greater star volume when holes appear in the trabeculae. Studies using the estimator of star volume detected mesangial matrix expansion in glomeruli by demonstrating an increase in the size of the matrix star volume in kidney biopsies from type 1 diabetic patients.

Although the disparity sensitivity profiles of the cells in the three regions appeared to have the same general shape , selectivity was clearly different. Cells at the 17-18 border were sharply tuned , those of area 19 were not only less numerous but also less well tuned and collicular cells exhibited coarse selectivity. These differences in selectivity appear to be linked to the projection pattern of the X , Y and W systems to these regions and the roles that these cells might play in vision . </shape.n.655><shape.n.656>Patients suffering from Bulimia Nervosa are usually of normal weight ( BMI in normal weight range ) . Bulimia Nervosa is characterised by the presence of " binge eating " . A binge is a situation where the individual feels that they are out of control with their eating and they are eating an amount of food that other people would consider large for the context. Following the eating binges , an individual with bulimia nervosa uses compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain. This would include vomiting and consumption of laxatives. Bingeing and purging occur on average at least twice a week for three months. As in anorexia nervosa , self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight . </shape.n.656><shape.n.657>Geometry Jamboree will excite young mathematicians as they learn to observe objects in their environment and describe them according to the shapes they are made up of and their position in space. Children will better understand shapes and their properties when they draw a circle on the whiteboard using a large compass that revolves around a point and relate it to the clock on the wall above them or they build a model of the moon using Polydron Sphera to construct a ball. This project will go beyond labeling shapes by name. It will encourage observation and exploration with shape as children use nesting and sorting stacks , reach into the mystery box using only touch to identify a shape , create tessellations using images and shapes from nature and take turns dropping shapes into a rectangular window to make their own discoveries about spatial relationships and how shapes create their world . </shape.n.657><shape.n.658>It was the elder warrior mage 's turn to frown.

The origin of the collapse is made by the random interaction of the real spinning quarks and leptons with the additional Higgs-virgin oscillation ( the photonic wavefunction ) of the vacuum particles. In contrast with modern physics we suggest that the wavefunction of MASS : quarks and leptons , ( neutrinos excluded ) is originated by the continuous real particle collisions with the Higgs-virgin vacuum particles. Therefore these material wavefunctions should be interpreted as vibrations of spinning real particles , different from photonic wavefunctions , and propelled by the oscillating Higgs-virgin vacuum particles . </shape.n.659><shape.n.660>Students should receive 40 points for successful completion of this activity.

There are lots of biomolecular actions and genetic pathways that can lead to accelerated aging , and it appears there are also several that can delay aging somewhat. Some may be more fundamental than others. But it may well be that there is no one master theory or mechanism of aging that drives all the others. It may be that we are looking at a large system of interacting feedback loops in which all the mechanisms of aging work together affecting each other in multiple ways. All are primary , somehow necessary. Think of a mechanical wrist watch. It contains numerous gears , wheels , cogs and bearings. Which is the main gear or wheel or bearing , the key component for operation of the watch ? Wrong question. They are all needed. Taking out or breaking almost any gear or cog or wheel or bearing will stop the watch or make it run screwy. If you want a healthy functioning watch it is important that all the parts be in good shape and well-aligned with each other. The same appears to be true for us mammals . </shape.n.663><shape.n.664>Transforming Shapes. Analyzing how various transformations affect geometric objects allows students to enhance their spatial sense. This includes combining shapes to form new ones and decomposing complex shapes into simpler ones. It includes the standard geometric transformations of translation ( slide ) , reflection ( flip ) , rotation ( turn ) , and dilation ( scaling ) . It also includes using tessellations and fractals to create geometric patterns . </shape.n.664><shape.n.665>Upon reflection , it would have been surprising to find CSFs for central and peripheral vision with the same shape under natural viewing conditions. The high-frequency portion of the foveal curve is dominated by optical factors ( Campbell &amp;Green , 1965; Banks , et al. , 1987 ) which normally prevent the measurement of the high-frequency tail of the curve running through the aliasing zone for foveal vision ( Williams , 1985a ) . In the periphery , however , the aliasing tail may be exposed for study simply by ensuring that the retinal image is carefully focused. Thus we would n't expect the two curves in Fig. 6 to have the same shape because one is dominated by optics and the other reflects a combination of optical and neural factors . </shape.n.665><shape.n.666>Wide Thighs To balance out your body shape , wear form-fitting tops with fluid bottoms such as wide leg pants or bootcut jeans.

In the location task , the sample stimulus indicated the target location of the upcoming saccade. In contrast , in the shape task , the sample location was not likely to be the target location of the upcoming saccade. Nevertheless , we found that some neurons in LIP showed enhanced activity for the sample in the shape task. Unlike enhancement for a stimulus in a location that will be the target of an upcoming saccade , there is a stronger response for a stimulus in the same location that only occasionally is the target location of an upcoming saccade ( see also , Bisley and Goldberg 2003 ) . </shape.n.670><shape.n.671>Media messages that equate thinness with beauty can contribute to development of negative body images among girls.

It states that all flow passing through a regurgitant valve approaches it as a series of concentric shells of decreasing surface area and increasing velocity ( 11 ) . Quantifying flow through any such shell ( most conveniently the contour identified by velocity aliasing in the color Doppler display ) yields the instantaneous flow through the valve. Assuming this contour to be hemispheric in shape , then flow Q through a contour of velocity va at radius r from the regurgitant orifice is 2r2va. If the velocity through that orifice at that instant is v0 , then the important parameter regurgitant orifice area ( ROA ) is given by Q/v0 ( 12 ) . For mitral regurgitation , this can be simplified by assuming a regurgitant velocity of 5 m/s ( reflecting a ventriculoatrial pressure difference of 100 mm Hg ) . If aliasing velocity is set to 40 cm/s , then ROA will be given simply by r2/2 ( 13 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . </shape.n.672><shape.n.673>There are various ways to categorize form and shape.

This shot sequence is mysterious and purely formal , a diversion from Ozu 's documentation of his ordinary characters to examine the rich details and prosaic beauty of their surroundings.

The IDR engine can also have high and low pressure seal zones that will decrease the seal friction. The high pressure zone lies between the two axles. See the yellow diamond shape in the picture below. Radial seals can have high and low seal pressure zones by changing the shape of the side housings ( i.e. they are not 100 flat ) A point on the side seals of the IDR engine follows a circular pattern. A seal of the IDR engine can therefore bed in. The lines that the seals will form on the side housings is nearly parallel at maximum compression . </shape.n.732><shape.n.733>Before you begin drawing shapes , you should start by setting the properties for new shapes.

Therefore , only the content of the schemas are variant , not the formulations themselves ( Beck , 1967 , 1987 , as cited in Jacobi et al. , 2002 ) . Body image disturbance related to weight , body shape , etc. , then , should be a fundamental cognitive structure in eating disorders ( Spangler &amp;Stice , 2001 ) , as verified by comparing results from the ASI-R and BAAS. The body schema ( Fischer , 1990 , as cited in Labarge , 1998 ) originates from disordered perspectives about appearance , and once an individual form these beliefs , they impact how she assimilates , organizes , and recalls stimuli associated with appearance , especially how these biases compromise self-esteem and so endorse body image disturbance ( Spangle &amp;Stice , 2001 ) . </shape.n.734><shape.n.735>SHAPE RESPONSES WITHOUT ATTENTION OR EYE MOVEMENTS.

For example , the floristic composition of ecosystems can be related to these measures. In forest ecosystems , foresters use site index curves to estimate the productivity of the forest. These species dependent curves are dependent on soil , climate , and topography ( Spurr and Barnes , 1980 ) . The hypsography can be broken down into measures of slope , aspect , and location on the slope ( top , mid slope , bottom ) . These elements do not act independently : they all influence climate and soil , for example.

AMiougb eggs in the ovaries could be classified into three groups ( mature , submature , immature ) , those in the oviducts were primarily of the mature type. These oviduct eggs were large , pale green and sufficiently well-formed ( with a semi-spherical shape and pronounced ribbing ) to be ready for oviposition. The vitellarium of the ovaries contained mainly submature eggs; these were large but more lightly colored than the mature eggs. Immature eggs , which included oocytes , were found in the terminal filament , the germarium and part of the vitellarium of the ovarioles. Eggs in the ovar-ioles decreased in size toward the tip of the terminal filament filled with oocytes. Because oocytes do not contain yolk , they appear white , and we were able to count them using tweezers and a light microscope ( 40x ) . </shape.n.748><shape.n.749>543.

While UNHCR officials were briefed on the plan earlier , it was not discussed at a high level until the High Commissioner 's visit to Brussels on 14 April. At that point , there was considerable concern in UNHCR about both the process and the result. Officials questioned whether an additional force of 8 , 000 men really was needed to support humanitarian functions , and worried that some AFOR units might be shifted to military functions if NATO were to engage in a ground war in Kosovo. Moreover , if AFOR had only a humanitarian function , why was UNHCR not consulted in its preparation ?

Jasper " .. However , it is not idealism per se , but a particular kind of idealism , of which Rhodies are typically imbued , that is the problem under consideration here. And it is certainly not an idealism proceeding from an " ideological vacuum. " If that were the case , we would expect to see idealism manifested and expressed in a diversity of shapes and forms , as for instance : Christian idealism versus humanist/pagan/atheist idealism , individualist versus collectivist idealism , libertarian versus totalitarian idealism , nationalist versus globalist idealism , etc. The Oxonian idealism , however , seems to run almost invariably along the humanist/pagan/atheist , collectivist , totalitarian , globalist , elitist lines. Perhaps Beinart 's peers do not explicitly subscribe to such a nasty idealism , but , apparently , it is implicit - at least in the formative stages - in their collective world view , and it is this which makes him " uneasy. " As he says , they have a passionate " commitment to government , " but , " above all , they believe " in themselves " in government.

One might also wonder if the conical shape itself has some functional significance. Fig. 4 shows the effects on manubrial displacement of changing the depth of the cone. This was done by scaling the z-coordinates of each point in the model by a " relative depth " factor. Note that the circular arcs formed by the radial fibres become elliptical under this operation. Increasing the depth of the cone reduces the displacement of the manubrium , that is , reduces the ability of a given sound-pressure level to move the ossicles. This presumably is because the deeper conical shapes impart greater stiffness to the eardrum , just as argued ( albeit in favour of the conical shape ) by Bekesy ( 1941 ) in connection with his hinged-plate model . </shape.n.766><shape.n.767>Processes are depicted in rectangles , while arbitrary data files of some binary or text form are depicted in parallelograms.

Zwicky 's studies of galaxies ' velocities in large clusters convinced him that there must be more mass present in the clusters ( in order to provide sufficient gravitational pull to keep the clusters from flying apart ) than could be accounted for by the visible mass of the galaxies themselves. Likewise , Oort 's measurement of the rotation curves of galaxies ( essentially , the orbital velocity of stars around the galactic center plotted against the stars ' radii ) suggested that the mass interior to these stellar orbits indicated by simple Newtonian physics did not match the mass inferred by the light from the centers of those galaxies. Both of these observations were made well before modern cosmology had really taken shape and , hence , were independent of any need for dark matter to make cosmological measurements match the theory.

However , what the organic shape of Dolphin invites patients to do is conceptually to leave this robotic intentionality pattern un-activated and to blend only its physical elements with the intentionality pattern from input space 2. The blend is a third mental space that makes composite structure available that did not exist in the separate inputs ( Fauconnier &amp;Turner , 2002 , p. 42 ) .

Such information can only be conveyed by distributed spatial signals within a population of afferents ( Doetsch , 2000 ) . Tactile spatial coding has been analyzed for a variety of stimuli , including three-dimensional objects of various shapes ( LaMotte and Srinivasan , 1987 , 1996; Goodwin et al. , 1995; Dodson et al. , 1998; LaMotte et al. , 1998 ) and patterns of raised dots and letters ( Phillips et al. , 1990; Connor and Johnson , 1992; Johnson et al. , 1995 ) . Understanding how curved edges could be encoded presents a particular challenge because the number of afferents activated will be relatively small compared with the spatial precision required ( Johansson and Vallbo , 1979; Darian-Smith and Kenins , 1980 ) . Thus , it might be expected that parameters of the afferent population , such as innervation density , could have a profound effect on resolution. Because it is not currently possible to record from the entire population simultaneously , such issues can only be addressed by simulating population responses . </shape.n.805><shape.n.806>The renderer 19 may also perform additional pre-processing functions on the relevant parts of the internal representation 14 when generating the required view 20 of the source document 11.

The geodesic length of the path in the space of diffeomorphic transformations connecting the given two images defines a metric distance between them. The initial velocity field v0 parameterizes the whole geodesic path and encodes the shape and form of the target image ( 1 ) . Thus methods such as principal components analysis ( PCA ) of v0 leads to analysis of anatomical shape and form in target images without being restricted to small-deformation assumption ( 1 , 2 ) . Further , specific subsets of the principal components ( eigenfunctions ) discriminate subject groups , the effect of which can be visualized by 3D geodesic evolution of the velocity field reconstructed from the subset of principal components.

Isolation and characterization of a Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage from Chinese yogurt. J. Appl. Microbiol. 101 : 857-863. Abstract : AIMS : The aim of this study was to investigate the properties of temperate bacteriophage of Lactobacillus fermentum , based on its morphology , restriction patterns , protein profile and the impact on the growth of host strain. METHODS AND RESULTS : With Mitomycin C , seven temperate phages were induced from Lactobacilli derived from Chinese yogurt. The temperate phages induced belong to the most common Bradley 's group B , having hexagonal head and long , noncontractile tail. They were furthermore confirmed to be the same bacteriophage by identical restriction patterns. SDS-PAGE profile showed that the phage studied had one major structure protein about 31.9 kDa. The presence of the prophage influenced the cell shape and colony size of its lysogenic strain. CONCLUSIONS : The phage obtained had similar , but not complete identical properties with other L. fermentum phages reported. It influenced the growth behaviour of its lysogenic strain. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY : This study provides some information about bacteriophages occurring in the Chinese yoghurt manufacture and contributes to our knowledge on the bacteriophage diversity in the dairy industry . </shape.n.851><shape.n.852>Have you ever wondered how world-class athletes manage to stay healthy and in playing shape for competition well into their 30s ?

Thus the wavelet filter has separate elements which analyse the input data at different scales. The basic filter element shape is similar to a Gabor function. Unfortunately there is no justification for wanting a filter that analyses inputs at different scales - although this seems intuitively reasonable given the fractal nature of many real images . </shape.n.859><shape.n.860>Crumble the newspaper and start to shape it into a dress-form shape about 16 inches tall , 9 inches around the shoulder and hips and about 7 inches around the waist.

To love the neighbor , to love being useful to others , to love the truth for its own sake , to love to form an eternal conjugial union , to love God -- these are exclusively human loves and they have the human shape. The definition of human is therefore to have a heavenly desire or love , to think of a rational plan for it , and to fulfill the desire by performing appropriate acts. This is how Sacred Scripture describes the Divine Human. From infinite Divine Love married to infinite Divine Truth , the Divine Human creates the Spiritual Sun , which creates the spiritual world of human minds , which creates the physical universe of earths where human beings are born and become truly human by choice of love and truth , living in eternal conjugial happiness. This is God 's fulfillment in existence of the Divine Love or Good married to the Divine Wisdom or Truth. This is the essence and entirety of the human shape or quality . </shape.n.867><shape.n.868>You have enough magnification if the k-curve visibly changes shape when you move one of the defining points by the building tolerance ( perhaps 1/32 of an inch or one mm ) . The distance a point is moved is always dynamically displayed in the status line while you are dragging the point. If the magnification is set too low , then the k-curve will not show unfair changes in the shape of the NURB curve. If the magnification is set too high , then the k-curve will be drawn outside the window and will be overly sensitive to editing changesand will be difficult to smooth. Note that with enough magnification , you could fair the curve to within 1/1000th of an inch. Keep in mind that there is no such thing as perfect fairness. You only have to fair the curve to within building tolerances. However , it is preferable to err on the side of too much magnification , rather than too little . </shape.n.868><shape.n.869>Goshtasby A.

A perceptual representation interacts with an emotional representation to form a bridging representation that links both. So the bonobo links the perceptual representation of a baby with a particular baby-sized piece of wood , or the need to move camp with the dragging of a branch. The symbol also links the relevant emotions ( evoked by a real baby , or a need to move ) to the symbolic use of a particular shape and size of wood. With the doll , a specific piece of wood acts to trigger a mental representation which both recalls a baby , and also evokes the emotions appropriate to a baby. The wood is an effective symbol of the baby because it stands both for identity and emotion . </shape.n.877><shape.n.878>However , evidence does not support this " photographic transmission " or serial pathway theory , but rather a parallel pathways model. This model states that three primary types of information-color , shape , and motion-are individually " pulled out " of the visual scene and sent through three parallel pathways , beginning right in the retina. In this view , one cone receptor receives light from a small area , for example , on the face of a moving calico cat , and signals from this cone go to several intermediate retinal cells and from these to ganglion cells. Each of the ganglion cells responds to only one of the attributes-color , form , or motion-of the cat 's face. The ganglion cells forward their signals to lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) cells in the thalamus that respond uniquely to that one type of information ( color , form , or motion ) , and so on to the primary visual cortex and further cortical areas. At higher areas , the scene is put back together again , as discussed below . </shape.n.878><shape.n.879>Pure or Absolute Motion is undifferentiated , with zero movement indistinguishable from infinite movement. When Motion unfolds , it does so ( this I suggest with deference to Heraclitus ) in a continuous interplay between opposites and polarities - mythically hiding from itself , teasing itself , searching for itself , confronting itself and so on. The concept of the holon , with its double face of dependency and freedom is useful. With AST set aside we can face the Motion that , regardless of shade or shape , expresses itself and expresses life by continuously observing itself and responding to all facets of itself from its innumerable holonic points of perspective . </shape.n.879><shape.n.880>As for what may be innovativethat is , not readily available for comparison elsewherein the above account , there are two main factors. The first is the specifically functionalist view of perception , on which more below. The second novel element is the implied claim that there are two kinds , rather than just one kind , of perceptual contentaspectual versus object-relatedwhich are also correlative to each other. For example , on the above account , one can not infer a determinate , object-related shape to be part of one 's perceptual content without simultaneously inferring that one has an appropriate correlative angle of view from which one is perceiving that object.12 </shape.n.880><shape.n.881>Concluding , it can be said that the described method principally works. However , there are problems arising concerning cases when an object outline changes nearly symmetrically in e.g. opposite directions of motion along a great circle on the view sphere. In that case , the tracking mechanism may follow the wrong direction if it is not supplemented by other ( control ) techniques. Also , the outline complexity can render interpolation of shapes unusable in these cases , choosing sampling points carefully when building an object model may be in place . </shape.n.881><shape.n.882>Givskov , M. , L.

Assuming opposite sides have been cut equally , equal diagonals establish a rectangular form with sides being square.

The timing of lux induction and the shape of the response curve of V. harveyi to the S. typhimurium signal are indistinguishable from those of V. harveyi responding to its own AI-2. Furthermore , we have been successful at partially purifying both the V. harveyi AI-2 and the S. typhimurium signal molecule using identical purification procedures.

The most common meaning is peace and goodness forever. Waraku brings mental , physical and emotional balance to the individual as well as their surroundings. The other meaning is circle , spiral and intersection. The movement of energy in Waraku is based on the shape of the spiral , a very powerful shape found everywhere in nature from the double helix of DNA , to whirlpools and typhoons , to black holes and galaxies. This shape is powerful because it starts from a core point and spirals out , making overlapping circles which do not lose momentum and energy like only one circle would , the energy and momentum is carried and multiplied. Waraku is founded on the concept that every person has a core , like a spirit or a soul , with four basic attributes or feelings : happy , peaceful , powerful and miraculous. People who practice Waraku try to improve themselves and help others to improve themselves as well , by awakening both their physical and emotional energy . </shape.n.899><shape.n.900>1Incorporate more physical exercise into your daily routine.

All that is assumed. The problem is to know what will be the net result of these isotropic and homogeneous forces. Into what shape will these forces mold this layer of soapy water; or to pose this same question in reverse , " What combination of surface curvatures will the soap film need to have adopted in order for all these contractile forces to become exactly counterbalanced against one another ?

Temporal spatial events are recorded as a group of discrete spatial data called time slices. A continuous display of a sequence of time slices gives the illusion of motion or changes through time.

This mechanism is supposed to be the origin of particle-wave duality. This photonic transformation influences the oscillatory energy of the vacuum particles and the former " hardrock photon particle information " will continue as a spiraling longitudinal oscillation inside the lattice reference frame. However the photonic transformation ( vacuum particle into photon ) also disrupt the vacuum lattice structure , as a result ONE vacuum lattice will become non functional for each created photon.

Object recognition occurs by recovering arrangements of geons from the stimulus image and matching these to one of the distinguishable object models , which is paired with an 'entry-level ' term in the language ( such as lamp , chair , giraffe , and so forth ) . The theory rests on a range of research supporting the notion that information from the image can be transformed ( via edge extraction , etc. ) into representations of geons and their relations. Thus , the hypothesis that , say , chair is representated in memory by an arrangement ( or several arrangements ) of geons is partly the result of constraints imposed by considering what information could be ( A ) extracted from the image ( under a variety of viewing circumstances ) , and ( B ) matched to the memory representation.

Individuals associated with the rise of a distinct Norwegian culture include the mathematicians Niels Henrik Abel and Sophus Lie , the physical scientists Christopher Hansteen and Vilhelm Bjerknes , the composer Edvard Grieg , the creator of modern realistic drama Henrik Ibsen , the poets Henrik Arnold Wergeland and Bj rnstjerne Martinius Bj rnson , the historians Peter Andreas Munch and Johan Ernst Sars , the explorer and statesman Fridtjof Nansen , and the expressionist painter Edvard Munch . </shape.n.989><shape.n.990>At least five cellular components are required for making changes to the organization of the cytoskeleton and therefore the shape of a cell : microtubules , actin filaments , the cell membrane , and two protein complexes. Microtubules are hollow protein pipes that arrange themselves in bundles down the long axis of the cell. As they extend from the cell center towards the periphery , they carry with them one of the protein complexes , so that when they finally dock with a protein receptor at the cell membrane , the effect is to deliver the complex to the desired growth point. What follows is a cascade of events : This complex recruits the second protein complex , which in turn recruits the protein actin. Filaments of actin from this site bring the transport machinery necessary for new cell membrane to extend in the intended direction generally , further along the long axis of the cell . </shape.n.990><shape.n.991>V.F.

On the other , we find that the most promising explanations of the problem of error construe intentional properties as teleological.

Without crescentin , the cells adopt a straight-rod morphology. Crescentin has characteristic features of IF proteins including the ability to assemble into filaments in vitro without energy or cofactor requirements. In vivo , crescentin forms a helical structure that colocalizes with the inner cell curvatures beneath the cytoplasmic membrane. We propose that IF-like filaments of crescentin assemble into a helical structure , which by applying its geometry to the cell , generates a vibrioid or helical cell shape depending on the length of the cell . </shape.n.1025><shape.n.1026>This approach tries to ameliorate these problems with using a priori shape model and the appearance model which is learned on-line.

INTRODUCTION In the field of computer vision , recognition of objects in the images is a main and important task which should be performed for understanding the scene. This task may be done using different features of the objects with respect to related application. Some of these features are shapes of objects , color , brightness , motion vector , etc [ 1 ] . Based on the application , a feature or a combination of them may be useful and may be applied. Shape of object is a rich and effective feature of the object which has a key role for recognition of objects. In this work , we aim to recognize objects using their shapes. Using of this feature leads to another problem so-called " shape recognition " . Typically , shape recognition interacts with similar tasks such as shape representation , shape matching and shape classification. One of them is result of previous one and another is input for subsequent one. For example , the task of shape matching can not be performed without a method for representation of shapes.

With experience talking about and drawing shapes , they can think about shapes as collections of properties. They can then discover rules about what makes something a shape. For example , they reason that a square is shape with properties of closure , equal sides , and 4 right angles , so that any shape that they can imagine ( even if they do n't actually see it ) with these properties is a square. So , they can reason that the two figures drawn below are both squares , even though one is " tilted. " ( Children often think of the tilted square as a " diamond.

Do not different people seek different things when they proceed to " get in shape " ? Indeed a senior citizen in perfect health , an NFL offensive lineman , an Olympic sprinter , a world class marathoner , a Cy Young Award winning Major League pitcher , a champion bodybuilder , and a supermodel may all be said to be " fit " but they all have different bodies achieved through very different fitness regimens. These regimens differ fundamentally in their emphases on the various components of fitness. Construction of a rational fitness program requires us to specify and prioritize fitness components that the trainee should develop , which in turn requires a list of fitness components with which to work. Various lists can be made of fitness components but any reasonable list will include strength , flexibility , endurance , and body composition. Body Redemption constructs personalized programs that manipulate these four components to achieve clients ' individual fitness goals . </shape.n.1069><shape.n.1070>Though frankly speaking , most of us have some degree of narcissism.

For example , the flow of heat from fire to boil water changes the chemical composition of water and creates a different order of things. This is similar to the flow of heat from the center of a star to its outer layers , and the flow of warm air from the earth 's surface toward outer space. In this latter case , the earth is warmed by the sun and heats the air from below while the air in the colder outer space absorbs heat from the top layers of the atmosphere.

Shrubs , such as Choisya ternate , which naturally grow in topiary-like shapes can , for example , be used to set off the autumn colours of other plants , while grasses such as the elegant Helictotrichon provide a backdrop of structure throughout the year. The foliage of evergreens and ferns too can help to give a garden form and interest , setting off the more colourful inhabitants of the flower bed , complementing but not competing with them . </shape.n.1088><shape.n.1089>Complexity of carbonate pore networks is distinguished by the rance of sorting , and size of carbonate particles that result in rock fabric. Three basic rock fabric/petrophysical classes were identified using a modified Dunham 's ( 1962 ) approach. These are ( 1 ) dolograinstone , ( 2 ) grain-dominated dolopackstone and medium crystalline mud-dominated fabrics ( 20-100 microns ) and ( 3 ) fine crystalline mud-dominated fabrics ( &lt; 20 microns ) . Dolomitization is a major effect in pore size distribution because of differences in the size , shape , and arrangement of crystals. In the mud-domininated fabrics , pore geometry is controlled by crystal size. When the crystal size increases , enhancement in permeability occurs because of an increase in particle size. Two major pore types control the petrophysical characteristics of carbonate rocks : interparticle and vuggy porosity. High permeability occurrences are associated with interparticle pore space of grainstone texture. Low permeability is related to microintercrystalline pore space of the fine crystalline ( &lt; 20 microns ) muddy facies. Mixed interparticle-intercrystalline pore spaces in grain-dominated and medium crystalline ( 20-100 microns ) mud-dominated fabrics have intermediate permeability range. These rock fabric classes formed distinct porosity/permeability transforms and water saturation ranges . </shape.n.1089><shape.n.1090>Oval is considered by many to be the loveliest and most versatile face shape since nearly every hair style looks great on this face.

The Sasquatch appears to rely less on the heel plant in walking , but rather bears more of its weight on the broad anterior part of the foot , distal to the metatarsal hinge ( Jeffrey Meldrum , personal communication ) or , for that matter , more evenly distributed over the entire sole in the absence of an arch. Placement of the Sasquatch foot on a suitable substratum has been observed to produce a slapping sound , implying a foot placement that is not congruent with a heel plant and a subsequent forward rolling of the foot , as occurs in the human foot with its rigid arch. In an expertly documented track of footprints ( Heryford et al. 1982 ) , the footprint changed from a normal shape during calm walking to a roundish footprint ( i.e. , the anterior half of the foot ) during running ( step length changing from 4 ' to 9 '; 122 to 274 cm ) , in which the heel never touched the ground.

First , any adequate account of genuinely perceptual content must be specific or fine-grained enough so that co-extensive , but intensionally distinct , content properties are not identified with each otherwhich could be dubbed the content intensionality condition. For example , it should be possible to distinguish seeing a shape as being trilateral from seeing it as being triangular , even though the extensions of the two predicates are the same. This intensionality requirement is especially important in the explanation of pictorial content , because an artist could easily structure a picture of a trilateral and triangular shape so that normal viewers primarily noticed one property rather than the othersuch as by either putting numbers 1 ... 2 ... 3 in each angle , or alternatively , next to the middle of each side of the shape.

The model microstructure was made by randomly choosing from the 1200 cement particle images , and shrinking or expanding each in size to match a typical experimental cement particle size distribution. Particles were digitized before placement in the matrix. Particles whose voxel volume , after digitization , was five or more voxels , remained as they were. Particles with less than five voxels in volume were assigned randomly oriented shapes , as shown in Figure 6 , since in the digitization process the original shape information is lost for these small shapes.

Furthermore you could not look at Morris , Hesse , and Serra in this brief period without thinking of Claes Oldenburg 's soft drum set as the antecedent. Or , perish the thought , of Marcel Duchamp 's Three Standard Stoppages , with shapes determined by dropping particular lengths of string. Most of the minimalists , by the way , were against Duchamp ( with the exception of Morris ) , seeing him as a sort of a rich person 's clown. And surrealism was too decadent. But -- wait a minute -- did n't the minimalists entertain the founders of the Dia Foundation ? Is n't there something decadent about finish fetish and perfect edges ?

This knowledge is concerned with the geometry ( the spatial extent of the object ) , the structure ( object features and part-whole decomposition ) , attributes ( colours , textures ) , semantics ( meaning , purpose ) , and has interaction with time ( morphing , animation ) . This objective will be achieved by growing a new multi-disciplinary research field , which deeply integrates Computer Graphics and Vision with Knowledge Technologies and builds on using knowledge formalisation mechanisms ( metadata and ontologies ) for linking semantics to shape or shape parts. The innovation sought by AIM SHAPE is to move towards digital representations of shapes which are able to model not only the visual appearance of objects but also their meaning or functionality in a given knowledge domain . </shape.n.1132><shape.n.1133>.Quest Vision on FlexOptic , an accommodative IOL that will move forward and have a change in the optic shape during accommodation.

The position and shape of plasmon absorption of silver nanoclusters are strongly dependent on the particle size , dielectric medium , and surface-adsorbed species ( 20 , 26 ) . According to Mie 's theory ( 24 ) , only a single SPR band is expected in the absorption spectra of spherical nanoparticles , whereas anisotropic particles could give rise to two or more SPR bands depending on the shape of the particles. The number of SPR peaks increases as the symmetry of the nanoparticle decreases ( 32 ) . Thus , spherical nanoparticles , disks , and triangular nanoplates of silver show one , two , and more peaks , respectively . </shape.n.1142><shape.n.1143>Lutz Meissner obtained a Masters degree in mathematics from the Free University of Berlin and has been working as a teaching and research associate at the institute of computer science since 1997.

In the normal editing mode , user interface controls are provided for modifying the size , position , and rotation of the mask-cropped shape. Because the digital image is mapped to the mask shape during the masking operation , visual effects can be easily added to the edges of the mask-cropped shape. For instance , edge effects like shadows and bevel effects can be added to the edges of the mask-cropped shape. At any time , the mask edit mode of operation can be invoked to independently alter the size , shape , and rotation of the digital image and the mask shape . </shape.n.1144><shape.n.1145>Abstract : We study the phase transition in the honeycomb dimer model ( equivalently , monotone non-intersecting lattice path model ) .

In Euthynnus and Auxis there is an abrupt angular change in the outline of the ventral margin of the skull , whereas in Katsuwonus and the Thunnidae this outline is rounded. In Euthynnus the posteroventral margin is relatively straight from the posterior ventrally projecting plate of the parasphenoid to the junction of the skull with the vertebral column. In Auxis the parasphenoid is produced posteriorly to form a horizontal ventral wall to the myodome , so the outline of this portion of the cranium is composed of three distinct segments. The difference is positive , and readily apparent in the illustrations. Sarda lacks the ventral plate of bone ( parasphenoid ) beneath the anterior extent of the myodome , and can not therefore be confused with Euthynnus . </shape.n.1161><shape.n.1162>The WEU is also working on the CJTF concept and appears to envisage CJTFs that are smaller than what NATO has in mind but employed for similar missions.

The most effective strategy for choosing vantage objects will be investigated , requiring detailed analysis of distributions of inter-shape distances in object space. Finally , the technique will be adapted for use with partial shape matching and other situations where the triangle inequality may not hold. Workpackage WP7 aims to develop improved methods for matching and indexing shapes on the basis of the spatial layout of components , such as the relative positions of region centroids , patterns formed by the centroids of regions with similar shape , and topological information such as which regions are contiguous , and which included within larger regions.

There are a number of features that make the finite-element method particularly attractive. First , in even its simplest form it handles irregular boundary shapes very conveniently. Second , it is relatively easy to handle inhomogeneities , nonlinearities , and complex geometries and boundary conditions systematically. Third , one need never analyze the behaviour of the whole system. All of the analysis is done on simple elements , and even there one need not be able to write down the governing differential equations. The elements can be formulated using any method that is convenient , such as the variational method often used for plates and shells. Another reason for the popularity of the finite-element method is that it can be understood on a physical , or intuitive , basis. Its use is essentially an extension of the very common technique of analyzing mechanical or electrical systems as networks of interconnected discrete components . </shape.n.1187><shape.n.1188>Problems with the shape of the eyeball , the shape of the lens , the quality of the lens or the way that information is transmitted to the brain can all cause poor vision.

Androgens are the " male-making " hormones , of which testosterone is the leading member. Normally , androgens do their business by attaching to " receptor " molecules in target cells throughout the body and brain , in the same way as a key fits in a lock. In genetic males with AIS , a mutation changes the shape of those receptors , so that androgens no longer " fit " them. An affected fetus may be awash in testosterone , secreted by the developing testes , but the hormone has no effect , so the fetus develops with the outer appearance of a female. In addition , the male reproductive tract ( prostate , seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia ) fails to develop . </shape.n.1192><shape.n.1193>Faceted Sillimenite , octagon Shape , first Quality good luster , white with light grey color , 1 Pc. 11x13.50mm , 9.40 Cts , 12.00 US $ Per Cts , 112.80 US $ </shape.n.1193><shape.n.1194>Both men and women use their physical appearance , weight and body shape , as a measure of self worth and physical attractiveness.

In many species the two sexes can be told apart by the shape of the shell. The male sex cells are released into the water and are taken into the female 's body through the in-current siphon. They are then transported to the gills where the eggs are fertilized. The gills now serve as brood pouches as well as respiratory organs. Next , the eggs develop into glochidium , possessing only partially developed organs. At this point they are discharged from the female through the excurrent siphon into the water column. If they are to survive , they must be taken into the mouth of a passing fish and attach themselves to its gills. The glochidium remain embedded for 1 to 6 weeks in the tissues of the host fish , not increasing in size , but developing adult structures. Some species of mussels parasitize only one species of fish , while others are not as particular. This parasitism usually does not harm the host fish . </shape.n.1200><shape.n.1201>First , plan to go slow.

The order of the shapes within a block was randomized from block to block. This strategy guaranteed that no shape could accidentally dominate a particular time period during the recording session as a consequence of randomization across the recording session. Of 159 neurons recorded , the responses of 58 units showed significant changes in response as a function of block number ( 2-way ANOVA , block main effect ) with this change likely due to adaptation effects during blocks subsequent to the first one ( cf. Lehky and Sereno 2007 ) . However , of these 58 neurons , only 2 ( 3 ) were shape selective ( significant main effect for shape in ANOVA ) and also exhibited a significant interaction between shape and block number.

Yet we are conscious of presented shape and color properties that seem to inhere in an object , and the relations among subject , inner object , and what is represented seem to be real. We should not state , however , that simply because this is the form of our experience that the object itself unequivocally exists. That would be the existence error.

An interaction graph was proposed to allow users to select variables for 1D , 2D or 3D plotting with additional , movable nodes along the spokes of the graph to select the range of the data and to locate the viewing position. For a 57-dimensional sample of the SuperCOSMOS data , however , it was necessary to expand the graph to a radial spiral shape , Fig. 13 . </shape.n.1331><shape.n.1332>As cultural values and norms change over time , so do our perceptions and the way we think about the shape and size of our bodies. Over the centuries , perceptions of human beauty and body weight have changed from the ideology of extreme corpulence being a sign of fertility in ancient times , to the 1960s where slim women , such as the model Twiggy , were idealised as the body beautiful. It is universally acknowledged that society 's preference for thinness affects people 's eating behaviour and attitudes towards food , and that dissatisfaction with weight and shape is evident from childhood through to adulthood.

Not only does the robot actually move its TV-camera sensors to point at whatever it presently needs to know about; different specialized algorithms are purposefully applied to extract the specific sort of information ( e.g. shape , distance , velocity , texture ) that the system currently requires. Often , these algorithms themselves may involve purposefully moving the sensor relative to what is being examined ( Aloimonos , Weiss , &amp;Bandyopadhyay , 1988 ) , actively picking up information ( c.f.

The private sector also studies Japanese women ' s body changes closely. The most noticeable changes that heavily studied by the fashion industry and the nutrition industry are in the growth of the chest as well as the hip areas in Japanese women.

The model is based on an explicit mesh representation composed of multiple competing evolving fronts. These fronts adapt to the local feature size of the target shape in a coarse-to-fine manner. Hence , they approach towards the finer ( local ) features of the target shape only after the reconstruction of the coarse ( global ) features has been completed. This conservative approach leads to a better control and interpretation of the reconstructed topology. The use of an explicit representation for the deformable model guarantees water-tightness and simple tracking of topological events. Furthermore , the coarse-to-fine nature of reconstruction enables adaptive handling of non-homogenous sample density , including robustness to missing data in defected areas . </shape.n.1348><shape.n.1349>There are some differences between the workout of a woman who wants to get in shape and stay healthy , and the workout of a professional bodybuilder.

The palette factory is specified via the 'factoryClass ' tag in the paletteProviders extension xml descriptor inside the 'contribution ' for the palette provider. The factory class is a java class that extends PaletteFactory.Adapter and implements the createTool method. If we consider our example above , where we are trying to create the LED element , the LogicPaletteFactory class demonstrates how to accomplish this. Given the semantic ID defined in the 'id ' entry , i.e. 'LED ' , it will create a tool that wraps that ID which is used later to decide which notation and semantic elements to create when the tool is invoked. There are two main types of tools clients need to create shapes. The CreationTool class is used to create shapes or nodes on the diagram surface or the ConnectionCreationTool class which is used to create connections or edges between shapes. In the case of our example , the LED is a shape so we will use the CreationTool . </shape.n.1358><shape.n.1359>The features of the invention are realized by providing a rectilinear track along which the light source incrementally moves , and means for determining the angular positions of the light source as it performs a rotational scan of the objectsurface at each incremental position. Both the linear and angular positions of the light source are converted to digital data usable by the computer. A plurality of light detector segments are also located along the track for detecting light which ispolarized parallel to the surface of the object. The position of each such light segment is permanently stored in the computer memory and thus , when a detector segment detects polarized light , the distance between such segment and the light source canbe recorded. With this information , as well as the determination of Brewster 's Angle from the index of refraction of the object being measured , the computer can perform a trigonometric calculation and determine the spatial point of reflection of thesurface. This process is continued until a multitude of spatial points are recorded in which event the shape of the surface can be reconstructed by a computer plot , or the like . </shape.n.1359><shape.n.1360>The cells of all bacteria are classified as " prokaryotic " , the simplest and most ancient of the cell types.

The bacilli and the cooci may form chains of a length typical of the particular bacterium. When faced with unfavorable environmental conditions , some bacteria form endospores. During the formation process , the cell shrinks , rounds up within the former cell membrane , and secretes a new , thicker wall inside the old one. Endospores are amazingly resistant to extreme temperatures , drying out , and harsh chemicals , including acids and bases. When conditions are suitable for growth , the spore absorbs water , breaks out of the inner shell , and becomes a typical bacterial cell again . </shape.n.1360><shape.n.1361>Active Shape Models with Stasm Stasm is a C++ software library for finding features in faces.

In deep sub-micron design , interconnect delay is shown to be 10 to a few hundred times bigger than the intrinsic gate delay for a global interconnect , and thus dominates the circuit delay. To reduce interconnect delay , wire-sizing and buffer insertion/sizing are two effective techniques. One of the approaches to wire-sizing is continuous wire-sizing. In continuous wire-sizing , the shape of a wire is described by a continuous function , and the objective is to find a shape function which minimizes delay or minimizes area subject to a delay bound.

" in an article for American Mathematical Monthly. This famous problem has led to many productive research paths , including the idea of " isospectral drums " , but essentially , the answer has been " no " . In other words , from a spectra of amplitudes , the exact shape of a drum 's spatial wave can not be decomposed. In attempting to resolve the Chesapeake Bay from an eigenfunctional approach , a one-to-one mapping of this famous problem has been identified. This work will rewrite the question from " Can One Hear the Shape of a Drum ? " , to " How Can One Hear the Shape of a Drum ?

The research reveals that neurons in the higher-level visual cortex at first respond to a visual stimulus somewhat indiscriminately , " signalling all the individual features within a shape to which they are sensitive. For instance , a particular neuron may respond to objects with either a concave fragment at the top or a convex fragment at the bottom. At this point , the neural signals are ambiguous; the brain does not know whether the concavity , the convexity or both are present. Milliseconds later neurons begin to react exclusively to combinations of shape fragments , rather than to individual fragments. In other words , the brain begins to put the pieces together to form larger sections , in the same way that an artisan might fasten discrete pieces of stained glass to create a design.

He suggests imagining " language as an independent life form that colonizes and parasitizes human brains , using them to reproduce.

Consequently , each has evolved with respect to the other. Each has become modified in response to the peculiar constraints and requirements of the other " ( 112-13 ) .

This is probably due to the fact that modern nomenclature provides few means for describing the gestalt of " attractive " female body shapes ( the term " hourglass figure " is a notable exception ) .

In the upper left hand image we morph using just one control point of the shape. In the upper right we utilize two control points in the morphing. By morphing 2 control points we extend out the effect of the morphing into the surface by applying the same transformation to subsequent points. This may have a somewhat undesirable effect so we also have a Morph Falloff flag which decreases the effect of the morph gradually as we move out. For example the lower left image uses falloff and to morph the 2nd control point ( actually the 3rd control point in the shape ) with only around 1/2 of the rotation of the first. G1 Continuity keeps the length of the curve tangent the same. The C1 Continuity enables you to change the strength of the tangent to either match the tangent field length or some scale factor of it.

Bone biology and physiology can reveal much about the environmental challenges or physical conditions individuals or populations had to contend with over the course of one ' s lifetime , including physical stresses from culturally related activities , or nutritional stresses from periods of famine or disease. This is because such stresses may leave lasting marks on bones or teeth. Indicators for age could include the presence of arthritis; nutritional deficiencies may be indicated on tooth enamel or markings on growth areas on the long bones of the arms or legs; behavioral stresses such as heavy lifting or squatting for extensive periods of time can also be indicated by signs of wear or change in bone shape at particularly stressed points like the junction sites for tendons or ligaments. Wear on teeth , calcareous or calcium deposits , or staining can indicate diet and , in the case of the Chamorros , specific cultural practices , such as the chewing of pugua or betel nut with lime . </shape.n.1457><shape.n.1458>Maybe this was a good thing , this dark night of my fitness soul.

Since the aggregate is generally stronger than the paste , its strength is not a major factor for normal strength concrete , or for HES and VES concretes. However , the aggregate strength becomes important in the case of higher-strength concrete or lightweight aggregate concrete. Surface texture and mineralogy affect the bond between the aggregates and the paste as well as the stress level at which microcracking begins. The surface texture , therefore , may also affect the modulus of elasticity , the shape of the stressstrain curve and , to a lesser degree , the compressive strength of concrete. Since bond strength increases at a slower rate than compressive strength , these effects will be more pronounced in HES and VES concretes.

The organization of circuits in the brain reveals that the brain is a massively parallel , distributed information processor. For example , the circuits involved in vision receive information from the retina. After initial processing , these circuits analyze information into different streams , so that there is one stream of information describing what the visual object is , and another stream is concerned with where the object is in space. The information stream having to do with the identity of the object is actually broken down into several more refined parallel streams. One , for example , analyzes shape while another analyzes color. Ultimately , the visual world is resynthesized with information about the tactile world , and the auditory world , with information from memory , and with emotional coloration. The massively parallel design is a great pattern recognizer and very tolerant of failure in individual elements. This is why a brain of neurons is still a better and longer-lasting information processor than a computer . </shape.n.1483><shape.n.1484>In the example below , the Shape prototype object defines three properties , GetArea , GetPerimeter , and Draw , that reference the functions , Shape_GetArea , Shape_GetParameter , and Shape_Draw.

These activations were localized to patches in the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus at a dorsal-ventral position approximately at the level of the caudal end of the principal sulcus. The region of activation extended from the junction of the superior and inferior limbs of the arcuate into the inferior limb ( see Figs. 11 and 12 ) . This region overlapped with the area ( lateral FEF ) reported to receive converging inputs from both dorsal and ventral processing streams ( Schall et al. 1995b ) , including many other regions activated by our 3-D shape stimuli ( areas V4 , TEO , MT , FST , the ventral bank and fundus of the STS , and LIP ) .

Most of the previous attempts to quantitate bronchoscopic images have used a series of correction values that are applied to measurements depending on the location and relative size of the measured object in the FOV 13 , 21 , 22. Such corrections are approximations and are only valid for objects of the same shape , which they were designed to correct. Indeed , the authors ' earlier efforts relied on tedious hand measurements and nomograms that were difficult to use 13. In contrast , numerical methods , such as those used in this study , are easy to use once suitable correction functions are generated. These methods correct the location of individual pixels in the image , and because the correction acts on individual pixels , it is not affected by the shape of the object measured. Furthermore , since each pixel in the image has its location uniquely corrected , these functions provide a continuity of correction over the whole FOV . </shape.n.1495><shape.n.1496>A more flexible definition of shape takes into consideration the fact that we often deal with deformable shapes in reality , ( e.g. a person in different postures , a tree bending in the wind or a hand with different finger positions ) . By allowing also isometric ( or near-isometric ) deformations like bending , the intrinsic geometry of the object will stay the same , while subparts might be located at very different positions in space. This definition uses the fact that , geodesics ( curves measured along the surface of the object ) stay the same , independent of the isometric embedding.

As we become more contemporary we realize we are not at the centre. To some extent our body is conditioned to reveal some of those cross currents in society and in ourselves; its inner architecture helps us. I would like to get away from the idea of shape but I do like clarity. So I face a dichotomy : how can the body have that clarity without it being attached to a singular shape idea , but through a series of energies that traverse through the volume of the body ?

Hair below the chin line should be worn with a face-lengthening center part. For hair above the chin line , wear an off-center part to " interrupt " the roundness. Creating volume at the top of your head and keeping your forehead bare will also slim the face. It 's best to avoid short and sleeked-back hairstyles. In shorter styles , you are best seen with hair brushed away from the face , building extra volume at the top of head to narrow the roundness of your features. Though bangs shorten the face and straight-falling bangs or wisps should be avoided , you can wear curly , tousled side bangs. Wear longer styles closer to the face to give length. Decrease the volume at the sides and ear area. An ideal length for your hair is beyond the chin or just above it. A side part works well. Keeping hair off the face at the cheek area is also recommended . </shape.n.1526><shape.n.1527>Wisps on the jaw area or wavy bangs can help give a wider , rounder appearance that evens out face. lf you are a dramatic heart shape you need to leave weight in the back nape area.

Selectivity patterns in high-level visual cortex change when additional experience is acquired with initially novel objects ( Op de Beeck et al. , 2006; Weisberg et al. , 2007 ) , thus the response pattern to familiar objects might be determined strongly by factors that have little relationship to perceived shape ( Mahon et al. , 2007 ) . LOC is probably organized in terms of multiple properties , shape being one of them , and the same set of factors might have a different weight depending on object familiarity. How the different properties are combined , the relative weight of each property , and how these weights depend on familiarity , are all important questions for future research ( Op de Beeck et al. , 2008a ) . </shape.n.1528><shape.n.1529>When you 've been training hard for a sport , there is nothing more frustrating than an injury.

Geometric shapes include circle , square , triangle , oval , rectangle , octagon , parallelogram , trapezoid , pentagon , and hexagon. Free-form or organic shapes are irregular and uneven shapes. Forms are three-dimensional. They are like shapes because they have length and width , but they also have depth. Shapes like squares and triangles can grow into forms such as cubes and cones. Like shapes , forms can also be geometric or free-form. Houses are usually geometric forms while your body is a free-form form. Artists create both shapes and forms.

His early research was on hypothalamic regulation of food intake and obesity , and he has published numerous papers on the topic. In 1991 , he became interested in evolution psychology and decided to apply evolutionary thinking for the causes of the significance of human obesity. He was surprised to learn that people talked about obesity strictly on the basis of being thin or fat with no regard to body shape. He argued that some women may not like their body because it is fat , where as other women may feel that they are not attractive because of their body shape. The very first step was to explore what constitutes an attractive body and then investigate the body shape dissatisfaction in some young women. He has published numerous papers on this topic . </shape.n.1561><shape.n.1562>Similar to other nematodes , C. elegans has an unsegmented , cylindrical body shape that is tapered at the ends ( IntroFIG1 ) .

Both cellular and organismal homeostasis often requires adjustment to mechanical forces generated by environmental sources or internal processes ( 168 , 353 ) . For example , osmotic balance , ion concentration homeostasis , cell volume and shape regulation , blood pressure , and turgor control all depend on appropriately responding to mechanical stretch or shearing forces ( 93 , 112 , 168 , 353 ) . Dedicated mechanotransducers in these paradigms serve as regulatory valves that initiate a cascade of events towards adjusting to or counteracting any substantial deviation from normal conditions. The requirement for regulatory mechanotransduction is probably as ancient as life itself. Cells constantly need to fight shearing and stretch forces they encounter , and the faculty of mechanotransduction was most likely decisive for the survival of the first cell. The universal occurrence of mechanotransduction capabilities in all living organisms argues for such early emergence of mechanotransducers ( 137 , 233 , 237 ) . An alternative , plausible scenario is that mechanotransduction is the outcome of convergent evolution and evolved independently multiple times by the conversion of various types of ion channels into mechanotransducers ( 137 ) . </shape.n.1563><shape.n.1564>Op de Beeck HP , Deutsch JA , Vanduffel W , Kanwisher NG , DiCarlo JJ ( 2008b ) A stable topography of selectivity for unfamiliar shape classes in monkey inferior temporal cortex.

[ Correspondence 1064 , 1609 , 1620. ] Supposing that someone blind from birth became familiar with solid figures by touch alone and then later gained the power to see , would this person be able to distinguish a cube and a sphere by sight alone without first touching them ? In a passage added to the Essay 's second edition , Locke agreed with Molyneux ( on a view confirmed by twentieth-century empirical research ) that the answer must be no. [ Essay II ix 8 ] The visual and tactile ideas of the globe are distinct. Although we use the same words to designate ideas of shape and motion whether they have come from sight or from touch , only " an habitual custom " associates ideas from distinct senses with each other . </shape.n.1588><shape.n.1589>It is a commonplace of present educational theory to say that letters of the alphabet are symbolic representations of the sounds universally possible to the human vocal organs. It is hardly as generally known that in shape they are more than mere algebraic x 's or sheer onomatopoetic imitations. They are in fact evident forms shaped to picture basic ideas. They are true ideograms. The capital letter A , for instance , is obviously the cardinal letter I , the symbol of primordial unity ( since it is also the number 1 ) , split apart from the top into the creative duality of spirit and matter , the cross-bar indicating the interrelation which dynamically subsists between them. The U ( V ) symbolizes , exactly as it is drawn , the descent of spirit into matter and its return above. The W pluralizes it , and we find , not strangely , the W to be the letter that pluralizes words in the Egyptian hieroglyphics. The O readily symbolizes the endlessness of matter and of eternity.

More recently , some investigators have found more widespread FEF selectivity to stimulus properties. Xiao , Barborica , and Ferrera ( 2006 ) reported evidence suggesting that many FEF neurons ( 81 ) are modulated by stimulus motion , and Ferraina et al. ( 2000 ) reported that many FEF visual and visuo-movement neurons ( 76 ) were selective for binocular disparity during either early or late responses. Motion and disparity are both properties widely associated with the dorsal visual stream ( Felleman and Van Essen 1991 ) . Given the strong anatomic connections between FEF and dorsal areas , it is therefore not surprising to find FEF neurons selective for these properties. The current study examines FEF selectivity for a property associated with the ventral pathway , namely shape , which has not previously received consideration in a quantitatively rigorous manner . </shape.n.1591><shape.n.1592>Bruises : Shape of the lesion is important. Extension cords , ropes or belts leave a loop mark when folded back upon themselves , and these objects can also leave linear marks.

A hand slap can leave red linear marks the size of the hand on any part of the body.

Shape animation stores the position of points in relation to their centres; by scaling up your curve the points are n't moving in relation to the position of the center , it 's the center that 's scaling up in the axes you choose.

There is no general rule predicting whether a change in cell-to-cell coupling leads to a shortening or a lengthening of the action potential. In tissue with simulated heterogenous distribution of intrinsic action potential duration , cell-to-cell uncoupling canceled the averaging effect of electrotonic interaction , and rendered the local action potentials either longer or shorter according to their intrinsic APD.38 In a cell chain with a homogenous intrinsic APD , simulation of cell-to-cell uncoupling had no effect on APD ( J. Kucera and Y. Rudy , unpublished data , 2003 ) . Thus , the finding of overall APD shortening ( Figure 3 ) in the HZ synthetic strands suggests that remodeling of one or more repolarizing membrane currents has taken place , similar to the finding of a change in a depolarizing current during the action potential upstroke . </shape.n.1605><shape.n.1606>We experience a guitar 's shape in a number of ways.

For more moderate mountaineering and glacier travel , larger muscle groups like quads , back , and core strength would be some key areas on which to focus more specific training. When planning and carrying out weight training exercises , try to come as close to simulating what you will be doing on your climb as you can . </shape.n.1654><shape.n.1655>Human body shape is a complex phenomenon with sophisticated detail and function.

In early visual cortex , hemodynamic changes measured by fMRI correlate somewhat better with LFPs than with average spiking activity ( Logothetis et al. 2001 ) . In IT cortex , average spiking activity over 3 6 mm regions is a reasonable , but far from perfect , predictor of LFP shape preferences at the center of such regions ( Kreiman et al. 2006 ) . Furthermore , LFP shape preferences correlate for sites that are up to 8 mm apart. Thus , the spatial distribution of selectivity in LFPs has a scale that is very similar to the scale of our fMRI-determined selectivity maps ( see Supplementary Material and Supplementary Fig. 5 ) . A reasonable hypothesis is that the fMRI-determined selectivity map correlates well with both an LFP-determined selectivity map and a spatially smoothed spiking activity map. Another nonexclusive hypothesis is that small pockets of very high spike selectivity across even novel object classes underlie the fMRI-determined maps as has been reported recently for faces ( Tsao et al. 2006 ) . </shape.n.1658><shape.n.1659>[ 0037 ] In one embodiment , the device is a wire 40 having a substantially round cross section.

Given a finite point set , a family of shapes can be derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set; a real parameter , " alpha , " controls the desired level of detail.

The considerations concerning the intrinsic nature of external space suggested that only its structure , and not its qualitative nature , was constrained by spatial content.

Both chromosomes carry many genes affecting this trait. These can be modeled as 10 factors on each chromosome with small subequal effects dispersed fairly evenly along the recombinational maps. On each chromosome , most of the total effect on genetic variance is due to additive gene action , although many interactions among loci do occur. The net effect of interactions in homozygous recombinants is small and negative across almost every point on both chromosomes. On both chromosomes , heterozygotes are almost exactly intermediate between homozygotes when effects are assayed on a segment-by-segment basis. Finally , each chromosome has detectable effects on leg shape when the whole chromosome is substituted high for low , which might be pleiotropic effects of wing shape genes; but these effects are small . </shape.n.1739><shape.n.1740>A strand of RNA such as the tRNA also trends to fold into a structure similar to a protein or enzyme. This ability of the RNA has inspired the hypothetical RNA world in considering the origin of life. The single-strand RNA can fold up to various shapes , depending on the sequence of its bases. The three-dimensional structure results from hydrogen bonding between the complementary bases and between other bases. These forces twist the strand into a partial double helix with a tertiary structure. When certain strategic bonds are broken , this usually stable structure untwists to a one-dimensional form , which is more suitable for information transfer . </shape.n.1740><shape.n.1741>One of the early steps in a computer-aided system is to segment a digitized radiographic image , such as a mammogram , into foreground , for example , corresponding to the breast and background , for example , corresponding to the external surroundings of the breast ( see , e.g. , U.S. Pat. No. 5 , 452 , 367. ) This segmentation reduces the amount of further processing because extraneous pixels belonging to the background are removed from further consideration. Also , the boundary contour or border between the foreground and the background , theoretically at the skinline , is ascertained. Next , a search for masses within the area segmented as corresponding to the breast may be accomplished by analyzing the size and shape of spots , sometimes referred to as " blobs " or " islands " , that are discriminated by thresholding the mammogram at one or a few intensity levels. For example , in U.S. Pat.

One starting point for this theory is that it is unreasonable for a visual system to treat all possible shapes within the same parametric framework : whereas similar shapes may need to be compared in detail , very different shapes need merely to be distinguished from each other. How , then , should similar images be described ? For a given class of similar shapes , it is known from statistical pattern-recognition theory that a representation can be obtained in a common space spanned by a small set of reference shapes , generally referred to as basis functions. One way of generating basis functions is to apply the statistical technique of principal-components analysis , which has been used successfully to explain how the visual system approximates a solution to the theoretically simpler problem of surface colour constancy , that is , the constant colour appearance of an object 's surface independent of the illuminant on the scene. Another way of generating basis functions from a set of data is to expose an artificial neural network to prototypical examples drawn from that set . </shape.n.1742><shape.n.1743>Allied Command Transformation ( ACT ) is based in the former Allied Command Atlantic headquarters in Norfolk , Virginia , USA.

Mr. Murphy was able to delay her surgery by about eighteen months , with a physical training program that he specifically designed for her. Without that program his client would have been in pain and needed surgery at an earlier time. Only six weeks after the completion of the surgery his client was roughly seventy five percent recovered and she was walking around on her own. Someone in her age group would normally take about twelve to sixteen weeks to recover. Since her body was in such good physical shape before the surgery , and she was in a healthy and upbeat mind state her body was able to recover in a remarkable six week time period ( Murphy ) .

An example of the latter is the popularized notion of the increasing reflexivity of the body that is considered to be a defining feature of what Anthony Giddens ( 1991 ) has termed " high modernity " . Here , the reflexive monitoring of action inherent in individual agency ( as developed in his theory of structuration ( 1984 ) ) becomes radicalized in a reflexive mobilization and cultivation of the body in and by which social structures and self-identity are ( re ) produced. A careful reading of Giddens , however , reveals that the ways in which self-monitoring institutional systems via " specific body regimes " ( 1991 : 62 ) constitute and shape " reflexive mobilized bodies " ( ibid. p. 7 ) remain unspecified . </shape.n.1746><shape.n.1747>When the function DM_solve is called , it uses an optimization procedure to compute the optimal control-point positions for a deformable model given the model 's current set of loads , constraints , and deformation parameters.

The vertex is shifted by a displacement equal to the difference times a scale factor where the scale factor is given by a function depending nonlinearly on the difference. The function is bump-shaped and depends on a number of parameters. Varying the parameters leads to a rich palette of shape deformations. The proposed techniques include also shape deformations with multiple ( real , auxiliary , and virtual ) control points and constrained , directional , and anisotropic deformations.

Most antibodies target the hemagglutinin , the viral protein responsible for getting the virus into cells. The new antibodies interacted not with the hemagglutinin 's head , as antibodies often do , but rather with its stem ( Figure 11-06f , the H5 hemagglutinin ( yellow and blue ) bound to an antibody ( red ) ) .

This curve magnifies all bumps and wiggles in the curve or surface row/col and marks all inflections. For a very small change in the edit point position , there is a large change in shape in the curvature curve. The magnification or sensitivity of the curvature curve can also be increased or decreased at any time. As you move/drag the edit point , the curvature curve gets dynamically recalculated and redrawn. This technique is very important for fairing surface rows and columns. Some modeling and CAD programs display " zebra " stripes , Gaussian curvature , or highlight lines to display the fairness of the surface , but none of these techniques are dynamically redrawn as you edit the shape of the surface.

This is done as a convenience for the programmer , not the user. There are many times when the designer needs to combine both of these shapes together or to convert one shape to another. When the designer is creating a 2D or wireframe shape there is often a need to insert and delete points and to change part of a curve back and forth between a curve shape and a polyline shape. Designers do not want to be forced to deal with multiply-connected polyline and curve entities. For example , what if you want to insert a knuckle or hard point in the middle of a curve. Most programs would have you split the curve into two separate curve entities that are joined at that hard point.

Chronic and transient forms of MB are characterized by a global deficit of direction discrimination ( pandirectional ) , which is generally assumed to result from damage to , or interference with , the motion complex MT+/V5. However , the most characteristic feature of primate MT-neurons is not their motion specificity , but their preference for one direction of motion ( direction specificity ) . Here , we report that focal electrical stimulation in the human posterior temporal lobe selectively impaired the perception of motion in one direction while the perception of motion in other directions was completely normal ( unidirectional MB ) . In addition , the direction of MB was found to depend on the brain area stimulated. It is argued that direction specificity for visual motion is not only represented at the single neuron level , but also in much larger cortical units . </shape.n.1880><shape.n.1881>Initially , the Bn was billeted in an old French caserne in Versailles.

That requirement comes from man himself ...

The name literally translates as 'star-taking'. Astrolabes are commonly of brass , circular in shape and outlined with a stereographic projection of the globe and the hemisphere of the heavens. The outer 'limb ' comprises a 360 degree scale against which the rule ( alidade ) may be aligned to measure the altitude of a star by cross-reference to a revolving disc ( rete ) . The instrument shows two distinct lines of development : Islamic and Western European. The Islamic type originated in Syria in the 9th century and penetrated to Spain via North Africa in the 10th century. They were still being manufactured in the 20th century due to their use as a calculating device for the times of Muslim prayers. Western astrolabes were produced around various centres including England , France , Germany and the Netherlands . </shape.n.1926><shape.n.1927>2.

It is held in conjunction with the Southend Planetarium and the County Park Ranger Service. Saturday morning was grim and grey , but during the afternoon it brighten up and the sky cleared. It was meant to start at 5 : 30pm , but the local paper had put 5 : 00pm so we had to get there by 4 : 30pm. Terry was on gate duty and directed us to the car park where we were to set up our telescopes as the field we normally use was too boggy to use. I had borrowed Ted 's 6 " reflector to use as an access scope for visitors in wheelchairs. I had never used it before so it was steep learning curve , but we did manage to provide some nice views for a wheelchair visitor. There were a good array of scopes of all shapes and sizes and Terry had made red light illuminated signs to indicate what each scope was showing. At 6 : 00pm , the clouds rolled in and brought an end to the evening , but we had about 120 people visit so it was a success . </shape.n.1931><shape.n.1932>To provide an adequate field of view ( FOV ) , bronchoscopes are fitted with a wide-angle " fish-eye " lens , which distorts the image , making objects at the periphery of the image appear smaller than those at the centre. This form of distortion has been termed " barrel distortion " 14 , 15. Bronchoscopic distortion is radial , increasing with displacement from the centre of the FOV in a nonlinear manner 13 , 1518. Bronchoscopic distortion also alters the apparent shape of objects , making straight lines appear curved and compressing objects radially so that a circle will appear elliptical near the periphery of the field. The extent of distortion depends on how close the object is located to or extends to the edge of the field 13. Without correction , only small objects near the centre can be measured accurately 13 , 15 , 19 , 20 . </shape.n.1932><shape.n.1933>Delta is the gain of a distributed spring force that connects the deformed shape to the default shape.

The headquarters was temporarily based in Paris , France. In 1955 , NATO reorganized into two strategic commands-Atlantic Command and Allied Command Europe. AFCENT was established in Fontainebleau , France , to serve as Allied Forces Headquarters for forces assigned to the central region of Europe. In July 1966 , When the French military forces withdrew from NATO ' s integrated military structure , coordinated efforts with Belgian national authorities occurred to relocate SHAPE to Belgium.Later the Same year , AFCENT relocated to Brunssum , The Netherlands. Over the years , numerous structural and organizational changes have taken place. Most recently , in September 1999 , NATO reorganized into two command regions-Allied Forces North and South-each with numerous sub-regional commands. As a result , northern and southern region US Army battalions were established to provide support to soldiers and their families assigned to NATO headquarters in both locations . </shape.n.1935><shape.n.1936>In the layout , all shapes are represented by lines only.

Of course , the CAD/CAM program may not take , or be capable of taking , advantage of the grain direction in the product manufacture. Billet can also produce shapes that are far better compromises of weight vs. stiffness than any forging.

Immediate transfer from one to another orbit can only happen where the two orbits intersect and at least two manoeuvres are required for a transfer between two nonintersecting orbits. The increase of the spacecraft energy is best at the perifocus where the spacecraft has the biggest velocity. A change in the orbital plane is best performed at the apofocus , which is the point of minimum velocity. Figure 4.8 shows the variation of the eccentricity de for a small thrust v in the direction of the current velocity versus the eccentric anomaly E. The shape of the curves does not vary with the length of the semi-major axis. The curves were computed with the formulas presented in appendix A using Matlab.

One of the most difficult tasks in generating a successful morph is determining the correspondences between the two shapes used to drive the interpolation process. Various trade-offs are made between allowing the user full control over the process ( and turning it into a mostly manual process ) and completely automating the correspondence finding algorithm. The curve-skeleton can be used in this context for its simplicity , allowing the user to quickly specify correspondences on the skeletons or enabling matching algorithms to find correspondences more efficiently. Additionally , the interpolation process can be performed directly on the skeleton [ 11 ] [ 47 ] [ 95 ] . </shape.n.1994><shape.n.1995>The superelastic quality of Nitinol , along with its biocompatability , makes it ideal for making many types of medical devices that are implanted in the body.

Perhaps , object representations in humans are more flexible than object representations in monkeys. A close comparison of the procedures and results in the 2 studies suggests other possible explanations for this difference. A first possibility is the general phenomenon that humans achieve higher performance levels on tasks that involve a comparison of multiple stimuli , like the shape task that we used here ( Op de Beeck et al. 2003a ) . Each of the monkeys in the present study showed a very strong behavioral improvement during the training period , starting with chance performance for the largest stimulus differences in the trained object class and ending with reasonably good performance for intermediate stimulus differences ( see Behavioral Tasks ) . Nevertheless , human subjects achieved far higher performance levels after only 10 h of training than monkeys after 3 months of training. Perhaps , the smaller effects on spatial organization of object selectivity in monkeys are linked to this behavioral difference . </shape.n.2022><shape.n.2023>As fat begins to accumulate , the natural shape and curve of the body begins to diminish.

The surface skeleton of a shape consists of 2D manifolds inside its volume. Each skeleton point has a maximally inscribed ball that touches the boundary in at least two contact points. A key observation is that the boundaries of the simplified fore- and background skeletons map one-to-one to increasingly fuzzy , soft convex , respectively concave , edges of the shape. Using this property , we build a method for segmentation of 3D shapes which has several desirable properties. Our method segments both noisy shapes and shapes with soft edges which vanish over low-curvature regions. Multiscale segmentations can be obtained by varying the simplification level of the skeleton. We present a voxel-based implementation of our approach and illustrate it on several realistic examples . </shape.n.2028><shape.n.2029>Now that you know how your face shape stacks up , what 's next ?

When these act together , a varying spectrum with the correct shape and fine structure may be generated by a synthesiser based on such an approximation to the source-filter properties of the vocal system. A resonance analog speech synthesiser is thus based on the source-filter model of speech production. The Klatt software synthesiser is such a synthesiser , but implements a far more detailed realisation of the model. The Parametric Artificial Talker ( Lawrence 1953 ) was the first successful , true source-filter-based synthesiser.

Consider the obvious phenomenological differences between seeing and touching a quarter. The representationist 's reply , as I understand it , is this. What we are inclined to think of as specifically visual and tactual differences in how we perceive a quarter are in fact differences in its perceived qualities over and above its shape and size , differences between its color and luminosity , and its texture and solidity.27 So we are not forced by the phenomenal differences between sight and touch to admit differences in qualitative aspects of experience , i.e. differences in how experiences represent rather than what they apparently represent . </shape.n.2064><shape.n.2065>Shall we use higher degree and many control points ?

This is an example of spatial coding ( Snippe , 1996; Ghazanfar et al. , 2000 ) , which has also been referred to as coordinated coding ( DeCharms and Zador , 2000 ) , or across-fiber pattern coding ( Ray and Doetsch , 1990 ) . We have used template matching to quantify the representation of curvature in the population. There are two advantages to this approach. First , it is in some sense an optimal estimate , minimizing the mean square error between the estimated stimulus shape and the population response. Second , it obviates the need to assume a specific coding scheme used by the CNS. We do not imply that the CNS necessarily uses an equivalent to the template matching scheme; it may , or it may extract curvature using some specific code ( for example , some combination of second spatial derivatives of the population response , or any other measure that would reflect curvature ) . Rather , we use our measure to establish the veracity of curvature representation in the population response . </shape.n.2068><shape.n.2069>derivative ABBREV : dy/dx RELATED : partial derivative CONVERSE : integral The gradient of the graph of a function : dy/dx is the gradient of y plotted against x.

Who thought that toddlers can not appreciate how a collection of objects looks from a perspective different from their own ? Who anticipated kindergartners ' beliefs that the amount of liquid changes when it has been poured into a vessel of a different shape ?

But because the human eye can easily detect a nonsmooth curvature change , designers often blend surfaces together so they match curvature along the common edge. Mathematicians call this G2.

Several of the buildings still have the iron rings to which the horses were hitched. While being used as an artillery range , the guns were placed at the end of the strip of land running out to the west gate. When the guns were fired , the shells landed in the area now covered by the shopping center , sports fields , and schools. On the site now occupied by the Main Building was a grass air field.

There is extensive evidence that sex hormones affect specific regional adiposity and regulate utilization and accumulation of fat ( Pond , 1981 ) . Simply stated , estrogen inhibits fat deposition in the abdominal region and stimulates fat deposition in the gluteofemoral region more than in other body regions. Testosterone , in contrast , stimulates fat deposition in the abdominal region and inhibits deposition in the gluteofemoral region ( Bjorntorp , 1991 ) . It is this sexually dimorphic body fat distribution that primarily sculpts the typical body shape of women after pubertal onset. Figure 1 shows the sex difference in body shape in men and women as a function of age but independent of body weight.

In any case , we classified those who completed the second phase within 120 min , which by itself is probably already meaningful , as biphasic. Similarly , finer oscillations may have been missed due to the sampling width of 30 min.

The photostress test and Amsler grid are two such examples. The photostress test measures the time it takes to recover central visual function , e.g. acuity following exposure to a bright light , and is very useful for distinguishing maculopathy from optic neuropathy. Recovery times are prolonged in a variety of macular disorders but are normal in optic neuropathies. Amsler grid testing is an objective way to assess alteration of object shape and size , a characteristic of macular disease ( see Chapter 8 , Sudden difficulty reading the paper ) . In yet other cases , a particular aspect of the eye examination that requires some experience and expertise , such as inspection of the drainage angle ( gonioscopy ) or visualization of the peripheral retina ( scleral depression ) , provides the key to the correct diagnosis. While such examination techniques are beyond the purview of the non-ophthalmologist , it is crucial to know when the patient should be referred for such examination.

LV dilatation and larger annular dimensions after inferior myocardial infarction require the mitral leaflets to cover more area during closing , exceeding their normal redundancy or " reserve , " which is exacerbated by restricted leaflet closure owing to apical tenting ( type IIIb ) . Based on MRI , septolateral annular dilatation and diminished LV systolic function determine mitral systolic tenting area , which , in turn , is predictive of the severity of the IMR.158 Additionally , the normal annulus has a distinctive saddle shape , which becomes accentuated during systole.171 173 In IMR , this accentuation of the saddle shape , as measured by the annular height to commissural width ratio , is eliminated , suggesting an association between maintaining the saddle shape and valvular competence.171 Thus deformation of the saddle shape of the annulus in conjunction with valve tenting contributes to the development of IMR.172 , 173 </shape.n.2126><shape.n.2127>ABSTRACT : The study examined the relationship between height and body image parameters related to dieting , body weight , and shape among 174 Subjects.

The luster and texture of the interior of the voids may sometimes be used in the recognition of voids caused by accumulation of water and passageways for water.The properties on which distinctions may be made between the various types of voids are arbitrary and may vary from one laboratory to the next. Because these distinctions are made on the appearance of a void on the surface of a slice ( where the third dimension of the void can not be seen ) , many large voids will be classified as entrained voids when they are really entrapped voids. As indicated in figures 58 and 59 , a small section through a large void can be indistinguishable in two dimensions from a large section through a small void. A cross section that is larger than the defined maximum for entrained voids must be a section of an entrapped air void or a water-formed void.

When developing a form that is generally the same , this enables all the aspects of the form to be created in a proper order with proper relationships. In the it was shown that all coffee makers fundamentally have the same components. By utilizing labels , it was ensured that each of these components would be created and be placed in a reasonable relationship with the other components. The coffee maker grammar utilized rules that applied to more than one view : top , side , and front. The labels enabled changes to be made in multiple views that were sensible , and then the final shapes could be abstracted to 3-D models. The labels drove the grammar and prevented the rules from creating forms that did not hold the necessary functionality. For example , labels enforced an important relationship among the three main components : the filter , the water storage unit , and the base unit. Labels prevented the base unit from being above the water storage unit , so that the final coffee maker design could be usable . </shape.n.2201><shape.n.2202>A common misconception is that channel dynamics are ignored in IFIM.

If stakeholders are comfortable using the estimates and best guesses of an analogous stream model , there is no reason that the model output can not be used as input to PHABSIM.

In the future , as two-dimensional hydraulic models evolve for instream flow analyses , obtaining better predictions of localized scour and deposition at a relatively small scale may become possible.

Cancer is often characterized as a chaotic , poorly regulated growth. Not surprisingly , the irregular shapes of cancerous cells , tumors , and vasculature defy description by traditional Euclidean geometry , which is based on smooth shapes such as the line , plane , cylinder , and sphere. In contrast , fractal geometry reveals how an object with irregularities of many sizes may be described by examining how the number of features of one size is related to the number of similarly shaped features of other sizes. By focusing on the irregularity of tumor growth rather than on a single measure of size such as diameter or volume , fractal geometry is well suited to quantify those morphological characteristics that pathologists have long used in a qualitative sense to describe malignanciestheir ragged border with the host tissue and their seemingly random patterns of vascular growth . </shape.n.2204><shape.n.2205>1.

A brief explanation of the meaning of form may be helpful for non-specialist readers. According to Aristotle and Aquinas , all material things are composed of matter , which has the potentiality to be actualized in particular ways and form , which is the actualization of one of the potentialities. For example , this piece of iron could assume any of a number of shapes. It has these potentialities and so it is " matter " in relationship to shape. It is in fact in the shape of a bar three feet long and one inch in diameter. That actual shape is its form. Besides forms such as shape , colour , temperature , etc. , there are 'substantial forms " which constitute a being as an actual substance or first being of a particular kind. The substantial form of any living being is called a soul. The substantial form of a human being is a rational soul. In these terms , any change in a material thing involves the acquisition of a new form by some matter . </shape.n.2252><shape.n.2253>Three-dimensional ( 3-D ) coordinates of points on the distorted fringes were calculated by spatial analytic geometry ( Song et al. , 2001 ) .

The first reason is that social groups became sufficiently large that unique identities were required to keep track of and refer to individuals.

Bonobos seem to have abstract symbolic ability to a higher degree than chimpanzees - which fits with the fact that their social groups are much larger. As well as the symbolic ability of chimpanzees and bonobos trained to use abstract geometric shapes to communicate with humans , examples of symbol use have been recorded in natural conditions - for example the young bonobo that used a log of wood as a 'doll ' to play with exactly as if it were a baby; or the way in which bonobos communicate the need to move on to a new camp by dragging a large branch around the troop and showing it to each member - the branch seems to serve as a symbol ( presumably learned ) of the need to move . </shape.n.2286><shape.n.2287>A collection of a semen sample obtained by masturbation that is analyzed in the laboratory for the sperm count , sperm motility , sperm shape , quantity , and evaluation of the ejaculate liquid may be recommended.

The problem of audiovisual coherence is quite important : human interlocutors are very sensitive to discrepancies between the visible and audible consequences of articulation [ 10 , 11 ] and have expectations on resulting audiovisual traces of the same underlying articulation. The effective modeling of audiovisual speech is therefore a challenging issue for trajectory formation systems and still an unsolved problem. Note however that intrinsically coherent visual and audio signals can be computed by articulatory synthesis where control and shape models drive the internal speech organs of the vocal tract ( tongue , velum , etc. ) . This vocal tract shape is then made audible by the placement and computation of appropriate sound sources . </shape.n.2316><shape.n.2317>New school requirements will mandate more physical exercise for students in the coming school year , but the bad physical condition of Texas youths wo n't be resolved with a few more gym classes.

There is a lot of variation in shape between imples , but this is reflected at a deeper level of detail , where the imple is described as if it were a separate subpart. An imple has two pairs of axes : The first pair are the waist line separating the imple from other convex subparts , and the normal to that line. The second pair are the major and minor axes with respect to which the imple shape is defined. The use of two pairs of axes means that the imple can be regarded as a curve when its exact shape is not important ( the waist axes can be regarded as curve axes ) , while the complete shape description can be related to that curve model for operations on the imple itself . </shape.n.2320><shape.n.2321>A rectangle shape building is associated with the element of wood.

Criticism should be creative in the sense that it transcends both the viewpoint being criticized and the critic 's own viewpoint. Ever since Hegel , to transcend has meant to eliminate and to maintain. Unless one discovers and eliminates a limitation one can not give shape to a particular new quality. But conversely , unless one maintains certain values , unless one establishes continuity and accepts the partial , if only relative truth which the criticized viewpoint embodies , there can be no genuine progress. Thus , in order to be dialectical , criticism should not be destructiveand above all it should be selfcritical; its own point of view evolves in the process of criticism. In setting itself in opposition to the other viewpoint criticism sees its own limitations and strives toward a new synthesis . </shape.n.2327><shape.n.2328>Shape nodes may specify an Appearance node that describes the appearance properties ( material , texture and texture transformation ) to be applied to the Shape 's geometry.

Completed in 1997 under the leadership of Dean Judy Areen , the East Wing houses classrooms , offices , and conference rooms. Built at a cost of $ 12 million , the new wing improves the east facade of McDonough without looking like a last minute fix. Stone 's unwieldy podium is shortened , thus making it more inviting. The color of the bricks is identical but their shape is slightly concave , bringing " new interest " to the curtain walls. The wing 's height lines up with McDonough Hall and retains Stone 's signature flat protruding eave. The rotunda and precast concrete recall the Williams Library and the Gewirz Center. The architects reproduced Stone 's vertical piers and windows but introduced architectural hierarchy to the facade. In addition , the piers are fluted rather than flat.

I propose a unified approach to visual representation , addressing both the needs of superordinate and basic-level categorization and of identification of specific instances of familiar categories. According to the proposed theory , a shape is represented by its similarity to a number of reference shapes , measured in a high-dimensional space of elementary features. This amounts to embedding the stimulus in a ( ... ) low-dimensional proximal shape space. That space turns out to support representation of distal shape similarities which is veridical in the sense of Shepard 's ( 1968 ) notion of second-order isomorphism ( i.e. , correspondence between distal and proximal similarities among shapes , rather than between distal shapes and their proximal representations ) . Furthermore , a general expression for similarity between two stimuli , based on comparisons to reference shapes , can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging from continuous , symmetric , and hierarchical , as in the multidimensional scaling models ( Shepard , 1980 ) , to discrete and non-hierarchical , as in the general contrast models ( Tversky , 1977; Shepard and Arabie , 1979 ) .

In this paper , an approach is presented that describes knowledge content and transitions by means of graphic entities present in the graphic representation. Graphic entities such as lines , shapes , and symbols conform to conventions of depiction and conventions of encoding. This means that a certain set of graphic entities ( e.g. a set of lines ) has a particular meaning ( e.g. a system of axes , a grid , zoning ) . Such a set is connected to different design decisions ( e.g. a basic ordering of spaces along axes , a field defining place and measure , and areas with specific properties ) . Therefore , it is necessary to distinguish between sets of graphic entities that have different meanings. Such a set is termed a " graphic unit " : a set of graphic entities with a specific meaning. Description by means of graphic units results in generalised graphic representations. Graphic representations that share the same graphic units deal with the same design decisions. Such generalised graphic representations are termed " generic representations. " </shape.n.2371><shape.n.2372>So how does one mathematically define curve thickness and the ideal shape of a knot ?

It is at this point that the specifically double content aspect of the present account performs some useful additional work. Consider perception of two qualitatively identical pictures of triangles , which differ only in that the interior angles of one are numbered , while instead the sides of the other are numbered. In each case , the physical causal factors associated with the triangular/trilateral shapes as such are the same. However , the aspectual factors , including the numbered angles in one case versus numbered sides in the other , are different. So the retinal sensory data available to a perceiver of the two will be different in each case , and that combined causal difference is sufficient to causally account for the fact that a perceiver would likely enter a different functional state in each case as a result of her inferential double content , aspect plus object processing of the retinal data . </shape.n.2376><shape.n.2377>Rare three colour , blue , lavender and white medallion , in thin convex shape made for mounting on a watch case.

In addition , the ratio of the weight of the kidneys to kidney-fat , and the contents of fat in the bone-marrow , were determined. From these investigations are deduced and described simple criteria for assessment of the physical condition of African Elephants , which criteria allow objective classification of representative population samples. Extensive individual variations of external anatomical features complicate assessment of the condition. Most of the investigated external physical features are more age- than nutrition-dependent. Only the shape of the lumbar region and the kidney-fat index give a fairly reliable indication of the physical condition of the African elephant . </shape.n.2402><shape.n.2403>THE genetic control of organ shapes in development can be analyzed using metrics that eliminate the allometric effect of size.

Rapid dynamic scans are required to capture the true shape of the time activity curve , coupled with high spatial resolution to provide adequate separation between the neighboring brain regions. These constraints have led to the development of multipinhole multiple-detector stationary SPECT systems ( 53 , 54 ); because the detectors do not need to rotate around the object , they can capture fast kinetics , which would otherwise be lost or blurred in a rotating scanner. Although the effect of radiation dose on small animals has not been studied in great detail , it is clear that brain-imaging studies may be one of the first applications in which multipinhole SPECT systems are a necessity because of the higher doses required for sufficient counting statistics in dynamic or quantitative SPECT. Indeed , simulation studies have been performed in which the multipinhole configuration is optimized specifically for mouse brain imaging ( 55 ) , enabling the radiation dose to be reduced by an order of magnitude . </shape.n.2434><shape.n.2435>Dogs vary in size , shape , color , coat length and behavior more than any other animal.

A variety of shape stimuli were presented , including 3-D objects , 3-D surfaces , and monkey faces ( see Fig. 10 ) . Example objects ( rendered with shading ) are shown in Fig. 10A. Object surfaces were rendered with white-colored random dots or square texture elements. Objects were 8.5 of visual angle. Random dot objects were rotated in depth about the vertical axis while textured objects were translated with small displacements in the x-y plane ( mimicking microsaccades that keep the image from fading on the retina ) . Control stimuli for rotating random dot objects were constructed by repositioning object dots in 3-D space , such that the scrambled stimuli appeared as rotating , ill-defined volumes of independently moving dots rather than rigidly rotating objects with clearly defined surfaces ( see Fig. 3A from Sereno et al. 2002 for stimulus construction ) . Textured object control stimuli were constructed by scrambling the texture gradient ( i.e. , swapping texture element positions; see Fig. 3B from Sereno et al. 2002 for stimulus construction ) .

In the gradient concept structural ecosystem properties are comprehended as concentration gradients in space and time ( M ller , 1998 ) . Any niche gradient is a peak of the fitness landscape of one environmental characteristic ( Wright , 1931 ) , which can be visualized in two-dimensional space as a graph with certain skew and width , determining the ecological amplitude. The shape of the fitness graph for certain characteristic can be plotted through the abundance of certain specimen benefitting of this characteristic. All niche gradients are situated and establish a multi-dimensional hyper-room , which axes are different environmental parameters. Thus , any learning niche in social systems is determined as a set of characteristics that people perceive and actualize as useful for their activities and wellbeing individually or in groups. Each niche gradient defines one dimension of the space. The fundamental niche term applies for all the possibly usable software tools and services , artifacts and people , while the realized niches form under the constrained conditions of resource availability . </shape.n.2460><shape.n.2461>Further information : The NATO structure is divided into two commands , one for operations and one for transformation.

( a ) On a sphere , the direction of the pull of gravity is always toward the center of the sphere , and therefore equal changes in angle correspond to equal distances along the surface. ( b ) On an ellipsoid , the direction of the pull of gravity is not always toward the center. Consequently , equal changes in angle correspond to different distances along the surface.

More important security challenge is taking shape just next to the eastern border of the Alliance. It should be named as the political , economical and military activism of Russian Federation in order to keep multiple influence in Eastern Europe. What NATO shoud do about this rising challenge ? First of all , the defense plans for the Central and Eastern Europe should be created. Up to date defensive plans of the eastern region of the Alliance need to be addressed in the development of new NATO Strategic Concept. What is more , this should be done very seriously. Additionally , NATO members that can be named as " frontier " members ( in geographical terms ) should get very clear common assurance that initiatives that can be implemented under Article 5 are developed and will be applied in case of foreign agression . </shape.n.2511><shape.n.2512>Easter Egg Maths Quiz 2 Presentations , Age 7-11 ( KS2 ) , Age 11-14 ( KS3 ) , Mathematics , Games and puzzles , Calculations and numerical method , Shape and space , A colourful and animated PP for year 6/7.

Overall , the shape of the CSF for detection is that of a bandpass filter which peaks at about 1.5 cyc/deg. Reliable measurements could be obtained out to 20 cyc/deg and extrapolation of the data would suggest a cutoff spatial frequency for detection of about 30 cyc/deg , which is somewhat less than cutoff for the same subject viewing interference fringes ( Thibos , et al. , 1987a ) . Of course contrast sensitivity for resolution could be measured only for frequencies below the resolution limit , but over this limited frequency range we found the same sensitivity for resolution and detection. This result is consistent with Thomas 's ( Thomas , 1987 ) conclusion that for low spatial frequencies , there is no significant difference between contrast sensitivity for detection and for resolution at any eccentricity . </shape.n.2513><shape.n.2514>One Shape , the Path class , uses a Geometry to describe its contents.

For example , the two curves shown below are of the same knot type ( K31 ) , but the second is substantially thicker than the first.

In its simple form , the theory held that a cognition develops over anatomical stages in the brain. These stages are entrained at successive phases and are aligned in a sequence that reflects evolutionary growth. This was the shape of early recapitulation theory as applied to brain and behavior.

Most of the energy derived from fat gets to the muscle through the bloodstream and reduces stored fat in the entire body , from the last place where fat was deposited. Sit-ups may improve the size and shape of abdominal muscles but will not specifically target belly fat for loss. Such exercise might help reduce overall body fat and shrink the size of fat cells.

Objects cast shadows both upon themselves and upon background surfaces. Previous research on the perception of 3-D shape from cast shadows has only examined the informativeness of shadows cast upon flat background surfaces. In outdoor environments , however , background surfaces often possess significant curvature ( large rocks , trees , hills , etc. ) and this background curvature distorts the shape of cast shadows. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which observers can " discount " the distorting effects of curved background surfaces. In our experiments , observers viewed deforming or static shadows of naturally-shaped objects that were cast upon flat and curved background surfaces. The results showed that the discrimination of 3-D object shape from cast shadows was generally invariant over the distortions produced by hemispherical background surfaces. The observers often had difficulty , however , in identifying the shadows cast onto saddle-shaped background surfaces. The variations in curvature that occur in different directions on saddle-shaped background surfaces cause shadow distortions that lead to difficulties in object recognition and discrimination . </shape.n.2557><shape.n.2558>Today ' s computers can process information at incredible speeds , and have the flexibility to store and display data in many different forms.

It is thinner or flatter than most insects and equipped with body hair that has a two-fold purpose : sticking to its host and moving around on its host. With its shape and body hair , the flea 's body is likened to a Velcro dart. Responding to movement , vibrations and the warmth , carbon dioxide and humidity of an animal 's breath and body , the flea jumps upwards towards its intended target. Once it touches the target ( animal ) it is able to make a safe landing with the aid of body hairs that only point backwards. These backwards facing hairs give the flea the Velcro effect needed to stick to its host and to crawl forward without falling back to the ground. Even the hairs that resemble a tiny beard serve as extra support , especially during feeding. This beard-like array ( called a comb ) is one of the characteristics that distinguish the Cat Flea from other fleas . </shape.n.2562><shape.n.2563>Cardio Keep your heart rate in check as you track your steps toward a healthier life.

It is much less parsimonious to postulate functional-role contents for these CRs , with qualitative features playing a purely evidential or intermediate role. Admittedly , there are words in the language which do have a functional-style meaning , and their ascriptions must exemplify the sort of multistage process postulated by the complex version of functionalism. Consider the expression can-opener , for example. This probably means something like : device capable of ( or used for ) opening cans. To identify something as a can-opener , however , one does n't have to see it actually open a can. One can learn that objects having certain intrinsic and categorical properties ( shape , sharpness , and so on ) also thereby exemplify the requisite functional ( relational , dispositional ) property. So when one sees an object of the right shape ( etc. ) , one classifies it as a can-opener . </shape.n.2568><shape.n.2569>Most students in prekindergarten through grade 2 know the word triangle and have some idea of what it means.

Students can compare the triangles on their geoboards and discuss whether or not each shape is actually a triangle. Some students may feel that a triangle with a vertex oriented toward the bottom of the geoboard is not really a triangle.

They provide impedance matching between the pressure waves in the air , and the required displacements of the perilymph in the inner ear , by intensifying the pressure fluctuations on a 22 : 1 ratio. They comprise the malleus ( hammer ) , incus ( anvil ) , and stapes ( stirrup ) . These are names derived from Latin , based upon their shape , which is at first sight rather curious. They are , in fact , a miracle of evolution , and not only provide near-perfect matching , but , because of their shape and attachment , protect the ear against overload. Excess movements cause rotations instead of displacements , reducing the transmission of energy to the inner ear. They also reduce bone-conducted input from the owner 's vocal efforts , walking , etc. because the centre of gravity and the centre of rotation of the malleus coincide , eliminating transmission to the inner ear of vibrations of the head in a vertical direction.

If this is the case then about fifteen billion years ago all space , time , and matter suddenly appeared ( physicists are just starting to play with asking how and from where ) and started expanding. This is called the big bang , though it was not an explosion of matter in space as some people have illustrated it. It is true that at the time of the big bang the universe was very hot , but that is because all the matter of the universe was squeezed into a very small space. The universe expanded from this state simply because that is what spacetime does according to Einstein 's equations . </shape.n.2576><shape.n.2577>Our next point explains why matter will take on a flat disc shape in the Universe , such as in galaxies.

To develop spatial sense , children must have many experiences that focus on geometric relationships; the direction , orientation , and perspectives of objects in space; the relative shapes and sizes of figures and objects; and how a change in shape relates to a change in size. These experiences depend on a child 's ability to follow directions that use words like above , below , and behind and to progress to such activities as using a computer to reproduce a pattern-block design. When children examine the result of combining two shapes to form a new shape , predict the effect of changing the number of sides of a shape , draw a shape after it has been rotated a quarter or half turn , or explore what happens when the dimensions of a shape are changed , they acquire a deeper understanding of shapes and their properties.

From the remaining genera of the Katsuwonidae , Euthynnus differs in the shape of the posterior orifice of the myodome which is roughly spherical in this view. In Auxis it resembles a greatly elongated and narrow inverted " U , " whereas in Katsuwonus the margins are almost vertical so that little if any of the orifice is seen.

For example , if previous studies using face stimuli were uncovering selectivity that reflects the shape properties of faces , in addition to familiarity or meaning , then one might expect some relationship between the spatial patterns of object selectivity reported here and the spatial distribution of face patches , for example , a correlation across voxels between the preference for faces over other objects and the preference for one of the novel object classes . </shape.n.2599><shape.n.2600>The preceding illustrations demonstrate the powerful effects generated by arrangements of visual shapes.

Prefrontal executive systems may not have direct access to action control. Rather , they may work by evoking motivational imagery , broadcast from the visual cortex , to control relevant parts of motor cortex , thereby generating appropriate actions. Parts of the brain that play a role in emotion may also be triggered by global broadcasting of conscious contents from sensory cortices and insular cortex. For example , it is established that the midbrain amygdalae are needed to recognize facial expressions of fear and anger from the visual system ( Le Doux , 1996 ) .

Ducasse 's formulation " I sense bluely , squarely " can not distinguish between sensing an indefinite patch of blue and a square from sensing a blue square. Nor will separating the visual locations of such color and shape intuitions do the trick. Sensing " leftly bluely " and " rightly squarely " would indeed remove ambiguity , but it also implicitly introduces a new form of object identification into the description of the phenomenon. The locations in the visual field are themselves species of objects. We have a sensation " here " or " there " in the visual field , thereby logically implying an object-like status to the segments of visual space themselves. These spatial object areas , designated " left " and " right , " then remain as static ( non-adverbial ) givens even if the mental objects " in " them can be designated as " modes " rather than objects . </shape.n.2609><shape.n.2610>The extracted and aggregated metadata need to be stored and managed.

However , if not stored , then there are three approaches to identify path sequences : 1 ) user interactive , in that a shape description is given by users , 2 ) data mining , in that a shape description is identified if similar to any known image , 3 ) mixed approach , in that a data mining technique may suggest an image shape , but the description may be modified by users . </shape.n.2610><shape.n.2611>With a thing that owes its possibility to a purpose , a building , or even an animal , its regularity , which consists in symmetry , must express the unity of the intuition accompanying the concept of its end , and belongs with it to cognition.

The relative standard deviation of these twelve shape indices is defined as the shape-irregularity measure of a microcalcification. This measure is small for a compact ( e.g. , square-shaped ) microcalcification , since all twelve shape indices have similar values.

If the elements of a scene are not different enough from each other , no one part gets our attention over another. Vision scientists describe two sequential processes that direct our attention : the first is a rapid scanning system that tells us if a simple property is different in one or more parts of a scene. After the initial scan , we direct our attention to individual features of the scene-color , shape , orientation , size-and compare each part with others to detect subtle differences , or we compare each with a previously known version of the scene or object. Our ability to recognize any differences in what appear initially to be two identical objects , or sets of objects , depends on several factors , such as the degree of differences and previous familiarity with the objects . </shape.n.2642><shape.n.2643>A stiff but flexible hollow cube , made from brightly coloured cloth sporting modern and stimulating geometric designs , makes up the body of the toy.

We can separate unwanted synaesthesias , create new and desirable ones , expand our repertoire of thinking by including habitually ignored representations and facilitate our capacity to learn with deliberate mental photographs and sound recordings.

Regarding the two kinds of curves , specific algorithms were presented in detail , strict mathematical proofs were given , and the effectiveness of the method was shown by examples. This method has the following three advantages : ( 1 ) the pattern is unified; ( 2 ) the parameter able to adjust the shape of the transition curve is available; ( 3 ) the transition curve is only a single segment , and the algorithm can be formulated as a low order equation to be solved for its positive root.

Many previous studies have reported category-selective cortical patches and patterns of selectivity in the object vision pathway ( Kanwisher et al. , 1997a; Epstein and Kanwisher , 1998; Downing et al. , 2001 , 2006; Haxby et al. , 2001; Schwarzlose et al. , 2005; Spiridon et al. , 2006 ) . Two studies also compared the differences in activation patterns for familiar objects with similarity metrics , exactly as we did here , using either perceived similarity ( Edelman et al. , 1998 ) or image-based attributes ( O'Toole et al. , 2005 ) . However , because these studies used exemplars from familiar object categories and did not explicitly dissociate perceived similarity for simple pixel-based metrics , this selectivity for familiar objects might be related to many factors : low-level visual similarity , object form/shape ( Haxby et al. , 2000 ) , the way objects are processed ( Gauthier , 2000 ) , semantic attributes ( Chao et al. , 1999 ) , and eccentricity biases ( Hasson et al. , 2002 ) . </shape.n.2716><shape.n.2717>A black , mist like spirit that has no discernable features.

Nonetheless , in a plenary meeting of the Belgian parliament on April 1 , 2004 , Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel stated , " in the first place , there was a meeting concerning NATO.

Thus , even though , from the standpoint of abstract geometry , the circle is isoperimetric , from the standpoint of physical geometry , some other shape provides the greatest stability for the tallest area. The shape that achieves this is a pointed arch in which the two arcs that make up the arch are circular arcs with different centers. ( See Figure 6. ) The pointed arch , thus , not only encloses a taller area , but is more stable because the curvature of the arch conforms more closely to the physical line of stresses in the structure. In other words , the shape of the arch is determined not by abstract geometrical characteristics but by physical ones . </shape.n.2721><shape.n.2722>Bull. London Math Soc. ( 16 ) , 1984 , pp. 81-121.

To this end , we identified eight patients with central and paracentral scotomas caused by macular disease. The location , shape and extent of these scotomas was carefully mapped with retinal specific microperimetery. Next we had subjects view a large field of dynamic ( 60Hz ) noise followed by a homogenous grey test screen in thirty second cycles ( figure 1 ) . Patients were asked to fixate a cross that was continuously present , although eye movements during the noise phase were unimportant since the stimulus was a uniform , spatially extensive noise field. During the test phases , subjects were asked to identify areas of any perceived anomaly in the blank screen by tracing around them with a stylus on a touch-sensitive screen mounted over the computer monitor. All participants were unfamiliar with the TwAE before the study and were asked to describe the appearance of the adapting and test screens . </shape.n.2733><shape.n.2734>A report of the Johns Hopkins University discusses findings based on recordings of nerve cells in the visual cortex of macaque monkeys. The research reveals that neurons in the higher-level visual cortex at first respond to a visual stimulus  somewhat indiscriminately , " signalling all the individual features within a shape to which they are sensitive. For instance , a particular neuron may respond to objects with either a concave fragment at the top or a convex fragment at the bottom. At this point , the neural signals are ambiguous; the brain does not know whether the concavity , the convexity or both are present. Milliseconds later neurons begin to react exclusively to combinations of shape fragments , rather than to individual fragments. In other words , the brain begins to put the pieces together to form larger sections , in the same way that an artisan might fasten discrete pieces of stained glass to create a design.

As his model is based on passive observation as the primary perceptual mode , it encounters difficulties when it comes to explaining external eliciting conditions involving embodied interaction and actual use in addition to visual experience. We thereby get an incomplete picture of emotional user experience , something that Dolphin provides us with a clear example of. Consider again the appraisal of appealingness. As soon as patients start interacting with Dolphin , they will experience quite the opposite of pleasantness. Because , in actual use , the healthcare design does not feel the way it looks. Thus , the experience of the rounded shapes together with the smooth and warm embrace contrasts rather sharply with the feeling of pain caused by the sting of the needle. Pleasantness then suddenly turns into unpleasantness. However , as I will argue later , the unpleasantness does not necessarily suppress the pleasant emotional response completely. Since the smooth pleasant embrace of the arm is co-existent with the puncturing sting , there is good reason to believe that emotions emerging cross-perceptually from different sources are able to co-occur and modify each other . </shape.n.2739><shape.n.2740>Morel fungus.

For if the mind is one type of thing , and the body is another , how do these two types of things interact ? To put it differently , if the mind really is a nonmaterial substance , lacking physical properties such as spatial location and shape , how can it be both the cause of effects in the material world -- like making bodies move -- and itself be causally affected by that world -- as when a thumb slammed with a hammer ( bodily cause ) causes one to feel pain ( mental effect ) ?

Prior probability models are constructed implicitly on tangent bundle of shape space , using past observations.

It is now well established that the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) extracts information about the local orientation , spatial frequency and polarity of contours and edges ( Hubel &amp;Wiesel , 1962 ) . Receptive fields of V1 neurons can be thought of as discrete and localized linear filters each one seeing only a small part of the visual scene. However , there is evidence supporting the idea that lower cortical areas , through facilitative and suppressive interactions , are also involved in global processing ( see Allman , Miezin &amp;McGuinness , 1985; Gilbert , 1992; Fitzpatrick , 2000 ) . More complex global processing of visual stimuli is also known to occur further along the visual cortical pathway. Single-unit electrophysiology experiments indicate that neurons at the highest level of the ventral processing stream in the inferotemporal cortex ( IT ) respond specifically to very complex stimuli and are tuned for highly complex patterns such as faces ( Gross , 1992 ) .

The term " repeatable " , as used in the description and the claims which follow , is intended to mean a result or a product ( such as the shape of a slug ) that is invariant in its dimensions ( for example ) within a given tolerance , the tolerance usually equal to a few percentages of the dimensions.

As a benefit , it shows that many critical tasks for working with objects can be accomplished with a limited sensor. These tasks include tracking objects , building structural models , and learning actions. Moreover , these representations can support object classification and goal-directed planning. As a drawback , a richer data stream could provide more information for distinguishing objects. As the planar laser rangefinder is a range sensor , similar methods could be applied to building object representations from three dimensional range sensors including 3D scanners and stereo vision. Tracking would generalize directly using SLAM techniques to separate the dynamic sensor readings from the static background. The geometric constraints used to determine an object 's shape could be generalized from rays to planes , though some algorithmic modifications may be required for handling higher volume data streams. Generalizing to other sensors such as monocular vision requires more research , since real-time background subtraction with a moving camera is still a challenging research problem.

This method was also applied to determine the central shape of the nucleus of the lens ( Koretz , Cook , &amp;Kaufman , 2001; 2002 ) . However , earlier studies in which Scheimpflug photography was used have not taken into account the fact that the nucleus is imaged through the cornea and the anterior lens surface.

The approach is illustrated by analyzing the response of a random rod subject to a box car type of axial impact and , also , by considering the flexural response of a randomly inhomogeneous beam resting on randomly varying Winkler 's foundation and subjected to the action of a moving force.

Ceramic materials have several advantages over single crystals , such as higher sensitivity ( up to several hundred times higher ) and ease of fabrication in several shapes and sizes. A major advantage of PVDF piezofilm over piezoceramics is its low acoustic impedance , closer to that of animal tissue. A good impedance match allows better transduction of acoustic signals. To pick up electric charge , conductive electrodes must be applied to the crystal at the opposite sides of the cut.

For each base type an entire hierarchy of array types allows for shape specifications of varying precision. Taking int as an example , the most general type specification is int [ * ] , which may represent a scalar as well as an array of any shape. In contrast , the type int [ + ] denotes an array of any shape , but excludes scalars. Scalar data types may either be specified using an empty vector as shape specification as in int [ ] or , in a more familiar way , by the base type alone. Using the dot notation as in int [ . , . ] allows for the specification of arrays with a concrete dimensionality , but whose extent in each dimension is still left unspecific. Of course , a type may also specify the exact shape of an array as in int [ 10 , 20 ] . The latter two notations may be mixed so that concrete extents are given for some inner dimensions but left unspecific for outer dimensions , e.g. int [ . , . , 10 , 20 ] . </shape.n.2954><shape.n.2955>Chin-length or longer styles work well with a heart shaped face.

Due to the influence of gravity all the matter in the universe ( galaxies , cats , gas , you , me ) will be pulling on all the other matter in the universe and this will cause the expansion to slow down. This is not only important for determining the age of the universe more accurately. If there is enough matter , the gravitational pull of the matter will actually cause the expansion to stop and reverse ! . This is another perspective on the possibility that the shape of the universe is a 3-sphere of positive curvature. So it is very important to determine how Hubble 's constant is changing with time. The quantity that measures this is called the deceleration parameter. This is very hard to measure directly , but there are several indirect measurements which indicate that the universe will expand forever. The value of the deceleration parameter is , however , surprisingly close to the borderline between expanding forever and eventually contracting. This is currently considered a mystery . </shape.n.2965><shape.n.2966>Patch shape complexity : Shape complexity relates to the geometry of patches -- whether they tend to be simple and compact , or irregular and convoluted. Shape is an extremely difficult spatial attribute to capture in a metric because of the infinite number of possible patch shapes. Hence , shape metrics generally index overall shape complexity rather than attempt to assign a value to each unique shape. The most common measures of shape complexity are based on the relative amount of perimeter per unit area , usually indexed in terms of a perimeter-to-area ratio , or as a fractal dimension , and often standardized to a simple Euclidean shape ( e.g. , circle or square ) . The interpretation varies among the various shape metrics , but in general , higher values mean greater shape complexity or greater departure from simple Euclidean geometry. Other methods have been proposed : radius of gyration ( Pickover 1990 ); contiguity ( LaGro 1991 ); linearity index ( Gustafson and Parker 1992 ); and elongation and deformity indices ( Baskent and Jordan 1995 ) , but these have not yet become widely used ( Gustafson 1998 ) . </shape.n.2966><shape.n.2967>This is the name for a channel that surrounds the circumference of the anterior chamber.

This is not to deny that there may be a small set of visual factors or geometric primitives that underpin object recognition [ 27 ] , which could potentially be discovered using methods like ours , but applied to visual brain area activation patterns in response to pictures of objects.

It often is the case that any script which can convey syllabic content without ambiguity or error could be used for a language. Sanskrit for instance could be written in half a dozen different scripts. A computer application dealing with a specific script will certainly have to honour the writing conventions in vogue but text processing can not be based on the way the script displays a specific syllable. What is critical is the linguistic content in the syllable because it represents the sounds the syllable is built with and not the shapes used in composing the display. The latin script handles the problem by displaying the syllable only by composing it from the shapes of the consonants and vowel and this rule is meticulously followed. With writing systems which are syllabic in nature , each syllable has its own unique shape and identifying the syllable from its shape is much more complex but it has the advantage that there will be no ambiguity in the sounds when the written text is read out . </shape.n.2971><shape.n.2972>As his brothers slowly began getting into shape , Emmanuel took a long look at his physique.

The shape of the early embryo is a result of different yolk concentrations in the eggs. Birds ' and reptiles ' eggs are heavily yolked. Their eggs develop similarly to amphibians except the yolk has deformed the shape of the embryo. The ball is stretched out and lying atop the yolk. Mammals have no yolk , but still form a disk early. This is because they have descended from reptiles. Mammals lost their yolky eggs , but retained the early pattern of development. In all these vertebrates , the pattern of cell movements is similar despite superficial differences in appearance. In addition , all types quickly converge upon a primitive , fish-like stage within a few days. From there , development diverges . </shape.n.2976><shape.n.2977>Edit Mode allows you to modify the shape of the curve as well as its parameters.

Since , on separation , the average density of the fluid in the central column is less than it was initially , the pressure at the bottom of the central column has decreased.

Increasing the degree of a B zier curve adds flexibility to the curve for shape design. However , this will significantly increase processing effort for curve evaluation and manipulation. Furthermore , a B zier curve of high degree may cause numerical noise in computation. For these reasons , we often split the curve such that each subdivided segment can be represented by a lower degree B zier curve. This technique is known as piecewise representation. A curve that is made of several B zier curves is called a composite B zier curve or a B zier spline curve. In some area ( e.g. , computer data exchange ) , a composite B zier cubic curve is known as the PolyB zier. If a composite B zier curve of degree n has m B zier curves , then the composite B zier curve has in total m n+1 control vertices . </shape.n.3034><shape.n.3035>This sense of measured detachment is continued through to its placement on the site.

This definition is consistent with the above , in that the shape of a set does not depend on its position , size or orientation. However , it does not always imply an exact mathematical transformation. For example it is common to talk of ''star-shaped'' objects even though the number of points of the star is not defined.

With sexually reproducing species , individual organisms begin when the fluids ( or semen ) from the mother and the father come together. This combines the essential causes and initiates the developmental process. Gradually , over time , form begins to emerge from the unformed. The maternal contribution is the material cause , which resides in the menstrual blood. After the discharge is over and most of it has passed off , then what remains begins to take shape as a fetus [ Aristotle 1979 ] . Yet the female semen or menstrual blood is only that out of which it generates and must be acted upon by the male semen which is that which generates. Together , consistent with the essential nature of the species and telos ( or final cause ) in question , the formal cause and efficient causal process act to bring a formed individual organism from potential into actual being. The male and female parents serve as the principles of generation , and each individual organism begins anew . </shape.n.3062><shape.n.3063>Choose the Direct Selection tool in the Tools panel , and select the square in the Document window.

Objective evidence was obtained for a quantitative difference between resolution acuity and detection acuity in the peripheral field. These two types of spatial acuity differed by up to an order of magnitude ( 3 vs. 30 cyc/deg at 30 eccentricity ) and they varied with stimulus contrast in distinctly different ways. Contrast sensitivity at the resolution limit was an order of magnitude above the absolute threshold of unity and the shape of the contrast sensitivity function was significantly different from that measured for foveal vision. The results suggest that current models of eccentricity scaling of contrast sensitivity be re-evaluated to take account of the extensive aliasing zone of spatial frequencies which becomes functional in peripheral vision when the retinal image is well focused . </shape.n.3066><shape.n.3067>For this example I created an abstract shape using Photoshop ( included in the project files ) .

It was found that the medial arch length changed at different phases of gait. The degree of change in the length of the arch ranged from 3.7 to 9.5 mm. A similar method was used by Umeki [ 11 ] , who investigated the factors that influenced the length of the medial arch of the foot in normal adults under various passive motions and loads on the foot. It was found that the medial arch was lengthened and the foot was abducted when a vertical load was added to it. Shortening was observed when the first metatarsophalangeal joint was manually dorsi-flexed. The results indicated that the medial arch length would change with weight bearing and foot positioning. The use of skin-mounted measurement techniques may limit the accuracy of measuring the kinematics estimates of motion [ 1 , 12 , 13 ] .

Throughout these next few lessons it will sometimes be necessary to look to models or approximations to help us understand the characteristics of the universe we live in because many high school students have difficulty comprehending a space with more than three dimensions. We have been able to successfully measure the circumference and therefore the radius of the Earth. This demonstrates both how big , in comparison with our everyday lives and how small in comparison with the universe that the Earth really is. If we think more generally , the radius of the Earth also tells us something about its geometry. The Earth 's radius is a length that best describes the rate of curvature of the surface of the Earth. For this reason , we can call it a radius of curvature. The radius is the important factor in the circumference , surface area and volume of the Earth. It is important to understand the role of the radius in an easily understandable situation since this concept will reappear when we study the curvature of the universe . </shape.n.3097><shape.n.3098>Emerald-cut Diamond : Also known as a step cut , for its broad , flat facets , this elegant shape is rectangular , with beveled corners.

We expressed the magnitude of this distortion as a one-dimensional deviation score and interpreted abnormal scores as resulting from displacement of retinal photoreceptors caused by epiretinal membrane contraction. The perceived distortion can not be ascribed to simple retinal or cortical remodeling. Data from healthy subjects appeared to describe a physiological level of tolerance for changes in oculocentric direction that may also apply to changes induced by tangential retinal traction. Our epiretinal membrane study population included both visuospatial deviation scores outside the normal range and scores that were within the normal range. Binocular correspondence perimetry may be useful for stratification of candidates for surgical removal of epiretinal membranes , when attempting to identify markers of outcome , and for extending the rationale for the clinical management of retinal disease with metamorphopsia . </shape.n.3130><shape.n.3131>The windmills represent a technology that was developed through trial and error , before the days when physics became well enough understood to permit paper designs.

Macromolecules can assume many different conformational shapes via the interaction of their atoms or functional groups with the local environment. Changes in temperature , pH , ionic strength , etc , all permit the alternating of a molecules conformation between a variety molecular shapes.

Vector content refers to content that is represented by description , rather than by listing a value for each pixel in the content. Any geometric shape can be represented as vector content , and any arbitrary shape may be represented by a combination of such , and hence as vector content. It should be appreciated that vector devices , such as printers , can also receive raster content like images as input. Vector content is preferred , however , because it is generally more compact thereby speeding up communication with the vector device. Vector content also typically provides better quality because vector devices have optimized algorithms for converting the vector content for final output.

Amultivariate statistical analysis ( viz. , principal component analysis [ PCA ] ) shows that about 96 of the total variation is due to twocomponents , one being the combination of absolute blue magnitude andmaximum rotational velocity beyond the optical region and the otherbeing the central density of the halo. On the basis of PCA a fundamentalplane has been constructed that reduces the scatter in the Tully-Fisherrelation up to a maximum of 16 . A multiple stepwise regression analysisof the variation of the overall shape of the rotation curves shows thatit is mainly determined by the central surface brightness , while theshape purely in the outer part of the galaxy ( beyond the optical radius ) is mainly determined by the size of the galactic disk . </shape.n.3185><shape.n.3186>Let us now turn to the notion of object status of mental " objects " specifically. I put quotes around the word " object " because even elementary considerations show that mental images do not fit our concept of ordinary physical objects in the external world. Mental images do not literally have size , shape , or color. There is , as Dennett has argued , undoubtedly a tendency to use object language in a way that results in speaking of mental images as if they could be literally seen by an inner eye. The results in the homunculus problem. Descriptivists attempted to remove the homunculus by showing how linguistic elements and concepts could fulfill the role attributed to images. The descriptivist correctives , I argued , went too far , resulting in loss of a correct description of the phenomenon to be examined . </shape.n.3186><shape.n.3187>ABSTRACT : The study examined the effect of unstable weight history ( WH ) on current body image perceptions among 15 female undergraduates with stable WHs , 15 whose lowest weights were 15 or more below their current weight , and 15 whose highest weights were 15 or more above current weight.

It is particularly valuable when biomass is low and cell numbers are limited , as in experiments for quantifying viability ( 16 ) and evaluating the nutritional requirements of new species isolated by extinction culture techniques ( 54 ) . In combination with DNA analyses , biomass measurements for resolved subpopulations offer improved evaluation of bacterial growth according to cell cycle theory ( 18 , 59 ) .

While both algorithms were in use during the past run period , rtEFIT shots became the more frequent choice. Control with rtEFIT allowed access to plasma elongation ( kappa ) to a record level above 3 , improved stability , produced longer pulse lengths and more consistent edge control , and permitted experiments to make shape comparisons with other machines. To support experiments , the PCS was upgraded to control the Resistive Wall Mode ( RWM ) coils using active feedback control on resistive wall mode sensors , error field sensors , and ohmic and toroidal field coil currents alone or in combination with preprogrammed current control. Use of the RWM coils to correct error fields was successful in delaying the onset of discharge-ending MHD by about 700 ms in the best cases. Planned improvements for the 2007 run include upgrading to a faster computer that will reduce the latency in the control system and provide faster control of vertical instability and RWM instabilities.

Because the Shape interface is used throughout Java 2D , these fundamental operations on shapes are quite powerful.

Both men and women emitted reproductive essences during orgasm , and if the male essence dominated , a boy would form , whereas if the female prevailed , a girl would form. A second set of theories attributed sex determination to the day that conception took place relative to the end of the woman ' s menstrual cycle , with boys forming on days when yang influences dominated and girls forming on days when yin influences were strongest. Finally , a third model said that sex was determined by the side of the mother ' s body where the commingled reproductive vitalities lodged. The Shengji jing ( 12th century ) spoke in general terms of qi circulating on the mother ' s left side and forming boys , or on the right side and forming girls.

The same qualitative angle values are used for curves as for vertices , with the exception that a straight angled simple curve is not described as a curve , but as a straight edge. This allows the description of concave or convex curves , as well as of varying amounts of curvature. Spread is expressed in terms of the ratio between the length of the chord axis and the maximum deviation of the arc from that axis. This deviation is the bulge of the curve. A simple set of qualitative values uses circle shapes as distinguished points in the quantity space , because the circle is a curve with many useful geometric properties. A semicircle-like curve has a bulge that is half its chord axis , and a circle-like curve has a bulge that is equal to its chord axis. Three qualitative ranges are separated by these two distinguished points , so that there are five possible qualitative values for curve spread . </shape.n.3384><shape.n.3385>E very page may be in one of two shapes.

Shapes are considered to consist of several simpler , intersecting shapes. Our method is based on the junction rule : the observation that two intersecting shapes generate an additional junction in their joined curve-skeleton near the place of intersection. For each curve-skeleton point , we construct a piecewise-geodesic loop on the shape surface. Starting from the junctions , we search along the curve skeleton for points whose associated loops make for suitable part cuts. The segmentations are robust to noise and discretization artifacts , because the curve skeletonization incorporates a single user-parameter to filter spurious curve-skeleton branches. Furthermore , segment borders are smooth and minimally twisting by construction. We demonstrate our method on several real-world examples and compare it to existing part-type segmentation methods . </shape.n.3412><shape.n.3413>... the camera begins to function , the irrevocably ultimate aesthetic form.

We have developed a method utilizing a Projected , Comb-Fringe technique combined with the Landmarks procedure ( PCFL ) , in which a comb-fringe pattern with high intensity and sharpness was projected onto the transparent wing of a dragonfly in free flight. Images of the wings with distorted fringes were then recorded by a high-speed camera. Based on the distorted fringe pattern and the natural landmarks on the dragonfly wings , we reconstructed wing shape and established the body-centered coordinate system. This method allowed us to derive kinematic parameters without assumptions of rigid chords or kinematic symmetry , except for the assumption of rigid leading edges. The instantaneous attitude of the body was also measured simultaneously. We measured dragonflies in two flight behaviors : forward flight and turning maneuvers , and compared the kinematics results obtained for each of them . </shape.n.3497><shape.n.3498>Duncan J.S. , Lee F.A. , Smeulders A.W.M. , and Zaret B.L.

Along the length of the cylinder the curvature is zero and in other directions there is positive curvature so the product of the maximum and minimum curvatures is zero making the Gaussian curvature zero. To see this another way , unwrap the label and you can flatten it out , draw a small circle of radius $ r $ anywhere on the label and it has a circumference of $ 2\pi r $ and an area of $ \pi r^2. $ Wrap the label around the can again and the circumference and area of the circle you have drawn do not change as the paper takes the shape of the surface of the cylinder.

An elongated shape for the FliN tetramer is also supported by the large shape factor ( 1.4 ) determined in the velocity-sedimentation experiment. Although the residues at the dimer-dimer interface have dimer-related counterparts that are exposed at the ends of the tetramer , we did not see evidence of any FliN complexes larger than a tetramer.

This makes periodic orbits possible. They are called Halo orbits. A Halo orbit , however , needs a minimum amplitude of about 600'000 km. The consequence is that the orbit has a declination from the Sun as big as 25 . This requires a boresight tracking antenna for satellites on Halo orbits. The Halo orbits form two classes symmetrical to the ecliptic as shown in figure 4.15. The orbits of one class have the apogee above the ecliptic , the orbits of the other below it. The amplitudes of Halo orbits are 200'000 km in the Sun-Earth direction , 600'000 km in the ecliptic plane normal to Sun-Earth direction and 120'000 km normal to the ecliptic plane. The shape of the Halo orbit is shown in figure 4.15. The orbital period is about 6 months and the elongation from the solar direction goes from 4.5 to 25.5 .

Similarly , no significant differences between the intravenous saline and intravenous cocaine conditions were found. This result is particularly interesting since it is known that cocaine causes vasoconstriction. The results of the in-depth analysis reveal that despite the existing literature suggesting drug-related alterations in the properties of blood vessels , the hemodynamic shape is not significantly changed. Thus , the results of analytic techniques that depend on hemodynamic shape may not be distorted when investigating groups of subjects who abuse drugs. The fact that no differences were found with the z-score analysis suggests that the standardized hemodynamic shape that it uses is sufficiently sensitive to yield reliable results even when cocaine has been administered. Combined , these results imply either that these drugs of abuse have no impact on the vascular processes that underlie the BOLD signal or that they affect the tonic baseline but not the dynamic task-induced , event-related BOLD changes ( 4 ) . </shape.n.3549><shape.n.3550>V.F.

Similarly , a functionalist perceptual theory would explain perceptual content in terms of the mediating functional role played by perceptual states. For example , on such a view , one 's having inferred , on the basis of sensory inputs , that the shape of the disk one is seeing is a circular shape is integrally connected with other cognitive states and outputs , such as one 's activity of consciously modelling the object for oneself as being round , internally classifying the object with other round objects , thinking to oneself , or saying out loud It 's round ' , attempting to pick it up as if it were a round object , and so on. Thus the view has some affinities with recent sensorimotor accounts of perception , as briefly mentioned above , in that one 's perceptual content may reveal itself via actual interaction with some relevant object , but it is a much more general-purpose view , in that potentially it can explain any kinds of representational perceptual content in functionalist terms . </shape.n.3562><shape.n.3563>[ 155 ] B. van Ginneken , M. de Bruijne , M.

A scapegoat thus has to be found to bear the onus of unacknowledged desire. To Robert Welch , that scapegoat was international communism; for the contemporary left , it ' s George W.

The ratio b/a is a size independent shape descriptor that ranges from 1 for regular hexagons to 2 for triangles.

This is most apparent in the biological sciences , where the factors that lead to morphological variation include genetic factors , pre-natal environment ( e.g. , fetal alcohol syndrome ) , etc. The study of biological shape variation in its metrical aspects is called morphometrics.

Most of these shape metrics are based on perimeter-area relationships. Perhaps the simplest shape index is a straightforward perimeter-area ratio ( PARA ) . A problem with this metric as a shape index is that it varies with the size of the patch. For example , holding shape constant , an increase in patch size will cause a decrease in the perimeter-area ratio. Patton ( 1975 ) proposed a diversity index based on shape for quantifying habitat edge for wildlife species and as a means for comparing alternative habitat improvement efforts ( e.g. , wildlife clearings ) . This shape index ( SHAPE ) measures the complexity of patch shape compared to a standard shape ( square or almost square ) of the same size , and therefore alleviates the size dependency problem of PARA. This shape index is widely applicable in landscape ecological research ( Forman and Godron 1986 ) . </shape.n.3681><shape.n.3682>Think you know the best way to get in shape ?

Because these latter attributes are usually affected by subdivision , it is difficult to isolate subdivision as an independent component. Subdivision can be evaluated using a variety of metrics already discussed; for example , the number , density , and average size of patches and the degree of contagion all indirectly evaluate subdivision. However , a suite of metrics derived from the cumulative distribution of patch sizes provide alternative and more explicit measures of subdivision ( Jaeger 2000 ) . When applied at the class level , these metrics can be used to measure the degree of fragmentation of the focal patch type. Applied at the landscape level , these metrics connote the graininess of the landscape; i.e. , the tendency of the landscape to exhibit a fine- versus coarse-grain texture. A fine-grain landscape is characterized by many small patches ( highly subdivided ); whereas , a coarse-grain landscape is characterized by fewer large patches . </shape.n.3684><shape.n.3685>45.

However , such machining features do not generally take into account a micro-level geometric characteristics of contacting shape between the required shape and the cutting tool , and the macro-level geometrical characteristics of removal volume. Therefore these machining features do not correspond directly to machining operations. The objective of this paper is to capture the fundamental characteristics of machining process and make suitable machining process models based on them. First , a model of the machining process based on the form shaping system theory proposed by Reshetov is constructed. Second , the characteristics of machined surface are the number of parameters in the family of the instantaneous positions of the cutting points , the machined surface , and the contact shape between the locus of the cutting edge in a cutting motion ( named macro cutting tool ) and the machined surface , are proposed. The characteristics of machining process are the number of macro cutting tool parameters , the number of feed directions in machining operation , and the number of enveloping constraints are also proposed. Finally , the abstract model of machining operation and the abstract model of operation planning which can represent , the linear equations are proposed . </shape.n.3687><shape.n.3688>Then at the other end of the spectrum , we have new dads , who often find that the demands of fatherhood derail their longstanding exercise regimen.

New research published in Medical News Today , is shedding light on our selection of the ideal shape. It may be that what men are looking at as a sexual ideal , changes with the economic and social times. The new research finds that the resourceful , on the go woman generally has a more androgenous body shape with slimmer hips and larger waist than the pear shaped or hour glass shaped woman. This research goes on to show that much of the sexual selection based on body shape is cultural and where women are more valued for their resourcefulness than reproduction the preference leans toward stronger , more androgenous shapes. It also suggested that in cultures where male/female relationships are more equal , less emphasis is placed on the hour glass figure . </shape.n.3701><shape.n.3702>Although the shape of plants is their most important ornamental feature , it is usually the one least taken into account in choosing them for the garden.

These assumptions may not hold for the developing heart , which can hardly be assumed to be a prolate ellipsoid from its earliest developmental stages. M mode is highly dependent on the incident plane and is inaccurate for volume estimation , with poor repeatability and high interobserver variability.21 The 2D-based calculations seemed to overestimate RV volumes by as much as 30 to 35 in an adult study comparing RV volumes.22 As many as 40 of normal fetuses can have artifactually increased cardiac dimensions on random 2D measurements compared with phase-specific M-mode dimensions.23 Thus , both M-mode and 2D modalities seem prone to overestimation of dimensions , volumes , and therefore mass.

It can be represented by a rational B-spline curve that the multiplicity of each interior knot equals degree. When using these curves to generate a ruled surface or skinned surface , it is necessary to merge the knot vector of all curves to form the knot vector of the generated surface. When merging the knot vectors of the curves , however , two problems tend to arise. The first is that the merged knot vector may be very large. This gives rise to a large number of control points , resulting in bad performance in other applications. The second is that there may be knots with close , but distinctly different values. Then , extremely narrow surface patches will be generated , resulting in numerical difficulties in other applications. To avoid these problems , in this paper , among two curves , the second one is reparameterized to have the same knot vector as that of the first one.

In this presentation , I will discuss a series of studies exploring a new visual fading effects in which entire photographs of scenes fade to a uniform luminance and hue during normal visual fixation. In these studies , fading can be induced almost instantaneously and does not require a prolonged adaptation period. These effects are sufficiently robust that they can be experienced by most observers in a single trial. The potential implications of these results for our visual awareness of natural scenes and other complex stimuli will be discussed.

Most of the energy derived from fat gets to the muscle through the bloodstream and reduces stored fat in the entire body , from the last place where fat was deposited. Sit-ups may improve the size and shape of abdominal muscles but will not specifically target belly fat for loss. Such exercise might help reduce overall body fat and shrink the size of fat cells.

With the increasing popularity of the use of large volume image databases in various applications , it becomes imperative to build an automatic and efficient retrieval system to browse through the entire database. Techniques using textual attributes for annotations are limited in their applications. Our approach relies on image features that exploit visual cues such as color and shape. Unlike previous approaches which concentrate on extracting a single concise feature , our technique combines features that represent both the color and shape in images. Experimental results on a database of 400 trademark images show that an integrated color- and shape-based feature representation results in 99 of the images being retrieved within the top two positions. Additional results demonstrate that a combination of clustering and a branch and bound-based matching scheme aids in i ...

Imari colours , cobalt-blue and rust-red with green and gilded overglaze on a white ground. Deep saucer with all-over pattern. Cup has a ring-handle gilded on outer surface. Pattern extends around the cup and the saucer border pattern is repeated on interior of the cup. It would appear that some overglaze blue transfer-printing was used to outline pattern as a guide to hand-painting. It is possible this pattern was used before 1812 , although the shapes are typical of the period. The John Rose &amp;Co. pattern book shows this pattern as No. 597. There are minor differences between 532 and 597. 1 ) The roof line slants in 532 and is a rectangle in 597. 2 ) The border pattern in 532 is more elaborate and appears to have better quality painting. 3 ) The scroll motif in the centre design is more condensed in 532.

Two properties of Gothic architecture most relevant to the character of the pointed arch are " changefulness " and " variety " in the Ruskinian sense. Having more than one centre , the pointed arch is constructed with more possibilities to vary than a standard arch; for the span of the arch is governed by the distance between the two ( or more ) centres in addition to the radius governing the span of a circular arch. The combination of radius and distance is exclusively a character of the pointed arch , and from that combination emerge other possibilities for variety in laying out the course-work of brick or stone to construct the arch . </shape.n.3800><shape.n.3801>Colloquial shape definition Shape can also be more loosely defined as " the appearance of something , especially its outline " .

Aspheric profiles of ablation result in varying central depths of ablation. Oblateness of the initial corneal surface , intentional increase in negative asphericity , and enlargement of the optical zone diameter result in deeper central ablations. This may be of clinical importance in planning aspheric profiles of ablation in LASIK procedures to correct spherical aberration without compromising the mechanical integrity of the cornea. Increasing negative asphericity without increasing the risk of ectasia for high magnitudes of treatment may be achieved by reducing the treatment diameter. The reduction of the optical zone diameter , however , may induce undesirable optical edge effects and may counterbalance the positive effect of restoring the prolate shape of the central cornea . </shape.n.3811><shape.n.3812>Save the features to a file by clicking on " Features " - &gt; " Save All Features As " .

Indeed , our finding of relative stability of the object selectivity topography in IT in spite of changes in object position shows that this topography is primarily driven by differences in shape ( i.e. , a shape map ) and not by differences in absolute retinotopic envelope. Nevertheless , our results do not rule out the possibility that monkey IT cortex also contains some kind of retinotopic map , as suggested for parts of human object-selective cortex ( Hasson et al. 2002; Brewer et al. 2005; Larsson and Heeger 2006 ) .

You can teach yourself to think in spiritual-rational correspondences rather than merely natural-rational , which follow a materialistic time-space bent structure. A spiritual idea of the shape of what is human , is to remember the scientific revelation that the human proper begins with the spiritual-rational ( see Section xx ) . In other words , the natural mind in itself is not human. It is in the shape of a sub-human animal. You can not see this physically. When we still are in the unregenerate materialistic phase of life , denying or doubting the existence of the spiritual , we still look human.

The curve meshes we consider consist of Bezier curves , rational Bezier curves or composite curves depending on the shape we design. To interpolate these curve meshes smoothly , we use Gregory patches , rational boundary Gregory patches , general boundary Gregory patches and G2 Gregory patches as surface representations. One of the advantages of these surface representations is that cross boundary derivatives can be independently defined for each boundary. This enables us to create smooth surface shapes even on irregular curve meshes. In addition to smooth surface interpolation , these Gregory patches enable intuitive modification of their shapes with new control point layouts based on the cross boundary derivatives. Designers can easily modify surface shapes without losing G1/G2 continuity between adjacent patches by moving control points . </shape.n.3831><shape.n.3832>It 's a fact of life that people and body parts come in all shapes and sizes.

Based on this criticism and a discussion of alternative approaches , a contrary theory of perception is presented. This approach of 'perception through anticipation ' tries to avoid the problems of the information processing metaphor by replacing sensory with sensorimotor representations and by considering perception as an active and generative process rather than as a pure projection. Perception of space and shape is assumed to be a process anticipating the sensory consequences of actions; appropriate actions are selected within the same process. This approach could provide a new solution to invariance and constancy problems. Starting from an abstract description of perception and action selection , two different models for this approach are presented : the first at a microscopic level modeling the architectonics of the cerebral cortex , and the latter at a macroscopic one , where the basic building blocks are associative memories . </shape.n.3834><shape.n.3835>So what happened when Yatra went from triangles and squares to the abstract notion of polygons ? Here 's my hypothesis. Yatra 's mind is like the mind of any human being in that when it is given concrete ( visual ) examples of some abstract class of things , it detects what features they all have in common and what features they don't. In the case of triangles , squares , pentagons , and octagons , what they have in common is that they all have straight sides and span some area. What they do n't have in common is the specific number of sides. The mind then disregards the features they do n't share in common. What remains becomes the concept. For Yatra , since straight lines and an area are what each shape has in common , this becomes the conception of a polygon. The exact number of sides does not go into the concept. Notice what this does to the visualization of the concept - it renders it unvisualizable. That is , if Yatra wants to visualize this conception of polygons , she must re-attach a specific number of sides to it. This is why conceptualization often dissociates itself from visualization . </shape.n.3835><shape.n.3836>[ 0088 ] To identify the article with coded platelets on or in it or a substance with the coded platelets in it a sample of the platelets must be examined. A means of looking at the platelets can be with a visual aid such as a microscope for a human to evaluate the platelets and determine the code used , or a machine aided observation and detection method can be used. For example if an ink containing the coded platelets is printed on the surface of an object a magnifying device connected to a scanner or charge coupled device can make bit maps or pixelized pictures of the platelets , a pattern recognition program in a computer can then detect the sizes shapes and spatial codes of the patterned platelets. Spectrum analyzers and polarization detectors can identify the polarizations and colors of the patterned platelets and determine the count of each type of platelet to match it to a code. A picture of the bit map or pixelized picture can be viewed by a human on a screen; or by printing the image.

This may explain results such as those of Finke , Pinker , and Farah ( 1989 ) , whose subjects had relatively little difficulty in reinterpreting the emergent shapes produced when they were asked to imagine letters and mentally rotate and juxtapose them in various ways ( e.g. a B rotated 90 anticlockwise and placed on top of a V , can be reconstrued as a heart ) .

In addition , the establishment of a united command with a supreme commander and Council of Deputies was also agreed upon. The most important NATO institutions for the next few years were the five regional planning groups ( including the Western European Regional Planning Group consisting of the five BTO nations ); the Military Committee , consisting of the chiefs of staff of the member states with a standing group based in the Pentagon; and a general three-nation standing group of NATO 's most crucial members , the United States , Britain , and France.

An explicit method of calculation is given which is analogous to that of Jupp and Kent ( 1987 , Applied Statistics ) for spherical data. The resulting splines are called shape space smoothing splines. The method resembles that of fitting smoothing splines in Euclidean spaces in that : if the smoothing parameter is zero the resulting curve interpolates the data points , and if it is infinitely large the curve is the geodesic line. The fitted path to the data is defined such that its unrolled version at the tangent space of the starting point is a cubic spline fitted to the unwrapped data with respect to that path. Computation of the fitted path consists of an iterative procedure which converges quickly , and the resulting path is given in a discretized form in terms of a piecewise geodesic path. The procedure is applied to the analysis of some human movement data . </shape.n.3867><shape.n.3868>The virgin mother continued the pre-monogamous type of the female who became the prostitute of later sociology and language.

We have derived semi-differential invariants for quadratic curves and three special classes of cubic curves. Such an invariant , independent of translation and rotation , is computed from the local geometry at one or more points on the curve. Recognition of a curve class becomes verifying the corresponding invariant with extra data points. The actual curve can be determined in its canonical parametric form using the same tactile data. Finally , the contact locations on the curve are computed , thereby localizing the shape completely relative to the touching hand . </shape.n.3871><shape.n.3872>If our project is successful , it will pave the way for the development of improved shape matching techniques of potential use in a wide range of application areas , including intellectual property management , design archive management and multimedia asset management ( see section 5 , especially 5.2 ) .

Differences observed in a comparison of a single specimen of each disappeared when the comparison was extended to other specimens. However the basisphenoid in lineolata is generally a narrow bone only slightly expanded at its lower portion , where it is firmly anchylosed to the parasphenoid. In S. velox the basisphenoid is greatly expanded at its lower extremity and it is apparently only loosely attached to the parasphenoid. In the three available specimens the basisphenoid became detached in the cleaning of the cranium , despite the fact that after the condition had been noted in the first , exceptional care was taken with the second and third specimens. Although in occasional specimens ( one out of six ) of S. lineolata the shape of the basisphenoid approaches that of S. velox , the usual difference in shape , plus the fact that this bone is never separable ( six specimens ) in cleaned crania of lineolata , whereas it invariably becomes detached in S. velox , amounts to a positive diagnostic character . </shape.n.3873><shape.n.3874>It has only been in recent years that there has even been a need for women ( or men ) to make a focused , separate-from-real-life effort to keep their bodies in good shape.

The inner sense theory supplies this , for in this theory perceptual states can literally be perceived. And if they are perceived then ipso facto they must have appearances. Moreover those appearances are in an important sense the direct result of the inner sense , in the same way that colour appearances ( as distinct from colours ) are the result of colour perception. The inner sense itself would not , if this approach is right , have its own phenomenal quality because it does not have an appearance. It does not have an appearance because its states are never themselves perceived.7 So for any sensation there is only one phenomenal quality associated with it.

Most of the energy derived from fat gets to the muscle through the bloodstream and reduces stored fat in the entire body , from the last place where fat was deposited.

The designer inputs a sequence of control points , and the computer fits a smooth curve that goes through these points. The literature of interpolating splines is rich , much of it based on the mathematical idealization of a thin elastic strip constrained to pass through the points. Until now there is little consensus on which , if any , of these splines is ideal. This thesis explores the properties of an ideal interpolating spline. The most important property is fairness , a property often in tension with locality , meaning that perturbations to the input points do not affect sections of the curve at a distance. The idealized elastic strip has two serious problems. A sequence of co-circular input points results in a curve deviating from a circular arc.

The trabecular framework of the bone undergoes erosion and absorption -- rarefying ostitis -- and either disappears altogether or only irregular fragments or sequestra of microscopic dimensions remain in the area affected. Less frequently the trabecular framework is added to by the formation of new bone , resulting in a remarkable degree of sclerosis , and if , following upon this , there is caseation of the tubercle and death of the affected portion of bone , there results a sequestrum often of considerable size and characteristic shape , which , because of the sclerosis and surrounding endarteritis , is exceedingly slow in separating. When the sequestrum involves an articular surface it is often wedge-shaped; in other situations it is rounded or truncated and lies in the long axis of the medullary canal ( Fig. 125 ) . Finally , the sequestrum lies loose in a cavity lined by tuberculous granulation tissue , and is readily identified in a radiogram. This type of sclerosis preceding death of the bone is highly characteristic of tuberculosis . </shape.n.3925><shape.n.3926>Appendicular bones include the one hundred twenty-six bones which comprise the appendages , including the shoulders and hips , arms and legs , hands and feet , and fingers and toes.

Circle 38 is drawn with a close and consistent separation from the original circle 36 so that one circle is inscribed inside the other. Some form of consistent separation is then maintained as the dynamic image is expanded or shrunk ( it may be a dimensionally constant difference in the radius of the two circles , a constant proportion of the radius of either circle , or may vary as the circles expand or contract due to some other beneficial formula ) . By providing a companion circle 38 , it is possible to make distortions in the circle 36 more easily detectable and result in a more precise test.

On these accounts the rich three dimensional structure of visual representations is constructed top down in the visual system. Underdetermined visual arrays are segmented relative to viewer 's tacit and explicit knowledge of the shapes and functions of objects. Tye argues , like Kosslyn , that mental imagery exploits these same processes , but replaces retinal input with top down conceptual input. Mental images of scenes and objects are generated from information stored in long term memory concerning their general form , function , and appearance. Tye contends that , as a result , the visual component of imagery , the initial array , is not by itself an image. Rather it is an abstract representation of the visible properties of surfaces and locations seen from a particular viewpoint . Only by being interpreted relative to particular conceptual information is this initial visual array segmented into forms and objects. Therefore Tye 's model attributes to images both propositional and depictive content . </shape.n.3935><shape.n.3936>This same melting phenomena happens with any conscious creation done in the astral dimension.

Physical dimensions are a scarce commodity in our universe , however , and Bertin identifies only eight variables that can be utilised in a printed graphic image. Apart from the X and Y dimensions , there are two more ordered variables : the density of ink used to make marks , and the size of the marks. There are also four categorical dimensions : texture , colour , orientation and shape of marks. Source code is just one way of making this assignment in a software visualisation. In source code , groups of shapes ( ASCII characters ) are given specific meanings and organised according to standard conventions - typically sequence of execution along the Y dimension , and control nesting in the X dimension. Some program editors also assign colour or density values to differentiate between information that is relevant to the compiler or relevant to the programmer . </shape.n.3951><shape.n.3952>Below , we have a stomach.

Here , to better understand swimming in a dilute aqueous buffer or in a buffer containing methylcellulose , we recorded the motion of fluorescently labeled cells at 500 Hz. Methylcellulose was used because it was included in early tracking experiments ( 8 ) as a viscous agent to suppress Brownian motion and make cells easier to follow; however , it did not alter the run-tumble statistics ( our unpublished data ) . Using frame-by-frame analysis , we measured the swimming speed , the rate of rotation of the cell body , and the rate of rotation of the flagellar bundle. We also measured the rate of rotation of single filaments on cells stuck to glass and in buffer. We compared the shapes of normal filaments when they were spinning to their shapes when they were stalled.

A good analogy is the elements of art are like words in a sentence.

The stimulus was composed of an array of oriented Gabor patches positioned on a polar grid. Thresholds were obtained for different array parameters ( e.g. different area , density , number and positions of elements ) as well as for different element parameters ( e.g. different carrier spatial frequencies , contrasts , polarities and orientations ) . Global structure was detected when ~10 of the elements were coherently oriented. Neither the properties of the array ( density , area , number or position of elements ) , nor those of the individual elements ( carrier spatial frequency , contrast , polarity ) altered coherence thresholds. Varying contrast or carrier spatial frequency within individual arrays also did not alter performance. Sensitivity was invariant to positional perturbations of the array grid. Only jittering the local orientation of elements decreased sensitivity. The underlying mechanisms are broadly tuned for contrast , spatial frequency and the spatial positioning of image samples. Detecting circular structure is a robust process and , in this case , a purely global one. Sensitivity was highest for circular as opposed to radial or spiral shapes . </shape.n.3973><shape.n.3974>DEFINITION : A large Greek or Roman earthenware storage jar , with a narrow neck and mouth and two handles ( two-eared "; each called an anem ) at the top.

If this arc is drawn so that it meets the shank at zero angle ( that is , the distance of the centre of the arc from the axis , plus the radius of the shank , equals the radius of the arc ) , then it is called a tangential or spitzer ogive. This is a very common ogive for high velocity ( supersonic ) rifle bullets.

For example , both humans and non-humans sometimes use an environment 's shape to guide navigation ( Gallistel , 1990; Gouteux &amp;Spelke , 2001; Hermer &amp;Spelke , 1994 ) .

This is a possible outcome until the contrary is established. Also note , as elaborated in this document , that explanations from biology and from physics are fully compatible in a number of ways; importantly , explanations from biology and physics should be complementary with biology providing both general framework and details and physics providing some fundamental ontological elements. It is possible that , as a result of future developments , physics will entail phenomenal consciousness as a fact - while biology will provide the main characteristics , functions and details.

Across decades of research within different disciplines , including neuropsychology , animal lesion studies , neuroanatomy , neurophysiology , and computational modeling , a consensus has emerged suggesting that shape and other aspects of object processing are largely segregated in the brain from spatial processing. This conceptual framework , which we challenge here , has limited investigators ' experimental approaches. There has been no straightforward neurophysiological investigation of shape selectivity in FEF , probably as a consequence of its known dense connections with dorsal stream areas.

The exact details of the nature of the mechanisms involved are still being investigated , but release of trapped particles from the Van Allen belt apparently plays an important part. The aurora is most intense at times of magnetic storms ( when it is also observed farthest equatorward ) , and shows a periodicity related to the Sun 's 27-day rotation period and the 11-year sunspot cycle. The distribution with height shows a pronounced maximum near 100 km. The lower limit is probably near 80 km.

This might , in turn , have been a consequence of gravity causing a change in the shape of the chest wall. Another line of reasoning also supports our observation of a lower Crs in the lateral position. From studies in adults , it is known that Crs in the middle volume range is higher in the supine than in the upright position ( 23 ) . The exact mechanism has not been clarified. However , since FRC has been found to be higher in both the lateral and upright positions than in the supine ( 24 , 31 , 32 ) , whereas total lung capacity is similar in all these positions ( 23 ) , this will imply a reduced IC in the lateral and upright positions. Indeed , in the present study , inspiratory capacity was 20 less in the lateral position than in the supine. Because IC can be regarded as a measure of complianceit represents the volume change between 30 and 0 cm H2Oit is reasonable that Crs should also be reduced . </shape.n.4080><shape.n.4081>Hence , exercise and fitness are two vital elements for a healthy mind and body.

" The female body is a beautiful ideal that should never have been criticized by society. Reubens and the other masters realized that the feminine form was more attractive when it contained its natural curves , and so chose models that reflected this. Another aspect of society that ruins the self-concept of women is the governmental military institutions. They have charts that say , for instance , that a 5'10 " woman , no matter her build , should weigh 145-160 lb. ( Air Force ) . The Army 's weight standards are less than that. Thus , young women intent on joining some branch of the military spend time that could be engaged in self-education in the field they intend to pursue losing obscene amounts of weight and disproportioning themselves.

As Smith and Sera ( 1992 ) point out , many developmental theories begin with the adult behavior as the expected end-state and then develop a theory that leads inexorably from some ( often chaotic ) beginning state to a more ordered approximation of adult competence. Adult behavior is often described in terms of a system of rules and children are then monitored until they seem to be sensitive to the proper set of adult rules. For example , in Piagetian studies of the balance beam , children are given long blocks of various shapes and encouraged to try to balance them on a fulcrum. They are monitored for the development of the correct rule that the downward force of a weight is a function of the weight and the distance of the weight from the fulcrum. In this task , children 's behavior is often described as the development of intermediate ( and incorrect rules ) like " the fulcrum must always be in the center.

Knowing the angles of incidences , trigonometric tables can be used to determine the spatial points of reflections 94-100 and thus the surface shape . </shape.n.4118><shape.n.4119>So , in a nutshell - this is n't in any way shape or form an issue of global warming denial but is a very specific criticism and I raised it here because I 'm bothered by the wide-eyed acceptance of any research by many commenters simply because it feeds into their ideology. Equally depressing is the kneejerk reaction that equates methodological criticism with global warming denial.

A single shape ( of 3 possible shapes , at 1 of 3 possible peripheral locations ) was presented during a sample period. Following a variable memory delay period during which the animal maintained central fixation , a set of three test shapes at three locations was displayed. The animal was required to make a saccade to the test stimulus that matched the sample stimulus. We recorded from 181 FEF neurons in two rhesus monkeys during the DMTS task. Consistent with findings in the PF task , we found units that were selective for the shape of the stimulus during the sample period. The example cell shown in Fig. 5A responded maximally to an upside-down Y and minimally to a diamond , with a shape-SI of 0.31. Among the 181 neurons recorded during the DMTS task , 12 ( 21 of 181 ) showed a significant shape effect with an average shape-SI of 0.20 ( Fig. 5B ) . </shape.n.4120><shape.n.4121>Eat organic food !

The distribution of defence expenditure among EU-25 is polarized between four big defence budgets , which count for 136 , 2 bn.

Posteriorly , the appearance suggests that the air bladder terminates in a hollow connective tissue cord which extends to the extreme posterior end of the body cavity. It looks as though the connective tissue lining of the body cavity met from either side at the posterior margins of the air bladder and thickened gradually to fuse in the mid-line , and into the hollow cord so formed the chamber of the air bladder extends to an indeterminate distance.

Stimuli were presented passively to an immobilized finger , therefore the only source of information about the stimuli available to the subjects derived from cutaneous sources. An additional feature of the protocol we adopted , i.e. , randomly varying the position of successive stimuli on the fingerpad , ensured that estimations about stimulus magnitude were based on information about the comparative shape of the stimuli and not on any spurious positional cues. As stimulus curvature increased , the subjects ' perception of the magnitude of curvature also increased.

Without his theory , very little in biology makes sense. Evolution can explain why human embryos look like gilled fishes , why hummingbirds and gorillas both have backbones , why disease-causing bacteria have become immune to penicillin. To Darwinians , the key is natural selection. Random changes in the genes of an organism produce diversity within the species to which it belongs , something Darwin realized when he saw 13 different species of finches on the Galapagos Islands. Each had evolved a different beak shape , adapted to exploit a different flower , insect or other food. For any number of possible reasons adaptations to climate , sexual attractiveness or , like the finches , superiority in food gatheringsome members of a species are more likely to reproduce than others. Thus natural selection , once described as " survival of the fittest , " is now more acceptably stated as " differential reproduction " : different combinations of genes produce different degrees of reproductive success. Some creatures leave more offspring than others , passing on their genes to the next generations until new traits become dominant . </shape.n.4139><shape.n.4140>The elongated shape of Norway and its many mountains , large areas of sparse population , and severe climate make special demands on transportation services.

The lateral occipital complex ( LOC ) , a large region in human ventral visual cortex , plays a central role in the perception of object shape ( Malach et al. , 1995; Grill-Spector et al. , 1998b; Murray et al. , 2002; Grill-Spector and Malach , 2004 ) . The overall LOC response depends on the perception of a coherent object shape ( Grill-Spector et al. , 1998a; Kourtzi and Kanwisher , 2000 , 2001; Lerner et al. , 2002; Hayworth and Biederman , 2006 ) , and the shape representations in LOC are relatively invariant to image transformations such as size , position , and viewpoint ( Grill-Spector et al. , 1999; Vuilleumier et al. , 2002; Ewbank et al. , 2005 ) . Furthermore , LOC is activated irrespectively of whether objects are meaningful ( e.g. , cars , flowers , etc. ) or not ( Malach et al. , 1995; Kanwisher et al. , 1997b ) . </shape.n.4143><shape.n.4144>An Oval Face : Most any style is suitable as this is considered the ideal face shape.

For sufficiently large alpha , the alpha shape is identical to the convex hull of S. As alpha decreases , the shape shrinks and gradually develops cavities.

Contents must be , roughly , pictures of what they represent. ( 'Roughly ' , because we have other modalities of perception than the visual; we hear , taste , smell , and feel. So not all ideas are literally pictorial. ) Because thought is the mental manipulation of contents , Hume 's understanding of thinking in general , and deductive thinking in particular , is shaped and constrained by his pictorial theory of content , just as ours is presumably shaped and constrained by our propositional theory of content. That is , since in Hume 's view all reasoning consists in the manipulation of ideas , which Hume tends to think of as something like mental pictures , deductive reasoning must be reconstructed as the manipulation of ( roughly ) mental pictures.9 The general shape of Hume 's pictorial view of deductive arguments is nicely rendered by Harrison : 10 </shape.n.4181><shape.n.4182>Philo complains that the Greeks had brought a mist on learning , which made it impossible to discover the truth.

We will also look at how these theories point to the type of chemical reactivity that a particular molecule will have. The consequences of these shapes and electronic structures are then explored in a number of ways. We will consider how the molecules react and how mechanistic ideas can be used to rationalise and predict the outcome of a chemical reaction. The way in which a qualitative study of the rates of chemical reactions sheds light on mechanisms will be discussed , and the way in which chemical equilibrium can be understood in a quantitative way will be introduced and illustrated. The course closes by drawing together all of these concepts and using them to make sense of the widely different chemistry shown by some key non-metallic and metallic elements . </shape.n.4183><shape.n.4184>Faceted Sillimenite , Octagon / oval Shape , First quality , Eye Clean , white gray Colour &amp;, Light Smoky , 3 Pcs.

Most subsequent Dreadnoughts , including Taylor 's , have been derivative of that early design. In 1997 , however , Bob Taylor re-designed the Taylor Dreadnought by softening the curves at the top and bottom and generally refining its overall shape. In 2003 , gloss-finish Dreadnoughts also underwent bracing refinements that substantially increased their overall volume and bass response , without sacrificing Taylor 's signature balance and clarity.

Visualizing each shape is the easiest task she has ever taken on , and she finds the conceptualization of what each shape is equally simple. When she thinks about how all these shapes ( and others ) are polygons , she also finds this simple , but the visualization is a little more tricky. Why ? Because to visualize a polygon apart from a pentagon , octagon , or any other " gon " with a determined number of sides is impossible - that is , to visualize a polygon necessarily requires choosing a specific number of sides. This means that one can not visualize a polygon as such , but only specific instances. Of course , this is okay as far as forming the mental model is concerned - that is , if the mental model needs to settle for a specific number of sides in order to manifest itself , this is fine so long as we keep in mind that this specific number is not necessarily an attribute of the concept of polygons . </shape.n.4244><shape.n.4245>The origins of this Part of ISO 10303 were in materials science and technology and the title of the Part is a consequence of these origins.

Acting as primitive organelles , chromatophores are densely packed with the membrane proteins necessary for photosynthesis , including light harvesting complexes LH1 and LH2 , reaction center ( RC ) , and cytochrome bc1. The shape of chromatophores is primarily dependent on species , and is typically spherical or flat. How these shapes arise from the protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions is still unknown. Now , using molecular dynamics simulations , we have observed the dynamic curvature of membranes caused by proteins in the chromatophore. A membrane-embedded array of LH2s was found to relax to a curved state , both for LH2 from Rps. acidophila and a homology-modeled LH2 from Rb. sphaeroides. A modeled LH1-RC-PufX dimer was found to develop a bend at the dimerizing interface resulting in a curved shape as well. In contrast , the bc1 complex , which has not been imaged yet in native chromatophores , did not induce a preferred membrane curvature in simulation. Based on these results , a model for how the different photosynthetic proteins influence chromatophore shape is presented . </shape.n.4301><shape.n.4302>We do not recognize the trail of the ant or the green leaf as representations because we realize that these things require interpretation by an observer with certain abilities and knowledge in order to serve as representations.

The representation can be visualized as a 2-D surface , where " hills " and " valleys " represent contour convexities and concavities , respectively. The optimal matching of two shape representations is achieved using dynamic programming and a dissimilarity measure is defined based on this matching. The proposed algorithm is very efficient and invariant to several kinds of transformations including some articulations and modest occlusions. The retrieval performance of the approach is illustrated using the MPEG-7 shape database , which is one of the most complete shape databases currently available. Our experiments indicate that the proposed representation is well suited for object indexing and retrieval in large databases.

Ostensibly , this is a claim that the suits " straighten out " a swimmer 's body shape. While that might be an intention of the suit , its effect in top-level swimmers has not been demonstrated. As was discussed above , the curvatures of the body are not that much of a resistance-generating problem because of the slow velocity with which humans move through water in competitive swimming. One can imagine cases where a swimmer with a high body fat content and/or poor skin tone might benefit from compressing the skin surface. In today 's elite swimmers , the majority of whom seem to be taller , straighter , and of respectable body-fat content than some time ago , any change in shape would likely be inconsequential.

The common denominator of the sand funnel and the caddis fly trap is that environmental forces are harnessed to serve the species. The trap is kept open by water pressure , which also channels in microscopic organisms. The Earth 's gravity spells doom for ants in the sand funnel. Both animals use natural forces to reduce their own energy expenditure. More importantly , both cases functionally involve funnel-shaped structures into which outside forces direct food items. The caddis fly constructs its device with its own means , i.e. with thread production and innate behavior programs. The ant lion takes advantage of another favorable environmental condition : soil consisting of flat , very fine sand. It merely needs to form this sand , much like a potter would form a jug. Functionally , the key criterion is the required shape and a building material that prevents the prey from escaping. Sand has the ideal features. Thus , a second favorable environmental factor helps the ant lion build its trap , making it unnecessary for the organism to produce its own building materials . </shape.n.4325><shape.n.4326>Again , a list of hits appears in the spreadsheet.

Many spatial relations between objects are topological in nature , including adjacency , containment , and overlap. It has long been know that topological spatial relationships are learned by humans at a very early age , well less than one year ( Piaget and Inhelder , 1956 ) . Metric information , such as size , shape , distance , or direction , also can be very important cognitively , but is often used to identify entity types. Metric aspects of spatial relations often refine , rather than define , spatial relations. The relative roles of topological and metric properties in defining spatial relations in reasoning or language is complex. Some terms indicate relations which are purely topological , and in those cases metric properties may be irrelevant " within " and " enters " are probably examples of this. In other cases , metric properties such as distance or direction , expressed either quantitatively or qualitatively , may determine the meanings of various terms , for example , " north of " or " near " both normally refine the " disjoint " topological relation , and are ill-defined for non-disjoint entities . </shape.n.4328><shape.n.4329>Of great importance in the proper appearance of the breed is the ear , and especially the proper cropping of the ear to create a pleasing shape and appearance.

I therefore endeavoured to see if it were not possible to imagine that the germ-plasm , though of complex structure , was not composed of such an immense number of particles , and that its further complication arose subsequently in the course of development. In other words , what I sought was a substance from which the whole organism might arise by epigenesis , and not by evolution. After repeated attempts in which I more than once imagined myself successful , but all of which broke down when further tested by facts. I finally became convinced that an epigenetic development is an impossibility. Moreover , I found an actual proof of the reality of evolution , which is so simple that I can scarcely understand how it was possible that it should have escaped my notice so long.

A yellow sensory stimulation might be the result of a white surface viewed in yellow light , or a yellow surface viewed in white light , or many other combinations of surface colour plus aspectual lighting conditions. But since arguably all visual sensory data is restricted to data about colours or shapes , all retinal data is indeterminate because of interactions between aspectual versus object-related factors. Hence , on the view being defended , any determinate perceptual content , whether veridical or not , can not be explained purely in terms of the data available to a perceiver via sensory inputs. In addition , some broadly inferential or interpretive process must be involved , in order to estimate determinate values both for the aspectual and object-related kinds of perceptual contentnamely , the perspectival angle of view plus the intrinsic shape of the perceived object for shapes , and the ambient light plus the intrinsic colour of the surface in the case of colours . </shape.n.4351><shape.n.4352>Most existing systems are limited to picking out simple statistical regularities such as performing action A in discrete , fully observable environmental state B will lead to state C with probability 0.8.''

The sickled cells also are more likely to rupture , releasing hemoglobin into the blood stream. Death usually occurs in the second decade. The genetic change is in the gene that codes for the -globin subunit of hemoglobin.

Our concepts of such things as " point " are not and should not be thought of as identical with an image. Indeed , an image will interfere with the proper concept , for a point is merely a location , without any size or shape whatsoever.

In this way , the texturing forces the test subject to view the test image as a full shape and not to only concentrate on some specific features of the image and only track them . </shape.n.4376><shape.n.4377>[ 0018 ] Other techniques for producing specified shapes and sizes of platelets include the use of masking by screen printing , masking by ink jet printing , gravure printing , chemical etching , ablating , and laser cutting methods all of which are well know in the art.

Instead of immediately seeking to revenge his father 's death , Hamlet begins to contemplate the nature of human existence. He perceives the pretense and falsehood of society. He becomes conscious of his own personal defects. He comes to question the very purpose of life and action. All this is possible , because the thinking mind has been born in Hamlet and that mind is giving shape to his individuality. ... Hamlet is a symbol captured in fiction of a real historical phenomenon that was occurring at the time the play was written .. the collective development of thinking mind and mental individuality in Europe. ... Around the time of Hamlet , some 500 years ago , thinking ceased to be the sole prerogative and preoccupation of a rare few and became the common right and heritage of humanity as a whole.

Lovejoy looked at Ardi for clues.

To him , this means the common ancestor changed its reproductive habits. Sparing our readers the lurid details Lovejoy discussed about genitalia shapes and sizes , promiscuous behaviors and Darwinian concepts like " sperm competition " and " ovulatory crypsis " ) he deduced that Ardipithecus had a suite of adaptations that would emerge in full flower in the human race monogamy , straight teeth and upright stance.

He supports this point by citing the " waterfall phenomenon " , where there is property-awareness ( of movement ) , combined with a fact-awareness ( of nothing moving ) [ try this experience out for yourself , courtesy of one Michael Bach ] . The explanation for this dissociation of awareness , he suspects , lies in the modular organisation of the brain and its subsystems. Moreover , only fact-awareness requires an understanding of what one is aware of. Thus a young child confronted with a pentagon for the first time is o-aware of its presence and p-aware of its shape , but does not understand it for what it is , and so can not be said to be f-aware of it. More importantly still , the same goes for being aware of our own selves : we can be p-aware and o-aware of them at an early age , but only f-aware of them when our minds have grown mature enough to conceptualise them appropriately , and that maturity comes typically at age four to five years . </shape.n.4403><shape.n.4404>Spatial region filtering allows a program to select regions of an image or rows of a table ( e.g. , X-ray events ) to process using simple geometric shapes and boolean combinations of shapes.

With the advent of both computers and applied mathematics more ambitious applications of computer graphics were sought in the last few decades.

Both CAD and CAM are extensively used in a large number of areas , including aerospace , automotive engineering , marine engineering , civil engineering , and electronic engineering. The successful applications of computer graphics in engineering is largely due to the progress of computer aided geometric design ( CAGD ) which provides the mathematical basis for describing and processing geometric shapes and data. The term geometric modeling ( which includes curve modeling , surface modeling , and solid modeling ) is often used as the synonym of computer aided geometric design , although some authors argue that geometric modeling means the building up of computer representations of complex shapes from representations of similar components . </shape.n.4412><shape.n.4413>Unlike the previous glabellar form analysis , there are no obvious subsidiary groupings of taxa within the cranidial data used to construct this PCA ordination space.

As long as the curve-skeleton has identifiable joints or junction points , a partitioning of the original object can be performed to produce a one-to-one correspondence between the different components in the object and the skeleton ( for use in animation or mesh decomposition ) . </shape.n.4439><shape.n.4440>8. form , shape , pattern -- ( a perceptual structure; " the composition presents problems for students of musical form "; " a visual pattern must include not only objects but the spaces between them " ) </shape.n.4440><shape.n.4441>Alessi Fitness offers fitness tips from professional trainers Amie Barsky and Paul J.

Our data indicate that the shape map was present the first day that the monkeys viewed the objects , and the topography did not change for the remainder of our experiments. We made a concerted effort to induce and find changes , by scanning over several months , by extensively training the monkeys with 1 class of novel objects to change the significance of that object to the monkey , and by changing the subject 's behavioral task. None of these manipulations produced a discernible effect on the object-class selectivity topography , even though our data were powerful enough to easily detect changes resulting from partial manipulation of object shape ( Fig. 9 ) . The only effect of training that we uncovered with our methods was a small increase in the magnitude of response to the trained object class. This effect was only significant in a task context in which monkeys were actively processing shape , so the response increase might be related to attention . </shape.n.4443><shape.n.4444>The net of connections of cognitive schemata is capable not only of spreading , but also of restructuring and shrinking.

The difference between these two trial types is that in the non-pure shape trials , the target shape would have appeared in a different location at sample so that the animal would have been required to shift his attention and change his EM plan to the new location before making the identical EM to the identical shape. A few units showed significant differences in activity between these two conditions during the test period ( 11 , 9/80 ) and around the time of the EM ( 17 , 13/80 ) . Figure 17B shows a unit that showed a significantly enhanced activity around the EM during the shape task when the animal needed to shift its attention and change its EM plan . </shape.n.4445><shape.n.4446>If you 're a baby boomer who has either been out of shape for the past few years , or maybe for most of your life , you might worry that it 's too late for you to get in good shape and to be in good health.

As children develop a vocabulary about shape , they begin to view shapes as having characteristics or attributes. Often , children will notice that some shapes have " square corners " ( like those of a square ) , and others , " pointy tips " ( like those of triangles containing less than 60 degrees angles ) . When children first reason about attributes , they often do n't make connections among them. For example , seeing a six-sided shape , children may notice that there are six sides ( " edges " ) , but must count the number of angles ( " corners " ) to determine their number. As children solve problems , they begin to coordinate attributes , so that if a closed shape has four sides , then they also know that it has four angles . </shape.n.4447><shape.n.4448>Music faculty , which involves four levels of representation; grouping structure ( the hierarchical segmentation of the musical surface into motives , phrases and sections ) , metrical structure ( the beat , hand clapping ) , time-span reduction ( encoding of patterns in terms of the rhythmic framework established by grouping and metre ) and the prolongated reduction ( encoding patterns in terms of hierarchically arranged waves of tension and relaxation in the music ) . Jackendorff suggest that the music faculty is closed linked with the body representation. Within the body representation itself he counts the motor faculty ( muscles and joints movements ) , the haptic perception ( perception of shape by touch ) and the body position sense which is fed by such diverse sources as e.g. the visual system , auditory localization , touch and pressure sensors in the skin and the otolithic organs in the ear. Interestingly Jackendorff does not deal with smell , one of our most ephemeral senses that plays such an important role in human biology ( ste98 ) and society ( cla94 ) . </shape.n.4448><shape.n.4449>This course introduces students to the ideas and some of the basic results in Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Beginning with geometry in ancient Greece , the course includes the construction of new geometric objects from old ones by projecting and by taking slices. The next topic is non-Euclidean geometry. This section begins with the independence of Euclid 's Fifth Postulate and with the construction of spherical and hyperbolic geometries in which the Fifth Postulate fails; how spherical and hyperbolic geometry differs from Euclidean geometry. The last topic is geometry of higher dimensions : coordinatization - the mathematician 's tool for studying higher dimensions; construction of higher-dimensional analogues of some familiar objects like spheres and cubes; discussion of the proper higher-dimensional analogues of some geometric notions ( length , angle , orthogonality , etc. ) This course is intended for students who want an introduction to mathematical ideas and culture. Emphasis on conceptual thinking - students will do hands-on experimentation with geometric shapes , patterns and ideas. Grades based on homework and a final project. No exams.

Consequently , Brunelleschi took the bold step of building the Dome without centering , requiring him to construct a dome that was self-supporting in its whole and its parts.

Experimentally , the papillary-annular distances remain relatively constant in the normal heart throughout the cardiac cycle.136 In acute ischemia , however , the papillary-annular distances differ from the nonischemic state , suggesting a repositioning of the papillary muscle tips relative to the mitral annulus. These papillary tip displacements can tether or " tent " the leaflets apically during systole , e.g. , Carpentier " type IIIb " restricted systolic leaflet motion.123 , 136 Furthermore , during acute ischemia , alterations in mitral apparatus geometry are seen not only in late or end systole , but in early systole as well.139 Systolic mitral annular dilation and shape change and altered posterior papillary muscle position and motion may be the primary mechanisms for incomplete mitral leaflet coaptation causing acute IMR during acute inferior or posterolateral ischemia . </shape.n.4469><shape.n.4470>Early in the trial the monkey was centrally fixated , and stimuli appeared at different peripheral retinal positions.

For instance , a straight line segment may be described as vector content by describing its two endpoints , or by its slope , length , and origin. Likewise , a circle could be described in vector representation by describing its radius and center point.

These representations are commonly generated from real measurements or numerical computations , which may require filtering and smoothing operations. This work proposes a smoothing mechanism for union of balls that tries to inherit from the scale-space properties of bi-dimensional curvature motion : it avoids disconnecting the shape , prevents self-intersection , regularly decreases the area and convexifies the shape. The smoothing is computed iteratively by moving each ball of the union according to a combination of projected planar curvature motions. Experiments exhibits nice properties of this scale-space . </shape.n.4504><shape.n.4505>According to the experts at the International Sports Sciences Association ( ISSA ) , a personal training certification organization that teaches the nation 's personal trainers how to get their clients into shape , " total fitness involves an integrated approach that is dynamic , multidimensional and also relates to heredity and environmental factors.

The 4 control points are easy to manipulate to achieve a pleasing curve. One drawback of the B zier curve is that for more complex shapes one will need to join two or more curve segments. This can be done by matching slopes in orientation at the transition points. This , however , does not necessarily give continuity of curvature at the transition points which can be important in computer aided design applications. The other problem with the B zier curves is that the control points do not all lie on or very close to the resulting curve. This can make it almost impossible to match a shape for which we have a known set of offset points. What we need for CAD applications , therefore , is a blending function which behaves much like the true spline . </shape.n.4508><shape.n.4509>C , T2 coronal MR image was obtained from a 67-year-old female normal control ( NC ) patient.

For example , before the particular length of a wing is decided upon , the decision has been taken that the shape of the building actually consists of a number of wings. In terms of graphic units this means that the contour ( a shape with no particular dimensions ) is established before the specified form ( a contour with particular dimensions ) .

Objectivity requires the appropriate integration of perceptions. Such integration involves the connecting of states over time so A1 presented at time t1 is connected with A2 at t2 and also of states at a time. The unifying of distinct but simultaneous states is crucial for the idea of objectivity. [ 49 ] One reason for this is that a single object will be capable of presenting more than one aspect at any one time. Even a simple object such as a solid metal cylinder say of the sort that may be used as a pendulum weight for instance can give rise , at one and the same time , to a multiplicity of perceptual representations : we can feel the cylinder s weight , its smoothness of surface and hardness of edge , at the same time as we can see its shape and colour , and hear the slight sound made by the rubbing of metal against skin.

The world of outer space and of the cosmic bodies within it ( the Kingdom around us ) was understood as something that opened up within the larger womb of the Heavens the spiritual world. Corresponding and connecting us to it was the Kingdom inside us - the womblike inner space or psychical interiority of our own Earthly bodies. I am he that formed thee in thy mother ' s womb. When we leave our mother ' s womb we continue to dwell in the womb of our own soul-spiritual body , a body whose boundaries do not end at the boundaries of our skin. Our flesh is but a surface boundary or skin ( sarx ) between the inner and outer fields of our spatial awareness. Thus the Kingdom is inside you and outside you ( Gospel of Thomas ) .

Inspired by existent prior works , the current paper proposes a first-order energy-based model for analyzing and simulating illusory shapes and contours. The lower complexity of the proposed model facilitates rigorous mathematical analysis on the detailed geometric structures of illusory shapes/contours. After being asymptotically approximated by classical active contours ( via Lebesgue Dominated Convergece ) , the proposed model is then robustly computed using the celebrated level-set method of Osher and Sethian with a natural supervising scheme. Potential cognitive implications of the mathematical results are addressed , and generic computational examples are demonstrated and discussed.

The rotation and contraction continue until the material in the disc acquires orbital velocity about the sun. This concentration of gas continues to revolve around the sun in a circular motion.

Similarly , to predict the topography and geoid over a dynamically compensated swell would require knowledge of the shape of the plume-head beneath the plate [ Olson , 1990 ] . Rather than resort to guesses of these parameters , I have approximated the swell shape by simple exponential functions. Crough [ 1978 ] was the first to model oceanic swells using a Gaussian function. Closer inspection of a cross-section of topography ( Figure 4 ) reveals that the Gaussian curve ( dashed line ) seems to overestimate the swell height.

It was separated from the island by about six thousand miles of ocean , and had less width than the western , having about the proportions of a three-day crescent , while the western had the shape of the moon when four or five days old. They found the height of the mountains and plateaus somewhat less than on the eastern continent , but no great difference in other respects , except that , as they went towards the pole , the vegetation became more like that of Scotland or a north temperate region than any they had seen. On reaching latitude fifty they again came out over the ocean to investigate the speckled condition they had observed there. They found a vast archipelago covering as great an area as the whole Pacific Ocean. The islands varied from the size of Borneo and Madagascar to that of Sicily and Corsica , while some contained but a few square miles. The surface of the archipelago was about equally divided between land and water . </shape.n.4649><shape.n.4650>Early Celtic dwellings were built of timber and wattle and have not survived. In treeless areas people lived in stone dwellings; their clochfms ( beehive huts ) were constructed in corbeled fashion , with the stones overlapping each other. The early Christian churches were also built in the beehive style , although some variations were introduced such as a rectangular shape and a pitched roof. Two examples are Skellig Michael , off the Kerry coast , and the Gallarus Oratory in County Kerry; both are thought to date from the 8th century . </shape.n.4650><shape.n.4651>When the foot model was aligned to the reference frame , it was then trimmed with a reference boundary for standardizing the area of comparison. All points of the foot models beyond the boundary ( or trimline ) were removed automatically. The trimline design was similar to that of commercially available insoles , but in our design , the forefoot section was included. The foot models were trimmed 10 mm horizontally above the weight-bearing plane. On the medial aspect , the trimline for the foot model was curved up to fit the shape of the medial arch. A tangent line , connected between the widest part of the first metatarsal head and the heel in the same plane , was projected onto the foot model , which was temporally inverted up 30 about the longitudinal axis. When the foot model was rotated back to the referenced orientation , a curved up boundary line could then be formed over the medial arch region of the foot model. The shapes of the trimmed foot models were then standardized and used as final shapes for comparison . </shape.n.4651><shape.n.4652>A good training program will get you in shape so you have more energy for daily life and a higher threshold for stress.

The two proteins - DEX-1 and DYF-7 - anchor the neuronal dendrites at the nose of the worm while the cell body migrates away , eventually forming an axon that projects into the worm brain. Both proteins are secreted , and seem to form an extracellular matrix that prevents the dendrite from being dragged away with the cell body , helping the neurons form their correct , elongated shape. Heiman has now extended this work by asking whether other worm neurons similarly depend on DEX-1 and DYF-7. The answer is no - but he 's identified mutants that specifically affect other groups of neurons instead. Different neurons therefore seem to use distinct machinery to form their correct contacts and shape. Especially intriguing is Heiman 's idea that components of the extracellular matrix can play specific roles in shaping cells - it 's rather like guy ropes giving shape to a tent in addition to the internal framework provided by tent poles . </shape.n.4666><shape.n.4667>Vase fired in a wood-burning kiln ( poplar wood ) .

However , the pathway of those individuals that continue to South America is considerably constricted by the narrowing of land through Central America ( Figure 16 ) . Although the cases cited represent extremes of convergence , a narrowing of migratory paths is the rule for the majority of North American birds. Both the shape of the continent and major habitat belts tend to constrict southward movement so that the width of the migration route in the latitude of the Gulf of Mexico is much less than in the breeding range. The American Redstart represents a case of a wide migration route , but even in the southern United States this path is still much narrower than the breeding range ( Figure 17 ) .

Taking various shapes and guises , Hammons s hair art consistently incorporates African American hair collected from salons in predominantly black neighborhoods such as Harlem. A recurring preoccupation in writing about black hair is its difference in texture from white hair , and the processes African Americans undergo to achieve the smooth texture desirable in a white-dominated culture. Hammons exploits the fears of a predominantly white society along with the natural , unprocessed texture of black hair to associate it with non-human materials. In one sculpture , tufts of hair appear as cotton awaiting harvest. In another , dreadlocks join together to form a massive spider. A recent work features a rock sprouting hair as would a head.

Thomas conjectured that for certain families of Thue equations there are  up to solutions arising from finitely many polynomials over the integers $ \Bbb Z $  only finitely many further solutions over the integers. We give an example which shows that this conjecture can not hold for arbitrary families of Thue equations where the coefficients are polynomials in one variable over the rational integers. Therefore we introduce the notion of $ \Bbb Z $ -parameter solutions of a family of Diophantine equations , which means a solution in algebraic functions which has infinitely many specializations to rational integers. With this revised setting , one might ask whether Thomas 's conjecture holds for families of Thue equations. Using C. L.

To accommodate objects with cavities , we propose a relaxed definition of topology preserving : the curve-skeleton should have at least one loop around each cavity of the original object. Think of a hollow sphere : the curve-skeleton can be just a circle a single loop or many circles in different orientations but all surrounding the same cavity. The latter version may better convey the true shape of the original object. However , tunnels in the original object also create loops in the curve-skeleton. Thus , we will reformulate the relaxed definition as follows : the curve-skeleton S preserves the topology of the original object O if it has the same number of connected components and at least as many loops as tunnels and cavities in the original object. Of course if the object does not have any tunnels or cavities , the skeleton should have no loops at all. The number of loops in a curve-skeleton can be determined by performing a depth-first search on the skeleton . </shape.n.4701><shape.n.4702>You can find out more about alpha shapes by going to the NCSA page on alpha shapes.

Although linear in both shape and appearance , overall , AAMs are nonlinear parametric models in terms of the pixel intensities. Fitting an AAM to an image consists of minimizing the error between the input image and the closest model instance; i.e. solving a nonlinear optimization problem. We propose an efficient fitting algorithm for AAMs based on the inverse compositional image alignment algorithm. We show how the appearance variation can be " projected out " using this algorithm and how the algorithm can be extended to include a " shape normalizing " warp , typically a 2D similarity transformation. We evaluate our algorithm to determine which of its novel aspects improve AAM fitting performance.Active Appearance Models Revisited </shape.n.4716><shape.n.4717>The AU welcomes the NATO assistance that it requested in April 2005 , for it means more resources and being less dependent on a single provider.

There is variation in the nature of the overeating but the typical episode of overeating involves the consumption of an amount of food that would be considered excessive in normal circumstances. The bulimic is dominated by a sense of a lack of control over the eating. Binge eating is followed by attempts to undo the consequences of the binge though fasting , self-induced vomiting , misuse of laxatives , severe caloric restriction , diuretics , enemas , or excessive exercising , etc. The bulimic 's self-evaluation is centered on the individual 's perceptions of his/her body image. Concerns about weight and shape are characteristic of those with bulimia nervosa. The diagnostic criterion of bulimia nervosa requires that the individual not simultaneously meet criteria for anorexia nervosa.

I propose a unified approach to visual representation , addressing both the needs of superordinate and basic-level categorization and of identification of specific instances of familiar categories. According to the proposed theory , a shape is represented by its similarity to a number of reference shapes , measured in a high-dimensional space of elementary features. This amounts to embedding the stimulus in a low-dimensional proximal shape space. That space turns out to support representation of distal shape similarities which is veridical in the sense of Shepard 's ( 1968 ) notion of second-order isomorphism ( i.e. , correspondence between distal and proximal similarities among shapes , rather than between distal shapes and their proximal representations ) . Furthermore , a general expression for similarity between two stimuli , based on comparisons to reference shapes , can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging from continuous , symmetric , and hierarchical , as in the multidimensional scaling models ( Shepard , 1980 ) , to discrete and non-hierarchical , as in the general contrast models ( Tversky , 1977; Shepard and Arabie , 1979 ) </shape.n.4764><shape.n.4765>The following ten tips can improve your health and fitness.

Unfortunately , due to the fact that taste is related to the sense of smell , Vulcans have a well-known lack of taste sensation. Vulcans are especially weak in tasting sweet things , although their sense of taste for salty and bitter things is relatively good. In order to enjoy the taste of things , Vulcans have historically tended to highly spice or season their foods. Some traditional Vulcan dishes are nearly impossible to eat by other humanoids . </shape.n.4774><shape.n.4775>We included sectoral measurements along the operator-drawn contour line outlining the margin of the optic disc and in the parapapillary retina along a contour of 1.7 mm radius concentric with the contour line ( Fig. 1 ) . Specifically , 36 ten-degree sector measurements of the mean height contour along the operator-drawn contour line surrounding the optic disc margin ( called mean height contour at disc margin , or MHCDM ) and 36 ten-degree sector measurements of the mean retinal height or mean height contour around a contour of 1.7-mm radius ( MHC1.7 ) , with its center at the center of the optic disc were included in the analysis. The contour of 1.7-mm radius was established by automatically changing the radius of the contour line outlining the disc margin to 1.7 mm.

Chaperone proteins work by being in physical contact with other proteins. Hsp90 can also enable cancer cells to survive and even thrive despite genetic defects which would normally cause such cells to die. Thus , blocking the function of HSP90 and related chaperone proteins may cause cancer cells to die.

All tRNA molecules have a 3 ' end with the nucleotide sequence -- ACC , which is known as the acceptor stem. An enzyme attaches an amino acid by forming an ester bond with the free -- OH at the end of the acceptor stem. Each tRNA contains an anticondon , which is a series of three bases that complements the three bases on a mRNA . </shape.n.4781><shape.n.4782>When delivering specific points within a platform she did punctuate her points , literally creating points from her fingers.

For the determination of the concentration of an element X from a respective characteristic Auger peak equ. ( 4 ) can be applied again. Mostly , the sensitivity factors Si which now refer to a certain Auger transition are conveniently replaced by relative sensitivity factors referring all S-values to that for one reference Auger peak. Thus the individual experimental parameters or their variation during the analysis need not be taken into account separately. As for PES , the areas under the Auger electron peaks have to be determined when the Auger electron spectra are recorded in the direct mode. For the differentiated Auger spectra the peak-to-peak ( ptp ) -amplitudes are taken as the Auger intensities IX entering equ.

The internal interosseous intercostals in humans also have an expiratory mechanical advantage throughout the rib cage. The striking difference observed in the dog between the interosseous and intercartilaginous portions of the internal intercostals is thus maintained in humans. However , the topographic distribution of the expiratory mechanical advantage of the internal interosseous intercostals in humans differs from the dog in two respects. First , the expiratory mechanical advantage of the muscle in the dorsal portion of the rib cage in humans decreases from the top to the base of the rib cage , whereas in the dog , it gradually increases. Second , the expiratory mechanical advantage of the muscle in humans is greatest in the ventral portion , rather than the dorsal portion of the caudal interspaces.

It turns out that the way that the shape can curve in these two different directions is related to the number of holes that the shape has. On a sphere , which has no holes , at each point the sphere curves toward its center in every direction.

Patients who have body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with an ideal body image and view themselves as ugly or misshapen. Comorbid psychiatric disorders may also be present in these patients. Body dysmorphic disorder is distinguished from eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa that encompass a preoccupation with overall body shape and weight. Psychosocial and neurochemical factors , specifically serotonin dysfunction , are postulated etiologies. Treatment approaches include cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and psychotropic medication. To relieve the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , in higher dosages than those typically recommended for other psychiatric disorders , may be necessary.

A natural velocity field method was employed for shape optimization of the member. The change in shape of an initially rectangular cross-section in addition to variation of the breadth and depth along the length of the member has been permitted. The required shape changes have been computed using a sequential quadratic programming technique. A genetic algorithm has been employed to optimize the diameter and number of main reinforcement bars. Constraints based on limit state design principles on the permissible flexural and shear stresses and deflection were employed. This study has also been extended to the optimization of the shape of initially rectangular prestressed concrete girders and prestressed box girder-deck slabs structures. The optimization of structural truss systems which is particularly complex as the load sustained by these members is directly dependent on the member connectivity and the nodal locations , has also been studied . </shape.n.4837><shape.n.4838>Sereno AB and Maunsell JH.

The major mechanism for neuron-to-neuron communication is 'receptor-mediated ' neurotransmission that takes place at specialized connections between neurons called synapses. At the synapse , the distance between two neurons is very short. A chemical ( classified as a neurotransmitter , neuromodulator or neurohormone ) is released from the 'presynaptic ' neuron and into the extra-cellular space ( called the synaptic cleft ) and binds to a specialized receptor protein in the membrane of the 'postsynaptic ' neuron. By occupying the binding site , the neurotransmitter helps change the shape of this receptor which then catalyzes a secondary set of chemical interactions inside the postsynaptic neuron that create second messengers. The second messengers such as cyclic AMP , inositol phosphate and calcium will then shift the intracellular chemical milieu which may even influence the activity of specific genes. This cascade of intracellular chemical responses allows communication from one neuron to another . </shape.n.4911><shape.n.4912>A local currency is also taking shape , but at a slower pace.

A special purpose finite element code has been developed which simulates the self weight condition of the cable-deck-tower structure taking in to account the exact erection process followed at the construction site. An incremental nonlinear self -weight analysis has been employed to arrive at the stresses in the structure and the cable profile. The cable has been modeled using an equivalent modulus that accounts for geometric nonlinear effects. The equivalent modulus has been derived from the basic cable equation accounting for the sequence of the bridge erection process. The study indicates that the inclusion of the actual sequence of bridge construction results in a modification of the dynamics of the structural system ( natural frequencies and mode shape ) significantly . </shape.n.4913><shape.n.4914>Contrary to popular belief , a male black widow is not always eaten by the female after mating. Some males live to mate another day. Females can live three or more years. Mating occurs in or near the female ' s web which is irregular in shape except for a short funnel-shaped portion in which the female hides. The webs measure about one foot in all directions and are typically found in dark , sheltered spots such as in animal burrows , around the bases of rocks , bushes , woodpiles or around the foundations of structures. Egg sacs are often seen in the webs. The sacs are about the size of a large pea and usually contain more than 200 eggs. The spiderlings that hatch from them disperse to new locations by extruding a long strand of silk that is taken aloft by the wind , a process known as ballooning that can transport the baby spider to locations several miles away . </shape.n.4914><shape.n.4915>Make the cuts in all of the rails and stiles , using caution when routing the top rail.

Simply put , when the eye is hit the equatorial expansion of the globe causes a flattening of the posterior pole and when the globe returns to its normal shape , the vitreous exerts tangential tractional forces on the anatomically thin fovea , thereby resulting in foveal dehiscence and macular hole formation. There are two theories on delayed traumatic macular hole development. A small hole is thought to be secondary to persistent vitreofoveal adhesion , whereas a large hole may be due to post-concussion retinal necrosis . </shape.n.4921><shape.n.4922>Select the copy together with one of the paths representing the outline of your shape and Combine them ( Ctrl+L ) .

Moreover , a number of diseases such as the common cold can cause a temporary increase in the number of abnormal sperm cells. This demonstrates the fact that the sperm are susceptible to damage from their environment. The authors believe that in spite of the high incidence of defective or abnormal sperm , they actually have little consequence for fertilization itself unless the proportion of normal sperm is exceptionally low. For the defective sperm do not reach the ovum : or they fail to penetrate it.

It permits Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ( SHAPE ) to activate an allied movement coordination center to review these national deployment plans and , if required , deconflict movements into the theater 's POD's. During this deconfliction process , there is direct dialogue and coordination between the troop-contributing nations and SHAPE on the forces ' arrival into theater. This is a very delicate and time-sensitive process. SHAPE does not want to discourage troop-contributing nations from providing forces , but it does want to manage the arrival of forces based on the commander 's operational preferences and future force order of implementation. Deployments at this level also must be managed because there often are restrictions at the reception ports. A majority of these ports have limited infrastructure , equipment , and space , which influence the number of forces arriving in the theater of operations.

This is similar ( but not identical ) to the criterion adopted here; unfortunately , they do n't specify why this criterion is used and their analysis of this principle is confined to looking at only bi-variate statistics so that entropy is approximated by correlation matrices from the start. They use their principle to find a receptive field shape for cells involved in early visual processing , assuming the input data is maximum entropy , but with the proviso of having a specific correlation matrix.

The naked-eye impression during such time is of a very small brightening of elongated but otherwise rather indistinct shape.

This may be expected because older drivers are most vulnerable to collision-related injury or death due to frailty associated with older age. Similarly , fatigue causes deterioration of mechanical and electrical components and susceptibility to external stresses. Design or defects of a product sometimes contributes to brittle behavior of a material. Therefore , in order to maximize safety of both people and products , it is necessary to seek to minimize these stress factors. In traffic-related collisions , these may be due to visual , cognitive , or motor impairments , or any combination thereof , of the drivers.

The story of second graders estimating cranberries to fill a jar , described in the " Connections " section of this chapter , illustrates a lesson in which students use their understanding of number , measurement , geometry , and data to complete the tasks. When teachers point out geometric shapes in nature or in architecture , students ' awareness of geometry in the environment is increased. When teachers invite students to discover why most fire hydrants have pentagonal caps rather than square or hexagonal ones or why balls can roll in straight lines but cones roll to one side , they are encouraging them to apply their geometric understandings. When students are asked to visualize numbers geometrically by modeling various arrangements of the same number with square tiles , they also are making connections to area.

H.H. Rowley has remarked : 'In the teaching of the Old Testament God is nowhere conceived of as essentially of human form. Rather he is conceived of as pure spirit , able to assume a form rather than as having in himself a physical form.'/94/ We may query the expression 'conceived of as pure spirit ' as dif cult to substantiate from the Old Testament , /95/ yet the basic point in Rowley 's statement is God 's formlessness , which does not indeed imply his disability to assume a form when he wishes to 'let himself appear'./96/ We may indeed go further , with J. Barr , and note that when Yahweh does appear in a form , the human form is the natural and characteristic one for him to assume. Nevertheless , 'thoughts of God appearing in human shape are by no means naturally reversible into thoughts of man sharing the shape of God'./97/ </shape.n.4976><shape.n.4977>Once again , the enterprise might have foundered; but once again , a deus ex machina appeared , this time in the shape of Professor Jay Forrester of MIT , who had been invited to the meeting. For thirty years he had been working on the problem of developing mathematical models that could be applied to complex , dynamic situations such as economic and urban growth. His offer to adapt his well-tried dynamic model to handle global issues was gratefully accepted , and the way ahead suddenly seemed less uncertain. A fortnight later , a group of Club members visited Forrester at MIT and were convinced that the model could be made to work for the kind of global problems which interested the Club. An agreement was signed with a research team at MIT in July 1970 , the finance provided by a grant of $ 200 000 that Pestel had obtained from the Volkswagen Foundation . </shape.n.4977><shape.n.4978>What I like about this test ( beyond just the weighted vests and general intensity ) is that it ' s entirely functional , and not just for firefighters.

To examine further whether the spatially-selective delay period activity in area LIP represents a purely passive memory , we also trained the animals on a fixation task that required no behavioral response. While the animal fixated , we presented the shapes from the matching tasks in the isolated neuron 's receptive field in the same position used during the matching tasks ( see Experimental procedures ) . We compared the activity for each unit during the fixation period following the presentation of a given shape in this passive fixation condition with that during the delay period in the matching task after the same stimulus had been presented in the same location as a sample ( see Data analysis for details ) . Of the 52 neurons with significant spatially selective delay activity in the matching tasks , 20 ( 39 ) had significantly greater activity in the delay period of the matching task compared with the first interstimulus period of the fixation task ( Fig. 10 ) . The failure of these units to show equivalent activation during the interstimulus interval of the fixation task shows that for some of the units with spatially selective delay period activity , this activity is not entirely passive or automatic . </shape.n.4982><shape.n.4983>The following example applies a drop shadow to a Shape instance.

All materials stretch to one extent or another which allows for a certain amount of twist. It depends on the properties of the material , its size , and its thickness. ProSurf helps with this problem by letting you define surface " ruling " lines between any two curves. These ruling lines are dynamically redrawn as you move the edit points on the two boundary curves. In addition , the ruling lines are drawn using colors that define the amount of twist in the plate in that location. The user can dynamically adjust the two curves until they achieve a good spread of ruling lines with an acceptable level of twist. A NURB surface can then be fit to the ruling lines to create a true surface that can be flattened. The flattened 2D plate shape can also be marked with cross-section trace lines . </shape.n.4985><shape.n.4986>The second question that we addressed is whether some purely global shapes are preferred to others. This too has its counterpart in the global motion literature where there is evidence that some forms of optic flow are more detectable than others and that the mechanisms underlying their detection may be different ( Morrone , Burr , DiPietro &amp;Stefanelli , 1999 ) . Here we compared thresholds for circular , radial and spiral global shapes. Thresholds were lowest for circular shapes and highest for spiral shapes. It is hard to compare this finding to similar previous comparisons for Glass patterns because there is still some debate concerning whether an observer ' s sensitivity depends on the particular transformation involved ( Wilson &amp;Wilkinson , 1998; Dakin &amp;Bex , 2002 ) . Since our stimuli were displayed within a square window , the lower thresholds for circular shapes that we find are at odds with those reported for Glass patterns ( Dakin &amp;Bex , 2002 ) and may represent another difference between the present task and its nearby relative , the Glass pattern. However , this difference may be related to the initial matching stage in Glass patterns , as opposed to the later global integration stage common to both tasks . </shape.n.4986><shape.n.4987>A Procrustes PCA analysis of these shape coordinate data yields 17 eigenvectors with non-zero lengths.

Their results nicely confirm and give parameters for an ionized stellar wind and a cold cloud of material behind the neutron star. However , the model and data do not agree in the detailed line shapes , indicating that in places the wind speed is lower than expected.

When choosing the three shapes used in the DMTS task , although we tried to pick the shapes that elicited the strongest and weakest responses , the choices were made from qualitative estimation from on-line histograms of a few test trials per shape and not quantitative calculations across many trials. This less than optimal selection of stimuli combined with a smaller number of shape stimuli and less than optimal presentations with respect to the receptive field on 2/3 of the trials ( 2 of the 3 locations ) would have reduced the probability of finding statistically significant differences in responses to different shapes in the DMTS task . </shape.n.4994><shape.n.4995>You can draw your own shapes by combining any of the shapes and lines in RFFlow.

Proteins are the building blocks of our body tissues; they can also be enzymes , hormones , antibodies or be intercellular and extracellular signaling molecules. Proteins can be very large molecules , consisting of 20 , 000 or more amino acid units. Each protein begins through tiny ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm reading instructions from messenger RNA which comes from the cell nucleus. The ribosomes act to link up amino acids in a long linear chain ( polypeptide ) in a process called translation. Each amino acid in the chain attracts or repels the other amino acids in a complex electrochemical way , soon causing the protein to fold up naturally into a characteristic 3-dimensional structure for that protein a sort of automatic origami folding process. The folding may take a microsecond or up to a minute. In the process new electron bonds are formed among the amino acids determining many of the chemical and biological properties of the protein. The shape of the protein helps determine its functionality . </shape.n.5006><shape.n.5007>Point-to-Point Line : This option provides an easy way to create complex shapes , especially if straight and curved line segments are combined.

Base curve topography patterns should demonstrate a more rapid rate of peripheral flattening , which should be obvious when viewing the axial map. Also , aspheric base curves are actually composed of both sagittal and tangential radii of curvature. Coincidentally , the Atlas Corneal Topography System measures an instantaneous or tangential radius centrally and peripherally.

Einstein reinterpreted the constant k from the above equation. We had said that k was a value for energy. Einstein instead interpreted it as a measure of the curvature of space. In the simplest of terms Einstein rewrote this equation as : " Matter tells space how to curve , and space tells matter how to move , " ( this description of Einstein 's interpretation comes from John Wheeler 's Gravitation ) .

They included computing the total power , cardiac index , systemic vascular resistance index ( SVRI ) , time of forward flow , mean velocities , quadrant flow , stroke volume , and time to maximum flow. Quadrant analysis was done in order to quantify velocity profile differences between the groups. Although the shape of the velocity profile is debatable , most investigators agree that flow in the ascending aorta is axisymmetric [ 12 , 13 ] .

This geometric modification possibly results in a nonuniform flow profile that could potentially result in increased frictional losses near the wall. In this study , we have attempted to evaluate the effect of such flow asymmetries on output power and systemic vascular resistance for HLHS and other single-ventricle defects . </shape.n.5029><shape.n.5030>On the drawing toolbar , select AutoShapes and any of the shape options that appear.

Among boys , there was no interaction between BMI and birth cohort in their effects on the risk of CHD ( not shown ) . The risk of an event in adulthood increased significantly for each 1-unit increase in BMI z score at each age from 7 to 13 years ( Figure 1A ) . The shape of the association was mainly linear at every age , since the results of tests against the cubic spline were nonsignificant ( all P values &gt; 0.10 ) . These findings show that the risk of CHD in adulthood was highest for boys with the highest BMI values and lowest for boys with the lowest BMI values. Furthermore , the risk of an adult event increased as the child 's age increased; for 13-year-old boys , the risk for each 1-unit increase in BMI z score was nearly double that for 7-year-olds . </shape.n.5032><shape.n.5033>- Supercharged shape shifting may result in the ability to mimic clothes and other none-body-parts , such as glasses.

Transfiguring into plant and mineral form was never attempted as too many upon Sirius had become stuck in such a form and could not return to the human shape that they once held. Why was this so ? In hindsight , such humans entered a holographic state of being that had no relationship to the human hologram; and in so doing they were unable to find their way back and got seemingly lost.

This view has frequently been criticized , however , most recently by McGinn ( 2004 ) . An alternative view , implicit in many discussions ( and explicitly defended by Thomas ( 1997a , 1999b; see also Jastrow , 1899 ) ) , is that imagery lies at one end of a spectrum stretching from veridical , highly stimulus-driven and stimulus-constrained perception at one end , to pure imagery ( where the content of the experience is generated entirely by the subject , and is quite independent of any current stimulus input ) at the other. Several varieties of imaginative preceptual experience may be taken to fill in the continuum between these extremes : mistaken or illusive perceptions ( imagining , for instance , that the bush seen indistinctly in the darkness is a bear ) , and various types of non-deceptive seeing as or seeing in ( such as imagining a cloud to have the shape of a camel , weasel , or whale; seeing a Laughing Cavalier in paint on canvas; seeing someone 's sadness in their eyes; or seeing the notorious duck-rabbit figure as a duck [ or rabbit ] ) . </shape.n.5044><shape.n.5045>Here is sample R code that merges separate ESRI Shape Files with the same internal format into a single Shape file.

Using tangent principal component analysis ( TPCA ) , we have imposed probability models on these spaces and have used them in Bayesian shape estimation and classification of objects in images. Extending these ideas to 3D problems , I will present a " path-straightening " approach for computing geodesics between closed curves in R3. The basic idea is to define a space of such closed curves , initialize a path between the given two curves , and iteratively straighten it using the gradient of an energy whose critical points are geodesics. This computation of geodesics between 3D curves helps analyze shapes of facial surfaces as follows. Using level sets of smooth functions , we represent any surface as an indexed collection of facial curves. We compare any two facial surfaces by registering their facial curves , and by comparing shapes of corresponding curves. Note that these facial curves are not necessarily planar , and require tools for analyzing shapes of 3D curve . </shape.n.5047><shape.n.5048>In Pneumatophorus this structure was especially difficult to locate and define.

In the case of a former tritium extraction facility , Building 232-F demolition ( Fig. 1a ) produced a significant volume of rubble with embedded tritium as tritiated water ( HTO ) . Tritium ( 3H ) is nonsorbing and decays with a half-life of 12.3 yr. The contaminated concrete debris ( Fig. 1b ) comprises a heterogeneous mixture of coarse aggregate sizes , shapes , and internal tritium distributions. The rubble was disposed in long , shallow , unlined , earthen trenches that were subsequently backfilled with excavated soil and exposed to normal rainfall infiltration. An accurate prediction of tritium flux to the water table was desired to demonstrate compliance with USDOE performance objectives for on-site disposal. To this end , an unsteady dual-porosity model was developed to describe tritium leaching from concrete to soil , and vadose zone transport to the water table. A novel development in the work is a practical technique for representing a highly heterogeneous mixture of arbitrary rubble shapes and sizes with an approximately equivalent distribution of one-dimensional slab geometries . </shape.n.5052><shape.n.5053>Transfer print underglaze in blue , polychrome decoration filled in by hand.

The separation of the representation of the property from its definition is a fundamental feature of the data modelling in STEP . </shape.n.5095><shape.n.5096>What we see is that when the rate is too high , growth rates are pretty low presumably this is because the high tax rates discourage private enterprise. Similarly , when tax rates are too low , growth rates are low this is probably because in such instances , the government shrinks too much to provide services essential to economic growth , or it must borrow heavily to finance its activities. ( Put another way taxes are too high when the private sector can make better use of a marginal dollar than the government , and they are too low when the government can make better use of a marginal dollar than the private sector. ) So what ' s the happy medium ? Highest observed growth rates occurred when the top marginal rte was between 50 and 60 .

Form and its opposite , space , constitute primary elements of architecture. The reciprocal relationship is essential , given the intention of architecture to provide internal sheltered space for human occupation. Both form and space are given shape and scale in the design process. In addition , the placement of a building form in relation to its immediate site and neighboring buildings is another crucial aspect of this form/space relationship.

This is where shape prescriptive modeling shines. It is really a very Bayesian concept. It is the process of quantifying our basic knowledge of a process in mathematical terms , and then estimating a predictive model of the process that has that knowledge built into it. Our knowledge becomes a prescription for the final shape of the process. Sometimes we know much about a process , in which case we have a detailed prescription. Other times we have a very sketchy prescription . </shape.n.5114><shape.n.5115>A number of recent studies have focused on the kinematics of hovering and forward flight , using a variety of techniques. Azuma and Watanabe ( 1988 ) changed the velocity of the wind tunnel in their measurements. Dudley and Ellington ( 1990 ) calculated angles of attack in the free forward flight of bumblebees. Willmott and Ellington ( 1997 ) employed a variable-speed wind tunnel associated with the optomotor response to investigate wing and body kinematics during free forward flight of a hawkmoth over a range of speeds from hovering to 5 m s-1. Wakeling and Ellington ( 1997 ) filmed the free flights of dragonflies and damselflies flying over the pond in the greenhouse at the University of Cambridge. The individuals were not restrained by either tethers or wind tunnels , but were free to vary the velocity and acceleration and could perform any flight action. In their analyses of forward flight , the stroke plane was constructed based on the assumption of bilateral wing symmetry , and variations in roll , yaw and pitch angles of the body through each flapping cycle were neglected. To date no detailed information on wing orientation or shape during free flight has been acquired . </shape.n.5115><shape.n.5116>Clothing changes the appearance of the body.

The NATO Council , therefore , had to make appropriate modifications to the Allied organisation.

The magnitude of the deficits is modest when low-level deficits ( reduced visibility , increased positional uncertainty , and abnormal shape perception ) are minimized , and does not seem to depend much on acuity , crowding or stereoacuity. The residual deficits reported here can not be simply ascribed to reduced visibility or increased positional uncertainty , and we therefore conclude that these are genuine deficits in global contour segregation and integration . </shape.n.5130><shape.n.5131>Let s face it  " almost everyone dreams of having a nice body.

Measurements are made of solar ultraviolet ( UV ) light entering the atmosphere ( the irradiance ) at a particular wavelength and of the solar UV that is either reflected from the surface or scattered back from the atmosphere ( the radiance ) at the same wavelength. By looking directly down at the atmosphere in a viewing geometry called nadir viewing , the satellite is able to get a good horizontal resolution , which is highly advantageous. The total area of the field of view seen by the instrument is called the footprint. The point on Earth directly beneath the satellite is called the subsatellite point. The BUV technique 's main disadvantage is that the effects of increased multiple scattering and reduced sensitivity to the shape of the profile lead to poor vertical resolution in the region below roughly 30 km.

Although Brunelleschi employed a form of the principle of least-action which Leibniz and Bernoulli later discovered was expressed by the catenary , the features of the Dome are not in the shape of a hanging chain. Rather , it is the principle of least-action expressed by the hanging chain , as that principle was later developed in Gauss 's theory of surfaces , Riemann 's theory of manifolds , and LaRouche 's principles of physical economy , which shaped the Dome.

However , the present report looked at functional organization instead of single-unit selectivity , focused on a different species ( human instead of monkey ) , and involved relatively large shape differences ( selectivity for object classes ) instead of fine metric shape differences ( selectivity for exemplars within shape groups ) . Together , the two studies suggest that shape-selective regions in primates are functionally organized in terms of shape properties that distinguish perceptually distinct shapes ( all nine object classes in the present study are easy to discriminate ) and that single neurons in these regions discriminate objects in terms of finer metric shape differences in addition to being selective for perceptually more distinct shapes. The actual organizational unit for the clustering of functional responses might be smaller than our voxel size ( Kamitani and Tong , 2005 ) , and the underlying functional organization might be similar to the feature columns as revealed by optical imaging in monkey IT cortex ( Fujita et al. , 1992; Wang et al. , 1996 ) . </shape.n.5167><shape.n.5168>Sereno AB , Maunsell JH.

Generally speaking , the greater the velocity the smaller should be the angle of incidence , in order to preserve a clean , stream-line shape of rarefied area and freedom from eddies. Should the angle be too great for the velocity , then the rarefied area over the top of the surface becomes of irregular shape with attendant turbulent eddies. Such eddies possess no lift value , and since it has taken power to produce them , they represent drift and adversely affect the lift-drift ratio. Also , too great an angle for the velocity will result in the underside of the surface tending to compress the air against which it is driven rather than accelerate it downwards , and that will tend to produce drift rather than the upwards reaction , or lift . </shape.n.5189><shape.n.5190>Table 2 shows geometry parameter values for the 28-year-old subject before and after correction for the two types of distortion ( Types I and II ) .

Smooth , curved outlines and surfaces can be soothing. Angular shapes with zigzag outlines and forms with pointed projections can cause us to feel uncomfortable. Perfectly geometric shapes seem orderly and stable , perhaps expressing a lack of emotion. The density or mass of an object refers to how compact it is. Dense materials seem strong and unyielding and may suggest protection. Less dense forms are soft and fluffy and seem comfortable. An open shape , form , or space , which you can see through or inside , can be welcoming. For example , an armchair is an open form that invites you to sit; an open door invites you to enter. On the other hand , closed forms , such as windowless buildings , can look forbidding and say , Keep away. Just as lines can be active and static , so can shapes and forms. Active shapes and forms slant diagonally and seem energetic. Static shapes and forms are usually horizontal or arranged like an equilateral triangle.

The key is identifying your body type and working out according to a programme that takes this into account. Edward Jackowski is widely recognized as the first and only fitness expert to create fitness programmes tailored to the four basic body types he calls : Hourglass , Cone , Spoon and Ruler. ESCAPE YOUR SHAPE begins by helping readers identify which one applies to them. It goes on to detail four different work out programmes with variations to accomodate physical contraints such as back or joint injuries. Readers who struggle every day with exercise thinking their bodies can not change , who believe genetics control their physical destiny , take hope !

Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous , but large effects are very rare. In the past , most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution.

The skin is thin , tough , and usually covered with microscopic hairs. The head is fairly complete and can be retracted into the thorax. The posterior end has a single pair of spiracles surrounded by a disc of fleshy lobes ( spiracular lobes ) , and membranous lobes ( anal papillae ) surround the anus. The shape , length , and number of these lobes vary among species and have proved to be taxonomically important and can be used to identify them. There is probably a close correlation of structure to habitats. Most crane fly larvae breath air through the posterior spiracles. Some can remain submerged in water for a limited time period when their habitats become flooded. The lobes surrounding the posterior spiracles often have a fringe of fine hairs that entrap a film of air when submerged.

This is in strong contrast with how pictures appear : we can attend to the paint in a picture , but , according to Harman , there is no phenomenal paint of which we are introspectively aware. Phenomenal paint fails to appear not only in unreflective experience but even on phenomenological reflection. Of course he does not deny that some perceptual experiences can lack real objects and yet have a fully phenomenal presence. But he is content to appeal to mere intentional objects , intentional objects that do not exist. An experience 's qualities in such a case consist in the properties it attributes to the object that is n't there.

So far as this appeal implies ( 1 ) that these ideas are immanent in his own self , and ( 2 ) that when feeling is opposed to the logical understanding , it , and not the partial abstractions of the latter , may be the totality - the appeal has a legitimate meaning.

For even greater simplicity , we have chosen to represent the curvature of the sides of the drum using circular arcs.

For example , suppose a designer is designing a computer mouse. One set of design specifications may deal with how comfortable it is for a user to hold the mouse and to control the buttons. These are functional specifications in the sense of the properties of the mouse when it is being used. One way to make a functional inferences is to combine the information about shape and distance between buttons that may be acquired visually from the sketch or the diagram , and combine it with conceptual knowledge about what kinds of shapes and distances satisfy the user needs. Another way is to directly acquire the information about ease of use by interacting with an external 3-D representation. " Buttons too far " is a direct perceptual inference in this modality.

The farsighted eye has no difficulty viewing distant objects. But the ability to view nearby objects requires a different lens shape - a shape which the farsighted eye is unable to assume. Subsequently , the farsighted eye is unable to focus on nearby objects. The problem most frequently arises during latter stages in life , as a result of the weakening of the ciliary muscles and/or the decreased flexibility of the lens. These two potential causes leads to the result that the lens of the eye can no longer assume the highly convex shape required to view nearby objects. The lens\\\ ' power to refract light has diminished and the images of nearby objects are focused at a location behind the retina. On the retinal surface , where the light-detecting nerve cells are located , the image is not focused.

However , very few geometric estimators that are projective invariant have been devised. This paper proposes projective length and projective curvature estimators for plane curves , when the curves are represented by points together with their tangent directions. In this context , the estimations can be performed with only the four point-tangent samples for the projective length and five for the projective curvature. The proposed length estimator is based on affine estimators and is proved to be convergent. The curvature estimator relies on the length to fit logarithmic spirals to the point-tangent samples. It is projective invariant and experiments indicate its convergence. Preliminary results using both estimators together are promising , although the estimators lack of robustness would require additional work for noisy cases . </shape.n.5366><shape.n.5367>All humanity is connected and networked.

On the one hand , the Sefiroth first receive their various potencies and shapes in the Shekhinah; prior to their appearance within the upper or lower Shekhinah , they have no shape of their own. On the other hand , this implies , not only that all things in the creaturely world obtain their form from the Shekhinah , insofar as it exerts a formative power upon every created thing , but that they already have this form while they are in the Shekhinah , insofar as they are constituted and prefigured in it.

The output was collapsed across directions , to provide an overall estimate of the correlation of nearby points in the image. Figures 10d and 10e show that nearby locations in natural scenes and noise tend to be of similar orientation. For noise , this surprising correlation is caused by the spatial integration of the filters and the spatial extent of correlation therefore increases with the filter wavelength. For real images , autocorrelation is greater and extends over a much greater distance before falling to chance levels , in good agreement with previous studies using very different methods ( Geisler et al. , 2001 ) . The difference between autocorrelation in real scenes and noise can be attributed to the spatial structure of natural scenes , rather than the shape of the filters used to perform this analysis . </shape.n.5383><shape.n.5384>3D Deformable Modeling is a unique interactive sculpting tool for shaping 3D models while maintaining high-quality , manufacturable surfaces. 3D Deformable Modeling provides local and global editing features that allow for the easy creation and manipulation of free-form B-spline curves and surfaces.

Here one understands why inter-individual attitudes , social behaviour and religious mentality may be greatly shaped by the character of messianic images. Perceived as ego ideals , the character and ideas that messianic protagonists stand for , as well as their gender and ethnic identity , shape personality models. These conceived the ideal self. It is thus crucial whether a Messianic figure serving as an ego ideal , stands for an exclusive society and exclusive values or co-existence. No less crucial is the origin of the messianic figure. It is proven essential whether this a personality ideal follows a model of low or high mimesis , forgiving and compassionate or punitive , feminine or masculine , paternal or maternal.

In this context , the estimations can be performed with only three point-tangent samples for the projective length and five samples for the projective curvature. The proposed length and curvature estimator are based on projective splines built by fitting logarithmic spirals to the point-tangent samples. They are projective invariant and convergent . </shape.n.5410><shape.n.5411>No matter who you are or where you are on Long ] sland , Citibankoffers you exclusive banking advantages.

When all this information is collected the renderer is able to calculate the coordinate position for each shape. It then calls each shape to draw itself . </shape.n.5431><shape.n.5432>Pearls are placed into eight basic shape categories : " round , " " drop , " " button " " oval , " " semi-round , " " circle -- or " ringed " , " baroque , " and " semi-baroque.

They consider CAD systems not appropriate for the ideation phase. This research investigates how designers ideate shape , in particular which terms they use to exteriorize shape. The goal is to be able to propose digital tools that are useful for shape ideation. For the inventory of shape terms , an experiment was set up for two subjects. Both subjects receive a picture of a shape. Subject A receives also a picture of a derived shape. A explains the derived shape to B , who sketches it. The used shape terms are inventoried and categorized. The experiment was performed with two different groups of subjects. The research method is described in detail , the frequencies of the observed terms are presented and the differences between the groups are shown. The results are discussed and implications for digital shape ideation systems are mentioned . </shape.n.5435><shape.n.5436>Mazarine-blue ground with gilded decoration.

However the concept of the internal structure is different from the concept of a mechanical assembly in that the organisation of a material structure will include interactions and intersections between the different shape representations making up the structure. Therefore it would be expected that the concepts from parts 42 and 43 would be used differently to represent material structure in an implementation than they would be for a mechanical assembly . </shape.n.5441><shape.n.5442>for Plato , forms were not shapes , but the essential divine patterns of things. the mutable world was a degenerated tracing of these ideal immutable forms.

It was unveiled to commemorate the company 's 20th Anniversary in 1994 , and since then it has more than lived up to its promise. Although the GA has the width and depth of a Dreadnought , its narrower waist gives it the appearance of a smaller instrument , adds treble " zing " across the guitar 's tonal spectrum , sharpens the definition of individual notes , and also enables it to rest comfortably in the lap. Because we remove mass from the width of the GA 's braces , the guitar top moves faster , resulting in a snappy , bell-like tone.

The type , size , shape , arrangement , and abundance of the voids are factors controlling many important properties ( e.g. , compressive strength , resistance to destruction bycycles of freezing and thawing , and resistance to chemical attack on the reinforcing steel and the cement paste ) . The percentage of air-void volume is generally specified by the design of the mixture. A large number of very small ( most are not visible without magnification ) air voids are desirable so that the average distance between any point in the paste and a void ( spacing factor ) is very short and , thus , the paste is protected from freezing and thawing. However , because voids weaken the HCC , spacing factors much less than the maximum ensuring protection from freezing and thawing are counterproductive and should be avoided . </shape.n.5465><shape.n.5466>December 12 EU leaders , meeting in Brussels , agreed to create a small EU military planning cell.

The contaminated concrete debris comprises a heterogeneous mixture of coarse aggregate sizes , shapes , and internal tritium distributions. Approximating the waste with a distribution of equivalent one-dimensional slab thicknesses is effective in capturing diffusional flux variations with concrete chuck size , shape , and internal source distribution. The unsteady dual-porosity formulation facilitated more accurate forecast of tritium releases from burial trenches compared with prior assumptions of instantaneous release. Specifically , the peak flux from concrete rubble is predicted to be roughly 40 of that from tritium-contaminated soil. The lower flux is a result of slow release of tritium from concrete and a reduced effective hydraulic conductivity of the trench due to the presence of impervious concrete. Downward migration of tritium released in upper portions of a disposal trench was observed to initially depress leaching in lower portions , due to elevated concentrations in backfilled soil. Tritium initially held up in the lower trench later produces elevated releases compared with overlying material . </shape.n.5467><shape.n.5468>The onMouseMove Shape Constructor and the Quadratic Bezier Shape Constructor are experiments in different ways to save a shape drawn by a user in a Flash application.

Whenever the ping-pong ball hit the table , its position would be sensed using microphones. A hit caused the water projected on the table surface to ripple on the spot , and virtual fish to scatter. The combined use of projection on a planar surface , with natural objects tracked as input , allowed tangibles to seemlessly integrate computer elements in a physical game , without affecting its speed or physicality. Tangibles allowed for a tighter coupling between input and output , or , as Professor Ishii more aptly put it : between bits and atoms. However , tangibles lacked the ability to display directly onto most input objects ( such as the ball ) , as rigid displays are difficult to integrate into non-planar objects. They also lacked the ability to track multitouch coordinates on the surface of such objects. And because their shape was not actuated , consistancy between bits and atoms could not always be maintained. As a consequence , tangible designs focused largely on the use of objects as devices for input . </shape.n.5469><shape.n.5470>11As telling against this explanation , the instance may be adduced that there are things in which we see a form suggesting adaptation to an end , without any end being cognized in them-as , for example , the stone implements frequently obtained from sepulchral tumuli and supplied with a hole , as if for [ inserting ] a handle; and although these by their shape manifestly indicate a finality , the end of which is unknown , they are not on that account described as beautiful. But the very fact of their being regarded as art-products involves an immediate recognition that their shape is attributed to some purpose or other and to a definite end. For this reason there is no immediate delight whatever in their contemplation. A flower , on the other hand , such as a tulip , is regarded as beautiful , because we meet with a certain finality in its perception , which , in our estimate of it , is not referred to any end whatever . </shape.n.5470><shape.n.5471>THE ANCIENT EMPIRE : THE PYRAMIDS.

This golden fluid - the product of the prodigious , silent labours of the kidneys - gathers in the urinary bladder , a hollow muscular organ , the shape and size of which varies according to the amount of urine it contains; when empty it is tetrahedral and when full ovoid. The desire to urinate or micturate begins when the content reaches 400ml but can be overridden until the content reaches about 800ml. It is a complex activity partly unconscious ( controlled by lower spinal cord centres ) and partly conscious ( controlled by the higher brain centres ) . Messages from the brain stimulate the detrusor or emptying muscles of the bladder , relaxing both urethral sphincters. Evacuation is assisted by the abdominal wall contracting , the diaphragm descending , the breath being held and the perineal floor relaxing. Once begun urination is carried through to completion by higher and lower centres acting in concert and messages sent from the urethra distended by the flow of urine - all this often accompanied by a heartfelt 'Ahhhh !

It is located behind the Pupil and Iris , and is attached to the Cilliary Body by hundreds of thread-like Zonules. The lens works together with the Cornea to focus light on the Retina. When the lens is cloudy or opaque , it is called a Cataract. Cataracts are present , at least to a small degree , in virtually everyone over 60 years of age , but can occur in people of any age , even in newborns. Remarkably , the lens also has the ability to Accommodate. Accommodation is where the lens changes its shape ( thickens ) , thereby changing its power , allowing us to focus on near objects. Between ages 42 and 65 , the lens slowly hardens and looses it 's ability to accommodate. This process is called Presbyopia. People with Presbyopia need glasses to read.

From these it appears that Celsus was well acquainted with the windpipe and lungs and the heart; with the difference between the windpipe and oesophagus ( stomachus ) , which leads to the stomach ( ventriculus ); and with the shape , situation and relations of the diaphragm. He enumerates also the principal facts relating to the situation of the liver , the spleen , the kidneys and the stomach. He appears , however , to have been unaware of the distinction of duodenum or twelve-inch bowel , already admitted by Herophilus , and represents the stomach as directly connected by means of the pylorus with the jejunum or upper part of the small intestine . </shape.n.5497><shape.n.5498>A hot air balloon shaped as a birthday cake flies above the Swiss Alps resort of Chateau d'Oex 19 January 2008 at the opening day of the 30th International Ballon Festival.

Within this classification there was remarkably little stratification between ranks. Quite early in my time a Signals problem arose. The withdrawal of France separated European members north of the Alps from those in the south , yet good communications from NATO in Belgium to both elements remained essential. At the time Tropospheric Scatter links were introduced needing antenna systems using dished reflectors some eight metres in diameter to pass transmissions on over mountain ranges by an indirect path. With the French and Swiss Alps in the way , suitably high mountains had to be chosen in NATO countries north and south for the system to work.

The MAT skeleton is derived from a depth map of the patch , where each pixel value represents the distance ( in pixels ) to the nearest edge. The MAT skeleton is then produced by removing all pixels from the depth map except local maxima ( pixels with no neighbors having greater values ) . The linearity index ( LINEAR ) is based on the fact that elongated patches of a given area have MAT skeletons closer to their edges than square patches of the same area. This index reflects linear features of the patch which may not necessarily be the overall elongation of the patch. Dendritic patterns result in higher values of LINEAR due to the elongated appendages of the patch. Inflated values may also result from patches with even small interior openings since these represent edge , and the MAT skeleton will surround the openings , resulting in lower MAT values than if the openings were not present . </shape.n.5510><shape.n.5511>In the third box , lower left-hand , draw several natural shapes using only an outline.

BSS is then gently injected into the anterior chamber to fill the chamber and deepen it. Irrigation with BSS also loosens the Healon from the endothelial surface and helps to gently unfold the tissue. Because the donor tissue was folded into an asymmetric shape , the tissue invariably will spontaneously unfold in the correct orientation ( ie , endothelium down ) , as long as the chamber is deep enough and there is no impediment. As the tissue begins to unfold , an air syringe is substituted , and an air bubble is gently injected between the lips of the unfolding donor tissue to complete the unfolding.

We now give two more reasons : One is to subdivide the curve at the given parameter u. This is done by repeatedly inserting u until there is k-1 number of u in the knot vector. Accordingly , we can split the curve at u. The other reason is to convert a B-spline curve into a composite B zier curve. This is achieved by repeatedly inserting knots into the knot vector until all the interior knots have the multiplicity equal to k-1. Consequently , each span of the B-spline curve is a B zier curve of the same degree. Therefore , a composite B zier curve is a special case of a B-spline curve. Since inserting new knots also introduces additional control vertices , a composite B zier curve usually requires more control vertices than a B-spline curve does when they are used to represent the same geometric shape . </shape.n.5530><shape.n.5531>A common line of action to L2 is shown in Figure 6 as B1 , B2 , B3 or B4 for spinal shapes 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively.

Since they experience a long and narrow shape , they are very easy to paddle out to get further to the sea and the big waves and much easier to control if on contact with steep waves. The Gun s name was draws from the phrase elephant gun , which means that the board is the surfers very own gun for hunting the big and giant surfs. A good example of these would be the Keith Malloy Round Pin or the Mark Richards 6 . </shape.n.5558><shape.n.5559>Have students draw different quadrilaterals on dot paper and then compare their shapes with a partner.

However , we do find some neurons that represent active or voluntary spatial signals ( e.g. , attention , memory , motor-preparatory ) . During the sample and after the onset of the test array , some neurons in LIP demonstrate active signals that could represent a neural correlate for attention to shape , a property not previously described in visual cortex. Interestingly , the percentage of units in LIP showing task instruction effects at sample is similar to what we have reported in AIT for units recorded in the same monkeys performing the same matching tasks ( Sereno et al. 1997 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated nonspatial processing in the dorsal pathway ( Gifford and Cohen 2005; Sereno and Maunsell 1998; Sereno et al. 2002; Toth and Assad 2002; see also Cohen et al. 2004 ) .

Wing measurements were performed as detailed in Gilchrist &amp;Partridge ( 1999 ) . Briefly , wing images ( one per fly ) were captured using a compound microscope-mounted video camera. Using the OBJECT-IMAGE program ( Vischer , 1998 ) , coordinates of 10 wing landmarks were recorded and the wing area calculated based on the polygon shown in Fig. 1. From the same landmark data we also extracted the principle components ( PCs ) of shape variation for use as shape variables. PCs were computed using covariance matrices after the landmark data had undergone a Procrustes superimposition , a process of reflection , scaling ( using centroid size ) and rotation that produced a superimposition minimizing deviations from the overall mean shape. The process is described in detail in Dryden &amp;Mardia ( 1998 ) . </shape.n.5567><shape.n.5568>Regarding , 268 , the spiral-dynamic , as in a bedspring/torus or the Slinky that walks down the stairs image , versus the structural-hierarchical , ladder , a third alternative crops up : a non-progressive , changing-manifold conception of transpersonal development. Imagine a big cigar smoke ring slowly rolled out in front of the mouth. Rings of varying size can be blown through the first at varying velocities to produce , if you will , vases of varying shapes composed of the rings in relation to each other. There is no beginning or end , priority or superiority , as with either a spiral or a ladder view : a spiral Slinky always has a beginning and end of the winding flat wire and a ladder has a beginning , middle , and end.

However , the monkey is also 44 ms slower ( a nearly equal amount ) to initiate an EM on the " non-pure " shape trials compared with the pure shape trials. Even though there is an increased task difficulty on these non-pure trials , there is no accompanying increased activity during the sample period due to this increased task difficulty. So one would need to postulate multiple forms of task difficulty , and these different kinds express themselves on different trial types at different time periods. One might argue that these different task difficulties represent the different cognitive processes that are required. Task difficulty is an important variable; but there is no simple account that could explain the present findings. Future work will need to examine the effects of task difficulty independently of other variables such as attention to shape or change in attentional and motor plans . </shape.n.5569><shape.n.5570>Touyz , S.W. , Beaumont , P.J.V. , Collins , J.K. and Cowie , I.

The pre-RNA world in the next diagram shows a short strand of nucleic acids ( a nucleotide chain ) undergoing binary fission with mutation. However , it is estimated that without the assistance from the enzymes even a short strand will take too long to form with random encounters. The conceptual problem is resolved by the realization that RNA can catalyzes many of the chemical reactions essential to life.

Of more direct relevance to the experiments reported here are a number of studies of planar tactile drawings ( Kennedy et al. , 1991; Millar , 1991; Lakatos and Marks , 1998 ) .

We describe an image compositing system and user interface that allow an artist to quickly and easily create technical illustrations from a set of photographs of an object taken from the same point of view under variable lighting conditions. Our system uses a novel compositing process in which images are combined using spatially-varying light mattes , enabling the final lighting in each area of the composite to be manipulated independently. We describe an interface that provides for the painting of local lighting effects ( e.g. shadows , highlights , and tangential lighting to reveal texture ) directly onto the composite. We survey some of the techniques used in illustration and lighting design to convey the shape and features of objects and describe how our system can be used to apply these techniques . </shape.n.5581><shape.n.5582>Two independent groups126-127 recently interrogated candidate genes highlighted from animal model studies and found statistically significant associations of candidate gene SNPs with high myopia in their respective human study cohorts.

Hepatocyte growth factor is an important multifunctional cytokine , is expressed in the eye , and maps to the chromosome 7q21.1 locus of Eye1.128 The HGF5-5b tagged SNP selected for association study was found to be significantly associated with high myopia as a quantitative trait in additive , dominant , and recessive models and with high myopia considered as a dichotomous qualitative trait.

Many of the nonlinear regression models that we see built in Matlab are of the shape variety. I.e. , we see a bell shaped curve , so we fit a gaussian to it. We see a function with a lower and upper constant asymptote , and we fit some variety of logistic function , or an erf variant to it. If the fit is inadequate for our purposes , we try another functional form. I 'll argue that this group of individuals is often using nonlinear regression for the wrong reason. They simply want some curve that behaves the way they know it should. Examples of this might be a photographic film modelor , who knows the film darkens as more photons land upon it , or a biologist , who knows that the count of bacteria in a petri dish will grow with time.

One of the merits of using a NURBS curve is that various shapes such as arcs and free-form curves , can be represented by the same equation. Therefore a user can design curve meshes without taking consideration of type of curves and/or special features. However , it is difficult to interpolate the area of curve meshes smoothly with NURBS surfaces.

It 's not new information , but it leaves us with many questions and many opinions. There 's plenty of information about physical activity , but sorting through it and figuring out what to do can be challenging. Instead of answering questions , all that information only seems to generate more : " What exactly does being physically active mean ? Is this physical activity or 'exercise ? ' How much do we need versus what can we do to get by ? Do we need to do it all at once ? Is there an easy way to fit it into our day , because life is pretty hectic already ? " So many questions ... plus , almost every day , a new exercise product is introduced promising a quick fix to whip us into shape requiring only the slightest amount of effort on our part. If only that were true , we tell ourselves ... . </shape.n.5634><shape.n.5635>But why are we so fat ? It 's a question that must be explored before any viable , long-term solutions can be found. Is obesity simply a condition caused by an imbalance between calories consumed and expended through physical activity ? Or are there other underlying drivers that influence how and why our diet and physical activity levels have expanded our waistlines ? The answer is a resounding yes. The increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of our environments , along with emerging social and political trends , all play their part in contributing to an 'evolutionary ' shape change . </shape.n.5635><shape.n.5636>Duncan , M.

The sound of both words with their shared suffix , -angle , challenges their expressive communication. As we work with our project materials to construct these figures , we play with vocabulary and adopt more precise language. Kindergarteners are surprising their parents with terms such as oblong rectangle and square rectangle. An innate sense of symmetrical form guides their constructions as they select lines from our set of " Anglegs " and arrange them into triangles and rectangles. They prefer the balance in equilateral triangles and squares or isosceles triangles and oblongs. As the children grow in their understanding and observation skills , they expand their ability to identify shapes in different sizes and orientations. They begin to take on the challenge of creating triangles with three different lengths of lines . </shape.n.5637><shape.n.5638>2.

The change of shape behind the head is too sudden for the water flow to follow the bird 's body at this velocity. The water flow separates from the path that is followed at lower velocities , creates a series of eddies that tumble along the bird 's back and sides and finally are left trailing the creature. Other parts of the bird also produce separation points that contribute to the turbulent trail . </shape.n.5639><shape.n.5640>The results from a five fold stratified cross validation experiment are shown in Figure 7 ( b , c ) . The results show that using aligned shapes performs significantly better than using unaligned shapes.

However , using the raw percepts has a disadvantage that is not shown in these graphs , namely greater runtime computation and space requirements from comparisons with all of the percepts instead of a few class prototypes . </shape.n.5640><shape.n.5641>c ) Many authors agree on the significance of high curvature points for visual perception. Leyton demonstrated the Symmetry-Curvature theorem which claims that nay curve section that has only one curvature extremum has one and only one symmetric axis which terminates at the extremum itself. He developed a theory which claims that all shapes are basically circles which changed form as a result of various deformations caused by external forces. The concept of symmetry curvature was used to explain the process that deformed the object. Symmetric axes show the directions along which a deformation process most likely took place. He proposed a theory of nested structures of control which , he argues , governs the functioning of the human perceptual system . </shape.n.5641><shape.n.5642>[ 0049 ] Shaped platelets have been made as shown in patent WO 98/12265 , which discloses a method of making shaped platelets by molding. The process is not easy to use , is expensive and does not show how to add spatial or spectral makings on the platelets. Further , it is not practical to mold patterned platelets with notches or other angled shapes because of the difficulty in removing such platelets from the mold. In addition , the molding process shown does not disclose the ability to make three dimensionally shaped patterned platelets. The molding process shown also wastes a lot of expensive material increasing the cost of the molded patterned platelets . </shape.n.5642><shape.n.5643>When vector shapes are optimized , it can leave behind a number of " useless " points in the vector.

The document may include raster objects , like three-dimensional objects or image fills , or vector objects like two-dimensional text , shapes , or charts. The application program maintains the in-memory representation in an intermediate format that is neither a raster format nor a vector format. When the application program needs to render the document , the application determines whether the target device for which the document is to be rendered is a raster device or a vector device. For instance , if the document is to be rendered for a display , the target device will generally be a raster device. If the document is to be rendered for a printing device , the target device will generally be a vector device.

It was assumed rod-shaped bacteria were closely related , so the genus grouping of " Bacillus " was defined. Different types of bacilli were given species names such as Bacillus coli ( found in the gut ) , and Bacillus typhi ( causing Typhoid and now called Salmonella typhi ) and Bacillus subtilis ( found in rotting hay ) . The Gram stain showed that many types of bacilli have different cell wall structures. Today the genus Bacillus is still retained for some Gram positive microbes but other bacilli have been moved to genera such as Escherichia , Salmonella , Clostridia , etc. The term bacillus is still retained in some simple alernative names ( such as typhoid bacillus ) for rod shaped bacteria not in the Bacillus genus , strictly in reference to shape.

The ears of most vulcanoids are very distinctive in that the top of the external ear structure tapers into a clearly defined point. This is the case with the T'Khasi Vulcans and their descendants. There appears to be a clear sexual dimorphism in ear shape , with males tending to have bigger ears with more prominent points. It has long been suspected that some Vulcans cosmetically alter the shape and angle of their ear tips to conform to an aesthetic standard. This may be supported by the fact that certain societal outcasts , Vulcans who chose to live a non-technical , traditional life , and members of certain monastic groups seem to have much longer , and often curved , ear tips. The hearing of the Vulcans , and indeed that of most vulcanoids , is very acute under most conditions.

Everything starts happening when the mass of the iron core reaches 1.44 solar masses - The Chandrasekhar Limit. Compression heats the core to a point where it decays into neutrons giving off massive amounts of heat. The core collapses from half the Earth 's diameter to about 100 kilometres in a few tenths of a second and in about one further second becomes a 10 km diameter neutron star. This releases an enormous amount of potential energy primarily in the form of neutrinos which carry 99 of the energy. A shock wave is produced which passes , in two hours , through the outer layers of the star causing fusion reactions to occur. These form the heavy elements. In particular the silicon and sulphur , formed shortly before the collapse , combine to give radioactive nickel and cobalt which are responsible for the shape of the light curve after the first two weeks . </shape.n.5701><shape.n.5702>I have become much more dedicated to eating better and exercising regularly while keeping a positive attitude.

Body image refers to the mental picture individuala have of their outward appearance , including size , shape , and form. It has two major components : how the people perceive their physical appearance , and how they feel about their body. Significant distortions in self-perception can lead to intense dissatisfaction with one 's body and dysfunctional behaviors aimed at improving one 's appearance. Some patients with BDD are aware that their concerns are excessive; others do not have this degree of insight. About 50 of patients diagnosed with BDD also meet the criteria for a delusional disorder , which is characterized by beliefs that are not based in reality . </shape.n.5707><shape.n.5708>[ 0036 ] As discussed above , once in the mask edit mode represented by the state 804 , user interface controls are provided for independently positioning , sizing , and rotating the digital image 104 and the mask shape 112.

You will likely have to switch to Druid form after combat to cast spells , heal , and use buffs , and then return to Bear or Cat form when you 're ready to fight again. You will also need to learn which is the best form to fight in for each situation. Druids regenerate mana while in shape shift form. Shape shifting now breaks roots , snares , and freeze effects.

As the cartilage wears away , the bones become exposed and rub against each other , which leads to pain. The deterioration of cartilage also affects the shape and makeup of the whole joint , so that it no longer functions smoothly. You may notice a limp when you walk , or you may have trouble going up and down stairs. This deterioration puts additional stress on the joint as it moves. Other problems can occur inside the joint as cartilage breakdown affects the joint components. Fragments of bone or cartilage may float in the joint fluid , causing irritation and pain. Bony spurs or osteophytes can develop on the ends of the bones. Fluid inside the joint may not have enough of a substance called hyaluronan , which may affect the joint 's ability to absorb shock. And although inflammation is not a main symptom of osteoarthritis , it can occur in the joint lining in response to the breakdown of cartilage . </shape.n.5713><shape.n.5714>However , there is a situation where the modification of a swimmer 's shape is advantageous , the benefit being moderated by individual characteristics.

Now it is common to see female competitors make a final adjustment to breast comfort by pulling on the arm-level sides of suits immediately before mounting the starting blocks or entering the water when racing.

A single BlueSurf is well suited to a 1 3 1 sweep , all the way to an n 3 m , with full support for tangency to adjacent surfaces , and along both sections and guides. So even though the initial simple sweep is no longer appropriate , the feature tree does not need repair. Users add control to a BlueSurf by dragging planes in the section or guide directions and " dropping in " additional sections , thereby slicing the surface. The resultant slice becomes an editable guide or section input to the surface , with the resulting surface continuous across all sections and guides , including those dropped in. Using this method , control is progressively added to the surface until the required shape is achieved . </shape.n.5719><shape.n.5720>I hope the next president will use his/her first 100 days of their presidency to advocate such changes.

Studies also demonstrate that cultural and media pressures on men for the " ideal body " are the rise.

It offers techniques to allow for automatic testing of vision function through shape discrimination of dynamic images. Compared to legacy screening tools such as the Amsler Grid , computerized screening with dynamic images ensures that inconsistent points of fixation do n't result in erroneous tests. Additionally , the benefits of using a computer system to improve test repeatability , ensure proper test sequences , ensure valid results , analyze and store results , and other benefits are obtained. These dynamic image tests can include many different shapes and configurations and can operate with conventional computer displays , with binocular viewers , or with other types of computer displays. Vision function testing with dynamic images can be used for disease screening , detecting injury , and for tracking the status of disease in a test subject already diagnosed with disease or injury . </shape.n.5761><shape.n.5762>The philosophy was relatively simple.

We show that many of these concepts can be derived from a single foundation that we term the atomic form of geographic information. The familiar concepts of continuous fields and discrete objects can be derived under suitable rules applied to the properties and values of the atomic form. Fields and objects are further integrated through the concept of phase space , and in the form of field objects. A second atomic concept is introduced , termed the geo-dipole , and shown to provide a foundation for object fields , metamaps , and the association classes of object-oriented data modelling. Geographic dynamics are synthesized in a three-dimensional space defined by static or dynamic object shape , the possibility of movement , and the possibility of dynamic internal structure. The atomic form also provides a tentative argument that discrete objects and continuous fields are the only possible bases for geographic representation . </shape.n.5769><shape.n.5770>DLA is a statistical growth process that progresses much like Eden growth , but the addition of sites occurs with the highest probability where the gradient of a substance that is diffusing toward the existing cluster is greatest. The sites with the highest gradients tend to occur at the sharpest and outermost points of the cluster , thus leading to the unstable and rapid growth of these points. A dendritic structure results that has been suggested as model of growth for healthy arteries. Unlike cellular automata and Eden growth , DLA is considered a global model as opposed to a local model. Whereas the probability of growth depends on the local gradient , the gradient itself is determined by the patterns of diffusion around the entire cluster that arise from the shape of the cluster as a whole. Growth therefore exhibits long-range correlation , an important characteristic in a structure that may approximate global optimization for transport of metabolic materials. The fractal dimension of a DLA cluster as a whole is known to be about 1.71 in a plane with a minimum path dimension of 1.00 ( 69 , 70 ) . </shape.n.5770><shape.n.5771>The referent object is not the same as the basis for labeling.

NATO 's technical arm , the NATO Consultation , Command , and Control Agency ( NC3A ) , moved quickly to implement Cronos , a wide-area network based on Windows NT Server 4.0. NC3A got what it needed : an infrastructure that is secure , robust , and easy to use and administer for 5 , 000 soldiers and staff under SHAPE command.

We noticed that in the course of the experiment , both individual cells and the entire epithelial islands seemed to condense ( Figures 1B and 3 ) . The confocal analysis of Z sections indicated that the apparent condensation was in fact largely due to a change of cell shape from flattened to more cuboidal. Additionally , the well-ordered cell monolayer became more irregular , with the appearance of several cell layers. This process was under way as early as 12 h after addition of TGF- and became especially marked at 24 36 h of treatment , when some of the original islets rounded up into compact balls and nearly or completely detached from the culture plate. Quite unexpectedly , these structures , containing cells deprived of anchorage , did not die : within the next hours they reattached and spread on the culture dish ( Figure 3 and Supplementary Fig 3videoA ) . Interestingly , the continuous presence of TGF- was not required for this response : a 2 h pulse with 5 ng/ml the cytokine was sufficient to elicit the changes of cells ' adhesion ( not shown ) . </shape.n.5793><shape.n.5794>The paintings of Sasa Pancic are no exception.

Other band spectra ( half-octave , third octave , etc. ) are also used.

If the level is defined per unit bandwidth ( hz ) rather than some form of octave basis , the apparent drop in any given unit bandwidth will be that much greater , and in general there will be an increasing drop of 3 db/octave at increasing frequencies. Of course , if , instead of merely converting , the measurements were retaken using narrower band analysis , the overall shape of the spectrum would very likely be considerably modified since there is no reason , in general , why the power in a given frequency band should be uniformly distributed throughout the band.

Although the majority of this fluid loss is temporary , some of it is permanent , resulting in an average height loss of 1 " to 2 " over the course of a lifetime. Loss of height impacts flexibility and mobility , and can actually result in a larger waistline !

As discussed on the Global Interpolation page , an interpolating curve may wiggle through all data points rather than following the data polygon closely. The approximation technique is introduced to overcome this problem by relaxing the strict requirement that the curve must contain all data points. Except for the first and last data points , the curve does not have to contain any other point. To measure how well a curve can " approximate " the given data polygon , the concept of error distance is used. The error distance is the distance between a data point and its " corresponding " point on the curve. Thus , if the sum of these error distances is minimized , the curve should follow the shape of the data polygon closely. An interpolating curve is certainly such a solution because the error distance of each data point is zero. However , the formulation to be discussed is unlikely to get an interpolating curve. A curve obtained this way is referred to as an approximation curve . </shape.n.5833><shape.n.5834>Crown Making- This lesson is to help students learn about using geometric shapes , overlapping , repetition , and paper sculpture.

If all three curvatures could be controlled during all phases of construction , the Dome would not only be stable upon completion , but each stage would be stable enough to be a platform from which the next stage would be built.

Our results show that this immediate , rough impression probably depends on recognizing just one or more individual parts of what we see. Fine discriminations - such as recognizing individual faces - take longer to happen , and our study suggests that this delay depends upon emerging signals for combinations of shape fragments. In a sense , the brain has to construct an internal representation of an object from disparate pieces . </shape.n.5887><shape.n.5888>5.

Given this , some young women may be dissatisfied with being overweight ( although have appropriate WHR ) , whereas others may be of normal body weight but dissatisfied with their shape , and finally there are those who are dissatisfied with both body weight and shape ( Singh , 1994 ) . Sorting women on these parameters may be critical for developing effective intervention techniques. A recent study by Hefferman , Harper , and McWilliam ( 2002 ) showed that women remain dissatisfied with their body image after they have lost weight by dieting but have high WHR. As WHR is a proportional measure , weight loss up to 16 pounds does not change it; to obtain ideal WHR , one has to exercise. By paying attention to body shape ( WHR ) , it may be fully possible to understand why some young women , in spite of being normal or underweight , insist on losing weight and are preoccupied with body weight reduction ( see Davis &amp;Cerullo , 1996 ) . </shape.n.5891><shape.n.5892>While laser light can damage eyesight it has become a tool used to fix vision problems.

One way that takes shape is our inability to grasp the many-sided truth of any individual thing or matter. We tend to know one or a few sides of an issue and believe that is the full truth. This limited knowledge , this Ignorance of the whole is rooted in the exclusive nature of Mind , which tends to embrace one view of a thing and avoid all others. That exclusivity is in turn supported by the seperative nature of Ego , which divides us from others and the world , and therefore the integral , multi-dimensional truth of things. However , when we move to a higher consciousness , we break these bonds , move away from Ignorance , exclusivity , and separativeness , and embrace the multi-sided view; i.e. the integral truth off any issue. In that way , we not only have the knowledge to make right decisions that result in powerfully , positive outcomes , but we evolve out of our current limited nature , and begin to embrace a Supernature . </shape.n.5922><shape.n.5923>Estimates for basic Rectangular pools can be given over the phone by our Customer Service Department.

Each partition rectangle has a different set of plates available for magnitude measurement. Also , each plate has a narrow , roughly rectangular strip along each edge , where the image is grossly fainter; if this part is used at all , magnitude calibration must be different there , so this amounts basically to a separate plate. If magnitude calibration is imperfect , the ratio " q " will be more uniform within one ( up to 6.5 deg long , but usually narrow ) " partition rectangle " , than between rectangles.

Digital shapes are digital representations of either physically existing objects or virtual objects that can be processed by computer applications. Digital shapes occur and are used in many different environments such as : Industrial Design ( e.g. , CAD models of products , laser-scanned prototypes ) , Medical Applications ( e.g. , tomography or X-rays ) , Entertainment ( e.g. , computer animations , virtual actors ) , Personal Environments ( e.g. , pictures or videos ) , Geographical Information Systems ( e.g. , maps or three-dimensional models of terrains ) , and many more. The concept of digital shape therefore encompasses all instances of objects which can be represented in a digital context , irrespectively of their format , use , dimension , provided that they have a geometric nature , that is , they are primarily characterised by their form or spatial extent . </shape.n.5958><shape.n.5959>He must discover that he is in reality " hid with Christ in God " , - that he is lost in the Universal LIFE of God.

( The same is true mutatis mutandis of the concept water : if there were such a thing , it would be identical with the natural kind. ) But a concept is not a part of the spatio-temporal world. A concept is a mode of presentation of a property. The concepts closed figure of uniform curvature and closed shape whose peripheral points are equidistant from a given point pick out the same property that of being a circle even though they are different concepts. ( The two concepts have the same referent the property of circularity but different senses. Better , they are different senses. ) But an individual e.g. Socrates is not a mode of presentation. To say otherwise would be sheer nonsense. The natural kind water is not a mode of presentation. So there is no such thing as the concept of Socrates or the concept of water : for spatio-temporal individuals and kinds are not modes of presentations of properties and are therefore not concepts . </shape.n.5962><shape.n.5963>30 minutes ( or more ! ) of movement for adults and 60 minutes for kids on most days can help keep you in shape and feeling good.

Consider the following example. It is well known that practical knowledge interferes with seeing in artistic contexts. Adults in beginning drawing classes , when asked to draw , for instance , a chair from a side view just below their line of sight , have a tendency to elevate their point of view. One explanation of these phenomena is that they draw it as if they were looking down at it from a higher perspective in order to resolve discrepancies between perceptual foreshortening and their canonical concept of the shape of the chair. One can argue , as a result that the content of their visual experience is an interpolation between what they " see " and what they know. They see , in a sense , what they expect to. This can be corrected by showing them their error and giving them a new framework with which to conceive the visual structure of scenes.

This hypothesis would predict a smaller effect of training on fMRI maps or LFP signals than on spiking activity. Further investigations with multiple methods of these input/output relationships and how they change as a consequence of experience might help illuminate a fundamental question : What is the functional significance of the spatial organization of shape selectivity in IT cortex ?

In their language all nouns denote objects and have singular and plural forms. The nouns we translate as nouns of the second group ( substances ) do not refer to bodies which have no shape and size , but rather to one where these characteristics are not indicated , where they are ignored in the process of abstraction just as the concept of ''stone'' does not indicate shape and the concept of ''sphere'' does not indicate size . </shape.n.6029><shape.n.6030>The galaxy consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of gas , dust and stars forming four distinct arm structures spiralling outward in a logarithmic spiral shape ( see Spiral arms ) . The mass distribution within the galaxy closely resembles the Sbc Hubble classification , which is a spiral galaxy with relatively loosely-wound arms. [ 20 ] Astronomers first began to suspect that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy , rather than an ordinary spiral galaxy , in the 1990s [ 21 ] . Their suspicions were confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope observations in 2005 [ 22 ] which showed the galaxy 's central bar to be larger than previously suspected . </shape.n.6030><shape.n.6031>Overview : Spatial sense is developed when students recognize , draw , construct , visualize , compare , classify and transform geometric shapes in both two and three dimensions. They learn to identify those characteristics that are necessary to define a given shape , and they can differentiate one shape from another. Students also develop an awareness of the properties of a shape and of the relationships among shapes. This includes hierarchical classification of shapes ( e.g. , all squares are rhombuses ) , relationships among components of a shape ( e.g. , opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel ) , symmetries of a shape , congruence and similarity . </shape.n.6031><shape.n.6032>The pivot of the shape ' s transform , about which the scale and rotation occur.

It is obtained when the structures are sampled with equal probability using the disector , i.e. , the objects are selected according to their number regardless of their size and shape , and their volume is estimated. Once the structures are sampled number-weighted , their mean volume may be estimated with three fundamentally different methods : </shape.n.6034><shape.n.6035>So , hey , I 'm happy to say that GameSpite Quarterly 4 is taking shape nicely.

Although they did sometimes have many cards in their hands ( and on the table -- they both spontaneously developed a strategy of organizing the cards in their hands in piles below the square cards ) they never appeared to become overloaded cognitively. Still , I felt this was the biggest flaw in the game -- it is simply in-elegant to play with so many cards ! The last modification I made to the rules was to allow players to trade in cards. Since it was often more strategic to get rid of shape cards one could n't use to win the currently displayed square cards , players tended to trade cards in and keep their hand sizes down. This added an additional element of strategy to the game , however , since a card that is turned in might be needed after the next shape set is won. For this reason I decided that the recycle pile should not be shuffled. Players who could exercise their visual memory by recalling where certain shapes were in the pile would have a strategic advantage . </shape.n.6036><shape.n.6037>In DrawML shapes may have one or more hook positions.

In this work , we present two different level set based variational models to capture a typical class of illusory contours such as Kanizsa triangle. The first model is based on the relative locations between illusory contours and objects as well as known shape information of the contours. The second approach uses curvature information via Euler 's elastica to complete missing boundaries. We follow this up with a short summary of our current work on disocclusion using prior shape information . </shape.n.6038><shape.n.6039>These two more " mentalist " views diverge in that for Chomsky , ALL you need to do is study the potentials , which have a very indirect relation to use -- and language use itself can essentially be ignored. Langacker , on the other hand , insists that the linguistic potentials , the possible productions of language , must be studied in co-occurrence with their use. There is no sharp dividing line between a speaker 's knowledge of language and his or her use of it , according to Langacker and others. They feed each other , in that the speaker 's system of language produces the productions , and the productions , of the individual AND all of the members of the speech community in turn shape the system -- fairly quickly in the process of language acquisition where there is no system there to start with , and more slowly as the connections are made and entrenched via use of the system in production and comprehension . </shape.n.6039><shape.n.6040>Although the initiation of rock mass caving can begin with block ravelling , the mechanical action involved in breaking and mobilizing the rock mass ( Figure 29 ) is difficult to quantify or predict with accuracy. Rock masses with blocks of similar shapes , smaller sizes with low surface friction , and shallow angle discontinuities are likely in areas of low confining stresses to block cave. These and many other factors readily make it difficult for a rock mass to breakdown during and after mining extraction . </shape.n.6040><shape.n.6041>Scientists ascertained that the specific body shapes are : the android shape , or apple shape , common among men ( fat deposits on the middle section of the body , mostly on the abdomen ) and the gynoid , or pear shape , more common among women ( fat deposited on hips and bottom ) .

This method has been used in characterizing the transport capabilities of Golgi cisternae in baby hamster kidney cells ( 122 , 123 ) . In the case of cells in suspension , a known number of cells are Millipore-filtered or centrifuged to make a pellet of defined shape so its volume can be measured ( 124 , 125 ) .

Although it is commonly assumed that early ontogenetic stages are more conservative than those that follow later , diversity actually drops when these fishes move from juvenile stages to adults. This increase in juvenile diversity is the result of a highly modified juvenile shape in one of the lineages included in the study. ( Fink 1996 ) Another factor being studied by today 's Systematicians is how these developmental pathways evolved. Thus giving rise to the diversity and evolution of body shapes seen in piranhas today . </shape.n.6045><shape.n.6046>The " Fight of Your Life " is like a championship prize fight.

During the course of this cycle , as her hormone levels change , a female experiences changes is the size , shape , and color of her genital skin. As circulating estrogens increase during the follicular phase of the cycle , the size of the swelling increases. When the anogenital skin is fully engorged , it is typically bright pink , and can measure from 938 to 1400 cc. The state of maximal tumescence is of variable length in different individuals and at different stages of maturity , but lasts an average of 6.5 days. It is during this time that females are sexually receptive and that the bulk of copulations with mature males occur.

Operators noted shapes and movements on their displays during clear-sky conditions , such as expanding ring-like shapes and long finger-like formations that did not correspond to weather events. The current United States National Weather Service weather-surveillance radars known as WSR-88D or NEXRAD ( NEXt-Generation RADar ) have been used extensively for studying bird migration on a larger geographic scale ( Gauthreaux and Belser 1992; Gauthreaux and Belser 1998; Russell and Gauthreaux 1998; Diehl and Larkin 2005 ) . Nocturnal and diurnal exodus flights ( large-scale departure of groups of migrating birds from a roost ) , overwater migrations , arrival times , and selection of roost sites can be examined using images produced from the first 0.5 elevation scan ( base reflectivity ) . Flights of large groups that occur along migration routes can be monitored , and thus long-term studies to examine changes in the intensity and scope of migration are possible. Insect migrations are also detectable in NEXRAD images ( Westbrook and Isard 1999 ) . Westbrook et al. ( 1998 ) were able to confirm that NEXRAD echoes were due to migrating corn earworm moths ( Helicoverpa zea ) by using additional 3 cm radar that revealed the orientation and size of the targets . </shape.n.6050><shape.n.6051>Beauty and attractiveness are much linked to body shape and condition.

Usually , the best indication is size - males grow larger than females in all crocodilian species , and so a very large individual is more likely to be a male. In some species , females may have narrower snouts , and a more slender body , but such traits are highly unreliable indicators of sex. In larger crocodilians , the shape of the vent can provide a guide to the animal 's sex. Females tend to have smaller , narrower and flatter vents ( Fig. 9.1 ) whereas males have larger , wider , and more convex vents ( Fig. 9.2 ) . This difference is due to the increased elasticity of the vent in males necessary to allow eversion of the penis during copulation. However , the differences visible in these pictures are rarely so clear-cut. There 's only one realistic way to be 100 certain - looking inside the vent . </shape.n.6057><shape.n.6058>" I should not be surprised , " said Cortlandt , " if we saw another waterfall to-morrow , though not in the shape of rain.

Landolt-Cs are presented on a monitor in one of eight orientations. The subject presses one of eight buttons , which are spatially arranged on a response box according to the eight possible positions of the Landolt-Cs ' gap. To estimate the acuity threshold , a best PEST ( best Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing ) procedure is used in which a psychometric function having a constant slope on a logarithmic acuity scale is assumed. Measurement terminates after a fixed number of trials. With computer monitors , pixel-discreteness artifacts limit the presentation of small stimuli. By using anti-aliasing , i.e. , smoothing of contours by multiple gray levels , the spatial resolution was improved by a factor of four. Thus , even the shape of small Landolt-Cs with oblique gaps is adequate and visual acuities from 5/80 ( 0.06 ) up to 5/1.4 ( 3.6 ) can be tested at a distance of 5 m . </shape.n.6071><shape.n.6072>Novel object experiment " after " a 3-month time interval with shape discrimination training ( 28 and 33 time series in monkey J and M , respectively ) .

Leaching is relatively slow from large chunks with a low surface areatovolume ratio. Small concrete pieces and/or a high surface areatovolume ratio produce a fast release. Rather than explicitly considering every potential geometry in a leaching model , our approach approximated concrete rubble by a distribution of equivalent one-dimensional slab geometries. The size and shape variations of rubble were characterized through a combination of physical measurement and photographic image analysis. Each size classification was simulated separately to show the effect on flux. The individual flux results were then blended in proportion to the thickness distribution to produce a composite flux . </shape.n.6098><shape.n.6099>The turntable is an integral part of the electronics box and essentially replaces its front wall ( Fig. 9 ) .

I showed that the definition of the critical temperature should be based not only on the criterion of average error at different temperatures of the short runs , but also on the shape of the error-versus-iteration curve for each temperature tested , and the slope of curve of number of accepted models as a function of temperature. Critical temperature is the temperature where the error-versus-iteration curve changes from an incoherent and fluctuating pattern at higher temperatures to a more or less monotonically decreasing one; the average error at that temperature is expected to be , but not necessarily is , the lowest; there is a sudden drop in the average error and number of accepted models at that temperature . </shape.n.6125><shape.n.6126>There are numerous ways to enlarge your breast and keep them in proper shape.

Most pellets are subspherical , but many are bean or sausage shaped , depending mainly on the shape of the nucleus. The upper parts of some limestone beds of the osagite limestone facies contain up to 70 percent of pellets in a microcrystalline matrix. These textures have been called osagites. They grade downward to rock that contains fewer irregularly shaped Osagia bodies than the osagites proper. Bun-shaped , concentrically laminated , calcareous algal mounds ( Pl. 6A ) are associated with osagite at one locality. South of Manhattan , Kansas , the Howe Limestone is typical of the osagite limestone facies in the Red Eagle cyclothem. This is similar to the Type a Osagia facies defined by Imbrie and others ( 1959 , p. 72 ) . The facies is judged to represent warm , almost hyperhaline water and deposition at depths only a few feet below low-tide level , under turbulence and circulation conditions as suggested by Imbrie and others ( 1959 ) . </shape.n.6157><shape.n.6158>" It was a white light with a little bit of orange inside of it.

An Inescutcheon is a smaller escutcheon borne within a larger escutcheon. The term crest is often used incorrectly to designate this part of the coat of arms. The term " escutcheon " also refers to the shield-like shape on which arms are often borne. The escutcheon shape is based on the Medieval shields that were used by knights in combat. Since this shape has been regarded as a war-like device appropriate to men only , ladies customarily bear their arms upon a lozenge , or diamond-shape , while clergymen bear theirs on a cartouche , or oval.

Solving navigational tasks , however , requires to integrate these different research directions , to be able to reason about various spatial entities like paths , shapes of objects , and complex configurations of potentially extended objects. From the theoretical perspective , spatial reasoning for navigation required the adaptation of traditional binary constraint reasoning techniques to algebras of ternary relations needed to express relative position information.

Perception involves connecting the various sensory properties into an object and seeing the object as the causal nexus of those properties. Look around you. You do not see patches of color.

The normalized trial density distribution itself follows from the equation of state , and is used as the source term in Poisson 's equation to determine the gravitational potential. For a rotation law in which the angular velocity depends only on the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation , the total potential and its equipotential surfaces can then be evaluated and used in solving the stellar structure equations. This step yields updated temperature and pressure distributions , and allows the process to be restarted and continued to convergence. When self-consistency of the normalized temperature and pressure profiles has been attained , the corresponding central values are adjusted in order to bring them closer to the physical conditions at the center of the final equilibrium configuration. The entire procedure is then begun again and repeated until an acceptable level of agreement between the current and previous central values has been obtained . </shape.n.6208><shape.n.6209>Flap gate : A gate hinged along one edge , usually either the top or bottom edge.

First , geometric holes can be robustly identified from noisy and defective data sets without the need for any normal or orientation information. The geometry and texture information of the holes can then be determined either automatically from the models ' context , or interactively from users ' selection. We use local parameterizations to align patches in order to extract their curvature-driven digital signature. After identifying the patch that most resembles each hole region , the geometry and texture information can be completed by warping the candidate region and gluing it onto the hole area. The displacement vector field for the exact alignment process is computed by solving a Poisson equation with boundary conditions. Our experiments show that the unified framework , founded upon the techniques of deformable models , local parameterization , and PDE modeling , can provide a robust and elegant solution for content completion of defective , complex point surfaces . </shape.n.6210><shape.n.6211>Every VRML node has an associated type name that defines the formal name for the node Box , Fog , Shape , and so forth.

When a node receives an event , it reacts accordingly by changing its state , which might trigger additional events. Nodes can change the state of objects in the scene by sending events.

Typically these methods introduce a local smoothing of edges due to a length minimization or minimization of a related energy. These methods have a tendency to smooth corners , which can be undesirable for tasks that involve identifying man-made objects with sharp corners. We introduce a new method , based on image snakes , in which the local geometry of the curve is incorporated into the dynamics in a nonlinear way. Our method brings ideas from image denoising and simplification of high contrast images - in which piecewise linear shapes are preserved - to the task of image segmentation. Specifically we introduce a new geometrically intrinsic dynamic equation for the snake , which depends on the local curvature of the moving contour , designed in such a way that corners are much less penalized than for more classical segmentation methods. We will discuss further extensions that allow segmentation based on geometric shape priors . </shape.n.6225><shape.n.6226>The forearm has the shape of a somewhat flattened cone , being large above and small below.

Compared with the monophasic shape , subjects with the biphasic shape were characterized by younger age and a lower BMI , WHR , fasting glucose , glucoseAUC during the OGTT , HbA1c , and insulin concentrations and higher insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. These findings are somewhat self-fulfilling because both increased early insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are destined to cause a more efficient disposal of the oral glucose load and result in a faster return of glucose concentrations to baseline this is essentially what , by definition , happens in the biphasic group. We therefore developed the adjusted ( for glucoseAUC ) shape index , which permitted separation of the shape from the above relations.

Catalyst shape searching is shape similarity searching. That is , a shape query defines a volume in space that is the union of a set of spheres. During a search , each candidate molecule is converted to a similar volume. The two volumes are aligned , and their intersection and union is approximated. The similarity of the shape query to the molecule is computed as the volume of the intersection divided by the volume of the union of the aligned shapes. It should be clear that this is not shape containment searching. Depending on the similarity tolerance that is set , a hit may have more or less volume that protrudes from the shape. The result of this fuzziness is a very robust form of searching. When using a mixed query ( see " Aligning a shape to features within a query " ) , excluded volumes may be added to the query to eliminate hits with protrusions in undesirable locations . </shape.n.6308><shape.n.6309>SHAPE now entered one of the most remarkable periods in modern European history.

The metal-rich group , which is much smaller in size , is concentrated toward both the center and the Galactic plane , and its shape can be very roughly described as an ellipsoid of revolution flattened along the Z coordinate. The envelope of its XY projection forms a circle 7 kpc in radius , and the envelope of the YZ projection forms an ellipse with a Z semimajor axis of 3 kpc.

This method includes changing the shape of spectacle lenses , changing the vertex distances with contact lenses , creating a weak telescope system with contact lenses and spectacles , and changing the power of one of the spectacle lenses. Computer software , such as the Aniseikonia Inspector , has been developed to determine the prescription needed to correct for a certain degree of aniseikonia. The problem with correction through optical means is that the optics do not vary with field angle and thus can not compensate for non-uniform macropsia.

White blood cells are placed in the appropriate category based on the appearance they have when stained. There are some white blood cells that have granules within their cytoplasm. These are known as granular leukocytes. Agranular leukocytes are the white blood cells with granules so tiny that they can barely be seen under a high powered microscope , or not seen at all. Granular leukocytes are oddly shaped and can often be recognized in this fashion. Their shape comes from the offset condition of the nuclei which are distorted into lobes attached by slight strands. Thus granular leukocytes are additionally classified as polymorphonuclear leukocytes . </shape.n.6334><shape.n.6335>Left-click on a shape to display the handles.

This difference in shape can be traced to the high-frequency , aliasing portion of the spectrum. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , a smooth curve fit to the foveal data describes the peripheral data only for frequencies below the resolution limit. Beyond the resolution limit , peripheral contrast sensitivity is significantly higher than predicted from the scaled foveal curve.

Previous studies have observed patches in IT cortex with strong selectivity for highly familiar object classes ( e.g. , faces ) , but the principles behind this functional organization are largely unknown due to the many properties that distinguish different object classes. To unconfound shape from meaning and memory , we scanned monkeys with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed classes of initially novel objects. Our data revealed a topography of selectivity for these novel object classes across IT cortex. We found that this selectivity topography was highly reproducible and remarkably stable across a 3-month interval during which monkeys were extensively trained to discriminate among exemplars within one of the object classes. Furthermore , this selectivity topography was largely unaffected by changes in behavioral task and object retinal position , both of which preserve shape. In contrast , it was strongly influenced by changes in object shape. The topography was partially related to , but not explained by , the previously described pattern of face selectivity. Together , these results suggest that IT cortex contains a large-scale map of shape that is largely independent of meaning , familiarity , and behavioral task . </shape.n.6338><shape.n.6339>The movement of the spikes in the fluid is controlled on the surface by adjusting the power of the electromagnet.

Moreover , certain parts of our unconscious self-model , such as the immune system and the elementary bioregulatory processes in the upper brain stem and the hypothalamus , are continuously active. Another candidate for an important aspect of the unconscious self-model , a representation of global properties of the body , is the body schema.

Although the Ring Nebula , at overall magnitude + 8.8 , is an easy object for small telescopes , even large instruments struggle to reveal the magnitude + 15.3 central star. The nebula is toroidal in shape and is seen almost end-on. It was formed about 5500 years ago and lies at a distance of 4100 l.y. The Ring Nebula was discovered by the French astronomer Antoine Darquier ( 1718-1802 ) in 1779 January . </shape.n.6441><shape.n.6442>^ Gannon , James ( 2002 ) .

Teddy reacts in a culturally standard " masculine " pattern , and we recognize the typical pride of the skilled worker in his insistence on his standards of quality. Yet Teddy 's experience is complex and exclusively his own - empirically we know nothing about his specific version of a life history as a boy and an adolescent , his relations to father , mother , brothers and sisters , to peer groups and colleagues. In this context it suffices to know that such relations lend their energy and specific shape to his experience.

The shapefile format ( promulgated by ESRI ) stores non-topological geometry and attribute information for the spatial features in a data set. Shapefiles typically contain data related to coastlines , political boundaries , state or county boundaries , climate zones , roads , rivers , topography , etc. The geometry of each spatial feature or 'shape ' is stored as a set of vector coordinates. Shapes can be points , lines , or polygons ( areas ) . An ESRI shapefile actually consists of three files : a main file ( *.shp ) , an index file ( *.shx ) , and a dBASE file ( *.dbf ) . The main file describes a set of shapes with a list of their vertices. The index file contains offsets pointing to the locations of each shape in the main file. The dBASE file contains attribute data for each shape in the main file.

The present study was aimed at minimizing or compensating for a number of important low-level factors : visibility , positional uncertainty and abnormalities in shape discrimination. Our results show that there are significant abnormalities in both strabismic and anisometropic amblyopes ( but more markedly in those with strabismus ) that can not simply be attributed to these low level factors.

To take from psychoanalysis the concepts of drive and libido without talking about what happens later to the child 's systems of self-perception is to drop out the deepest level at which phallocentric society asserts its power : the sexed family as it imprints itself on the child 's sense of herself as a sexed being . </shape.n.6512><shape.n.6513>One challenge to this view of cognition is its implication for abstract concepts. It 's one thing to say that the concept HAMMER involves the activation of circuits related to hand shape; it 's quite another to identify significant modal-specific representations underlying such concepts as TRUTH , DEMOCRACY , ENTROPY , and NINETEEN ( Adams &amp;Campbell 1999 , Brewer 1999 ) . Logical concepts are also a challenge. Prinz suggests as a perceptual basis for the concept of disjunction that it is based on feelings of hesitation. However , his more considered view seems to be that logical concepts are best understood as operations , not representations. The resulting theory is one in which thoughts lack logical form. The trouble is that this makes it difficult to see how to distinguish logically equivalent thoughts. A related problem is that , since composition for Prinz does not yield structurally complex representations , there seems to be nothing to distinguish the type of contents associated with judgements ( propositional contents ) from those associated lists or even single concepts ( for related discussion Fodor &amp;Pylyshyn 1988 ) . </shape.n.6513><shape.n.6514>3.

From the results we can conclude the following. The form factor ( area / 4 pi perimeter2 ) is a good feature , but it deteriorates fast when the image quality decreases. The third harmonic of a Fourier contour description is very robust against this , but it strongly depends on object size. Other features like the roundness and aspect ratio perform less good. We also apply a direct measurement of the ratio b/a. This feature gives the best overall result and is to be preferred for AgX shape measurements on digitised optical microscopy images . </shape.n.6516><shape.n.6517>Initial development of the digital collections focused on Classic Period ( A. D. 1250 1450 ) pre-Columbian Hohokam ceramic vessels from central Arizona housed at the Archeological Research Institute at ASU. These vessels have simple , undecorated surfaces , and their analysis focuses on shape and symmetry. The level of symmetry has been a research focus as it relates to the skill of the potter and may be related to the level of time devoted to craft as a community develops and evolves over time. Since even the best hand-made pots are asymmetric , the traditional measure of symmetry , the profile curve , can vary dramatically depending on the orientation of the vessel. Multiple photographs used to create a QuickTime view of the vessel would assist researchers in visual analysis , but not in more detailed measurement. By scanning and creating a 3D model of the vessel , researchers can perform detailed , objective analysis of the shape and symmetry using tools to compare local and overall curvature , inflection points ( changes in curvature from convex to concave ) , corner points , and calculated measures such as surface area . </shape.n.6517><shape.n.6518>If doctors could find a way of stopping the testes from producing MIF in a foetus known to have CAIS ( and we would like them to do so ) then you would have an XY woman with a uterus and vagina who would be able to carry a child following egg donation and IVF. Her situation would then be not far removed from that of the XY woman with Swyer 's syndrome ( XY gonadal dysgenesis ) in whom the gonads never really developed at all ( into either testes or ovaries ) so no foetal testicular hormones at all were produced , either to curtail Mullerian development or to promote masculinization. Women with Swyer 's syndrome illustrate perfectly the fact that a female body shape with female external genitalia , vagina and uterus , is the basic body form for all mankind. For maleness to be superimposed requires the active intervention of male hormones on the developing foetus , and at puberty. If this can not happen then the default biological route is to produce a girl baby . </shape.n.6518><shape.n.6519>Now let us assume that we cut the cable between the camera and the television set.

We have to agree that certain 'photon frequencies ' for 'green ' ( measured in 'nano meters ' ) will be responsible , for the 'electromagnetic impulse ' of green in the cable and hence a certain 'pattern ' on the screen of the oscilloscope. If we now would learn how to interpret the pattern on the screen , we could immediately say 'this is green ' - or rather this is the impulse for green.

To get a sense of what this view amounts to , it is helpful to start with an analogy. Computers are sometimes characterized as operating by manipulating sentences in " machine language " in accordance with certain rules. Consider a simplified description of what happens as one enters numbers into a spreadsheet. Inputs from the keyboard cause the computer , depending on the programs it is running and its internal state , to instantiate or " token " a sentence ( in machine language ) with the content ( translated into English ) of , for example , " numerical value 4 in cell A1 " . In accordance with certain rules , the machine then displays the shape " 4 " in a certain location on the monitor , and perhaps , if it is implementing the rule " the values of column B are to be twice the values of column A " , it tokens the sentence " numerical value 8 in cell B1 " and displays the shape " 8 " in another location on the monitor . </shape.n.6524><shape.n.6525>Once you ' ve painted a color shape in a vector paint operator , you can open its property editor to change its attributes.

Other artists take these illusions of positive and negative images to even greater lengths , hiding images within images. Perception of form and shape are conditioned by our ingrained " instinct " to impute meaning and order to visual data. When we look at an image and initially form an impression , there is a tendency to latch on to that conclusion about its meaning , and then ignore other possible solutions.

In November , Guy Co  me , the Minister of the Defense , acknowledged the existence of a Belgium " stay-behind " army , lifting concerns about a similar implication in terrorist acts as in Italy.

One basic argument for this view is that retinal or other sensory information is a mixture of information both about the properties of objects , such as their shape or color , and also information about various relevant aspectual conditions , such as ambient lighting , or the angle at which a surface is viewed. Thus perception of the color or shape of an object is achieved only after a decoding operation in which the intermixed object-related versus aspectual information components are separated out , but both components persist in normal perception , such as when one simultaneously sees both the circular shape of a disc , and also the aspectual elliptical shape it has because of the perspective in which one is viewing it . </shape.n.6588><shape.n.6589>Below you see what happens when the center node is converted to a symmetricnode.

A higher endogenous gibberellin content was found in apple fruitlets grown at higher altitudes ( Eccher T. , 1986 ); besides , relative proportion of irradiance in violet-UV and in red-IR wavebands were found to be higher at higher altitude ( Eccher T. , 1990 ) . Supposing therefore that light quality could play a role in the synthesis or in the activation of endogenous GAs , a research was carried out by modifying natural light spectrum.

Several varieties of imaginative preceptual experience may be taken to fill in the continuum between these extremes : mistaken or illusive perceptions ( imagining , for instance , that the bush seen indistinctly in the darkness is a bear ) , and various types of non-deceptive seeing as or seeing in ( such as imagining a cloud to have the shape of a camel , weasel , or whale; seeing someone 's sadness in their eyes; or " seeing " the notorious duck-rabbit figure as a duck [ or rabbit ] ) . </shape.n.6604><shape.n.6605>To access the weight of a shape clip through an explorer , navigate to the model level of your character , then navigate to the Mixer &gt; Tracks &gt; Shape &gt; Mixer_Shape_Track &gt; Clip list &gt; Clipname &gt; Instanced Action &gt; weight.

From the point of view of special relativity alone , speaking of " the shape of the universe ( at a point in time ) " is ontologically naive because of the issue of relativity of simultaneity : you can not speak of different points in space being " at the same point in time " , thus you can not speak of " the shape of the universe at some point in time " .

However , many neurons in parietal cortex that represent remembered locations were active irrespective of whether the animal remembered shape or location. Our findings suggest that many neurons in this region contribute to a more reflexive or automatic process. Nevertheless , in agreement with previous studies , we do find that the delay period activity of some units in LIP reflects a more active process. Specifically , we show for the first time , under highly controlled conditions the following : 1 ) neurophysiological evidence that the delay period activity of some neurons in LIP represents what the animal is actively attending , remembering , planning , or deciding; and 2 ) neurophysiological evidence that the responses of some neurons in LIP are modulated when the animal attends to shape providing the first neurophysiological evidence for shape-selective attentional mechanisms in visual cortex . </shape.n.6617><shape.n.6618>Figs. 12 ( a ) -12 ( d ) also illustrate the qualitative correlation of the eight features with radiologists ' experience and the overlap of malignant and benign clusters reflects the similarities in radiographic appearance of malignant and benign clusters commonly experienced by radiologists.

In Fig. 12 ( a ) , benign clusters tend to be smaller and rounder whereas malignant clusters tend to be larger and irregular in shape. This corresponds to the clinical observation where benign microcalcifications associated with adenosis form tight clusters , but malignant ductal microcalcifications are often more directional and diffused. In Fig. 12 ( b ) , benign clusters tend to have fewer and smaller microcalcifications compared to malignant clusters; clinically , punctate and " lobular " calcifications are often benign. In Fig. 12 ( c ) , malignant microcalcifications tend to have larger variations in size; clinically , pleomorphism is used to describe some malignant microcalcifications.

Thus , behaviorism is a theory that still has basic applicability in both its theories and methods. However , it needs somewhat of a reconstruction in order to continue to be beneficial to the world of psychology as a great theory of personality ( Zuriff , 1986 ) .

The tissue ( that is being over stretched ) can become so over stressed that it can tear , again , a condition that might require stitching to rectify. But the damage to the skin tissue itself ( in the form of long skin tears ) can hinder the ability of the skin to re-heal uniformly or even allow it to stretch to larger gauges without further damage. A stretched piercing is less likely to heal back to its original shape if it has been over-stretched , stretched to a large diameter like 12/14mm and above. This does depend on the original dimensions of the skin that was stretched . </shape.n.6655><shape.n.6656>FIGURE 38.

A positive curvature corresponds to the inverse square radius of curvature; an example is a sphere or hypersphere. An example of negatively curved space is hyperbolic geometry. A space or space-time without curvature ( formally , with zero curvature ) is called flat. For example , Euclidean space is an example of a flat space , and Minkowski space is an example of a flat space-time. There are other examples of flat geometries in both settings , though. A torus or a cylinder can both be given flat metrics , but differ in their topology. Other topologies are also possible for curved space.

The literature demonstrates that orienting the subcutaneous tunnel laterally and caudally in relation to the intraperitoneal entry site significantly reduces the risk of peritonitis associated with exit-site or tunnel infection. It is reasonable to think that installing a straight catheter in an arcuate tunnel would increase the risk of migration of the intraperitoneal segment , as well as the risk of external cuff extrusion resulting from the pushing force exerted by the catheter 's resilience ( shape memory ) . To mitigate this problem , a catheter with an inverted U-shaped permanent bend between the two cuffs ( the so-called swan neck catheter ) was developed. The advantage of this device is that it can follow the shape of the subcutaneous route in an unstressed state.78 , 79 It is also available with an additional curvature of 90 at the intraperitoneal entry site , so that it can be oriented parallel to the abdominal wall . </shape.n.6671><shape.n.6672>After you have finished this lab , you are free to decide to use another environment.

We can derive a measure of crowding for our observers by comparing their line letter acuity to their isolated letter acuity ( Table 1 ) . Specifically we express both acuities as minimum angle of resolution ( in minutes of arc ) and take their ratio as a crowding index . For our observers this index varies from 1 ( no crowding ) to 2.5. Crowding likely does , at least in part , account for the effects of noise on global shape discrimination. For example , in Fig. 5 ( which isolates the effect of noise on global shape discrimination ) , JT shows the largest effect of noise and has the largest crowding index while SC show the smallest effect of noise and the least crowding. Thus it is tempting to speculate that both the crowding and the effect of noise on global shape discrimination might be due to abnormal pooling of information at a second stage of beyond the intial filtering stage ( Levi et al. , 2002; Hariharan , Levi &amp;Klein , 2005 ) . However , after compensating for abnormities in global shape discrimination , crowding plays very little role in global contour integration ( Fig 11 , middle panel ) . </shape.n.6680><shape.n.6681>There 's a lot of nonsensical mumbo-jumbo about phi in the article.

In this space of fingerprints , there exists a group operation carrying every shape into any other shape , while preserving the metric distance when operating on each pair of shapes.

Skeleton of the shape is considered as a free tree and is represented by a connectivity graph. Geometric features of the shape are captured using Radius function along the skeletal curve segments. Matching of the connectivity graphs based on their topologies and geometric features gives a distance measure for determining similarity or dissimilarity of the shapes. Then the distance measure is used for clustering and classification of the shapes by employing hierarchical clustering methods. Moreover , for each class , a median skeleton is computed and is located as the indicator of its related class. The resulted hierarchy of the shapes classes and their indicators are used for the task of shape recognition. This is performed for any given shape by a top-down traversing of the resulted hierarchy and matching with the indicators.

While medial axis regularization usually aims at dealing with its sensitivity in the context of applications such as recognition , we use it here to smooth shape. The approach overcomes a basic drawback with current smoothing techniques , namely , the rounding of perceptually salient corners. The key idea is that the instability of the skeleton under a family of deformations can be dealt with via a symmetry transform which is applied to all related symmetry branches so as to effect an appropriate change in the shape. This leads to the notion of a splice transform which removes a branch coupled with simultaneous changes in the skeleton. In contrast to point-based pruning techniques which use local salience and which can not construct coarse-scale corners , our approach constructs and preserves coarse-scale curvature extrema , leading to a " scale-discrete scale-space " for shape. The approach is also applicable to the smoothing of incomplete shapes represented as a set of curve segments . </shape.n.6740><shape.n.6741>nautical : The geometric center of gravity of the immersed volume of the displacement or of the displaced water , determined solely by the shape of the underwater body of the ship.

Then it is important to grasp and control the whole characteristic of shape , and macroscopic shape-information is desired as a new design index. In past study , we found that curvature entropy represents the whole characteristic in a curve profile at the product level. However , there were some cases that curvature entropy defined without continuity of curve does n't adapt cognitive process. Therefore , we proposed quadratic curvature entropy by modeling continuity of curve with Markov processes. As a result , quadratic curvature entropy represents the whole characteristic of shape in the simple curve profile and the automobile side view. Thus , it is indicated that quadratic curvature entropy is a useful design index for controlling the whole characteristic of shape and the shape-generation system with it is to be realized.

To demonstrate that the female body shape is judged attractive due to its reliable link that men would have sought out in ancestral populations , it is essential to establish that this shape has a plausible linkage to physiological mechanisms regulating reproductive capability and good health.

They want to build up an image of success through an attractive appearance and try to distribute the concept of beauty to the people. If we want to be successful and popular , we must have a so-called charming look just like the models in the magazines. The media would sometimes use ugly or fat people in their advertisements , but always in a negative and miserable way. As we can see that only the obese and hideous people are teased , bullied and repulsed by others in the movies. They always have a lower status and suffer an unpleasant life in the film.

Decidual cast have also been reported in non-pregnant women as a side effect with the use of human menopausal gonadotrophin ( HMG ) , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( HCG ) and progestogens . It is uncommon to see a decidual cast with the use of standard dose combined oral contraceptive pill.

Genetic variation is the result of mutations , recombinations and alterations in the karyotype ( the number , shape , size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes ) . Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous , but large effects are very rare. In the past , most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However , recent research suggests that many mutations in non-coding DNA do have slight deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism , estimates from data in humans have found that a majority of mutations are slightly deleterious . </shape.n.6828><shape.n.6829>A ( non-authoritative ) diagram of heritage of the Unix operating system.

There are two sub-worlds in the mental world of eternity. One is the sub-world of heavenly loves arranged in a variety of numberless societies , each having the geographic shape of the human body. The entire collection of heavenly societies is also arranged in the form of the human body and is called the Grand Human.

The data analyses include macroanalysis ( e.g. , path length , percent of movement on interior or exterior of environment ) , microanalysis [ e.g. , quantification of individual behaviors such as turning , rearing , sniffing; ( 50 ) ] , and characterization of path shape [ e.g. , predictable vs unpredictable ( 51 ) ] .

These overlay curves allow you to dynamically smooth the surface using our Move and Ooch Point commands. Although ProSurf can display the true , smooth curvature curves , we find that these simple , polyline curvature curve approximations ( one polyline point per edit point ) work best for most situations. Turning on multiple curvature curves at once allows you to make sure that all rows have the same curvature shape. If you are shaping a surface with more than a few rows or columns , these row/col curvature curves are an absolute necessity if you want complete control over the shape of the surface. Other programs may provide automatic smoothing tools , but they come only at the expense of the loss of detailed shape control. You should not let these smoothing tools control the shape of your design . </shape.n.6841><shape.n.6842>The current version is more robust than the module available up to Spring 2002.

There is also less need for posterior error correction now , as the current module filters out some potentially problematic shapes at the point of import , and so , will always insert incoming data into the final map. If a map fails to build because of topological errors , the problem can be tracked down using v.digit and fixed.

The sibyl finial is surrounded with four motifs from " Maternal affection , The Domestic Employment , Family School ( ? ) " series all designed by Lady Elizabeth Templeton ( 1747-1823 ) . The fourth motif is of shepherd and lambs. The body of the teapot has two classical female figures within niches , somewhat reminiscent of the revived Gothic style of arcaded moulding , foliate decoration around spout terminal and handle area.

" A major step toward understanding resides in appreciation of the full significance of Pascal 's Law : that the pressure at any point in a fluid is the same in all directions. The usual formal " proof " of this idea is given by examining the static equilibrium of a small volume of fluid , for example , one having a parallelepiped shape and triangular cross section. This treatment is so abstract that , even if it is presented , very few students assimilate its physical implications. Many introductory courses now eschew such treatments entirely in order to save time for other subjects.

In the consciousness of other members of the same tribe it also had the shape of circles concentric circles , the huts being inscribed in the internal circle , while the external circle stood for cleared ground bounded by forest. Thus , in the consciousness of members of the same tribe , depending on their affiliation to one half of the tribe or the other , changes even the structure of the settlement , although both structures go back to a common archetype , rooted in social consciousness a circle.

And different people appear differently due to numerous factors such as body shape , clothing , skin color , and hair. In this paper , we introduce a multi-cue tracking technique that uses prior information about the 2-D image shape of people in general along with an appearance model that is learned on-line for a specific individual. Assuming a static camera , the background is modeled and updated on-line. Rather than performing thresholding and blob detection during tracking , a foreground probability map ( FPM ) is computed which indicates the likelihood that a pixel is not the projection of the background. Off-line , a shape model of walking people is estimated from the FPMs computed from training sequences. During tracking , this generic prior model of human shape is used for person detection and to initialize a tracking process. As this prior model is very generic , a model of an individual 's appearance is learned on-line during the tracking. As the person is tracked through a sequence using both shape and appearance , the appearance model is refined and multi-cue tracking becomes more robust . </shape.n.6901><shape.n.6902>Giuseppe Buttazzo , Paola Trebeschi. the role of monotonicity in some shape optimization problems.

Octants were most commonly used for measuring the altitude of the sun above the horizon in order to determine a ship 's latitude.

Shepard and Metzler have found that the reaction time was proportional to the degree of rotation which is required to bring the two objects into a similar position. These results were taken as proof that in solving the problem , the subjects mentally rotated representations of three-dimensional objects , and that imagined rotations corresponded to actual physical rotations of objects : " Imagined rotations and physical transformations exhibit corresponding dynamic characteristics and are governed by the same laws of motion.

There is also a question about which axes we ' re talking about. Since the space occupied by the glabellar data in the PC space is far away from the origin of the coordinate system it makes little sense to model forms/shapes along the system axes sensu stricto.

Expected intensities of light scattered by bacteria of a given mass , shape , and orientation were obtained from computer programs ( 37 ) based on Rayleigh-Gans theory. To verify the formulations , calculations for spherical particles were compared with those based on the more complete but complex Mie theory ( 34 ) as programmed by Tsay and Stephens ( 63 ) , since the Mie theory is not easily applied to nonspherical particles. Input for all programs included an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and a forward light scatter collection angle of 0.5 to 20 . Error from signals excluded by the beam blocker bar was assumed to be minimal ( 37 ) .

The data set of 35 , 050 measured wings from 701 recombinant isogenic lines is 35 larger than the data set for chromosome 3 ( WEBER et al. 1999 ) . Moreover , the variance among line means with the same marker genotype is 40 lower for chromosome 2 than it was for chromosome 3 , probably due to improved consistency among measurement technicians. The increases in accuracy and number of measurements and the high density of markers ( 110 cM/47 markers ) permit a resolution of effects that is powerful for this type of study. The outlines of the system of polygenic shape control are revealed.

Assemblages are characterized by flakes made by preparing the core; there were many shapes and sizes of these artifacts. The characteristic tools are made on flakes produced by a developed Levalloisian technique , including slender unifacial and bifacial lances or spear points for stabbing or throwing. In the final stages of the Middle Stone Age , known as the South African Magosian , microlithic elements appear. Middle Stone Age assemblages are associated with anatomically modern Homo sapiens in southern Africa. People continued to live in open camps , while rock overhangs also were used for shelter. Middle Stone Age bands hunted medium-size and large prey. Sometimes they collected tortoises and ostrich eggs in large quantities , as well as seabirds and marine mammals that could be found along the shore. The rich archaeological deposits of Klasies River Mouth Cave preserve the earliest evidence in the world for the use of shellfish as a food source . </shape.n.6932><shape.n.6933>Cadigan 's future of a self existing independently of the ( sexed ) body is only one of several envisioned by science fiction writers. Also intriguing are the worlds in Octavia Butler 's books. In Wild Seed ( 1980 ) , Butler describes a conflict between a shape-changing protagonist , Anyanwu , and her body-inhabiting opponent , Doro. Although the former is referred to as a " she , " and the latter a " he , " neither is tied to a biologically sexed body. Anyanwu can take on the shape of man , or of another species , as easily as that of a woman ( although she notes that as a man she can father only female children; an interesting re/vision of parthenogenesis ); Doro kills and then inhabits the bodies of both men and women. The characters ' personas exhibit characteristics we associate with traditional gender roles -- Anyanwu as a nurturing and protective being , Doro as calculating and pragmatic. But by placing these characteristics outside of a fixed physical body , Butler separates them from gender as currently constructed . </shape.n.6933><shape.n.6934>Points 2-4 also provide interesting points of contact between Simon 's notion of artificial , and the notion of artifact that comes out of cultural-historical theory. Artifacts are , in some respects models. Their structures carry within them , so to speak , a " theory " of both the human who is using it and the range of environmental circumstances in which it will be normatively used. Every axe and hammer , for example , embodies such a theory in its length , its shape , its size , its weight as a synthesized ensemble that satisfices the constraints of the human user and the task at hand. At the same time artifacts are transformers , enabling the metamorphoses of what we refer to as external into internal and vice versa. Because they enter intimately into human goal directed action , there is a functional aspect to all artifact-mediated action. And for the same reasons artifacts embody values ( oughts , shoulds , and musts ); in this sense all culturally mediated action is , at least implicitly , moral action . </shape.n.6934><shape.n.6935>This is the essential starting point for incorporating Swedenborg 's religious behaviorism into scientific psychology.

These factors likewise allow for better light scattering and thus better color in oil and better dry hide. Flatting efficiency is generally inferior to that of platy talcs.

The body clearly exists as a substance because it differentiates one individual human being from another. But the body 's shape is more than the sum of its parts because it moves together on its own power as an integral whole , requiring a form united with matter.

While we have tools for viewing digital shapes even in much unspecialised web contexts ( e.g. browser plug-ins like SVG or VRML for 3D shapes ) , we miss tools for interacting with the semantics of digital shapes. It is not possible , for example , to search digital shapes by their semantic meaning. This is partly due to the lack of methods for the automatic extraction of the semantic content of digital shapes ( semantic annotation ) and partly to the evolution of research on shape modelling which had to be highly focused , in the past years , on the geometric aspects of shapes. The shift from a purely geometric to a semantic-aware level of representation of digital shapes is the ultimate scientific objective of AIM SHAPE. For the next generation of semantic-enabled systems and services , we foresee a generation of shape models in which knowledge/semantics is explicitly represented and , therefore , can be effectively retrieved , shared , exploited , and used to construct new knowledge . </shape.n.6982><shape.n.6983>There are lots of suggestions on how to figure out your shape.

Consider how an artist represents things using a paint and canvas. Her medium and the perspective from which she views the object place certain constraints on her representations. Yet her medium is neutral with respect to the representation of certain properties of the object. While the type of canvas and paint determine the texture of the representation and that it will be two dimensional , they impose no important constraints on the two dimensional geometric shape placed upon the canvas. In particular , it is just as easy to paint a circle on the canvas as it is to paint a square. The medium is neutral with respect to these properties. Therefore , the geometrical shape of the representation , whether it is square or round , reflects the object and not the medium of representation. It is objective. Even though the representation is in a certain medium and from a certain perspective , all of its properties need not be determined by that perspective or medium. Some of them may be objective and really reflect the object . </shape.n.7023><shape.n.7024> Move the points on the middle row to match up the shapes of all of the column k-curves.

The remediated self basically begins with a notion of self as summative and re/configurable ( like William James ' empirical self ( 233 ) ) rather than rigid or authentic. Remediated self gives way to ( at least ) two variations of self : immersed and interrelated/interconnected. These selves correspond to the poles of remediation; the immersed experiences the visually mediated as transparent and immediate; the interrelated/interconnected self experiences the visually mediated as opaque and navigable ( 232 ) . According to B &amp;G , we experience ourselves in both ways. This connects up with expressive activity , too. Virtual reality ( where the user moves through ) fits with romantic selfhood , while opacity and ubiquitous computing are akin to the fixed-subject self of the Enlightenment. The clearer part of this first chapter in section three -- " The Remediated Self " -- builds on the duality of self as object and subject in the specific case of bodybuilding.

It is common to classify bones according to their shapes , i.e. long , short , flat or irregular , but with little reference to use. Long bones are those found particularly in the limbs where they act as the central supports and levers; i.e. the bones of the thigh , leg , upper and lower arms and also , on a smaller scale , in the hands and fingers , feet and toes. Short bones are found making up the complex of bones at the wrist ( carpals ) and the hind foot ( tarsals ) . Flat bones are found in the skull as well as the plate-like scapulae and part of the pelvis ( iliac bones ) while the vertebrae are examples of irregular bones.

It works on the principle of double reflection , like the octant ( q.v. ) , to measure the angular distance between two bodies by bringing the reflected image of one object alongside that of the other viewed directly. Typical measurements with a sextant would include the altitudes of celestial bodies such as the sun and moon above the horizon , and the angular separation of different celestial or terrestrial bodies ( e.g. in surveying ) . Because the instrument works by double reflection , it can measure angles up to about 120 degrees. The marine sextant was developed in about 1757 by Captain John Campbell with the help of the London instrument maker , John Bird. During trials of the lunar distance method for determining longitude at sea , Campbell first worked with a reflecting circle developed by the German astronomer , Tobias Mayer. Finding this rather cumbersome , Campbell suggested the sextant as a more manageable alternative. Following its introduction , the sextant became one of the principal instruments used on ships for celestial navigation . </shape.n.7062><shape.n.7063>The highest leaders in an organization ( e.g. the commander-in-chief and senior officers of the military ) English &gt; shape : 11 senses &gt; noun 8 , cognition </shape.n.7063><shape.n.7064>The GrADS shapefile interface also allows the user to discover the contents of a shapefile.

In 2000 the two effects are about six months out of synch , and tending to oppose and cancel. Hence the 2000 dates of first visibility tend to agree very well between Southern Africa and Northern Africa/Mideast. The supposition of similar crescent visibility conditions holding for most lunar calendar observers in a restricted longitude zone has been invoked by Ilyas ( 1994 ) to suggest a compromise three-longitude-zone global lunar calendar , as a start toward a Unified World Islamic Calendar , in place of the proliferation of lunar calendars occurring under the present multi-domain system.

We may relax the constraint to require only the continuity of the tangent directions at the joint , which is known as the first-order geometric continuity.

Exploring concepts in a number of different contexts helps students to generalize , as does using nonexamples as well as examples. Students are extending their understanding of cause and effect and their ability to make conjectures. They are particularly interested in " Why ? " Questions such as " Why are most rooms shaped like rectangles ? " offer interesting points of departure for studying geometric concepts.

I continued until July of 1954 - about 3 1/2 years - before I came back to the States. The physical arrangements were interesting : When we first started , the headquarters and all of the offices were in the Hotel Astoria , which was on Rue De Presburg , which circulates around the Etoile where the Arc De Triomphe is located. We had our offices in various bedrooms. They put plywood over the tub so you would have a desk space and put file cabinets in the bathrooms , closets and everywhere else , so it was a very improvised system. That was what we were working with until about August or September of 1951 , when the permanent location out in Rocqencourt near Versailles was completed and the headquarters was transferred out there . </shape.n.7118><shape.n.7119>1.

The presented program is designed for the processing of geological models with four seismic layers , separated by the plane and dipping interface. Furthermore , the thickness of each layer must be sufficient so that each layer be recognized in the travel time data , preferably as a first arrival. The program allows the optional choice to processing seismic data for two , three , or four layers. After the introduction of intercept times obtained by projecting the observed segment of the travel time curve back to the shot point and of velocities determined on the basis of the curve slope , the program will allow calculation of the refraction interface depth under the shooting points. The intercept method is recommended when the seismic interface is of a small depth down to 25 m and has a nearly plane shape . </shape.n.7133><shape.n.7134>ziggurat.

In practice , In particular , you will learn data fitting with B-spline curves , i.e. , the construction of a B-spline curve that fits a given set of geometric data such points and derivative vectors. If the resulting curve is required to pass through every data point , then the fitting process is known as interpolation. If the curve does not necessarily passes through every point but approximates them , the fitting process is known as approximation. The most commonly used approximation method is the least squares approximation. Due to the scope of this book , we shall not go into detail about interpolation and approximation algorithms used in CAGD applications.

This paper proposes a novel feature-based invariant descriptor termed Radon composite features ( RCFs ) for planar shapes. Instead of analyzing shapes directly in the spatial domain , some shape features are extracted from the Radon transform plane using statistical and spectral analysis. The proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of existing shape representation techniques since it accomplishes the invariances to common geometrical transformations without any normalization process , which usually causes inaccuracies. A novel hierarchical strategy with RCFs can achieve low complexity and coarse-to-fine retrieval , and perform accurately when retrieving shapes , while remaining robust against variations. Experiments demonstrate that RCF provides a higher degree of discrimination as compared with several state-of-the-art approaches . </shape.n.7150><shape.n.7151>Drag a shape from a stencil into your chart or click on a shape in a stencil.

The system incorporates multiple feature vectors , relevance feedback , and query by example and browsing , flexible definition of shape similarity , and efficient execution through multiple dimensional indexing and clustering. In order to offer more information for a user to determine similarity of 3D engineering shape , a 3D interface that allows users to manipulate shapes is proposed and implemented to present the search results. The system allows users to specify which feature vectors should be used to perform the search. The system is used to conduct extensive experimentation with real data to test the effectiveness of various feature vectors for shape the first such comparison of this type. The test results show that the descending order of the average precision of feature vectors is : principle moments , moment invariants , geometric parameters , and eigenvalues. In addition , a multistep similarity search strategy is proposed and tested in this paper to improve the effectiveness of 3D engineering shapes search. It is shown that the multistep approach is more effective than the one-shot search approach , when a fixed number of shapes are retrieved . </shape.n.7152><shape.n.7153>According to classic accounts of sense data , if you see a red tomato , you see it in virtue of becoming directly aware of a mental item -- the sense datum -- which is literally red , has a bulgy shape , and so on.

The greater the level of flexibility the greater the ROM will be. An individuals level of flexibility is dependant on the structure of the joint , the shape of the bones , the tightness of the muscles , tendons and ligaments. The level of flexibility varies from joint to joint ( e.g. an individual may be flexible in the knee joint but not the shoulder joint ) . Generally as we get older are level of flexibility decreases. We can improve are level of flexibility by performing stretching exercises. This involves gently stretching the joint until you can fill a stretch in the muscle , and holding the stretch for 10-20secs , then relaxing the muscle . </shape.n.7182><shape.n.7183>Gen.

One possible reason for this discrepancy is that the standard hemodynamic shape used in the z-score analysis was different from the actual hemodynamic response measured in the midline areas. In the majority of the groups , the measured impulse response function was noisier in these areas ( res ) ( Table 1 ) , and hence it is possible that the regressor used in the analysis did not correlate as well with the shape of the time series in those voxels and thus did not identify those voxels as significantly active ( these areas do appear at a lower statistical threshold in the z-score analysis ) . However , the more robust percentage-area-under-the-curve score analysis that can accommodate voxelwise differences in hemodynamic shape ( by being capable of fitting a different gamma-variate function to each voxel ) was able to detect activations in these areas. For this reason , the regions of interest for the analyses were taken from the percentage-area-under-the-curve score AND map . </shape.n.7185><shape.n.7186>A rectangle is the simplest but perhaps the most common shape in design and illustration.

One major problem many hypotheses regarding the neural correlate of consciousness ( NCC ) face is what we might call the why question : _why _would this particular neural feature , rather than another , correlate with consciousness ? The purpose of the present paper is to develop an NCC hypothesis that answers this question. The proposed hypothesis is inspired by the Cross-Order Integration ( COI ) theory of consciousness , according to which consciousness arises from the functional integration of a first-order representation of an external stimulus and ( ... ) a second-order representation of that first-order representation. The proposal comes in two steps. The first step concerns the general shape of the NCC and can be directly derived from COI theory. The second step is a concrete hypothesis that can be arrived at by combining the general shape with empirical considerations.

When running , QTimeLine generates values between 0 and 1 by calling valueForTime ( ) and emitting valueChanged ( ) . By default , valueForTime ( ) applies an interpolation algorithm to generate these value. You can choose from a set of predefined timeline algorithms by calling setCurveShape ( ) .

The ascending and descending nodes ( point where the spacecraft crosses the equatorial plane ) are on this line. The orbital plane is given by its inclination i to the equatorial plane and by the angle between the vernal equinox and the line of nodes called Right ascension of the ascending node . The location of the curve in the orbital plane is given by the argument of perigee which is angle between the line of nodes and the line of apsides. The shape of the curve is characterized by the eccentricity e and by the semi-major axis a. The sixth element gives the location of the spacecraft on the orbit. It can be the true anomaly or the time since the last perigee t. Figure 4.6 shows these angles and the location of the orbital plane.

First , while we recorded across all of FEF ( 45B , 8Ad , 8Av ) , patterns of afferent projections ( Schall et al. 1995b ) as well as patterns of fMRI activation ( Sereno et al. 2002 ) suggest that shape selectivity may be localized in certain subregions. We indeed observed some clustering of shape-selective neurons in both physiology and fMRI. Specifically , our results suggest that the location of FEF shape selectivity lies at the dorsal/ventral position of the arcuate that is congruent with the posterior end of the principal sulcus ( see Figs. 1 , 11 , and 12 ) . A second possible factor that could lead to an underestimate of shape selectivity is that , at later stages of visual processing , shape-selective neurons may have preferences tuned along more complex dimensions than the simple patterns used here ( Hegde and Van Essen 2007; Tsao et al. 2006 ) . The excellent response to the complex object , surface , and face stimuli used in the fMRI portion of this study supports this notion . </shape.n.7259><shape.n.7260>Walter Beisinger , a physical education teacher at Horace Mann , a private school in the Bronx , N.Y. , goes out of his way to see that kids like Susan are not neglected.

Of the ethmoid , which he omits at first , he afterwards speaks more at large in another treatise. The malar he notices under the name of zygomatic bone; and he describes at length the upper maxillary and nasal bones , and the connexion of the former with the sphenoid. He gives the first clear account of the number and situation of the vertebrae , which he divides into cervical , dorsal and lumbar , and distinguishes from the sacrum and coccyx. Under the head Bones of the Thorax , he enumerates the sternum , the ribs ( ai irXevpai ) , and the dorsal vertebrae , the connexion of which with the former he designates. as a variety of diarthrosis.

By allowing also isometric ( or near-isometric ) deformations like bending , the intrinsic geometry of the object will stay the same , while subparts might be located at very different positions in space. This definition uses the fact that , Geodesics ( curves measured along the surface of the object ) stay the same , independent of the isometric Embedding. This means that the distance from a finger to a toe of a person measured along the body is always the same , no matter how the body is posed . </shape.n.7278><shape.n.7279>At the Tabernacle ( an open air wooden tent that seats 1000 ) she had key supporters seated behind her on the stage , hence she was essentially speaking in a theater in the round.

They check each other s work. The students then make a 3- or 4- sided shape on their geoboard and give it to a partner and the partner copies their shape.

Consistent with units with increased responses to the sample presentation showing an enhanced response during the shape task , these units with suppressed responses showed a greater suppression of response during the shape task. This is similar to the pattern reported above for the delay period , where some of the units with significantly greater responses in the shape-matching task during the delay period were units with sustained suppressive responses in the contralateral visual field. Such units with suppressed responses in the contralateral visual field during the sample period suggest that the distribution of negative selectivity indices ( Fig. 8D , blue highlighted part of range ) and the population histogram of units with significantly greater response during the location task ( Fig. 8E ) is more difficult to interpret . </shape.n.7324><shape.n.7325>F.

The absence of augmented filling rate in patients with depressed LV systolic function probably reflects underlying myocyte abnormalities. In general , chronic mitral regurgitation causes a decrease in LV systolic contractile function but an increase in early diastolic function ( as evidenced by an increase in early diastolic filling rate and a decrease in chamber stiffness ) .222 , 224 The reduced chamber stiffness may be the result of altered ventricular geometry ( more spherical or less eccentric shape ); this shape change can exacerbate the degree of mitral regurgitation by distorting annular dimensions and dislocating the papillary muscles.221 , 225 Although the LV chamber stiffness is less owing to the change in geometry , the LV myocardium may be stiffer owing to myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis.221 , 222 </shape.n.7346><shape.n.7347>In case there is still lingering doubt about our evolutionary past , further supporting evidences can be found in many of our ailments that can be traced back to the shark and even microbe.

Designers have thought of clever approaches to dealing with Indian scripts by identifying a minimal set of primitive shapes from which the required shape for any syllable could be constructed. For Indian scripts , the basic set of consonant vowel combinations can be easily accommodated through a minimal set of basic shapes involving only the vowels , consonants and the matras. When we write text in our languages , we can in fact build the required shape of the syllable from these but writing conventions are such that for almost all the scripts ( except Tamil ) many syllables have independent shapes. It is very likely that as writing systems evolved in India , the syllables which did occur more frequently got special shapes assigned to them.

Despite their phylogenetic differences , the components of Asian ( Elephas maximus ) and African ( Loxodonta africana ) elephants feet are remarkably similar. The major differences are the shape of the rear foot and the number of phalanges and toenails. This is not to say that the feet of the two species are the same. The differences in their wild habitats and the more common occurrence of foot lesions in captive Asian elephants suggest that the biology of the two species ' feet are quite different.

This is referred to as thelarche. By the widely used Tanner staging of puberty , this is stage 2 of breast development ( stage 1 is a flat , prepubertal breast ) . Within 6-12 months , the swelling has clearly begun in both sides , softened , and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months ( stage 4 ) , the breasts are approaching mature size and shape , with areolae and papillae forming a secondary mound.

Second , it allowed us to test our hypothesis that the PHC is hierarchically organized , with spatially bound stimuli eliciting greater activity in the posterior portions of the PHC and nonspatial but nonetheless contextually associative stimuli evoking greater activity in the anterior PHC. By using novel shapes , we maximized the distinction between spatial and nonspatial targets. In general , the stimuli used here may be seen as highly impoverished versions of real-word contexts and scenes. By deliberately avoiding the richness of realistic scenes , however , we have minimized the chances of confounds that might stem from sources such as background information , individual experience , and so on , allowing us to concentrate on the specific questions that emerged from our proposal regarding the role of the PHC in spatial and nonspatial contextual processing . </shape.n.7406><shape.n.7407>Singh , D.

For a very small change in the edit point position , there is a large change in shape in the curvature curve. The magnification or sensitivity of the curvature curve can also be increased or decreased at any time. As you move/drag the edit point , the curvature curve gets dynamically recalculated and redrawn. This technique is very important for fairing surface rows and columns.

The stent skeleton is constructed from a single strand of nitinol wire formed into a sinusoidal shape and wound in helical fashion around the PTFE tube. The device is deployed from hub to tip by releasing a single restraining suture line ( 19 ) . There is minimal foreshortening of the stent on deployment. The Hemobahn Endoprosthesis is available in diameters ranging from 6 mm to 13 mm and lengths of 50 mm , 100 mm , and 150 mm. There is no 12-mm stent and the 10- , 11- , and 13-mm stents are not available in the 150-mm length. Recommended introducer sheath sizes range from 8 F to 14 F and the system is compatible with a 0.025-inch guide wire.

This notion can be illustrated in the following way. Suppose I am looking at a circular object , say a coin on my desk , which is tilted away from me. The appearance of this object as it presents to me is dependent upon the point of view from which I see it. And I see the object as being circular and as being tilted away from me. But let us specify the appearance of the object without mentioning the fact that it seems to be tilted away from me , that is , without any reference to its outward distance and orientation in my visual field. The apparent shape of this object then looks elliptical.

Thus , each of the components of the multimodal cognitive state supports its characteristic form of inference . </shape.n.7507><shape.n.7508>points. The results emphasize two egocentric strategies : grid and perimeter-to-center . The first strategy consists in exploring the boundaries to identify the shape , size , and key features of the area around the perimeter and then the inside of it.

All three boundary types divergent , convergent and transform are prone to earthquake activity. Plate tectonics causes the lithospheric plates to move. As you might imagine , having giant slabs of lithosphere moving about on a spherical shape is not smooth. When stresses build , they first cause the rocks to bend elastically. If the stresses persist , energy continues to build in the rocks. When the stresses are greater than the internal strength of the rocks , the rocks snap. Although they return to their original shape , the stresses cause the rocks to move to a new position. This movement releases the energy that was stored in the rocks , which creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or maybe as much as a few meters. This description of how earthquakes occur is called elastic rebound theory . </shape.n.7510><shape.n.7511>The main thing to know about modern guitar construction is that the plates are domed. They hold their domed shape because the bottoms of the braces are domed to the correct arch , and when the braces are glued to the plate it ( the plate ) is placed into a dished workboard. Clamping pressure bends the thin plate to conform to the shape of the dish and when the glue dries on the braces the dish stays domed . </shape.n.7511><shape.n.7512>What about body shape ? Typically , there are three different types of body shapes : Mesomorph which is represented by large bones and well-defined muscular shape. Typically the mesomorph has a V-shape or wedge shape which starts off thicker at the shoulders and narrows to a smaller waistline. The mesomorph is always in good shape. Endomorph which is typically rounder , shorter , plumper and softer battles weight gain daily. Usually , the endomorph holds a portion of their weight in their abdominal area giving them an apple shape. Lastly , the ectomorph. The ectomorph is usually seen as fragile and delicate with small bones and joints. The ectomorph usually appears taller than they really are because they are so thin and they constantly struggle to maintain their weight . </shape.n.7512><shape.n.7513>One characteristic that does n't vary much from one tree to another is the way components of the tree , the larger and smaller branches and twigs , reflect the shape of the entire tree; a computer programmer would recognize the tree as a " recursive structure " ( because the same pattern " recurs " at both the top and bottom levels of organization ) .

Mutations that result in amino acid substitutions can change the shape of a protein , potentially changing or eliminating its function. This can lead to inadequacies in biochemical pathways or interfere with the process of development. Organisms are sufficiently integrated that most random changes will not produce a fitness benefit. Only a very small percentage of mutations are beneficial. The ratio of neutral to deleterious to beneficial mutations is unknown and probably varies with respect to details of the locus in question and environment . </shape.n.7520><shape.n.7521>[ 0173 ] FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating the operations of associating metrics with display attributes of shapes representing items in the system of FIG. 1 , or other systems for displaying a plurality of associated items in a collaborative environment.

During FWB casting , the casting board was placed horizontally on the electronic balance and filled with prepared liquid dental plaster. Each participant was instructed to stand upright with all weight placed on the casting foot. The noncasting foot was flexed up and bore no weight. The line of progression of the foot being cast was pointing forward. The casting foot alignment was examined by placing one arm of the goniometer parallel to the line of progression and the other arm parallel to the perpendicular line of the heel centers that were drawn on the ground. The electronic balance was continuously inspected in order to ensure that all weight was placed on the casting foot until the dental plaster was fully hardened . </shape.n.7526><shape.n.7527>Our shape matching research aims to devise new algorithms for whole and partial shape matching which both accurately reflect human similarity judgements , and overcome the computational limitations of current techniques. A framework for so-called ' parametric search ' recently developed by us ( Oostrum and Veltkamp 2002 ) makes geometric optimization much easier. Particular attention will be given to devising novel techniques for directly matching sets of shape elements rather than individual components , as this should allow us to tackle both problems together. We shall also investigate the effectiveness of matching based on boundary regions ( such as the neighbourhood of corners ) known to be of particular perceptual significance. Our initial approach to partial shape matching will be to develop techniques for curve matching using Hausdorff and Fr chet distances restricted to only part of the curve , and we expect to develop new measures of our own later in the project. As a first filtering step , we will use feature-based matching and matching using shock-graphs ( Kimia et al. 1995 ) , so that the number of more complex computations is reduced . </shape.n.7527><shape.n.7528>A path is described using the concept of a current point.

The aim of the research is to recognize the vital specifications representing for a national style by comparing two different countries together. By using Quantification Theory Type III and Cluster analysis , firstly , the analyses were undergone separately for Japanese and then Vietnamese product data in succession so that a view of general direction for each country was caught. The result showing a difference in scale of " Complexity " and " Specification " axis between Japan and Vietnam leads to performance of the analysis done on combine database of the two countries to get a clearer view of correlation between them. However , the biggest difference between the two countries lies in " Form " ( Geometric-Organic ) axis.

At this site enzymes called DNA polymerases move along each of the separated DNA strands , adding nucleotides to the exposed bases according to the base pairing rules. The ribose-phosphate bonds form between the new nucleotides to hold the new strand together. The synthesis acquires energy via the removal of two phosphates from the triphosphate. The process continues until the original double helix is completely unwound and two new double helices have been formed. Each new double helix is composed of one old DNA strand and one new strand. This is described as semi-conservative replication. ( See Figure 11-20. ) There is a small variation for the processing on the other strand and is lagging behind the leading strand. The polymerase on the lagging strand adds bases to one section of the strand at one place , jumps ahead to add bases to a different section of the lagging strand. Then it may jump behind to add more.

Molten metal poured into a concavity will solidify into a corresponding shape. The concavity has only to be given the shape of the required artifact. Such molds can be made of stone , pottery , or metal with a melting point higher than that of the alloy being cast. Molds were also used for making figurines and relief-decorated pottery. The simplest type of mold is a one-piece or open one , from which the casting emerges with one flat face , requiring further hammering to give it a symmetrical form. Two-piece molds allowed bifacial tools and weapons to be cast -- a third piece , or core , being added if a socket was required. These technical advances had been made before the end of the Early Bronze Age. Multi-piece molds were used in Shang China. Molds were used to produce the elaborate asymmetrical vessels of the Mochica and Chim styles. The earliest molds for casting metal were made of stone.

First , neurons in LIP , an area with the heaviest projections to FEF , have been shown to have sensory and mnemonic 2-D shape selectivities ( Sereno and Maunsell 1998 ) . Second , FEF does also receive projections from ventral stream areas including AIT , a high-level visual area in the " what " pathway specialized for form and object processing ( Schall et al. 1995b ) . Finally , a recent imaging study in anesthetized monkeys has demonstrated 3-D shape encoding in primate FEF ( Sereno et al. 2002 ) . Employing a conventional , straightforward experimental design used to study single cell responses in visual areas of the " what " pathway , we directly test , for the first time , sensitivity of FEF neurons to simple , 2-D shapes.

One possible explanation is that location is a special case compared with other stimulus attributes ( Kwak and Egeth 1992; Nissen 1985; Tsal and Lavie 1993 ) . That is , attending to any attribute of a stimulus , such as its shape or color , necessarily entails directing attention to its location. However , we also found shape-selective delay activity in many of those units that was not affected by what task the animal was performing. Of the total of 122 units , only 17 ( 7/41 ) of the shape-selective units and 16 ( 14/87 ) of the spatially selective units showed a significant difference depending on the task instruction . </shape.n.7564><shape.n.7565>These stimuli were created with custom algorithms written in Matlab.

These three query types are implemented as pure Prolog predicates , respectively space_contains/3 , space_intersects/3 , and space_nearest/3. These predicates work completely analogously , taking an index handle and a query shape to retrieve the URI of a shape matching the query , which is bound to the second argument. Any successive calls to the predicate try to re-instantiate the second argument with a different matching URI. The results of containment and intersection queries are instantiated in no particular order , while the nearest neighbor results are instantiated in order of increasing distance to the query shape. The space_nearest_bounded/4 predicate is a containment query based on space_nearest/3 , which returns objects within a certain range of the query shape in order of increasing distance . </shape.n.7569><shape.n.7570>Furthermore , once along-the-path shapes are created , their original properties can be adjusted after the fact.

They must both be represented by ordered values , so colour or shape could not easily be substituted for them. Execution sequence is related to flow of time , which is a continuous variable that is by convention assigned to either X or Y - so users expect it. Finally , both control nesting and execution sequence are fundamental properties of computing machines , so this conventional depiction of software is sufficiently general to visualise a program written in any language equivalent to a Turing machine. As with most properties of Turing machines , however , this generality is also at a sufficiently low level to make it uninteresting - but it has already allocated the two most versatile variables of the graphical plane . </shape.n.7571><shape.n.7572>As a way of compensating for the lack of an operational planning and C2 capability , the framework nation and Berlin Plus tracks were agreed under the provisions of the Helsinki Force Catalogue.

With a shape-only query , the shape is aligned to each candidate compound , the similarity is computed , and if the similarity tolerance is satisfied , the candidate is considered a hit. The shape in a mixed query is also aligned to the candidate compound , and the tolerance is tested. In addition , the transformation used to align the location constraints to the molecule is applied to the shape. Then , the similarity of the shape to the molecule is computed without any further alignment. If this similarity value satisfies the tolerance , then we record a hit. A hit from a mixed query search can be interpreted , therefore , as a molecule which ( 1 ) satisfies the feature-only query , ( 2 ) has similarity to the shape greater than the specified tolerance , and ( 3 ) satisfies the shape similarity tolerance when the orientation of the shape is fixed relative to the location constraints . </shape.n.7573><shape.n.7574>Pear shaped , in reference to the shape of a pear , i.e. , a generally rounded shape , tapered towards the top and more spherical/circular at the bottom.

They respond to divergent selection in the same way as most quantitative traitswith an immediate response in both directions that is most rapid at the outset ( WEBER 1990 ) . However , there could still be weak buffering toward wild type that shows up in highly selected genotypes. In our system , where both chromosomes were measured in a low background and all phenotypes were therefore below the presumably optimal range of wild type , the appearance of consistently negative interactions along the whole chromosome would also be generated if gene effects became increasingly less than additive the more they approached wild type. Such a buffering system might result if wing shape were determined by multiple , independent , partially redundant parallel systems , all with selectable variation. At present one can say only that directional asymmetry in the net effects of genetic interactions is strikingly consistent in our studies of wing shape and also in the report of ESHED and ZAMIR 1996 . </shape.n.7575><shape.n.7576>Well , I never found one , but it is possible , even easy , to add a Shape Key to a Curve.

Three different ways of computing the representation are described. They result in three different representations : the curvature scale space image , the renormalized curvature scale space image , and the resampled curvature scale space image.

The finding that inferotemporal cortex contains sufficient spatial information to compute a non-retinocentric frame of reference based on postural inputs alters , in a fundamental way , the current view of the nature of visual processing in the ventral stream and provides strong grounds for revising the classic segregation of shape versus spatial processing in ventral and dorsal cortical visual streams . </shape.n.7603><shape.n.7604>Limerick Walls Forming a rough diamond shape , the Limerick walls run east and southeast from Ball 's Bridge , along Old Clare and Lelia streets to the grounds of St. John 's Hospital.

The outer layer facing the dura contains the afferent axons from the olfactory receptors comprising the primary olfactory nerve ( PON ) . The innermost layer surrounding the ventricle consists of efferent and centrifugal axons , of which the most prominent set forms the lateral olfactory tract ( LOT ) . The PON axons synapse on the apical dendrites of large excitatory neurons , called mitral cells , which send their axons in the LOT. The basal dendrites of the mitral cells form reciprocal synapses with inhibitory interneurons , called granule cells , in the middle layers of the bulb ( Shepherd 1972 ) . The negative feedback loop formed by the mitral ( excitatory ) and granule ( inhibitory ) cells is the principal mechanism for the sinusoidal oscillation of the induced wave in response to receptor input ( Freeman 1975 ) . The potential field manifested at the surface of the bulb is a dipole field generated by the granule cells that alone have the requisite location and cytoarchitecture to generate such a field ( Rall and Shepherd 1968 ) , </shape.n.7609><shape.n.7610>Introduction - Shape factors - Moment redistribution Static , Kinematic and uniqueness theorems - Combined mechanisms - Analysis Portal frames.

The two chains in the crystallographic asymmetric unit are similarly folded ( RMSD for main-chain atoms , 0.4 ) and are related by an approximate twofold axis. Each chain contains three helices and five strands. The two chains intertwine to form two barrels near the middle of the molecule , each containing strands from both subunits. The subunits are held together by extensive -strand interactions , chiefly between the 1 strands of the two chains and between 2 of one chain and 5 of the other. Each end of the molecule is capped by a group of three helices , 2 from one subunit and 1 and 3 from the other. Helices 2 and 3 are packed against each other and against the rest of the molecule. Helix 1 is directed away from the main body of the molecule and is positioned differently in our structure than in 1O6A , implying that its location is influenced by crystal packing forces ( Fig. 3B ) . </shape.n.7636><shape.n.7637>Panel A shows many places where the water flow separates from surfaces on the swimmer soon after entry. The velocity of the swimmer at this stage exceeds any that could be achieved by free swimming. Most surfaces produce extra resistance at this velocity while only a few leading edges ( e.g. , the forehead , the rounded torso caused by outward rotation of the lower angles of the scapulae ) are visible. The suit and body shapes together produce considerable turbulence. Since the swimmer is progressing forward , turbulence tumbles down the swimmer and is added to that created by separations further down the swimmer 's anatomy. Usually , when turbulent flow travels over a surface the surface resistance is lessened but not sufficiently to offset the increase in form resistance involving the separations . </shape.n.7637><shape.n.7638>BSE and CJD are examples of , so called , spongiform encephalopathies which , as the name implies , are characterised by a sponge-like change in the appearance of the brain. The most acceptable theory to explain the cause of these diseases is based on the existence of prions ( pronounced pree-ons ) which are proteins. One particular form of prion with a characteristic spiral ( helical ) shape is present in all normal brain tissue at a constant level. Its function is a mystery but when it comes into contact with prions from a person/animal infected with an encephalopathy it changes its shape to an extended , stable form ( cf stretching a spring until the coils are lost ) with different properties , which accumulates in the tissues and causes disease symptoms. This form can infect other animals . </shape.n.7638><shape.n.7639>[ ZL01b ] D. S. Zhang and G. Lu. Content-Based Shape Retrieval Using Different Shape Descriptors : A Comparative Study .

To the best of our knowledge , with one exception , nobody has tried to answer the question of whether the shape of the glucose curve over time during the OGTT has any relevance. The one study addressing this issue that we found in the literature is a paper written in Japanese ( with an abstract in English ) , where the authors classified the glucose curve during the OGTT as biphasic ,  domed , and upward ( 6 ) . The main finding was that in patients with type 2 diabetes , the prevalence of biphasic was lower and the prevalence of upward was higher than in any other group. This appears somewhat trivial , because the category upward naturally favors enrichment with diabetic subjects who , by definition , have the highest glucose concentrations at the end of the OGTT. Nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the biphasic shape was most strongly associated with NGT in that study. This suggests that the shape harbors metabolic information not captured by the level of glycemia alone . </shape.n.7651><shape.n.7652>Boundary The dimension of the boundary of a shape is always that of the shape minus one.

Absolute 3D coordinates were calculated for each point in the resulting point cloud to describe the surface geometry with accuracy of 0.025 mm , as suggested by the manufacturer. Because of the limited scanning angle of the scanner , the surface geometry of the cast was digitized from the two sides and from the plantar views , in order to obtain a wider angular range of image. The files from the optical scanner were imported into PolyWork ( InnovMetric , Canada ) , where the data sets were " merged " into the complete 3D surface geometry. In this process , eight landmarks ( fiducial points ) over the surface images were used to perform the primary registration process. Automatic translation and rotation of the corresponding points over the merging point clouds completed the global registration process. As there may be overlapping points from different surface images , a step was included that removed points with exactly the same coordinates . </shape.n.7666><shape.n.7667>This is not telling much about the general shape of the foot.

Our perceptions can be similar only to our perceptions and to nothing else. Even what we call an object is nothing but a collection of perceptions which are connected in a certain way. If I strip a table of its shape , size , color , etc. -- in short , everything that is merely my perception -- then nothing more remains.

One of the more startling predictions of GR , gravitational lensing is the deflection of light due to gravitational potentials. The confirmation of gravitational lensing by Eddington 's 1919 expedition was one of the early important observations in favor of GR and lensing remains a powerful cosmological probe today. For particularly strong gravitational potentials ( like galaxy clusters ) , light from sources behind the lens can actually travel multiple paths to observers on the other side of the lens. This results in distorted , arc-like images of the background object like those seen in this image of Abell 2218. The pattern and shape of these images is very sensitive to the mass ( and mass distribution ) of the lensing object , providing our cleanest measure of galaxy cluster masses and , once again , dark matter is necessary to bridge the gap between the observed and visible mass.

Results of a subjective evaluation of the global system with competing trajectory formation models are further presented and commented . </shape.n.7699><shape.n.7700>To examine if there were behavioral ( EM latency ) and physiological changes in unit activity dependent on these conditions , we made comparisons across these conditions. Because we were looking at a subset of trials for each unit ( i.e. , 33 or 67 of all trials ) , we only included units that had more than nine repetitions for each sample shape and location and task ( 80 of 122 units ) . The pattern of findings for these 80 units was similar to what we have already reported in the preceding text for the entire population. Namely , 27 ( 22/80 ) , 19 ( 15/80 ) , and 59 ( 47/80 ) , of this subset of units showed differential activity between tasks during the sample , delay , and EM periods , respectively ( Fig. 7 ) . </shape.n.7700><shape.n.7701>The present study demonstrates the importance of geometric and metric properties of the environment in establishing spatial representation. To substantiate the present results , further testing of blindfolded subjects in an unfamiliar environment with an irregular shape will enable the subject to encounter an external environment that substantially differs from the repertoire of stored internal representations. Similarly , testing blindfolded subjects in a large-scale unfamiliar environment will have an impact on acquisition of the geometry of the environment. These tests may highlight the effect of scale and boundaries on the construction of spatial representation. They may also extend the use of egocentric mechanisms involved in the construction of spatial representation and further validate the SIRN model as a framework for this dynamic process . </shape.n.7701><shape.n.7702>The referent object is not the same as the basis for labeling.

Two main problems in this approach can not be discussed here at lenght , but ought at least to be mentioned in passing : Firstly , an entire animal species , assumed to be constant in character and physique , is being compared with an individual human being; and secondly , the decision where exactly the analogy between the animal and the person lies in nose , hair , eyes , shape of head , or any other , is entirely up to the arbitrition of the artist or rather physiognomist . </shape.n.7704><shape.n.7705>Wave Nouveau Coiffure Shape Release features a conditioning hydrogen peroxide formula.

The two samples might still have differences in the shape of their distributions , e.g. in the ratio of rare to common words , or in the way related words aggregate over paragraphs because of content differences.

For example , perimeter-area fractal dimension is a measure of shape complexity ( Mandelbrot 1982 , Burrough 1986 , Milne 1991 ) that can be computed for each patch and then averaged for the class or landscape , or it can be computed from the class or landscape as a whole by regressing the logarithm of patch perimeter on the logarithm of patch area. Similarly , core area can be computed for each patch and then represented as mean patch core area for the class or landscape , or it can be computed simply as total core area in the class or landscape. Obviously , one form can be derived from the other if the number of patches is known and so they are largely redundant; the choice of formulations is dependent upon user preference or the emphasis ( patch or class/landscape ) sought. The same is true for a number of other common landscape metrics.

Filaments are quite stiff; changes in shape between spinning filaments and stationary filaments were not detected. The torque generated by a flagellar bundle is surprisingly small , 700 pN nm. Evidently , a substantial fraction of the torque supplied by the several motors that drive a bundle is dissipated through internal friction within the bundle or between the bundle and the cell wall. However , the torque and thrust generated by the bundle are balanced , as they should be , by the drag computed for the cell body. Even though additional filaments in a bundle might not add much to a cell 's speed , they are useful for reorientation during tumbling. CW rotation often , although not always , triggers a polymorphic transformation to a right-handed filament form. This transformation plays an important role in generating changes in the direction of swimming . </shape.n.7886><shape.n.7887>Alexander , P.W. , H. Sun , A. Pathak , Jonathan E.

We present a dynamic data-driven framework for tracking gestures and facial expressions from monocular sequences. Our system uses two cameras , one for the face and one for the body view for processing in different scales. Specifically , and for the gesture tracking module , we track the hands and the head , obtaining as output the blobs ( ellipses ) of the ROIs , and we detect the shoulder positions with straight lines. For the facial expressions , we first extract the 2D facial features , using a fusion between KLT tracker and a modified Active Shape Model , and then we obtain the 3D face mask with fitting a generic model to the extracted 2D features. The main advantages of our system are ( i ) the adaptivity , i.e. , it is robust to external conditions , e.g. , lighting , and independent from the examined individual , and ( ii ) its computational efficiency , providing us results off- and online with a rates higher than 20fps. 1Kanaujia; Dynamically Adaptive Tracking of Gestures and Facial Expressions </shape.n.7888><shape.n.7889>Polygons , Beziers and Symmetric shapes are used to define the shape ( or path ) of a vector object.

As they build three-dimensional models and read maps of their own environments , students can discuss which blocks are used to represent various objects like a desk or a file cabinet. They can mark paths on the model , such as from a table to the wastebasket , with masking tape to emphasize the shape of the path. Teachers should help students relate their models to other representations by drawing a map of the same room that includes the path. In similar activities , older students should develop map skills that include making route maps and using simple coordinates to locate their school on a city map ( Liben and Downs 1989 ) . </shape.n.7913><shape.n.7914>Have students construct various two-dimensional shapes with K'NEX rods and connectors ( or straws and gumdrops ) .

Mindful of Bion 's admonition , we can reiterate here that the psychoanalytic probe launched into the space-time homogeneity of the unconscious system does not perform the function of knowing , but that of " being " a fragment of that same system. The resulting gain is a series of opportunities to generate other unconscious systems , other spaces and times , and new fragments ( see the idea of dreams as producers of unconscious in Bion and others ) . It could thus be pointed out that the homogeneous system , understood as primordial chaos and archaic blur , is nothing more than a working hypothesis that takes into consideration a series of objective data such as an-albeit partial-knowledge of brain function and of the active relations between its differentiated and undifferentiated parts , and the psychoanalytic notion of the unconscious , in order to give dynamic image and shape to the analytic enterprise . </shape.n.7921><shape.n.7922>In conclusion , the shape of the plasma glucose curve during an OGTT can be easily assessed and may contain the net information of a number of metabolic factors , including insulin sensitivity , insulin secretion , glucagon secretion and sensitivity , and hepatic glucose sensitivity. The biphasic shape is associated with NGT and female sex. Among common genetic variants implicated in metabolic disorders , the UCSNP44 C/T polymorphism in CAPN10 had a significant effect on the adjusted shape index.

When given a finite set of points S , and a real parameter alpha , the alpha shape of S is a polytope. This polytope neither have to be convex nor connected. When varying the number alpha over the real numbers , a family of shapes is generated displaying the intuitive concept of " rough versus " fine ' shape. When alpha is sufficiently large , the alpha shape is identical to the convex hull. When decreasing alpha , the shape shrinks and progressively shows cavities. Such cavities may join to form holes.

Neuronal loss , decreased synapse density and the intra- and extracellular deposition of abnormal proteins constitute the histological hallmark lesions of AD. The intraneural accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated state leads to the formation of neurofibrillary lesions ( NFL ) . Whereas the widespread distribution of NFL in the neocortex correlates with the cognitive decline in AD patients no such correlation could be found for the extracellular deposition of the A beta-protein in the shape of senile plaques ( SP ) .

The link with industry application semantics means that all data that complies with STEP data specifications has an explicit , dependence link to the reason or purpose of its existence.

In Agams , this property is named as 'a-guru-laghu ' or affinity. Both soul and the Karma-pudgals exhibit this virtue. Once this pair is formed , their affinities are neutralised and any further interaction is prevented. Thus , a soul once pair with a body is not free to associate with any other body.

Dynamic constraint relationships between geometry In the boat design world , a common shape that has to be modeled is a chine hull consisting of two or more surfaces joined edge to edge. These multiply-connected surfaces are called polysurfaces in some 3D modeling programs. Amazingly , most modeling and CAD programs do not let you edit these shapes unless you " explode " or disconnect the surfaces at their edges. The surfaces will then separate if you move one of the edge points ! This is completely unacceptable for shaping chine hull boats - AND for shaping most other types of objects where surfaces meet . </shape.n.7986><shape.n.7987>A program of Calisthenic , Isometric and stretching exercises combined with dance will enable you to develop muscle strength and endurance as well as flexibility and cardio-pulmonary fitness.

Further , we also report that some LIP neurons show differential responses to the same sample stimulus depending on which task the animal is performing. These findings suggest that the animals , even early in the trial at the presentation of the sample , are differentiating between the two tasks. Finally , and perhaps most directly , average saccade latencies for identical trials in the two tasks ( i.e. , identical both in stimuli at sample and test and with identical response ) were 43 ms longer ( and 2.4 more errors ) on shape-matching trials than on location-matching trials. Taken together , these observations show that the animals indeed adopt different behavioral sets between tasks but that much of the spatially-selective delay period activity in area LIP is independent of what the animal voluntarily attends to and remembers , and some of this activity represents reflexive shape and spatial processes . </shape.n.7994><shape.n.7995>According to Dr. Joseph C.

Hence the 2000 dates of first visibility tend to agree very well between Southern Africa and Northern Africa/Mideast.

Our research is embryonic in the sense that we can not define the best way to achieve this in advance. We expect our ideas to grow and develop as the project proceeds. The ultimate success of our approach will be judged by the effectiveness and efficiency of the proof-of-concept prototype retrieval engine for figurative images which we intend to develop in the later stages of the project. These objectives form the first steps on the way to meeting one of the biggest challenges in content-based image retrieval : the development of effective and efficient retrieval systems capable of matching human perceptual similarity judgements . </shape.n.8058><shape.n.8059>Drake , S.

Myopia , or nearsightedness , refers to eyes that see better at near than distance. Hyperopia or farsightedness , refers to eye that see better at distance than at near. Astigmatism refers to eyes that have irregular shapes to their cornea cause distortion in images whether they are at near or at distance.

How can these changes be anticipated , or compensated , without complete reprocessing ? The results of eye and head rotation are simple : things move in the visual field but keep their shapes; but changing place causes large shape changes that depend both on angle and on distance relations between the object and observer. The problem is particularly important for fast-moving animals because a model of the scene must be built up from different , partially analyzed views. Perhaps the need to do this , even in a relatively primitive fashion , was a major evolutionary stimulus to develop frame-systems , and later , other symbolic mechanisms . </shape.n.8088><shape.n.8089>Enclosing a vertical area with columns and a flat roof. The roof is strong only close to ther columns , It is weak in the middle. Extend this thought to an area. From the standpoint of empty Euclidean space , an area is that which has length and width. A bounded area is enclosed by a line , either straight or curved. A physical area , however , is enclosed by a physical structure , whose shape must be determined by physical principles. One approach to enclosing a physical area , would be to build two vertical columns and span those columns with a flat roof. This is a relatively weak structure , however , because the roof is only strong close to where it is supported by the columns. The farther apart the columns are , the weaker the roof [ See Figure 3 ] . A far more stable structure for vaulting a vertical area is an arch . </shape.n.8089><shape.n.8090>You can stop participating in life , totally , at any moment. Remember Harry ?
