We know that Fisheries officers , game wardens and certain other people can as well. Those are people who we presume , by virtue of their title and appellation , have some knowledge , experience and training with respect to exercising constabulary powers. This is a constabulary power , but the bill just says a " person who is designated for the purpose of this section " can be authorized to get a warrant to go into anyone 's house. This does not refer to a police officer , a peace officer , a game warden , a Fisheries officer or anyone with experience , but just a person a telephone operator , a plumber or any person without designation . </presume.v.9><presume.v.10>Third , no one else can presume to understand your state of mind and more specifically , how your children would receive the news of a step father.

While you are not his birth mother , he is now under your guardianship and we urge you to keep his well-being in mind as well when you consider the options before you. Your own children should also be mentally and emotionally prepared to have a step-father. How all of these children have dealt with the loss of their father will predict to a great degree how they will deal with the idea of having a step-father.

Neither can I hope to recount the many honours and distinctions which have been heaped upon him by learned bodies and universities all over the world. Let me conclude by referring to Kenzo Tange as a great man , a rare man and a great architect who has used his unique talents to enrich our environment and , who by his teaching and devoted guidance will ensure that future generations of architects may continue to give us the benefit of his imagination and inspiration . </presume.v.22><presume.v.23>Part Two of a two part course focusing on Usability for the Public Sector - you can attend either or both days , however this course does presume you understand what the principle features of usability are , and how they fit with service delivery , web development and website management.

We all have our tailor-made battle lines , and our current rung is far less important that our current direction. Moreover , we can now heed the words of Hillel with greater appreciation : " Do not judge your fellow until you have arrived at his/her place ! " Not only is judging someone unfavorably an undesirable , elitist thing to do but even more , it does n't make sense from a logical perspective. Why ? Because we have never truly arrived at another person 's place we have never experienced the precise combination of forces that make up another person 's battle lines. While it is reasonable to condemn inappropriate actions ( and to penalize the perpetrators when necessary ) , it is illogical to judge the inherent value of the people behind those actions. May we all climb life 's ladder in the direction of our positive purpose , and may we judge others favorably as they attempt to do the same ! </presume.v.26><presume.v.27>We can start by asking some questions that we may not be used to asking; Who else is involved ?

To wit : what is common about common sense is merely a function of consensus and when that consensus is built around the kind of Enlightenment rationale responsible for systemic oppression of the Other ( by way of judging those who operate from within a competing paradigm through a prism cut to refract only western moral and intellectual standards ) , it is a consensus worth pressuring , until its very commonality is divorced from the kind of self-regard that would presume to tie that commonality to righteousness , or even rectitude . </presume.v.29><presume.v.30>( Interestingly , a high-income family with can generally justify a larger policy on a work-at-home spouse than a family with lower income , even though neither homemaker makes any money.

Read review </presume.v.31><presume.v.32>With Minnesota 's second senator still unnamed , the Illinois seat helps move the Democrats ever close to that 60th vote required to enact cloture. Longtime observers agree it is safe to presume that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel pointed this out to Springfield 's Democrat leadership. So at the veto session the Democrats refused to block Blagojevich 's appointment authority , leaving him the power to select as he would. And thus was born Burris , a notable Blagojevich legacy . </presume.v.32><presume.v.33>We know there are current entitlement programs that have major unfunded liabilities. Medicare has a $ 38 trillion unfunded liability and will effectively go bankrupt in 2017. Yet this bill , at least the Finance Committee bill -- I presume the bill coming out of Senator Reid 's office will do the same -- takes $ 500 billion from Medicare to create a new entitlement plan , a new government-run health care plan , when Medicare itself has $ 38 trillion in unfunded liabilities. It just does not seem to make any sense . </presume.v.33><presume.v.34>It matters when we share a stake in something. It matters particularly when they are the ' other ' .

The traditional paths are based on such proposals of belief in the Revelation of God , the will of God , or the nature of God. And the path offered on the basis of such belief is to Realize God or enter into perfect union with God through a progressive activity whereby you are cured of your dissociation from God. Until you go through the entire process of cure , however , and come out on the other side of it , now or in heaven or in some extraordinary state , it is presumed that you have not yet Realized God and are not yet enjoying a condition of perfect Unity with God . </presume.v.36><presume.v.37>But when the archangel Michael , contending with the devil , was disputing about the body of Moses , he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment , but said , The Lord rebuke you. </presume.v.37><presume.v.38>Forgive me Sir but why do you presume the attempt is to generate random numbers within a Normal Distribution ?

It is a reminder that we are dealing with a government and state-owned firm with an established record of mendacity , misinformation , and overtly political motives - one can not presume regularity in regards to statements made by the Kremlin or Gazprom. You may as well believe Medvedev 's statements today that their strategy is motivated only by " economic factors " and that they have enough supply to meet their commitments. Many former Soviet states under Gazprom 's hammer would beg to differ , and many energy experts would dispute that in fact Russia could very well face a gas shortage in the near future.

He lived at Charlton , MA , where he married , on 28 Aug 1770 , Bette Clemons. He served in the Revolutionary War , and was discharged 17 Dec 1780. Enoch does not appear on the census of 1790 , but his widow appears on this and succeeding censuses as head-of-family until her death , which occurred 11 Sep 1823. In 1790 she had one male in the household. Therefore we presume Enoch 's death between 1780 and 1790 , and that they had but the one son . </presume.v.44><presume.v.45>If , presume not to God to scan; The proper study of Mankind is Man.

There have been deeply fervent souls who out of a more or less intense need for belief have gained a relation to the Mystery of Golgotha and its Bearer; there have been deeply religious natures all through the centuries since the Mystery of Golgotha down to our own time. But the Mystery of Golgotha is a Mystery which , notwithstanding that it took place as a real fact , at the beginning of modern times , is yet of such a nature that human souls can not presume to understand it fully without preparation. New epochs will continually arise which will bring a greater deepening to human souls , and which will have an increasing understanding for what happened in the Mystery of Golgotha. The Event itself stands there as the great turning-point in human evolution; the understanding of the Event will continuously grow and ripen in the spiritual evolution of the Earth. This fact can not be engraved deeply enough into our minds and hearts . </presume.v.47><presume.v.48>Our schools are in trouble again because of necessary budget cuts , according to Sacramento.

Not being much of a sports fan , sports movies have to have some kind of personal importance , grounding them in human drama or a stronger significance for them to resonate very strongly with me. Miracle has that in spades. It epitomizes the American spirit and not just that the 1980 Olympics were important , but why they were; why we needed , as a nation and a society , to have something spectacular happen. Being born well after all this took place , I would never presume to understand the magnificence of the story like those whose lives it directly affected. That said , the true brilliance of the film comes from how it can make people who know nothing about hockey or the history behind the 1980 games get behind the characters , the struggle , and the beauty of the event. I ' m not going to analyze the film; it ' s been done better than I can do it. What I will do is reiterate the grandness of the film. It ' s an astounding success , well deserving of the countless times I ' ve seen it since 2004 . </presume.v.50><presume.v.51>We can not presume to understand why G-d commanded IR MIKLAT as He did. Some of it lends itself to common sense. Some does not. Why can one person be released after a day in exile , if the Kohen Gadol dies then , and someone else can stay in exile for years and years , even until his death and beyond. I someone in IR MIKLAT dies before the K.G. , then he must be buried in the IR MIKLAT.

It is up to a separating couple to identify when and where they can lessen the impact of divorce upon their children , and these statistics may go some way to helping them to identify those areas where children are most vulnerable . </presume.v.53><presume.v.54>Next offerings of bread , wine , and money are presented at the Altar. The bishop or priest offers them in a prayer which recalls God ' s acts in history and in Jesus ' life , including the Last Supper. The Holy Spirit is then invoked on the gifts of bread and wine so that they may be for us the Body and Blood of Christ. We do not presume to understand or explain how this happens but rather trust Jesus ' words , This is my Body/Blood. The Spirit is invoked on the congregation as well so that we may be Christ ' s Body , the Church. The bread and wine are then shared reverently. All who have been baptized are welcome to receive communion. Those who do not wish to receive the sacrament are welcome to come forward for a blessing. After Communion , we are dismissed to carry on the work of God ' s Kingdom in the world . </presume.v.54><presume.v.55>Electricity is of two kinds , positive and negative.

The authorities find no trace of the airplane and presume they 're dead , but Alicia is determined to continue searching. Brash pilot Jake Dawson accepts a search charter but vows to stay detached from Alicia and her problems. Yet every day he flies over the Bahamas with her by his side puts him closer to losing his objectivity. When clues indicate the boy is alive and mysterious accidents hint someone wants to kill Alicia , Jake resolves to protect her at any cost. He may run from love but not from trouble. Although Alicia refuses to be distracted from her search by Jake 's advances , she must team up with him to stay alive and save her child. Soon they find the danger to their lives is real , but so is the danger to their hearts . </presume.v.73><presume.v.74>Apparently , according to those in the know , this is the likely answer to who the average Londoner thinks the next elected Mayor will be. The loveable rogue , the man who tells us how things really are. The man who is elected to serve and govern London but still manages to pontificate on international affairs. More accurately , on international affairs of his own choice. The man who vociferously attacks George Bush at any opportunity , but has little to say publicly about the human rights record of the Chinese on a recent visit to Beijing. The man who likened the massacre in Tiananmen Square of 1989 to the ' Poll Tax ' riots of 1990 : the first killed an estimated 3000 people , the second killed none. The first led to a further crackdown on individual freedoms , the second led to reform of local taxation in Britain. Similar ?

After a series of death row exonerations , the Illinois criminal justice system came under scrutiny. According to Turow , our society accepts the death penalty based on certain beliefs. First , we presume that although no man-made process is flawless , our police and courts are efficient assessors of blame. We know the execution of an innocent person is possible , but we expect those risks to be low. Proportionality of punishment is another important element of American jurisprudence. We see a difference between shoplifting and murder , for example. It ' s about balance , says Turow. Allowing the state to kill one of its citizens is tolerable only when there is no doubt of guilt -- and when the sentence fits the crime.

The literary theorist Jacqueline Rose has written about the mysterious psycho-politics of war , asserting that its persistence through time ' signals the breakdown of the 19th-century faith in evolution , progress and science ' .2 Quoting Gertrude Stein , Rose continues : ' If everything was understood , so it was then believed , there would be progress and if there was progress there would not be any wars , and if there were not any wars then everything could and would be understood .

Kolbowski does not presume to understand the origins or persistence of war to answer the simple but elusive question Rose poses , ' Why war ?

Each of my sons , in his own way , made me see that by trying to create a dream child in my own image , I was also creating mile-high hurdles and asking him to jump over them. It took many years and a great deal of painful conflict to learn to be aware of , to respect , and to honor my sons ' unique and separate identities. The challenge for mothers of sons is to realize that because we do not share a sexual identity , that because we have not grown up in a male body , we can not presume to understand everything there is to know about our sons ' world.

I do not presume to understand the European expectation of time away from work , but I do think that American positions , due to corporate downsizing and restrictions on employee head counts , put a lot more stock and responsibility into the position each employee holds. They do a very good job in explaining to employees that time off is time others have to spend to cover the activities of that missing person. This creates an expectation that corporate offices will not discuss more time. Though one or two employees wo n't change policy , a group offering petition or collective communication is more likely to instill a need for change. It is still questionable without a union , but it also depends on the corporate culture.

I presume the burden is on the depositor to prove that this was the banks ONLY intention. Generally , banks seem to process the largest checks first ( which of course , leads to more of the smaller checks bouncing than normally would ) . The banks justify this by saying " well , the larger checks are probably more important , like mortgage or car payments , so we put those through first. " I suspect this is a rational enough reason to allow the process to continue even under this bill. I would point out that bouncing your $ 29 minimum payment on a credit card can now have catastrophic implications on your interest rate , especially if you have a large balance.

He discusses the factors likely to have determined both form and content of compilations of customary law as recorded at the beginning of the seventeenth century in the Habsburg Netherlands. Basing himself on such compilations as those at Antwerp ( Consuetudines compilatae ) and Roermond ( The Guelders Country and Town Statue Book [ Het Gelderse Land- en Stadsrecht ] ) of 1608 and 1620 , respectively , the author reveals a number of factors which had a decisive impact on the form and content of the law of customs as recorded. In veiw of the special character of a case study such as the one presented here , the author does not presume to attempt an exhaustive presentation on these factors. On the contrary , his dissertation is intended to provide an exploratory first encounter with the internal history of the process of recording customs , a process initiated in the Habsburg Netherlands by Charles V in 1531 . </presume.v.228><presume.v.229>Drinkers have nothing to fear.

Since Jewish law would not allow a victim to remain on the cross past sundown , we can presume that the Romans would have designed Jesus ' crucifixion to be " short-lived. " This would mean , in all likelihood , that Jesus ' feet were plantar flexed with the soles nailed to the uprights. Even so , we have pointed out that Pilate was still surprised at his early death.

It is fundamentally a process of the knower rather than a process of his or her knowledge.

So the question for the Christian in this respect is whether or not he thinks his god chooses to think logically , or if logic is said to mirror its thinking regardless of what may think. Van Til ' s statement suggests that logic is not a norm to which the Christian god volitionally conforms its thinking , as man should his own thinking. To do so would presume that logic is a norm independent of the Christian god ' s actual thinking , just as it is in the case of man ' s thinking.

But the ancient standards do not necessarily conform to modern standards. The only legitimate human standard by which the bible can be measured is the logic of noncontradiction. Paradox may be incomprehensible , but contradiction is non-sense. What I have in mind here is that fundamentalists do not stand under the Bible long enough to understand it.

The punch line is , " Pure thought is always better than thoughtless counting. " Who could disagree ?

Is it a responsible and mature decision to implement a penalty of such resounding finality merely because the convicted offender has been found to be guilty " beyond a reasonable doubt ? " It has long been argued that an appropriate term of imprisonment should be the maximum available penalty for a violent offense. This argument has been supported by the fact that our legal system , though highly evolved and altogether expedient , is far from infallible , and in recognition of this the penalties imposed under it should be both reversible and humane.

What 's happening here with prices is happening globally. After 20 years of insufficient capital investment , there is very little surplus productive capacity left in the oil business anywhere in the world. Meanwhile consumption is continuing to increase. As a result , prices have risen significantly because of the fear of supply shortages ( e.g. , caused by unpredictable events such as Hurricane Katrina ) . This is of particular concern given the current instability in major producing regions such as the Middle East ( e.g. , Iraq , Iran ) and Nigeria. To get prices down , either consumers must use less product or producers must invest vast amounts of money in new productive capacity ( $ 10+ billion for every additional 0.1 million barrels/day of production ... and the world now consumes 85 million barrels per day ) . Until this happens , I 'm afraid we 're stuck with the current price levels ... and whatever Petro Canada or any other Canadian oil company does in the short term wo n't make much difference on the global scene . </presume.v.469><presume.v.470>Sandra : I presume you understand English , since the comments that preceed me are all in that language.

And when heliography assumes its rightful place , as one among the noblest of the Fine Arts , imperatively demanding , in its practice , high genius , various culture and manifold accomplishment , then all mere mechanical operators will by the general voice be excluded from the profession , and the genuine heliographist will be a " a power among men , " and like the eminent painter or sculptor will be nigh overwhelmed with honors and patronage.

But this fact should not deceive us into thinking that we fully understand His plan , that God has blessed us with knowing what the future holds. Of course we understand those things that have gone before us and of which we have a record in the scriptures , but so did the people of Christ 's time. At any point in time , God has given to His people a sacred record of the past , and promises of the future. The past is understood; the promises of the future are not.

In addition , this chapter discusses the Transnational feminists who place less emphasis on creating a unifying theory and more importance on creating awareness and understanding of the diversity of women ' s experience throughout the world.

If they are old enough to reason , then they sense very accurately when they are being left out of important discussions about things that concern them.

Many people , I have found , are reluctant to reveal what goes on in their minds ( or in other states of consciousness , or on other planes ? - you choose ) during rituals , and often resort to joking about gods and goddesses with generously endowed anatomies in order to get out of answering such questions. Or in some cases descriptions are abandoned because the deities " tend to look different at different times " or can only be described as " forces " or " aspects of nature that occasionally possess human characteristics " .

Their remains patiently lingered , just off the beaten path of tourists and buffs , for discovery and the contemplation of their demise.

Guided by the eclectic imagination of Eisner , the " Spirit " strip , which ran through the 1940s up until the early 1950s , deftly transcended genres in much the same way as the contemporary superhero tale. Unfortunately , while " The Spirit " has remained a popular classic , the title character , a masked vigilante who has allowed the world to presume the death of his civilian self in order to have the anonymity he needs to fight crime , has been overshadowed somewhat by his successors. Even compared to his peer Batman , who was created near the same time , the character of the Spirit lacks a certain melodramatic complexity. However , I think there is the charm of this character , and the reason why , in the era of a superhero genre hobbled by over-indulgence of its fan base and obsessed with its need to present " dark " and " edgy " stories , Darwyn Cooke 's revival of " The Spirit " actually looks like something entirely new and revolutionary.

The question is if a seemingly lifeless body is partially uncovered , what physical examination definitively determines the person ' s status. The Talmud seems to indicate that cessation of respiration is the classical indicator of death. Proponents of defining brain death as death argue that since cessation of autonomous respiration constitutes death , then the death of the brain stem which controls autonomous respiration also constitutes death. Those who disagree understand the Talmud as simply establishing that if there is no autonomous respiration and sufficient time has passed , one may presume that the heart has stopped as well , but that in truth , cessation of both respiration and heartbeat is required for a determination of death . </presume.v.663><presume.v.664>This two-fer CD combines the Hi-Lo 's ' 1955 album , The Hi-Lo 's , I Presume , with Under Glass , which was released the following year.

Sentell also says , The element of peril accelerates the presumption of death. This rule was enacted after the attack on the World Trade Center , so that death certificates could be established. Although people who are presumed dead sometimes turn up alive , it is not as common as it used to be. There has been one recent memorable case where this has occurred , such as in the case of John Burney who disappeared after financial problems and reappeared years after , December 1982 , to Arkansas.

Over the succeeding days and months , Billy ' s legend is transformed into an indisputable narrative , much in the fashion that Jesus ' legend slowly solidified among the apostles of what eventually became the early Christian church. In this way , a scriptural hodgepodge , rather than the true words and actions of Billy Budd , becomes the object of worship and veneration.

You yourself say , " we can not honestly say that we understand baptism " , meaning rather that you can not honestly say that you understand baptism. But that does n't mean that other Christians can not understand it. Right ?

The things that influence interpretation all fold back on each other in reciprocal fashion , but if there is any factor that has received greater , explicit attention in recent decades it is the shaping influence of our own experience.

As a volunteer with Habitat for Humanity , I encounter homelessness and poverty housing more often than other college students , and I 'm always overwhelmed by what I see. At school we once had a homeless vigil where a group of students slept outside to get a feel for the helplessness of those who have to do this every night. Around 3 a.m. , freezing , we gathered up our sleeping bags and moved into an unlocked campus building. Snuggled warm in our blankets , we gradually drifted to sleep , cursing the hard floor. I went home in the morning with the realization that someone who has never been homeless can never presume to understand what it is like , but we must always do what we can to help.

( For more about his attitude , see his 1784 essay " An Answer to the Question : What is Enlightenment.

In such a situation , the court presumes that the beneficiary died before the deceased testator or intestate. The presumption can be rebutted only by evidence that the beneficiary survived the deceased : the presumption of continuance of life is insufficient.

While no mortal can presume to understand the thoughts and feelings of the incarnate Son of God at such a time as this , we know that he endured great anguish and suffered untold sorrow , for the perspiration rolled off his face in great drops.

It makes clear that in the Deep South of the 1930 's , jurors were not willing to accord a black charged with raping a white woman the usual presumption of innocence. In fact , one may argue that the presumption seemed reversed : a black was presumed guilty unless he could establish his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. The cases show that to jurors , black lives did n't count for much. The jurors that in April , 1933 had just voted to sentence Haywood Patterson to death were seen laughing as they emerged from the juryroom. Hannah Arendt wrote of " the banality of evil. " Evil rarely comes in the form of monsters , but rather in the form of relatively normal people who , for reasons of careers , ideology , or a desire for society 's approval , are indifferent to the human consequences of their actions. Because of indifferent jurors and career-motivated prosecutors , the self-serving and groundless accusations of a single woman were allowed to change forever the lives of nine black teenagers who found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time . </presume.v.965><presume.v.966>" Finally , in a civilized society , the law presumes that those lacking the capacity to reason also lack the capacity to consent.

There are constitutional limitations to these procedures : The presumption must arise only after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed. The absent person must be notified; courts permit claimants to be notified by publication. Adequate safeguards concerning property provisions must be made in the case that an absent person will show up. There are some states that require those who receive assets of the missing person ' s to return them if the person turned out to be alive. If a person is declared dead , when missing , their estate will be distributed as if they were deceased. In some cases , the presumption of death can sometimes be rebutted , according to Sentell , courts will consider evidence that the absent person was a fugitive from justice , had money troubles , had a bad relationship , or had no family ties or connection to a community as reasons not to presume death.

An insurance company refused to pay out on a life policy , and the court held that Heard was not proved dead. A second application to presume death , made on 11 December 1952 , was granted , but the mystery remains unsolved.

Guided by the eclectic imagination of Eisner , the " Spirit " strip , which ran through the 1940s up until the early 1950s , deftly transcended genres in much the same way as the contemporary superhero tale. Unfortunately , while " The Spirit " has remained a popular classic , the title character , a masked vigilante who has allowed the world to presume the death of his civilian self in order to have the anonymity he needs to fight crime , has been overshadowed somewhat by his successors. Even compared to his peer Batman , who was created near the same time , the character of the Spirit lacks a certain melodramatic complexity. However , I think there is the charm of this character , and the reason why , in the era of a superhero genre hobbled by over-indulgence of its fan base and obsessed with its need to present " dark " and " edgy " stories , Darwyn Cooke 's revival of " The Spirit " actually looks like something entirely new and revolutionary . </presume.v.989><presume.v.990>Others say this is all a red herring meant to distract people from the reason the TREAD Act was written : to prevent another tire safety debacle.
