I look forward to completing this and submitting our dossier. People say that waiting for the referral is the hardest part , but at this point , I still would choose it over the paperwork ! </wait.v.1><wait.v.2>( We are currently transitioning to 20 members ( from 30 ) . If you are interested in being on the waiting list , knowing that it will be a longer than usual list , please read below and e-mail me . ) </wait.v.2><wait.v.3>Getting everything together for the taxes was a not-so-fun way to spend the afternoon yesterday , but Gerry and I got a lot of stuff figured out. Now we 're waiting for the 1099 's and other surprises , then I 'll input it all and see how it falls . </wait.v.3><wait.v.4>Wow ! As you know , I have been through a season of waiting ! It has been a long ordeal for us to wait ! But all those verses are true and everything you said is so true ! I had to decide to listen to those same verses and make the choice to wait on Him even though it wasn ' t going as I wanted. I would never have chosen to be seperated from my husband this long , but God had other plans ! And His plan is perfect ! ! ! ! ! He is so good and faithful ! I want to share with you a verse that He showed me about waiting that changed my heart and my perspective ! </wait.v.4><wait.v.5>Nevertheless , waiting lists have remained long and waiting times have not significantly improved. The AMA has argued that at least 90 per cent of patients should be seen within the recommended time frames for surgery. Even this target means that we still have patients waiting for an entire year for the surgery they need . </wait.v.5><wait.v.6>Transportation is a " nightmare , " she says. People wait for several hours for transportation to and from work , and then all the money they earn is used for transportation. Fuel is getting harder and harder to buy also . </wait.v.6><wait.v.7>While hanging out with my very-pregnant sister and my goddaughter , I had a baking itch. One night , I introduced the joy of baking to Sofia with a batch of Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies. She helped in measuring ingredients , mixing the batter , and spooning the dough onto the cookie sheets. She also learned about the magic of the oven as she patiently waited for the cookies to bake. Her reward was a freshly baked " chaw-quit cookie " ( as she calls it ) with a glass of milk . </wait.v.7><wait.v.8>Liberals are already hopping mad at the lack of progress on the liberal agenda. By now the masses should be happily waiting in long lines at a dwindling number of clinics , grateful for single payer health care. After all , we own the government and we know what ' s best. Holy Lenin ! You ' d think Obama would know how to put together a proper politburo . </wait.v.8><wait.v.9>Guess what I 'm waiting for ? If she goes into rehab and turns her life around , we 'll be seeing the KK story in hard-back , paper-back , the movie ( I wonder who 'll play KK ? ) It 's all so inevitable. She 'll still have a better life - in financial terms - than the rest of us ! ! </wait.v.9><wait.v.10>Bill swung into the saddle , gathered the reins , and clucked to his mount , a frisky dun mustang Rod Owen had bought in Texas. The animal frog-jumped and bucked for a few minutes , but Bill stuck tight and waited out the horse 's temper tantrum. The dun would settle down soon and carry him through the morning without further complaint . </wait.v.10><wait.v.11>With rising prices , I ' ve put aside some books like Y : The Last Man and Fables; at this point , I ' m likely to wait until all the volumes are out in deluxe format before I get them. Then there ' s titles like Birds of Prey and Blue Beetle that I ' ve started asking for as holiday gifts instead of buying , or like Detective Comics that I ' m waiting until the hardcovers come out as softcovers . </wait.v.11><wait.v.12>At the start of Rucka ' s electrifying sixth thriller featuring bodyguard Atticus Kodiak ( after 2001 ' s Critical Space ) , Atticus is ready to settle down after years of chasing the deadly female assassin known as Drama and finally breaking her away from The Ten  a group of cold-blooded killers operating around the globe. But when he and Drama , now known as Alena , are ambushed and left for dead , Atticus knows his troubles are far from over. Suddenly , the two find themselves the target of a massive manhunt after being mistakenly identified as Ten members. From a tiny village on the Black Sea to the inner sanctum of the Pentagon , Atticus and Alena race to clear their names and punish those responsible for the shocking death of a close friend. Rucka expertly blends intense shoot- ' em-up scenes with biting political commentary as Atticus and Alena uncover just how high the conspiracy reaches within the U.S. government. Kodiak fans who ' ve waited a long time for this installment will find it exceeds all expectations. ( Sept . ) </wait.v.12><wait.v.13> I don ' t usually read romances , but was drawn to this one because of the knitting angle. I really like it. It ' s entertaining , funny and charming , and it has some sizzling sex in it too. Best of all , it doesn ' t trivialize women the way the romance novels of my youth did the main character isn ' t sitting around waiting to be rescued or swept off her feet or dragged kicking and screaming to some gothic castle where she will succumb to Stockholm Syndrome. The icing on the cake ? It ' s got a fabulous cat character in it. Terrific first novel. I ' m looking forward to Herron ' s next book. </wait.v.13><wait.v.14>It lets you interact with your fellow man - Waiting in line also reminds us that we are social creatures , trapped together on this eternally shrinking planet. Assuming there is nothing to catch your eye on the magazine rack , try striking up a conversation with the shop assistant or your fellow shoppers. Instead of tapping your foot with the fury of an Irish dancer , use that energy on getting to know the people in your neighbourhood . </wait.v.14><wait.v.15>I have my doubts about Obama. But he ran a better campaign. And he won. Hillary did not. So what to do next ? Senator Clinton has said on numberous times that he is not prepared to be president. Why would she hitch her political wagon to his star other than to be waiting for him to fail and pick up the pieces. Not a good standing for a VP in my mind . </wait.v.15><wait.v.16>I was in the lobby waiting to check into our new rooms when I heard a familiar voice yell my name. It was Chanda ! Oh , frabzjous day ! We collided in a joyful embrace , and then I was reunited with Nick and then Todd. They had gone first to the Riverside , but they figured it out and found their way to Palace. We stood in the check-in line for a few moments and caught up a little bit before Justin came sauntering in Joe Cool-style and said hello. Behind him , Neil ran in and hugged everybody , and then Colin. They were all laden with surfboards and bags and looked like they 'd been having some good beach time in South America . </wait.v.16><wait.v.17>While we wait , we can concentrate on one of two things. We can focus on the things that we are waiting for , or we can focus on the One who holds those things in His hands. What makes such a difference when we wait for something is n't so much how long we have to wait as it is our attitude while we wait. If we trust the Lord , if we have placed our lives in His hands , if we have surrendered our wills to Him , then we can trust that He will do what 's best for us when it 's best for us , no matter how hard it is sometimes to believe it . </wait.v.17><wait.v.18>Tuesday , June 27 , 2000 ... Called the insurance company this morning. They told me that I needed to get it to a shop so they could have the adjuster come out. I told them it was at the house and was n't going anywhere until we get things settled and decided just what it needed , because it will probably have to visit several places to get everything done. The guy finally relented and said he would get in touch with their , State Farm , Duluth office and have someone contact me. Now I am just waiting for them to call so I can schedule to meet them at the house . </wait.v.18><wait.v.19>Okay , but hey. HEY ! Mr. Techie-tawkie. You know as well as anybody that buying first generation Apple anything is a fool 's errand.

The SPY came close to triggering my contingent order , but the rally at the end of the day kept it from triggering. Thus I am still waiting. With the slight pullback on Friday , we are still in a situation where we could rally up to that 1085 area ... or we could drop big time from the open on Tuesday. Mondays have been rally days for the last several weeks. With the market closed today due to the president 's day holiday , we could be in for a rally Tuesday. I do n't care what happens tomorrow. My contingent order is still set and I 'll just patiently wait until it gets triggered . </wait.v.21><wait.v.22>How great is this ?

Paul and I waited at that corner , and made bets about how long it would take for the end of the line to unweave itself around the block. I won the bet : it was 8 : 57pm when we saw the end of the line recede past Cedar . </wait.v.23><wait.v.24>As we waited to present our tickets to get into the arena , we wondered if Katie Snodgrass would do some of her behind-the-back dribbles.

I know because I am a verizon retail employee , I can tell you the first time I heard of this is from an AT &amp;T customer that wanted to switch to verizon but was waiting till 2009 for the iPhone , so I started doing some research. That said the only reason that apple and verizon have not struck a deal is because appl edoesnt want anyone messing with their phone , and verizon want 's to keep it 's network as secure as possible. in the end one will have to give , and strike a deal as doing so would bring business to both markets . </wait.v.31><wait.v.32>I hope we get rid of all these dumb ***** thugs I am tired of them and their crazy antics reflecting on Black men.

Charles had promised me he would come in the evening. I had prepared plenty of beef patties. He likes them so much that at one sitting he can gobble up nearly a dozen. Evening passed , he didn ' t turn up. I thought he might be coming for dinner so that we can go for midnight Mass together. When he didn ' t come even then , I thought he might be working late.

Lines were not that long for reserved customers , longer for those without a reservation. The manager announced they had phones for everyone with a reservation , and thought they would have enough for those without. In the store by 7 : 15 , out by 7 : 30 with a 16gig phone. Walked to the other end of the mall to the AT &amp;T store , only a couple of people waiting , in and out in 15 minutes after transferring my wife 's number to my old 2G iphone. Both phones were activated within minutes , quite impressive given previous experiences. A restore through itunes and then a sync to load my apps , tunes and photos , and I am back in business. The new phone has a very different feel to it than the 2G , smaller , lighter , and a lot faster. The one app on page 2 is an odd glitch , otherwise it is impressive. The percentage display for the battery is under settings/general/usage - not an obvious location. The screen may have a new coating , but the back is showing a lot of fingerprints and smudges . </wait.v.50><wait.v.51>I am a 31 year old African American Male.

Everyday , I observe great new frontiers being established in internet marketing. While the two of you have only unveiled a small part of NTH , even this unveiled portion promises a whole which is clearly super-inspired. With its free content , effortless targeted traffic and zero cost , NTH is in a league all its own and has no rival. How could it be rivaled ? It breaks the sound barrier and is close to the last frontier ! The very last frontier will , of course , have a robot or two doing absolutely everything for us , including watching your videos and imitating you.

Saturday morning I received a call that little Aros had been sick through the night and was still feverish and sick. After calling the hospital , checking his fever , and administering some over-the-counter meds , we waited for one of the doctors to call us back. When I saw Aros , it was clear that he was not his usual happy self. We wondered if it might be teething causing his symptoms , as he is definitely cutting some teeth. The doctor let us know that we should bring Aros in to be sure it was nothing serious , so by early afternoon we were on our way to the hospital . </wait.v.60><wait.v.61>" You really should go to the hospital dear , " I said.

I have used the Careworks clinic approximately four times in the past two years. I have always been treated like a human being and not a number. The CRNP is knowledgeable and had a nice bedside manner. The longest I had to wait to be seen is approximately 20 minutes. They take my insurance , send a report to my family doctor and , if need be , they are able to write a prescription which I get filled at the same building ! I highly recommend Careworks.

The blood loss evident on our clothes got us immediate attention and a nurse replaced the bloody paper towels with an elastic band that held a bandage in place. Twenty minutes later we were triaged by a very grumpy and unprofessional nurse who failed to even obtain an accurate history. Worse yet , her unfriendly demeanor caused my 14 year old ' s mood to change from calm and controlled to apprehensive and nervous. After 45 minutes we were escorted to a treatment room. Thirty minutes later we saw a nurse who did nothing more than say hello. As the minutes and hours passed , my son ' s head began to hurt worse and his nerves started to get the best of him. He knew he needed stitches because I told him so when he was bleeding on the hill. He never experienced stitches before so my wife and I reassured him that stitches were not too bad . </wait.v.71><wait.v.72>Thank you , for writing something that was hysterical &amp;endearing &amp;educational all at once.

Right ? Well , if you are , while you 're waiting for their eventual release , join us for FragBU this weekend and play with or against BU staff members and your fellow BuF'ers for two nights of fast and heart pumping matches which can take you from DM , TDM , CTF , vCTF , and even WAR.

We have been waiting so very patiently. We thought we heard him knocking at the door , but when we answered , it was only his friends Wind and Cold. The invitation was sent out long ago , did it get lost in the mail ? I 'm sure Snow knows the way here , he 's been here ma ... </wait.v.76><wait.v.77>Shiver is amazing.

I can ' t wait to read Linger ! </wait.v.77><wait.v.78>Then suddenly the door opened , revealing a tall young man with tousled hair , his white ruffled shirt untucked , holding a candlestick. She entered past him without waiting for an invitation . </wait.v.78><wait.v.79>I love Macleod 's Daughters , I 've watched it from the start. I can handle that its the last session but what p 's me off is that i waited so long for it come back to air , then it disappeared when the olympic 's were on and then we had to wait months for it to come back on and now channel 9 decide to air it on saturday nights just before christmas.Great time and great night to pick now im going to miss out on the next 3 episodes due to christmas parties and no dvd recorder.Its so disappointing that i have to watch repeats of old show during the week and i miss out on the last session of my favorite show.

It is beyond our imagining. It is our guaranteed future as children of God. But now we wait , groaning as we deal with the problems and limitations , the pain and suffering of our current condition; waiting for our full sonship , the redemption of our bodies ( Romans 8 : 23 ) . </wait.v.82><wait.v.83>At the Nathan Bransford Literary Agent site , he put forth the question to his readership. ( I found this link via Google so I wonder if we were both inspired by the Boston.com article or whether there is some correlation readers of all ilks are seeing in the increased releases and possible decline in quality ) . Many reader professed that they were willing to wait for a good book . </wait.v.83><wait.v.84>The psalmist had just said , " I had fainted , unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. " If it had not been for his faith in God , his heart had fainted. But in the confident assurance in God which faith gives , he urges himself and us to remember one thing above all , - to wait upon God. " Wait on the Lord : be strong , and let your heart take courage : yea , wait thou on the Lord. " One of the chief needs in our waiting upon God , one of the deepest secrets of its blessedness and blessing , is a quiet , confident persuasion that it is not in vain; courage to believe that God will hear and help; we are waiting on a God who never could disappoint His people . </wait.v.84><wait.v.85>After what seemed many seasons she began to grow impatient. I did not interrupt their conversation but merely waited patiently to be noticed for my obvious charm . </wait.v.85><wait.v.86>Then , a young man sitting directly across from Uri and me , announced to us all that he 'd nearly cut his foot of with a chain saw. We all looked at him and waited for him to continue. " I was cutting wood with my father and my right foot fell thru the snow and I brought my hand down and the chain saw got hung up on a stick and the saw went thru my foot. " " Man ! " " That musta hurt " the " imbiber " said to him. " Nope , it didn't. I could n't feel a thing ! " The young man stated. " Guess I was in shock or something. But now when I go to bed my foot burns like hell all night long " Everybody shook their heads and waited for the next confession and it was n't long in coming . </wait.v.86><wait.v.87>The girls , my youth pastor and I had a great time last night. Thank you for inspiring our youth. I know that it 's a lot of work , time and commitment to instill sexual purity into them. I talked with them while taking them home about your message and how it affects them and they all agree on waiting until marriage before engaging in any sexual encounters. It was the perfect plan to bring it up with them after seeing your show. They know that they do n't have to be a square to be Christians , but you can be cool and still have fun.I will continue to pray for you and support your World Renown Revolution to changing our youth one at a time. I am excited at what God is doing through your ministry. I 'll be in touch ! </wait.v.87><wait.v.88>I understand why Apple went with AT &amp;T in the beginning of their iPhone release. It was all about network support and at that time AT &amp;T was ahead of Verizon. I wish they had n't signed such a long contract though. I 've told Apple sales people I would go with AT &amp;T if you gave me an iPhone ! ! Their customer service is the worst. I will wait as long as it takes. Apple just needs to realize how many customers they are missing out on then make their decision based on the numbers . </wait.v.88><wait.v.89>This cycle has rendered too many Christians powerless , defeated and not much different than the unsaved people around them. In some cases they are worse off because they pray and then do nothing ... waiting on God to do a miracle ... Meanwhile the unsaved are n't waiting for God so they go ahead and do what ever they can to make a living and in some cases come out looking better than the Church . </wait.v.89><wait.v.90>In the spring of 2007 , we happened to look at the website of another agency , one that our friends were working with. Listed on their waiting child page was the following : Boy , 5 1/2 , congenitally severed left forearm , malformed toes. Some pretty cold words for a whole little person. No photo. We talked to our friends and everyone else , we offered to share our experiences with any family that inquired about him. It was too soon for us , barely six months home with our new son. Just too soon. We very sadly said good-bye to the idea of him as our son . </wait.v.90><wait.v.91>I understand completely about the patience part of being a patient. When I was waiting for results , one of my dearest friends was angry at my docs for not getting back to me sooner. She did not understand why I could wait without becoming upset. Since being diagnosed with NHL five years ago , and breast cancer last year , I can wait for results. Somehow I sort of know what they will be before I hear . </wait.v.91><wait.v.92>The other day after shopping at a local department store for a few mundane items ( hairspray , toilet paper , envelopes , etc. ) I found myself waiting patiently in the checkout lane. Yes , I said patiently waiting. I 'm not normally the most patient person in the world , but when it comes to waiting in lines I really am patient. I think of waiting as a break from rushing around. I have no control over how fast or slow the line moves so I choose not to stress over it. In fact , I think waiting in line could actually be a gift from the universe. I am grateful for any free time and not having to be focused on doing something. Waiting can be a fabulous " living in the now " experience . </wait.v.92><wait.v.93>Of course , wages in our economic system are n't set by fairness , but at least the professionals and tradies get their high pay through genuine supply and demand rather than nepotism. At present we have a shortage of doctors , and that is why the waiting times are so high. With lower pay , we 'd get less doctors. Which means that you 'd be waiting much longer for surgery . </wait.v.93><wait.v.94>A few weeks later , I felt compelled to look at the waiting child profiles on the web again. I knew there were no new ones. But I also liked to see if the children on there had found families. As I logged on , a little face I had never seen before caught my attention. There was something about his eyes; it was like he was saying , Hi Mom , it s me Eli.  I called my husband so he could log on at work. I didn t say much to him other than look at this little boy s picture. He saw it and said , He looks like what I pictured our Eli to look like.  </wait.v.94><wait.v.95>Participants may pay to attend events and have certain expectations of content quality. However , as you ' ve indicated , speaker objectification isn ' t included in the package. I wish you the best of luck at your future events and can ' t wait to see you at SXSW . </wait.v.95><wait.v.96>There are just too many of us I guess. I am 45 and also waiting to die like most of you. I guess we all don ' t know the reason we just want to leave this world. People will tell us there is so much to enjoy and be thankful for in this world. Besides , if we look at ourselves we really have achieved something. But we just feel burned out and tired of life. We are a community . </wait.v.96><wait.v.97>All I have to say is that you guys deserve the fans that you have and you guys were so great waiting for so long to see you was so worth it.. Though I didn ' t get to meet you up close and personal , I did get a hand shake and you got to see the girls.. I was in a black shirt and when you saw them your eyes went bugged.. So I took that as you liked them , so I ' m hoping I get to meet you and then you can meet them as well. But I love you and I love how you always put on a great show . And though there was alot of pushing on the left side all the pushing and everything It was still worth the time that i got to see you guys Oh yeah tell danny that he should wear my scarf I threw up on stage..Take care of your self.. Paula </wait.v.97><wait.v.98>Above I mentioned Chris 's stomach issues. Most of you know that he has a VERY high tolerance for pain. On Mon. the pain was getting worse so I made him go to the doctor. They determined that he was bleeding internally and scheduled him to get scoped the next morning. They discovered 4 bleeding ulsers. Poor Chris , the family stress combined with walking 60 miles and advil probably caused him these problems. We went to Mayo in Rochester for a second opinion and right now he is on medication to try and heal them. He will go back in a couple of months for a check up. We are also waiting on biopsy results so keep your fingers crossed. He is on a no alcohol , non spicy food diet and plan to keep as much stress and negativity out of our lives as possible . </wait.v.98><wait.v.99>Think about , for instance , the 70-week prophecy of Daniel 9 : 24-27 , the prophecy that points to Jesus as the Messiah ( review it if you need to ) . How long was this time period ? What does this tell you about learning to wait for things in God 's time , even if it takes what seems to us a long time ? </wait.v.99><wait.v.100>Take , for example , the Time Bomb. This customer 's temperament is simple : after a lifetime of being waited on hand and foot , the Time Bomb expects everything to come to the table unreasonably fast and efficiently. When it does not , there is likely to be a detonation. Time Bombs are not much of a threat when the pace is slow , but get one in your section on a busy Saturday night among your seven or eight other tables , and his or her ticking will pound in your ears like Edgar Allen Poe 's telltale heart. The way these people explode is as crass as it is absurd; I once had a stockbroker who actually went behind the bar to pour his own drink after determining that he had waited long enough. Like most abusive diners , he was so wrapped up in his own convictions , and so gratified by the apologies of the manager , that he continued to consume drinks from the bar without ever pondering what the aggrieved bartender might have done to them . </wait.v.100><wait.v.101>Why do we so often work against ourselves ? Why do we avoid the very things that we know will make our lives easier and more enjoyable ? These are questions I ask myself every day. From the outside , people think I am doing great. They compliment how patiently I am waiting for my double lung transplant and how well I am preparing for it. But truth be told , I am not really handling it so well. I do n't always do my exercises and am anxious for it already. And the very things that always gave me strength and direction , my prayers and Jewish learning , are also things I have been neglecting. Yet I am not sure why . </wait.v.101><wait.v.102>One reason I stay on this board is to try to reach out to anyone I can , and I try to be very aware of how others are doing around me in those waiting rooms when I go for follow-ups. There were some " angels " along the way for me too , and I will never forget their kind words . </wait.v.102><wait.v.103>Well , Space Mountain , like most Disney rides , carries a big aspect of make-believe. The gimmick is that you 're a " space traveller " about to launch on a galactic journey. As such , the entire ride is designed around this storyline : the building , the paint job , the props , the video clips you watch while waiting in line , and the experience of riding the ride all come together to create , if not a compelling illusion ( it 's still a roller coaster in the dark , and everyone knows it ) , then at least the sensation that the ride is more than the sum of its parts . </wait.v.103><wait.v.104>and for the whole trap discussion i believe Neville set it up with the mannequin but simply lost his mind in that moment and fell into his own trap. this can be proved because right before he gets knocked out you see him start to bleed. the darkseeker are attracted to the scent of blood as soon in his previous trap. and as for the darkseeker having the dogs ready , its possible that he had seen Neville suspended in the daylight and simply was waiting for him with the dogs; knowing that the dogs could roam at dusk . </wait.v.104><wait.v.105>Ive got my wait time window open on the ticketmaster website and it says ive got 10 mins to wait , im buying 3 tickets £ 75 hopefully i will get them. I only need 2 but I am going to sell 1 , could be a good money maker lol. Oh its 8 mins to wait now excited but i better get good seats and i hope they dont sell out. This should be an awesome show . </wait.v.105><wait.v.106>In both Venezuela and the USA , the houses are decorated with Christmas trees , colored lights and many figures of Santa Claus. It is really beautiful. In Venezuela , all people make in their houses a " Nacimiento " , or Nativity Scene. However , in the USA , only Christians and Catholics , about 30 of all people in the USA , have a Nativity Scene in their home. The " Nacimiento " or Nativity Scene is a copy of the town where Jesus was born. In Venezuela , the people wait until December 24th at midnight to put the " Ni o Jesus " in his manger . </wait.v.106><wait.v.107>I don ' t mind waiting for a reasonable amount of time , as long as the host takes good care of us. Meaning , he/she gives us updates on the table and maybe buys a round of drinks when the wait is over 20 minutes. And we better not be rushed through the meal to turn over the table. Ginny </wait.v.107><wait.v.108>EDIT 2 : It 's about 7 : 30 PM , and Adam &amp;Laura have left to the " casino night " event. Sadly , as a reporter , I am unable to attend this function , so instead I will go to sleep ( something I have n't done for about 30 hours ) . Only one other cast sighting -- I saw Creed &amp;" The Scrantones " jump on the elevator. I guess he must have been in a hurry , because he did n't stop or pose for pictures with anyone waiting nearby . </wait.v.108><wait.v.109>You obviously are n't going to be able to avoid this situation in every case. In some cases it will be your friend - Indy backers will be happy they waited until Sunday last weekend. Still , there are lots of situations where you can get yourself an extra point or more in a game that you are confident about. Some experts say that each extra half point you get in a spread adds about 2 percent to your chances of winning. Whether that is accurate or not , it certainly ca n't hurt , especially if you can move the spread off of 3 , 7 , 14 or another potentially annoying number without having to buy a point. Here are four things to consider when trying to find extra value from your bets : </wait.v.109><wait.v.110>As the eyes of a servant looks to the hand of his master; we too wait upon God , and as we wait He will pour His grace and power upon us. If a man prays only a short time and then says : God is not taking care of me. I can no longer wait. I will do things by myself. This man will find himself deserted. We must receive the strength of God to do the work God sets before us . </wait.v.110><wait.v.111>O.K. U can tell Old Uncle Roar..that U are really just land lubbing until after the SD Bolts beat the tar out of the Steelers this weekend ! RIGHT ON BROTHER ... U are preaching to the converted ! ! !

Outdoors in the elements , cold , snowy , eat a greasy cheesburger , grab a cold beer , have a laugh , and make the most of a wintry weekend. Jen A where are U ? ? ? </wait.v.111><wait.v.112>I agree ! I waited tables in college and though I wouldn ' t necessarily do it again there was a fun , social aspect to it . </wait.v.112><wait.v.113>I don ' t care about this film maybe cause I had the book and also I can wait for it on DVD. But I do think that it is a great move by the studios ( WB I think ) to make it come out now with all this holiday films out. Because if you are like me you don ' t care at lot about holiday films . </wait.v.113><wait.v.114>It is , then , because Christians do not know their relation to God of absolute poverty and helplessness , that they have no sense of the need of absolute and unceasing dependence , or the unspeakable blessedness of continual waiting on God. But when once a believer begins to see it , and consent to it , that he by the Holy Spirit must each moment receive what God each moment works , waiting on God becomes his brightest hope and joy. As he apprehends how God , as God , as Infinite Love , delights to impart His own nature to His child as fully as He can , how God is not weary of each moment keeping charge of his life and strength , he wonders that he ever thought otherwise of God than as a God to be waited on all the day. God unceasingly giving and working; His child unceasingly waiting and receiving : this is the blessed life . </wait.v.114><wait.v.115>I turned back to the chicken. It was ready. I emptied it into a waiting bowl , then swept a pile of chopped vegetables into the empty pan. They made a satisfying hiss as they settled into the boiling chicken grease. " Youre probably right , " I said. She was. Her father had been having some fairly serious heart problemsno need to spring something like that on him. I thought about it a bit more as I pushed the greens around in the pan. " But Id think this would help you in the divorce. I mean , hes basically just gone on official record as being totally insane. Id think on that basis they could rule that hes not competent to represent himself.

A half a league away she could see Varrus and his Lt.s ' herding the mercenaries toward the flanks with shouts and waving swords. As the disorganized men parted and quit the field to the left and right they revealed a new phalanx already formed and waiting patiently for the order to advance up the hill . </wait.v.116><wait.v.117>Andy !

If I know Crystal she will be driving soon and it will not matter if she is supposed to or not. That is how Crytal is. She has a seizure before Haleigh went missing AND claimed the reason it took her so long ( five hours ) to show after Haleigh went missing was she could not drive and has to wait for someone to drive her , because of her seizure. Guess what , the DMV will not let a person who has a seizure drive for one year . </wait.v.118><wait.v.119>Andrew , Thanks for all of the great music that you ' ve given us over the years !

I refer back on the website and book when I feel alone or attacked , so that I know that I am not alone and others are striving for the best as well. It seems like so many people around me are choosing to not wait , but I will say that I am strong and not weak. God cares and is faithful to His word and that 's what I believe. I applaud you Dr. Lindsay Marsh for boldly addressing this matter which has made it easier for myself and others to be proactive about waiting for God 's best for our lives.

People expect God to express delivery or overnight their prayer requests too.

As Christians , we need to learn to wait with faith that God has our best interest at heart and with hope . </wait.v.142><wait.v.143>The scientists then kept track of these children into their teenage years.

There is a double answer. The one is this. God is a wise husbandman , who " waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it ( James 5 : 7 ) . He can not gather the fruit until it is ripe. He knows when we are spiritually ready to receive the blessing to our profit and His glory. Waiting in the sunshine of His love is what will ripen the soul for His blessing. Waiting under the cloud of trial , that breaks in showers of blessing , is as necessary. Be assured that if God waits longer than you could wish , it is only to make the blessing doubly precious. God waited four thousand years , until the fullness of time , before He sent His Son. Our times are in His hands. He will avenge His elect speedily. He will make haste for our help and not delay one hour too long . </wait.v.144><wait.v.145>And I bet you have been Twittering already whilst Neil is waiting for his bacon sandwich !

Concentrating deeply through her pain and misery she listens to the approaching footsteps. Step , step , step ... Like that of a cat stalking its prey her head follows the passing soldier. After waiting for a few seconds she quietly slips out of the alley and onto the street. The illuminated sidewalk is not her favourite hunting ground , but it will have to do. With the patience of a saint and the intentions of a demon she follows the soldier , silent like a leaf in a breeze , glaring at his back , but not too hard , or he might notice. He 's still carrying that stupid notepad of his , she notices. When he is dead she will take a peak at what 's in there anyway , she decides , wetting her lips. Suddenly the soldier stops in his tracks. Venn immediately halts mid stride , not that it does her much good , as the soldier turns his upper torso to look at her. Venn is startled for a moment as her carefully laid out plan of attack falls to pieces . </wait.v.155><wait.v.156>Three years ago , a beautiful blonde Sheltie named Jolynn came to stay at the Bare 's Den.

So we ' ve already had Germaine Greer in The Guardian go on about Ian McKellen dropping his trousers to display his impressive genitalia to the audience ( which she says was for many of us the only memorable moment in the production ) , and a big feature in The Independent about Nunn ' s folly in keeping the critics at bay , in which Adrian Hamilton writes that Nunn seems to have absorbed too much of the old king ' s foolishness although not - if reports coming out of the RSC headquarters are to be believed - much of his fondness . </wait.v.159><wait.v.160>This was fresh air of a reminder.

This tale from Korea is universal -- a small child waits for Mama at the station , asking the conductor if he has seen her. The conductor has n't , but cautions the child to wait a little farther from the tracks. It is cold and snowy but the child waits patiently until finally Mama comes. In the last wordless spread , we see the small hand in a mother 's firm clasp as they walk away from us. The art and text are so authentic , so real , that this book is best published in a bilingual edition that respects and honors those traditions. The Korean setting gives it special appeal to a growing demographic segment. The institutional market is especially hungry for bilingual books in languages beyond Spanish . </wait.v.166><wait.v.167>" I wait for the Lord , my soul waits , and in His word I do hope " ( Psa 130 : 5 ) . Waiting on God doesn ' t mean passivity or keeping our minds blank. This may attract the devil because he keeps roaming about to occupy vacant and well-swept houses ( Lk 11 : 24-26 ) . We must feed richly on the Word of God during seasons of waiting on God. This is what Jesus did during the forty days He spent in the desert before He began His public ministry. There must always be an open Bible before us when we kneel down to wait on God. The time of waiting on God can also be used to ruminate the truths we study during our regular meditations of the Scriptures . </wait.v.167><wait.v.168>And then one day , more than a year later , that had changed. Will had again been waiting on deck , gazing off at the nothingness at the end of the dock , trying to imagine what Elizabeth and William might be doing at that moment , when his father asked him to accompany him ashore. He had learned early on that as long as he stayed on the dock he would n't be violating any of the restrictions of his duty. Stepping onto the beach , however , would result in his being bound to stay in the land of the dead forever. And so he had silently followed his father down the gangplank and towards the shore. He had n't gone more than twenty yards before she came into view. He remembered thinking how odd it was that he had n't noticed her standing there before that , as he had been looking in that direction.

For nearly four hundred years the Jews waited for the Messiah , and when he arrived all but a few missed him. They had learned to occupy their time so well , that they had lost the ability to perceive difference. They had their system rationalized down to the smallest detail; nothing escaped their notice. Nothing and everything . </wait.v.204><wait.v.205>If we value hearing from God and are assured that we will hear His voice we can muster the determination to wait patiently for His voice. Waiting to hear from God is never easy. Especially when we are hurting in the area of Christian dating relationships. We wonder why can ' t God just make this better NOW ? </wait.v.205><wait.v.206>The deep need for this waiting on God lies equally in the nature of man and the nature of God. God , as Creator , formed man , to be a vessel in which He could show forth His power and goodness. Man was not to have in himself a fountain of life , or strength , or happiness : the ever-living and only living One was each moment to be the Communicator to him of all that he needed. Man 's glory and blessedness was not to be independent , or dependent upon himself , but dependent on a God of such infinite riches and love. Man was to have the joy of receiving every moment out of the fulness of God. This was his blessedness as an unfallen creature . </wait.v.206><wait.v.207>was the ticket pick-up at the Congressional offices.

As the navigator , I frequently have conversations with people on the fly with three other cars waiting to hear what I found out. As such , my ability to absorb a language quickly has become paramount. While in Australia , I am spending time every day studying the essential things I may need to say or hear. I learned a lesson the hard way in Latin America. I knew for months that I would be traveling in Spanish-speaking countries , but with everything going on before the expedition departure , I neglected to study any Spanish. That came back to haunt me many times , and I stared at people blankly while trying to receive directions. In fact , I never even bought a phrasebook before we left.

What will make you put down illicit sex and drinking ? What will make you wait years with the person you love the most until you go to the altar ? What will make you leave friends that you grew up with but are pushing you away from God ? What would make you put down your life ? The answer is the power of His grace. God is looking for a pure body. He doesn ' t want perfection , He wants holiness. When you tell Him I love you , make sure that mouth has been holy and not kissing people you shouldn ' t be. He doesn ' t want you to worship Him from your lips but from your heart . </wait.v.217><wait.v.218>My sister and I went to town to try to see her , but the N.K.V.D. chased us away.

Amanda had been up 6-2 , 4-1 in the second and Anke fought back to win the second 6-4 and then again , Amanda was up 4-1 in the third and Anke came back to win 7-5.

If I were to drop out for 12 months I could qualify as an in-state student and save thousands. I didn ' t want to drop out , but my wallet said otherwise. Now , for the first time in my life , I was not involved with school or music directly. I was working 3 part time jobs to save for tuition. While I was waiting to become in-state qualified my wife auditioned again and this time was accepted. I , on the other hand , was finding I had to drag myself to the practice room.

One thing that really , REALLY makes a huge difference in the amount of money saved is to plan ahead. Plan your meals for the week , fortnight , or month even ! That way you have a good shopping list and you buy what you actually need instead of " spur of the moment " purchases. You also end up having the ingredients in the house when you need them. Planning household purchases in advance really helps the budget too because then you can put away money for something which you NEED ( watch that one ) instead of going into debt for it. Interest on credit cards is nasty ! Another benefit of saving up for needs is that sometimes in the process of waiting you discover it somewhere else for a lower price ( like at a garage sale ) or you find out that it was n't such a " need " after all ! </wait.v.225><wait.v.226>'There is no chance that he breaks my serve in normal conditions.

Let us be assured that while we wait , God is working in us to prepare us for the good things that lie ahead. Let us not doubt that we shall see them.

In that scenario , chances are , quality will suffer. But if an author is able to do that and still put forth their best effort , then he/she should do it. For some authors , having them wait x-amount of time between books doesn ' t ensure higher quality any more than forcing an author to produce too many books too quickly ensures a happy fan base ( again , in my humble opinion ) . There ' s no one size fits all . </wait.v.236><wait.v.237>In this passage , we have two precious thoughts. The one , that it is the language of God 's people who have been unitedly waiting on Him.

Waiting becomes then the only way to the experience of a full salvation , the only way , truly , to know God as the God of our salvation. All the difficulties that are brought forward as keeping us back from full salvation , have their cause in this one thing : the defective knowledge and practice of waiting upon God. All that the Church and its members need for the manifestation of the mighty power of God in the world , is the return to our true place , the place that belongs to us , both in creation and redemption , the place of absolute and unceasing dependence upon God. Let us strive to see what the elements are that make up this most blessed and needful waiting upon God : it may help us to discover the reasons why this grace is so little cultivated , and to feel how infinitely desirable it is that the Church , that we ourselves , should at any price learn its blessed secret . </wait.v.240><wait.v.241>I absolutely hate cold weather and always thought that I would avoid it at all costs.

I waited six hours in an emergency room , in horrible pain while watching a parade of people with bumps and bruises come in the door and be taken ahead of me. It was really insulting considering that I have what is considered one of the better insurance plans in the area. But if someone comes in with no insurance and needs a translator , then they are rushed in to keep from seeming to " discriminate " . This has to stop , the services are already strained to the breaking point , do people have to die waiting in order for the people in charged to wake up ? Wait , they already are dying.

The " line " funneled into this mob , but I asked multiple people in the mob how long they 'd been waiting and they said , " We just got here. " In other words , the line was meaningless.

You are as beautiful as we imagined you to be ! We can not wait to see you so we can embrace you with all our " hugs &amp;lovies " .

If she thinks gay marriage is bad , wait until Junior hears about all the mega-pervs lurking about in their crew. I sure hope they do n't go to the New Life Church . </wait.v.269><wait.v.270>These considerations suggest a need to establish distributive justice principles for providers that are consistent with , but ultimately subordinate to , the public interest. Patients value highly the freedom to choose their doctors. But providing the public and referring general practitioners with information about the track record of all providers ( procedural report cards , for example ) and differences in waiting times might lead to different choices and , quite possibly , shorter waits for at least some patients . </wait.v.270><wait.v.271>Hope this note finds your family , sheps included just fine. Over a year has gone by and I must say Kyle is a dog I am proud to own. Kyle and I have gone thru the good and bad stuff but Kyle is always there to cheer me up , he is with me day and night. I would love to get another one but I must wait for now . </wait.v.271><wait.v.272>Let ' s turn to the historical passage which the Psalmist had in mind , at least in part , when he wrote Psalm 106 : 13f and see if we can glean more insight into this matter of man ' s tendency to lustful cravings rather than trustful waiting. The children of Israel were complaining of adversity rather than waiting confidently in God ' s goodness . </wait.v.272><wait.v.273>Since I discovered fanfiction a few years ago , I have been hooked ! Sometimes I read fanfiction before the actual show is on tv. This usually results in disappointment in the show. Because the characters and relations are so different ' in real life ' than in the fanfiction stories. Womens Murder Club was one these shows. And this virtual season is really very well written. I really enjoy it. As I discovered it a bit late in the season I was able to read a few ( about 6 ) episodes in one go. The waiting for the next episode was very long after that. The dialogue , the emotions , the humour , all very well done ( still laugh about the rolling pin scene ) . Can ' t wait to find out how it will all come to a close in the last episode. I would love a next season ! </wait.v.273><wait.v.274>Still waiting ! 3 packages due 12/22 and 12/24 have been out for delivery since the 24th. I agree with everyone who says this is shameful and the weather excuses are no longer valid. What consequences will UPS face ? Anyone know ? </wait.v.274><wait.v.275>I could n't wait for a time to once again give you the HONOR and RESPECT and Glory and Titilation of another word from me. You may address me as " Your Royal HINNEY ASS " and please treat me with Holie Dignity and above all , be discreet with our relationship. I LUV your doggies and your vids of them. They are SOOOO CUTE and cuddly and Coco OBVIOUSLY LUVS you two VERY MUCH , but finds time to GROWL at your other dog over a bone that was not hers. Have you told her that , " The Bones ALWAYS SEEM CHEWIER on the other side of the dog bed border , ( when the other dog has them and controls them ! " ) She needs some counseling about THAT issue and some POOP counseling as well ! For Jesus Sake , you just CA N'T POOP EVERYWHERE ! Otherwise HE may not Listen to Coco 's prayers unless Coco can get a HANDLE on her POOP Problem ! Well. POOPY DOOP for tonight then ! </wait.v.275><wait.v.276>i got a bb curve for free with rebate this week for my foray into " smart phones " ( other than my lovely sidekick i had a few years ago ) ... sooo i will be getting on the AT &amp;T network for when they come out with a lower priced iphone ... they say they are but i will wait patiently ! </wait.v.276><wait.v.277>When Darcy lowered the newspaper to reach for some tea , his vision was filled with the petulant face of his son. Darcy brought the newspaper back up again. He waited some moments before letting the corner of the paper droop. No Fitzwilliam was still there and the look on his son 's face did not inspire Darcy with confidence . </wait.v.277><wait.v.278>Ultimately , Friday , after a last government-paid lunch , they came back with what was clearly a compromise 5-1 verdict that my lady was 51 at fault ( 5/6 is OK in civil cases in my state ) . Which we counted as a victory; it got me lunch or something besides a pat on the back from the senior partner. Anything less than 100 liablity for the lady turning left was counted as a victory. Moreover , I got to bill all the time I sat in the courthouse waiting , drinking coffee , reading newspapers , reorganizing my files , and shooting the bull about baseball , politics , you name it , with all the lawyers I met , and generally killing time. I for one have never been able to drive my attention to another case while waiting on a jury . </wait.v.278><wait.v.279>That morning one of my closest friends called while waiting for her flight at an airport terminal in Tampa.

To my surprise when I checked in the Blueotooth menu on the iPhone , all my old paired devices were still there and sure enough it connect to the BMW bluetooth automatically. I waited until the signal meter appeared along the bottom of the iDrive screen showing the pairing was successful and then I opened up the iDrive communication page to list my A-Z of contacts and they all appeared briefly ! </wait.v.281><wait.v.282>I suppose I 'll probably have to wait until the next iPod Touch , but even then , Apple will probably say " No iPod user would want to pay extra for THAT feature " and leave out something I wanted. Seems to me , if Apple wants to count iPhones in their iPod statistics , they have to allow the iPhone to be used solely as an iPod , right ? </wait.v.282><wait.v.283>We had an hour layover between train connections in Interlaken Ost. We walked out to a park by a river , which was lovely. M didn ' t want to leave the bench there. She was tired after the long trip. Bruce stayed with her while I explored further down the street toward Interlaken West. It was hotel row with lots of pretty hotels dating from the late 1800 ' s to early 1900 ' s. The further I walked the more " tourist-trappish " it became full of Americans , loads of Japanese tour groups , cheap quality souvenir shops. I even overheard some pick-pocketers passing by discussing technique ( " You have to wait until they ' re all grouped up ... " ) . </wait.v.283><wait.v.284>We went for long walks and runs in the park , car rides , stops for ice cream ( I only got the cone because " ice cream is bad for dogs " you said ) , and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day. Gradually , you began spending more time at work and on your career , and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently , comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments , never chided you about bad decisions , and romped with glee at your homecomings , and when you fell in love. She , now your wife , is not a " dog person " -- still I welcomed her into our home , tried to show her affection , and obeyed her. I was happy because you were happy. Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness , how they smelled , and I wanted to mother them , too . </wait.v.284><wait.v.285>What I do believe out of the story is the wait and see comment. I think that ' s what we all have to do is just wait and see . </wait.v.285><wait.v.286>" Do n't worry. I see you 're a very honest boy and that you really do n't want to go without paying.

I am happy to report that the superintendent decided in our favor " in deference to the strong feelings set forth in [ the ] letter. " Serena will continue to come down the hill and wait for me at the corner . </wait.v.288><wait.v.289>When we wait on the Lord , we give up the control our flesh wants to have and we let the Holy Spirit be in charge. Thus , letting the Spirit triumph over the flesh and letting God be in charge. When our flesh is not winning , then we allow the Spirit to lead us in God ' s way and we end up having a much better time of becoming who we are supposed to be through Christ . </wait.v.289><wait.v.290>There was a lot of debate amongst my friends about where to go to be assured of getting product at launch. Richard , for instance , was a proponent of finding the small , out-of-the-way AT &amp;T store in , like , rural Idaho - someplace without much of a line. For my money , though , the U Village Apple Store was the only place to go : as the flagship Seattle store , it was guaranteed a good supply of the phones ... and it 's where the party was going to be. ( I mean , waiting in line for Star Wars is as much the experience as the movie itself , right ? ) </wait.v.290><wait.v.291>I can not believe people are still going on about the colleges limiting training places ( or the AMA limiting medical school places; what the ... where on earth do you get that from ! ) . This may have been true some time in the distant past , i do n't know , but it has n't happened for a long time. The reality is that the colleges have been urgently to train more specialists. But the problem is you need patients going thru the public system for the trainee registrars. The long waiting lists not only represent patients not being treated , they represent doctors not being trained . </wait.v.291><wait.v.292>I felt the attention and treatment provided to me by Ken Dotson was excellent ! It ' s wonderful to be able to have service available every day without waiting weeks for an appointment.

Odds are it will work in Snow Leopard . </wait.v.293><wait.v.294>Of all the people they knew who were inside , it was Travers and Hank that they had to be most wary of. They couldnt be made aware that anything was amiss until the last minute. If they were to put the fire out magically before the authorities arrived , all hope of rescuing Buffy could be ruined. So Willow sat and waited for the clock to show the time to be eleven minutes past six . </wait.v.294><wait.v.295>Aunti Val , Uncle Jojo &amp;Mimi , We loved looking at your website ! We can not wait to meet our new cousin. We are looking forward to seeing the family this August. Take care til then. Love , Bro and Bran </wait.v.295><wait.v.296>A couple more months passed. Lian was doing great with her sisters. Boyd and I were convinced that the idea of adopting another child was not crazy after all. We decided to go for it. I filled out the waiting child form and , you know what , checked the albinism box as one of the possible medication conditions that we would be open to. Very quickly Deniece called us , informing us that a four-year-old boy named Zou Yue Xiao in Beijing with albinism was available.  We told her : Send his information to us and let us take a look at him.  Zou Yue Xiao was a very cute boy and from the information we were provided , he sounded like a great kid . </wait.v.296><wait.v.297>Never has there been a more appropriate name for something-the waiting room. That is indeed what you do there and usually for longer periods of time than shorter. Either the doctor is running ... </wait.v.297><wait.v.298>" i was in here both tuesday and wednesday , but the first day no one was available and the second i waited for 45 minutes and then could not wait longer since i had to pick my son up from school. i signed in both times so there is a record of my being here. " </wait.v.298><wait.v.299>The gameplay in-game is , well , hit or miss. While you do have tremendous force powers by the end of the game , I stuck with only two or three through the game with only minimum usage of the other powers. Some , like the lightsaber throw , while pretty awesome to look at and use in single combat , put you at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that if you miss you 're left without an opportunity to attack or defend while you wait for your saber to return. The controls in battle work pretty well , and you 'll find most of the enjoyment in this game throwing stormtroopers around as if they 're nothing , but the developers tried to pigeonhole platforming elements in it as well , and they do n't work so terribly well. The reason for that , I believe , is that the jumping mechanic in TFU requires precise timing , and between the camera not adjusting correctly and the fact that you jump 'so far ' and that 's it , make lining up and judging distances a pain. For the force controls , after about the first hour , I 'd gotten it down pretty much pat with only minimal confusion after new abilities were added afterwards . </wait.v.299><wait.v.300> Rhoda : No , they still think Obama went too far left on the economics , whereas I think it ' s fairly clear that he didn ' t go far enough particularly with the stimulus; and whatever losses the Dems suffer in the fall will have far more to do with the economy than anything else. In retrospect from a purely short-term political standpoint he probably should have also gone after the bankers first and pushed through the banking reform and waited on health care ( though that may well have meant no HCR ) . A lot of the teabagging anger ( at least as much as can be attributed to tacit racism ) derives from the sense that Obama is bailing out Wall Street and shitting on mainstream . </wait.v.300><wait.v.301>The perfect way to start a weekend morning , fuel for the day ahead , and just easy enough to help you remain in the haze of the night before. Just boil some water , carefully place eggs in , making sure not to overcrowd , and wait 3-4 minutes. Simplicity at its finest. If you would like a full rundown of my Sunday brunch , check the Daily Specials page . </wait.v.301><wait.v.302>My experience was that when I went back for call back 2nd mammo focusing on the one side , the tech left the room and the radiologist came back in and stood ( and he was like 6'5 " ) as I was sitting straining my neck to look up at him , that I needed a biopsy and the Nurse Practioner would explain everything and left. Stunned by his words , the tears ran down my cheeks. The mammo tech acutally was very kind and supportive. She then walked me to the changing room/waiting room for mammos and waited for me. She then walked me straight to the Nurse Practioners office. I was so grateful. I saw another person I knew from work and just could n't have sat there falling all apart. All the suggestions we can make can help another person going through these stressful , anxious moments ! ! Speak up ! You may just help someone else ! ! ! ! </wait.v.302><wait.v.303>Do not be disappointed when God ' s promise is not yet fulfilled to you. God tests us to see how long we will wait on Him. Joseph waited for 13 years. God put dreams in Joseph ' s heart but he had to spend 13 years in Egypt as a slave. After all his waiting , with toils and suffering , God made Joseph the prime minister of the whole nation of Egypt. One can only imagine Joseph ' s sadness in his heavy season of waiting . </wait.v.303><wait.v.304>The environment during the lunch rush is loud and chaotic. The lines may seem long at first but they move quickly. This is not the sort of place where the guy taking your order is going to patiently wait for you while you get your shit together. And do n't even think of playing 20 questions with these guys -- they aim to keep things moving , and they 'll simply pass you over and go on to the next patron . </wait.v.304><wait.v.305>All the " normal " amenities of the normally well-appointed waiting room had been reduced to a bare minimum to make room for extra folding chairs. The magazines , coffee machine , tea maker and free fruit basket had been removed along with the television and end tables and plants. Every spare inch of space was greatly needed . </wait.v.305><wait.v.306>OH MY GOSH ! First of all , I loved loved loved how the episode started. I never would have guessed that the voice over was radio comentary from the state championship that DAN lost 18 years ago. That was pure genius ! And when Haley was hit by the Daunte , I was just so shocked ! b/c that could have easily had been Nathan , but Haley pushed him out of the way. And then Dan stood up for Nathan by taking his place saying he killed Daunte. I thought that was so sweet but then I thought that Dan deserved it b/c of Keith. But since he 's mayor , you know he 's gon na get it easy. And then Lucas going into cardiac arrest ! We all know that he and Haley are gon na be okay but how is the baby ? I 'm hoping it lives even though it may be defected or something when its born but it does n't look likely. Wow , I can not wait til next week ! </wait.v.306><wait.v.307>We adopted Buster ( FKA Butler ) in October and could n't have asked for a more perfect addition to our family. Buster and my teenage son are completely devoted to each other. If they are not running around the park playing fetch they are curled up on the sofa enjoying quiet time. My only regret is that we waited over three months after first </wait.v.307><wait.v.308>The thought was n't new , only new to me. Solomon penned some wise advice in the last chapter of Ecclesiastes : " Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth , before the evil days come and the years draw nigh when you shall say , I have no pleasure in them; before life ebbs , beauty fades , fortune fails , and poverty returns after prosperity ... Remember Him before the silver cord is cut off and the golden bowl is broken and the pitcher is broken at the fountain or the wheel is broken at the cistern " ( Ecclesiastes 12 : 1-2 , 6 , Lamsa translation ) . Here was a living example standing before me admitting he had waited until the end of his life to do what he should have done at the beginning . </wait.v.308><wait.v.309>Getting into clubs , on the other hand , is another story. Queueing in Canada is pretty strict and even letting " late-arriving friends " into line with you can get you called out. Frace was the other extreme , where it was not uncommon for a group of 10 to materialize at the last moment and merge with that one friend that was in line in front of you , with no complaint. In the USA , it was less of an issue ( most of the clubs I were going to in Chicago did n't have crazy-long lines ) . In Berlin , it was generally OK if the number of people you were letting in was less than the number of people already waiting in line ( unspoken rulke of thumb , here , do n't quote me on it ) . But at certain Berlin clubs ( e.g. , Berghain ) , the bouncers repeatedly scan the lineup and sometimes bounce you to the back of the line if you 're merging into a " friend 's space. " On the other hand , the bouncers at these same clubs might also recognize you as a regular and take you directly to the front , without much complaint from the lineup . </wait.v.309><wait.v.310>As we wait in long lines this Advent season , or as we wait for anything really , I think it is important that we remember the waiting of those expecting the Messiah , and always wait with patience , humility , and expectant hope in a state of prayer. I know it is difficult , but especially during Advent , waiting prayerfully and patiently , in the manner of our Lord and his blessed Mother , is not only a good spiritual discipline , but could also lower our risk of holiday-induced blood pressure. It seems like we 're all waiting for something , so why not use these experiences to enhance our Advent disciplines by prayerfully waiting , joining our prayers with Isaiah , Zechariah , and all the saints ? </wait.v.310><wait.v.311>Apply this to the prayer that follows : " Deliver me from all my transgressions. " You have prayed to be delivered from temper , or pride , or self-will. It is as if it is in vain. May it not be that you have had your own thoughts about the way or the extent of Gods doing it , and have never waited on the God of glory , according to the riches of His glory , to do for you what hath not entered the heart of man to conceive ? Learn to worship God as the God who doeth wonders , who wishes to prove in you that He can do something supernatural and divine. Bow before Him , wait upon Him , until your soul realizes that you are in the hands of a divine and almighty worker. Consent but to know what and how He will work; expect it to be something altogether godlike , something to be waited for in deep humility , and received only by His divine power. Let , the , " And now , Lord , what wait I for ? My hope is in Thee " become the spirit of every longing and every prayer. He will in His time do His work . </wait.v.311><wait.v.312>Let no one who seeks to learn the blessed art of waiting on God , wonder if at first the attempt to wait on Him only reveals more of sin and darkness. Let no one despair because unconquered sins , evil thoughts , or great darkness appear to hide God 's face. Was not , in His own beloved Son , the gift and bearer of His mercy on Calvary , the mercy as hidden and lost in the judgment ? Oh , submit and sink down deep under the judgment of your every sin. Judgment prepares the way and breaks out in wonderful mercy. It is written , " Zion shall be redeemed with judgment " ( Isa. 1 : 27 ) . Wait on God , in the faith that His tender mercy is working out His redemption in the midst of judgment. Wait for Him; He will be gracious to you . </wait.v.312><wait.v.313>At that moment , Wilson 's cell phone rang. Picking it up , he saw that it was Susan , and when he took the call she told him she was almost there. He lifted his jacket from the back of the chair , and went downstairs to wait in the lobby . </wait.v.313><wait.v.314> Well , if it ain ' t the Dynamic Duo , or should I say trio ? Is this ravishing beauty with you dudes ? Without waiting for an answer , he took one of Samantha ' s hands with a flourish and kissed the back of it lightly. Welcome to The Pits , lovely lady. Anything you would like is most surely yours , or my name isn ' t Huggy Bear. </wait.v.314><wait.v.315>I miss the girls back in Riverside and always think of them when I go to the doggie park and see really big red husky dogs there. I am still a little afraid of the big dogs so I usually play with the little ones. All the people at Doggie Park always want to talk to daddy. I think it 's something about me ? Daddy even said he met a very nice lady named Mary who has been talking to you about a puppy. I ca n't wait to get a new friend like me ! </wait.v.315><wait.v.316>Yes I have seen that site before. They made the same claim like a year or two ago and we have not seen them actually produce anything yet. I think it is a great idea but I would wait for some production before ordering </wait.v.316><wait.v.317>Another friend has a proposal out for a series of book completely unlike anything she ' s written before. She loves this project more than anything else she ' s ever worked on. She ' s in paroxysms waiting to see if it sells. What if it doesn ' t ? Will she be stuck writing books like the ones she ' s been writing and is now bored of ? Will it torpedo her entire career if this new series doesn ' t sell ? Aaaarghhhh ! ! She is in a total state and the proposal ' s only been out a few days . . . </wait.v.317><wait.v.318>I loved Evita at the first night at first sight , but seeing it each successive time has allowed my enthusiasm for it to grow still deeper and richer , just as the production has , too. I ' m thrilled both by the operatic grandeur of Michael Grandage ' s incredibly rich and opulent staging , and by the seductive choreography of Rob Ashford which ( though it steals both a little and sometimes a lot from his ' Havana ' and ' Luck Be a Lady ' steps from Guys and Dolls ) weaves a tapestry of tango-inflected movement around the show as nothing since the original Grand Hotel ( as opposed to the Grandage one at the Donmar ) did. But most of all , I ' m thrilled by the firebrand performance of Elena Roger in the title role. She ' s no great beauty and her articulation is sometimes as indistinct as her voice is sometimes shrill; but there ' s such presence and vibrancy that she offers one of the most exciting musical theatre leading performances I have ever seen. I can ' t wait to see it again this Friday . </wait.v.318><wait.v.319> So sell the house or rent it and hit the road. Take your job with you.

I sure hope so , I like Her , Dream Empress and Justwhistledixie to complete the Tri , We shall see ! Also , Have a hunch on a the tenth at Gulfstream today , Love " Miss Match " , At a M/L of 6-1 , She would have been a great play , But , With 7 scratches , She might go off as the favorite ? Still like her , Though ... </wait.v.320><wait.v.321>We legitimately cry out Maranatha , Come Lord ! , with St. Paul. When God the Word became man in Christ , celebrated on Christmas day , the world was sanctified. Something in the fabric of the cosmos shifted as creation became a fitting vehicle for God 's redemptive work. Human experiences have been sanctified as well , commemorated in our Church Year. Yes , as the season of Advent shows , even waiting has become sanctified . </wait.v.321><wait.v.322>Because it rarely , if ever , is on. What you ' ve put off for a month can inevitably be put off for another month. Or you wait for the magic of the New Year ' s resolution to kick in , and then you realize that it ' s January fifth and nothing has happened because what you want to do requires work , not magic . </wait.v.322><wait.v.323>I also just finished waiting years for Isobelle Carmody ' s The Stone Key- the latest in her Obernewtyn series. I think the wait between books was something like 9 or 10 years. I couldn ' t have been more excited to read it , though , and had it shipped over from Australia the second it was published . </wait.v.323><wait.v.324>wow , they use to talk about the angry white male ... from what i just saw , those guys should run for cover. She really seems like an angry women. I know ... If I were running for office I would have to retract that statement because the Rove gang would call it sexist. But come on America , she had no idea about the Bush doctrine , and got really upset that she was called on it. Maybe she shoud wait 8 years and take on Hillary . </wait.v.324><wait.v.325>Now that would serve them Iraqis well if all we leave behind is a corporate presence ! Before you know it there will be lines outside of Best Buy and Circuit City waiting for the after-holy-day sales . </wait.v.325><wait.v.326>Danielle Johnson , 29 , of Wheelersburg , Ohio , was among the Black Friday veterans. She has enjoyed the craziness for seven to eight years. She used to arrive at 4 a.m. , but any idea of sleep has been erased. This year 's arrival time was midnight. By 4 : 44 a.m. , she was sitting in the floor waiting to grab a gift bag when Victoria 's Secret opened 16 minutes later. She already had made purchases at The Disney Store , Bath and Body Works and Claire 's . </wait.v.326><wait.v.327>She took him on a quick tour of the achingly-clean , modest little house and then said , We have to go now. She had closed both bedroom doors. He didnt ask to see those rooms , but only nodded. He could afford to wait until she was ready . </wait.v.327><wait.v.328>If you want to see how-freakin'-unbelievable the iPhone is , take 20 minutes and swing on over to Apple.com for this guided tour.

Humphrey was waiting on the front doorstep empty-handed and alone , snorting steam from his nose </wait.v.329><wait.v.330>We brought Evey home about a month ago now and we are so glad we did ! She is a truly a great dog. How she lasted 3 years without finding a family we just do n't know - but we 're glad she waited for us. She 's had all her vaccinations updated at Rye-Harrison Veterinary Hospital , and they are amazed at how well she 's doing even with her old leg injury. It does n't stop her from wrestling with her older brother Buddy ! Thanks again for keeping Evey for us. Mary Beth Dale and Wes Griffin </wait.v.330><wait.v.331>Sexual compatibility is , IMO , important in a marriage sometimes it ' s really REALLY important. For a lot of men , sex is the physical manifestation of the love in the relationship; many women often accept other forms of care as demonstrations/manifestations of the love in a relationship. The real downside to celibacy before marriage is that quite often , women find that the men who have been so considerate and respectful actually are either gay , or have low or no no sex drives , which the women did NOT bargain for nor want. The men may also find a downside I personally know two men who waited , at the request of the brides-to-be , only to find out after the wedding that the brides in question had no interest in EVER consummating their marriages . </wait.v.331><wait.v.332>Damam : is translated " to be become silent and still , " " silently waiting with a quiet trust or of quieting oneself , resting , being silent or being still.

I am going over the letters , the vowels , the sounds and let me tell you , for those who have never read Hebrew , it can be a little tricky. A lot tricky in some places. But now , I am attempting to use my study book alone , practice on my own , get over my fear of sounding ridiculous or making mistakes. I am new again. I am five again. I am an adult again , a bit wiser and surer. I am not afraid. I read and learn and am not afraid. You see , while you wait for a transplant , you can often feel somewhat afraid , somewhat vulnerable , with your life dangling on a phone call and your well-being dependant on a healthy mind/body/spiritual balance . </wait.v.338><wait.v.339>If you say that you are afraid of deceiving yourself with vain hope , because you do not see or feel any warrant in your present state for such special expectations , my answer is , it is God , who is the warrant for your expecting great things. Oh , do learn the lesson. You are not going to wait on yourself to see what you feel and what changes come to you. You are going to WAIT ON GOD , to know first , WHAT HE IS , and then , after that , what He will do. The whole duty and blessedness of waiting on God has its root in this , that He is such a blessed Being , full , to overflowing , of goodness and power and life and joy , that we , however wretched , can not for any time come into contact with Him , without that life and power secretly , silently beginning to enter into him and blessing him. God is Love ! That is the one only and all-sufficient warrant of your expectation. Love seeketh out its own : Gods love is just His delight to impart Himself and His blessedness to His children . </wait.v.339><wait.v.340>I submitted an adoption application to Teresa Cotton.

Two days later I started making my way to the hill station of McLeod Ganj where I have many friends and where I remained for the last month of that last trip. But Im not keen on talking about these trips to India unless they bear any direct relevance to a topic that might be meaningful to all the readers. Apart from the superficial things any tourist can see architecture , monuments , visible aspects and manifestations of culture , etc. , and which I dont really care to talk about , the other types of experiences and encounters that affected my perception of things and later my art only rarely had a direct link to our craft and I feel dont belong here.

Or that first box of Tampax I had to buy on the sly and smuggle into the house since in my we did NOT use tampons. And , too , all those pregnancy scares in my wild days in the ' 80 ' s , late periods brought on in the stress of post-drunken-one-night-stands-sans-birth-control. The miscarriage. The abortion.

But she occasionally served as her father 's hostess , and he insisted that her wardrobe contain several garments suitable for occasions such as this. The simple white tunic and pants she now wore , while not " fashionable " even in this backwater , set off her figure and skin tone quite well.

There were some pretty star moments , and Johnny Depp remains on my list of deeply respected actors. But erm.. at the risk of spoiling it for you guys , there was no ending.

It was , if anything , worse than in the morning , and a new and very distressing feature , vomiting , set in , and continued till dawn. Not one wink of sleep did I get that night , for I passed it in assisting Ustane , who was one of the most gentle and indefatigable nurses I ever saw , to wait upon Leo and Job. However , the air here was warm and genial without being too hot , and there were no mosquitoes to speak of.

It creates all kinds of annoyances , like not being able to run Java Tutorial examples. Some who are working on Java 6 projects can not use their computer easily , without resorting to installation of a separate OS in a virtual machine , to do their job.

Well , actually , in a way , porting the Win Word converter is exactly what we have been doing , but we ' re still faced with having to wait until Win Word ships before we have the final source code to merge into what we ' ve already ported. Once that merge is done , then we still have to go through several months ' worth of testing and bug fixing before they ' re ready for public use . </wait.v.396><wait.v.397>Sinak looked back at the man beside him , intending to ask his name , only to be startled at the sight of watching his friends knife vanish. He kept his silence for now , but unknown to those with him , he seized the wild currents of saidin and held them in abeyance , waiting for trouble to start. It might be a false alarm , an innocent mistake that could be peaceably resolved but the old man was not one to take chances when the two young women he considered his guests might be endangered . </wait.v.397><wait.v.398>Wilson breathed quietly , almost afraid to move. Slowly , he raised his eyes to the tops of the surrounding trees and scanned them for signs of a nest , but there was nothing to be seen. He lowered his eyes again and looked back at the bird. It stood so still in the reeds that its reflection was captured perfectly upon the surface of the lake. Minutes passed , but the bird made no movement , and Wilson wondered suddenly how much of its life was spent waiting , in that way. He found something unsettling in the idea , and when he eventually rose from the log to trace his steps back to the hotel the image remained in his mind . </wait.v.398><wait.v.399>Asher woke up pretty mad from the anesthesia today , but I had them give him morphine and bundled him around two blankets and he fell asleep on the bed for 35 minutes more , when I then woke him up ( ugh ) he was the typical confused and irritated. Asher was more mad today than usual though , going home , and even pulled out his NG tube on the way home ... .he was pretty upset and confused and I just ca n't wait till Asher does n't have to be put to sleep for these nasty dressing changes anymore. I try to smile through it and try to explain to the nurses that Asher does n't know what he is doing or saying after he wakes up , but many of the nurses try to engage him in conversation , which makes him even more angry. It will all be over soon . </wait.v.399><wait.v.400>" Thank you , " I said , putting it back in my wallet. I stared out across the small park and the shadows lengthening in front of us , swallowed.

Thank you in advance for what I know will be another great movie . </wait.v.405><wait.v.406>I left temperatures of 38 degrees in South Africa and now it is 2 degrees in Surrey where I am staying with my best friend Janine. Daisy and I arrived back in England on Wednesday morning and it was freeeeeeeezing. I literally dumped my suitcase in the hall , shot up to the farm , went home , slept and left early the following morning pausing only to kiss Tony as I won ' t see him until Sunday. Such is our life. I filmed all day yesterday for This Morning and was back in the studio live today with the delightful Peter Andre and Kate Thornton. I was covered in snow as I slid down the drive to my waiting car and the Kruger seems a very , very long way away today. I have just got back to Surrey and will now drive down to Reigate to meet up with Emily for lunch as I haven ' t seen her for over two weeks.

Even if she 's pretty sure she would. Saying you want a man because you happen to be straight and lonely is just too dangerously close to saying you need one and single-handedly sending women back to the dark ages ! It 's much safer for your own heart and indeed the sisterhood if you squelch your desires and wait patiently for someone to come along and deem you dateworthy. Just as women have always been trained to do , but never mind that. ( Perhaps the popularity of " The Rules " can be explained by the simple fact that it gives women something to do while furiously pretending we 're doing nothing . ) </wait.v.412><wait.v.413>I 've patiently waited for more than a month now for this fix.

And still , when the nurse came back in and asked my name , then consulted her paperwork and said simply Youre pregnantall I could do was stare. For a long , horrible moment I waited for her to smile and tell me she was just joking to break the tension , and tell me I was fine and send me on my way. But those words never came. Instead , I heard myself say , Are you sure ? She looked at me a little oddly; I dont imagine many people second-guess their test results. She nodded , and I buried my face in my hands. Although I dont remember crying , my friend later told me that I had tears streaming down my face when she saw me . </wait.v.415><wait.v.416>For those who sit home and wait and can not quite get away from the court scene , may I suggest another trial , one I believe compares in interesting ways with this one , and that is the two trials in 1951-52 of Alger Hiss. There are yards and yards of books on this one , and you will get yourself all involved with woodstock typewriters and 1920 ' s typefaces , and at least in the first trial , all the famous New Dealers who stuck with Hiss and appeared as character witnesses. What has been interesting me in recent weeks is recalling how the Republicans ran for office , and built successful political careers on this trial for near 50 years. It was the root of Richard Nixon ' s career without question . </wait.v.416><wait.v.417>Ianna reserved any comments or questions until they were safe inside their room.

He closed his eyes briefly to get himself under control , then opened them to glare at her. " You 're a bad girl. " He told her , moving up her body again so that he covered her. Her hips never stopped their erotic dance , and Spike brought one hand up , fingers digging into her pelvic bone to try and still the tempting movement. " You 're asking for it. " Spike threatened her . </wait.v.418><wait.v.419>Having worked as a nurse and now with the elderly , today 's inspiring message made me think of another analogy , our life is really a waiting room. We live through ups and downs , sharing good and bad news with family , friends &amp;acquaintances. In life we wait for bad things to pass and good things to come. Waiting is part of life , but as you and the others in the waiting room that day experienced the feeling that life can be cut short. So I say , Do n't Wait ! Do n't wait to tell someone how special they are , surprise someone with flowers or make that phone call. Waiting too long , one may miss out on the very opportunity they were waiting for . </wait.v.419><wait.v.420>It is Christ 's perfect life , and sorrows at the close of it , in which He refers to the faithfulness and goodness of Jehovah , so as to lead His people to confide in it , instructing them in this in which His perfection is shown.

I do not understand how the situation became so unmanageable in such a brief period of time. As I have heard O'Neill say on many occasions , this was supposed to be a routine mission. Now , as I cradle this still form ... my friend ... in my arms , I realize my imprudent reticence will be the cause of death for two of my teammates. My *friends*.

Repentance is one of the most essential things in Christianity. We need to repent every day. Just like we wash our faces and hands we need to cleanse ourselves through repentance.

Nobody is 100 clean . </wait.v.426><wait.v.427>10-26-06 : We got robbed during the concert of around $ 2000 , says a local promoter of an early September event held in an increasingly urbanized part of the city. And if you have in mind a stereotype of the profile of the most likely type of person to do that , you 'd be exactly right someone walked into the venue halfway thru set one , walked up to the ticket table , grabbed the box of money , and raced out and up the alley , jumping in a getaway car waiting for him. </wait.v.427><wait.v.428>Many people , when they talk of Lent , ask : So , what are you going to give up this year ? But going to mass today , the message had quite a different slant to the typical cliche of these 40 days of Lent. The priest included in his homily an anonymous quote to illustrate his point and I loved it ! Immediately after church , I asked the priest if I could have a copy of it. He said; They are making copies of it in the office.

Similar thoughts are expressed in Psalm 37 : 34 , Wait for the LORD , and keep His way , And He will exalt you to inherit the land  . As the psalmist waits on God to deliver him , he is obeying God. Even though we are in God ' s waiting room , we should continue to obey God in our daily lives. We can not stop or stall out in our daily walk with God. We need to continue to put God ' s word into practice in our lives. We need to be active in sharing faith , encouraging and serving others. I have found that when I make the decision to obey God , in spite of the fact that I may feel frustrated by being in the waiting room , it makes the time in the room more meaningful and removes the drudgery of the waiting. When I focus on others , I am not so self absorbed. Also , if all I do is fret and moan about my circumstances , I am murmuring against God , neglecting loving others and undermining faith . </wait.v.431><wait.v.432>" I got a notion that I think will work , but it 'll take some time.

I check their website and call their 1-800 number daily , but I ' m always given conflicting information.

We feel comfortable being ' inactive ' in his musical company , and time passes neither quickly nor slowly , just ' rightly ' . ' The Fountain and the Bell ' on the linked CD is a perfect example of this. The title would lead us to expect gushing water effects , at which the piano can be so skillful , and great tolling , ringing sounds opening up the full dynamic range of the instrument. In fact , the bell on this occasion seems to be a rather modest one , tolling gently for the first time at 0 55 , and the fountain has no obvious representation at all. Compare this piece to Liszt ' s or Ravel ' s cascading Jeux d ' eaux. We are dealing here with the most intense contemplation even a metaphysical depiction of reality : the accidents have disappeared and we are left only with the substance. It is as if the person watching the fountain or hearing the bell is being evoked , his or her soul at rest in harmony with the vibration , or purified in the cleansing water . </wait.v.450><wait.v.451>Diego roused himself from his silent contemplations to assist Padre Benitez in getting the sleepy Juan back to bed and to thank them both for their help.

Having our thoughts and wishes , our fears and hopes , hushed into calm and quiet in that great peace of God which passeth all understanding. That peace keeps the heart and mind when we are anxious for anything , because we have made our request known to Him.

She stopped instead at the Flowered Corner , waiting happily in a long queue , her nose delighting , her eyes gorging on bright orange tiger lilies , brilliant violets , luscious roses , bird of paradise flowers with tangerine beaks.

" Blessed are all they that wait for him. " Yes , blessed even now in the waiting. The promised blessings for ourselves , or for others , may tarry. The unutterable blessedness of knowing and having Him who has promisedthe divine Blesser , the living Fountain of the coming blessingsis even now ours.

Once these antigens are recognized , they become developed into a mature CTL. Sometimes , CD4+ cells are also stimulated which provides a second signal to CTL development. Now , these CTL , once they come into contact or " kissed " these tumor infected cells or virus infected cells , they release the cytotoxins perforin and granulysin. Perforin forms pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane allowing granzymes , types of serine proteases , to enter the target cell , which then activate a series of enzymes , the caspase cascade , that eventually lead to apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) , which is why it is called the " Kiss of Apoptotic Death. " After it delivers the " Kiss of Apoptotic Death , " CTL detaches to the destroyed cells , waiting for another infected cells to be killed by it. They trigger the suicidal program of an infected cell. Not only infected cells , but CTL are also major effectors of allograft organ rejection in transplantation . </wait.v.474><wait.v.475>I ' m waiting in anticipation for my peppers and tomatoes.

The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had the feeling , though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry , that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother.

In our church worship , in our prayer-meetings , in our conventions , in all our gatherings as managers , or directors , or committees , or helpers in any part of the work for God , our first object ought ever to be to ascertain the mind of God.

In Navajo lore , when Coyote appears , something very different and unforeseeable is usually about to happen. He is sometimes a gadfly , pestering and distracting; he is sometimes a trickster , waiting slyly and patiently to lure the unsuspecting into radically changed circumstances; he is sometimes vaguely malevolent; he is sometimes a buffoon; but in an especially fundamental sense , he is also the original source of much of the wisdom that guided the ordering of creation . </wait.v.508><wait.v.509>Thank you , My dear friend , you who wait upon Me and want only My point of view for those you love.

Yet it is a duty , and not only a duty , but a privilege. Reasoning will do but little good. Resistance will injure us. Therefore David took another course. Hear his words " Lord , my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do n't concern myself with matters too great or awesome for me. But I have stilled and quieted myself , just as a small child is quiet with its mother. Yes , like a small child is my soul within me. " Here was quiet waiting upon God. The soul was humble; it bowed before God; it lay at his feet , and in stillness of soul , waited for his appearing. This was wise " The Sovereign Lord , the Holy One of Israel , says , Only in returning to me and waiting for me will you be saved. In quietness and confidence is your strength.

The really important mission is to understand why the black box contains flies. We should spend our efforts to understand where the flies are hidden and thoroughly understand the structure of the black box itself.

We are unable to share with you , they say. But once we understand that this parable is speaking symbolically of realities within each of us , this makes sense. The ten bridesmaids stand for the various characteristics , habits , tendencies and traits that make of each of us a complex human being. Whenever Christ enters into our lives , there is a moment of reckoning , a moment , if you will , of inner house cleaning. In every forward movement in our spiritual lives , there are parts of ourselves , be they habits , tendencies , likes and dislikes , entrenched opinions and so on , that we need to leave behind. They are precisely the parts of ourselves that are not prepared to follow the Lord. Ironically , art of waiting includes knowing when not to wait anymore , when to stop waiting for everything within us to catch up.

I think I 'm impatient because I 'm aware there may not be as much time as I think to do things.

She would roll it into the kitchen and fill it with water from the sink; a hose expelled the dirty water at the end of the cycle. She monitored the clothes being agitated , moving them with a stick.

This patience honors Him greatly; it leaves Him , as God on the throne , to do His work; it yields self wholly into His hands. It lets God be God. If thy waiting be for some special request , wait patiently. If thy waiting be more the exercise of the spiritual life seeking to know and have more of God , wait patiently. Whether it be in the shorter specific periods of waiting , or as the continuous habit of the souls. Rest in the Lord , be still before the Lord , and wait patiently.

We fret , we moan and groan , we withdraw or run from the problem. We may try to control others , call attention to ourselves to bolster our feelings of inadequacy or to defend ourselves against the comments of others. Out of fear of failure or loss , we may compromise our convictions or what we know is right.

As when the melting fire burneth " ( Isa. 64 : 1 ) . In great mercy , God executes , within the soul , His judgments upon sin , as He makes it feel its wickedness and guilt. Many try to flee from these judgments. The soul that longs for God , and for deliverance from sin , bows under them in humility and in hope. In silence of soul , it says , " Rise up , LORD , and let thine enemies be scattered " ( Num. 10 : 35 ) . " In the way of thy judgments . . . have we waited for thee.

Cant publishers wait til KM marries PW to start writing books about her ? I agree with Lewis , right now , there is nothing interesting to say about KM except that she is dating a prince. After she marries there might be more interesting things to say about her as she will be more involved with the people and with the royal family. Right now , people think that she is a pearl but after she marries ( if she marries ) we will get to see her true identity ( could be good or bad , we dont know ) . So I am kind disappointed that publishers and supporters are giving her too much credit when we dont know anything about her and when we dont know the true kind of person she is . </wait.v.671><wait.v.672>Now read 1 Samuel 26 : 12-25.

Their story waited for three years while they grew ever so slowly together. They might have constructed a different narrative for their story back then if they had had a choice , but as I watched her walk down the aisle , I wondered if she still felt the hurry. This bride and groom 's circumstances refused to follow the seemingly most desirable timetable , and the monumental effort they both invested sometimes seemed ineffective. But I witnessed a tender moment as my friend walked towards her groom - her eyes never left his face , and he could n't stop smiling at her. Those three years slipped by in a moment to reveal two people refined and beautiful . </wait.v.675><wait.v.676>I find it funny that the two options listed are weekly store runs or wait for the trade .

" In wake of these arguments , Americans are being spoon-fed obscure statistics in regards to the coming " shortage , " to the point in which they are too full to apprehend the truth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conferred vague projections while dismissing important facts regarding the issue. What the data fails to acknowledge is the millions who are now outside of the labor force , who may by then choose to join , the contributions of baby boomers who are projected to work beyond the age of retirement and not to mention the simple fact that many people hold more than one job.

In His suffering Christ did not forget him , but turned round and looked upon him , and " Peter went out and wept bitterly.

It feels like a waste of time and at worst , an insult to us - as if we do n't have better things to do with our time. But wait , actually waiting for someone ... </wait.v.744><wait.v.745>It ' s hard to imagine a ramen lover like me took so long to finally come to the much heralded Ippudo NY. Well , here I am , waiting for my food to come. This place is where the ramen is supposed to end all ramens. I ' ll be the judge of that . </wait.v.745><wait.v.746>I LOVE your Caroline videos and I love Vimeo too. Did you know that after your video FINALLY loads and you wait in line for an our or 12 for it to convert , you can go to settings and choose a thumbnail for your title page. Not sure why I ' m sharing that but there it is . </wait.v.746><wait.v.747>Both of our competitions will be taking a break until we are past this festive season , so over the holiday you should be seeing regular updates from us for a few weeks ! For which I am very excited. I am anxious to see what has been goin ' on in the webcomic world in my absence , BUT AT THE SAME TIME , I am excited to do a slew of new pages for you guys here to apply all of the new tricks I have learned. Working with deadlines and to impress a panel of judges and meeting with other comic artists teaches you a ton and I think it 's been a really enriching experience for me. I ca n't wait to show you guys ! </wait.v.747><wait.v.748>I registered as a student and as a teacher. As a student , I have already been able to take part in a trial lesson of Spanish ( quite successful ) . As a teacher , I waited long for some contact concerning the consultation session , then wrote an e-mail asking for one and received a series of e-mails boiling down to catch Hala on Skype , which I did , was promised a consultation session , waited 3 days &amp;nothing happened , so asked again , had a lesson scheduled , then rescheduled ( on Hala ' s request ) , then Ms Hala was late for the lesson , then appeared for a few seconds &amp;said sorry , then disappeared again with no sorry. I ' m confused as hell. Hope to be offered some explanation. Needless to say , not looking forward to booking the Spanish course ( nor recommending the site either to students or to really good teachers ) . </wait.v.748><wait.v.749>That Magic time has arrived , the time we all wait for. It 's playoff time and The Pistons and their fans are ready to for a long playoff run . </wait.v.749><wait.v.750>I sat for hours waiting for my boyfriend to return as the crazy thoughts continued to swirl. Seizing the opportunity to stop stewing in my own self pity , I returned the snow gear. Making my way back to the lodge , I waited impatiently. I finally saw my boyfriend wandering and I rushed out to meet him . </wait.v.750><wait.v.751>We got up early enough to get there and scope out a viewing spot. As it turns out , the best place to view is a big parking lot just off Highway 83. We pulled in about 2 hours early and got a front row spot. Over the next hour or so the entire parking lot filled with cars and trucks. The traffic on Highway 83 was backed up as far as I could see. We set up our chairs , tripods , and cameras and waited . </wait.v.751><wait.v.752>I live in NYC where we stand ONline. I visited a friend in San Francisco and we were waiting for an elevator. There was a lot of space in front of the elevator but everyone was hanging back so I went to fill that space , though not blocking the doors. My friend grabbed me and said that we have to wait online for the elevator , in an actual line ! I think in NYC things are more crowded so in situations like that , we tend to gather and crowd rather than form actual lines , as lines block traffic flow more than crowds. We treat elevators like subway cars. I think fluid dynamics would prove this more efficient and NYC is all about efficiency . </wait.v.752><wait.v.753>At the top of the pile of memorabilia was a picture of three young girls , about nine years old. The picture was black and white , but Vera didn ' t need color. She remembered that day all too vividly. The three friends were smiling brightly , about to head to their weekly trip to get ice cream in Diagon Alley. They were all wearing matching purple robes , and kept bursting into fits of giggles in the photo. The youngest girl , with her vivid red hair pulled into pigtails , was standing between the two older girls. Molly was , in reality , only a few months younger than Vera , but , as her birthday was after September , she had to wait an extra year to go to Hogwarts. Molly ' s friends were lost without her. They had made so many plans for school. They couldn ' t wait. Growing up on Diagon Alley , they had watched every year as the Hogwarts students purchased their supplies. They didn ' t care what House they were in , as long as they were all together. Molly cried they day the other girls left for King ' s Cross , even though her friends promised to write her every day . </wait.v.753><wait.v.754> Waiting for the tides to turn , waiting for the wind to change , enduring , submitting to fate it ' s a very humbling thing to do if you think about it. It ' s rather easy to pass judgement on why people don ' t take action and do something to change their fates , but as I grow older , I find myself to be more willing to understand. After all , life is never easy , and I would never know what it feels like to live weighed down by centuries of suffocating customs. </wait.v.754><wait.v.755>I have waited for my share of juries in my lifetime , both as defense counsel and as an assistant prosecutor. I 've waited with my clients , with the families of my clients , and with the families of victims of crimes and the police officers who investigated them. Waiting for a jury is incredibly difficult , for everyone involved in a case. But it is especially tough on the family and friends on both sides who know the defendant and/or the victim , because for them whatever the verdict it is so personal . </wait.v.755><wait.v.756>Like my friends Estragon and Vladimir , I wait , not sure of what I am waiting for or when it might make itself known to me. Waiting for Godot or a CAT scan is n't much different. There 's nothing to be done but develop the art of being in the nothing , and give up trying to master doing nothing . </wait.v.756><wait.v.757>And then for 3 blessed weeks , I would come downstairs in the mornings and my mother would be sitting on the couch drinking her coffee , waiting for us to wake up. Her face was serene and beautiful radiating in the cool glow of that tree. I used to think it odd that there was nothing playing -- no television , no radio , no children -- just her in the morning silence not even reading the paper yet. But falling under the same spell , I 'd wrap up in a waft of pine perfume and my blanket and join her in that morning rapture. I 'd look over at her , and she 'd smile , and then I would look back at the lights making blurry vision and sending the rays from those tiny bulbs a thousand miles . </wait.v.757><wait.v.758>When I was a teenager waiting for upcoming releases was a lot harder. I would read all of the related marketing hype , and press , which would make it worse. Now that I 'm almost thirty I have to mark my calendar for these things , or I 'll forget about them . </wait.v.758><wait.v.759>We went to the office and waited for awhile because there was a line today. We went in the office and the head of the department of the immigration office is the one we had to go back to. He asked a woman if she had looked over our paperwork and she said yes everything is fine , that our paperwork was suitable. The he checked if we changed our registration to Vladimir like he had asked , and then he signed the papers that we could be granted this Residency . </wait.v.759><wait.v.760>In a pair of whimsical notes to Scientist magazine , Walter F. Cannon offered this prediction : " Since William Dunbar had square UFOs , and we have round UFOs , the next step would seem to be triangles. If NASA would only make our spacecraft a little pointier ... we may not have to wait for the twenty-first century. " Later he wrote , " I still believe triangles are the coming thing , although my reasoning , being more Freudian than documentable , is not such to convince a skeptical astronomer. The Space Shuttle conforms to Dunbar 's requirement of a pointier spacecraft. Oddly this prediction seems to be coming true. The Grand Boomerang of March 1983 was a well-publicized early example and more recently a flap in Belgium starred triangular craft. They do seem to be much more numerous than when Cannon wrote his note . </wait.v.760><wait.v.761>I saw you sitting there alone , and ... the woman began , her voice trailing off towards the end. Kyleaia ran a slender , calloused finger through her soaked blonde hair , waiting for the timid girl to continue. I thought that you might like to join us at our table. </wait.v.761><wait.v.762>Second day I know today is early too , but I 'm waiting. Perhaps hoping for an unusual expediency on the part of the Post Company. And what about the " PAR AVION " stamp on the letter ? That 's why I 'm still waiting today. But what am I talking about ? What " PAR AVION " to our town am I dreaming about ? And just for me ? Hey , wait a minute. You do n't have to joke with the air ! But perhaps the sender has used a carrier pigeon. Good idea to put a small handful of grain on my balcony to orientate it towards my place. It would be a pity if it lost the way . </wait.v.762><wait.v.763>Hmm ... ca n't say I like the service or the length of time it takes for them to ship. If you can handle waiting for 2-4 weeks for the shield ... go ahead . </wait.v.763><wait.v.764>I can ' t wait to have my so-called comeback. The food is also a big factor why I want to go to Tanjung Pinang. People have been telling me how tasty Tanjung Pinag ' s food is. And it ' s all about sea food. There ' s this unique creature they love to eat called Gonggong. I can picture myself sitting by the beach on a cheap-plastic chair while enjoying Tanjung Pinang ' s famous dishes. I can picture myself being so free and peaceful . </wait.v.764><wait.v.765>Loved this book ! It was a wonderful book to read after reading the whole Twilight series , and feeling stumped about what to read next.

Most every parent has to wait at least nine months for a child , and a number of parents wait much longer . </wait.v.769><wait.v.770>Nobody ever seems to cheat , and in my experience , if someone goes out of turn , they 'll be lectured by the nearest 90 year old woman. Then they 'll blush brightly , mumble apologies , and return to the waiting huddle. Organizationally , the group waiting remains a messy scrum. People wander off , come back later , and so on. As long as you remember who you follow , though , the " line " seems to work out pretty well. I 've seen queues of many hundreds work this way , but it 's also the rule in force at every three-person pizza shack . </wait.v.770><wait.v.771>Eventually we caught a tattered cab back to the port to catch the ferry. Unfortunately , we just missed the 4 : 30pm boat , and had to wait an hour for the last boat back to Nangan. In the meantime , we sat at a nearby temple and talked about what we had seen so far , as a fishing boat docking up confused the two young coast guard members entrusted with registering the vessel. The tide was out and the water level was about two stories lower than it had been when we arrived . </wait.v.771><wait.v.772>We wait in a thousand ways , like we wait for the birth of a new world. Or perhaps we wait for the fulfillment of a promise : we wait for a world of justice , peace , and light that seems so slow in coming . </wait.v.772><wait.v.773>I ' ve been waiting for a new Lehane forever , and see his September release is 720 pages long , oy. I can ' t imagine writing something with such a scope in even a year ! </wait.v.773><wait.v.774>Yes , Yes , I am Worth the Wait ! It took me a while to realize what a valuable gift a woman 's virginity is. I kept myself undefiled of sexual intercourse until age 18 , however I did it because it was the " Christian thing to do " ( saving myself for my husband ) .I now realize Virginity is a gift first given to me , from my Father God. I now celebrate 4 years of celibacy.* Praise Him* Just a tip- If you plan on waiting dismiss company of those who are n't and surround yourself with those who will encourage you to. It makes waiting much easier. Until God blesses me with the precious gift of marriage , I promise to give all my tender love &amp;affection to Elohay Tehilati - God Of My Praise : ( Psalm 109 : 1 ) . To all my singles : Keep that mind wise and those emotions healthy , </wait.v.774><wait.v.775>Here 's the pictures you all have been waiting so patiently for ! !

Most of her song dont ! Dont get me wrong , Beyonce is a hell of performer , but those two shouldnt be compared.. They are in different games NE ways , I waiting on Brandy and haters will learn to respect ( KHIA style lol ) her .

On Christmas Eve , a judge ruled that Fox has the right to , at the very least , distribute The Watchmen. Will they try to stop the release of the movie ? Probably not , ( though they certainly could ) . Will they try to change it ? Again , no. Will they make some fat cash off of it ? Certainly. Should they eat all the dicks ? Without a doubt . </wait.v.777><wait.v.778>You are truly an amazing and gifted person. I am so happy that you won. I thought you were absolutely fabulous from the beginning with Glamorous Life and can not wait to purchase your new CD.

There 's a quick way to turn off these shortcuts , to wit : You go to the Tools menu , then AutoCorrect , and simply uncheck the " Replace Text As You Type " option. I turned off the shortcuts for the exams , and incidentally I also did so when doing practice exams in order to simulate actual test conditions. The macros would n't do me any good for the exams because I do n't think professors really want to see IRAC that nakedly applied. So I agree , in order to appropriately sign the Honor Code Pledge , I ca n't use that stuff , and thus I didn't.

A caring server may forget one or 2 things , but my goodness , that many mistakes , sorry , but 10 would be TOO MUCH to give to someone that does all of that and is rude.

I have a wonderful picture of him barking thru weaves with split flying everywhere , I love it ( the picture , not the barking or the spit ) .

And even after waiting , the final realization of the Messiah 's eternal reign is still yet to be seen , coming in the future , when the baby born in Bethlehem returns in power to judge the living and the dead. All of this makes our own waiting seem pretty insignificant. Somehow waiting five extra minutes for a dried out bun and a tiny piece of meat from a fast-food restaurant seems pretty trivial . </wait.v.798><wait.v.799>Table 2 presents variations in time from the initial diagnostic procedure to surgery , both overall and in various subgroups. The overall median waiting time was 34 days ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 19 62 ); in 13.5 of the episodes the women waited longer than 90 days.

Watch the working of the Holy Spirit in your heart , and mark the desires he awakens , the graces he quickens , the checks he gives , and the consolation he imparts. Wait on the Lord to carry on his work within you , and watch , expecting him to do it. Wait on the Lord , expecting him to work for you; and watch his hand , expecting him to answer your prayers.

As we read here what the Holy Ghost said , so the Holy Ghost will still speak to His Church and His people. In these later days He has often done it. He has come to individual men , and by His divine teaching He has led them out into fields of labor that others could not at first understand or approve , into ways and methods that did not recommend themselves to the majority. But the Holy Ghost does still in our time teach His people. Thank God , in our foreign missionary societies and in our home missions , and in a thousand forms of work , the guiding of the Holy Ghost is known , but ( we are all ready , I think , to confess ) too little known. We have not learned enough to wait upon Him , and so we should make a solemn declaration before God : O God , we want to wait more for Thee to show us Thy Will . </wait.v.822><wait.v.823>" I do a lot of research , " she said.

He came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. He then confused and scattered their language into many languages. That is why this tower is called Babel.

They disagreed with God ' s plan and set their own goal. They followed their hero Nimrod and built a city with a high tower to try to reach God ' s throne. They erroneously thought , Now if a flood comes again , we will be fine. Let us gather together for we are the center of the world.

I recommend both of them to you for further study and reflection. In waiting patiently , we live out the key traditional Christian virtues. Patient waiting has faith. In waiting , it continues to live in the present , confidently and joyfully. It trusts in the Spirit ' s timing. Patient waiting hopes. It believes in the original goodness of God ' s creation , and is alert for the signs of its progressive restoration and return to its Creator. Patient waiting loves. It is love that inspires waiting and it is love that gives us the courage to sustain the tension and uncertainty to be found in even the best of waiting . </wait.v.842><wait.v.843>( and on the theme of waiting , I am starting to wonder about the friend coming by so I may drive them to greet our coat hanger visitors .at the rally starting at 10 : 30 . </wait.v.843><wait.v.844>Once upon a time , a lovely maiden from Fresno married the man of her dreams.

Further , he requires medication that is approved for doctors to prescribe , but not covered by Pharmacare. It is very expensive. Without his meds , he is a cripple.

And then , too , how many , who have heard of a life of rest and perfect peace , of abiding light and fellowship , of strength and victory , and who can not find the path.

For a few years , my father was a rice farmer and as a boy growing up on the farm , I had the privilege of working on the farm and being involved in the rice growing process. The most important and exciting seasons were when we planted and harvested the rice , but they were weeks and weeks apart. We would plow , disk , and harrow the soil , and then we would plant the seed. After the rice had sprouted a few inches , the fields with their levies were flooded with water. For the next months , the job was to maintain the proper level of water on the rice and wait for the rice to grow. Daily we walked and watched the fields to see that the water lever was just right. Finally , after weeks of waiting and watching and anticipation , it was time for the harvest and in would come the combines and the trucks.

It would mean a deeper conviction that God must and will do all. It would require a more humble and abiding entrance into our deep helplessness , and the need of entire and unceasing dependence upon Him. We need a more living consciousness that the essential thing is to give God His place of honor and of power. We must have a confident expectation that to those who wait on Him , God will , by His Spirit , give the secret of His acceptance and presence , and then , in due time , the revelation of His saving power. The great aim would be to bring everyone in a praying and worshiping company under a deep sense of God 's presence , so that when they part there will be the consciousness of having met God Himself , of having left every request with Him , and of now waiting in stillness while He works out His salvation . </wait.v.863><wait.v.864>But seriously , this will be great.

She loves to sit in your lap and anytime you go out with her , she stays within arms distance and when you stop she likes to stand leaning , touching you looking forward.

When the heart has learned how entirely powerless it is for one moment to keep itself or bring forth any good , when it has learned how surely and truly God will keep it , when it has , in despair of itself , accepted God 's promise to do for it the impossible , it learns to rest in God.

Martha Stewart was scheduled to have a book signing for her newest book " Martha Stewart 's Cooking School. " I thought I would check it out and see. To my surprise , the line was long even before the store opened. I was probably the 50th person in line and I thought I was late. But I found out that I was actually pretty early. So , I waited in line to get inside. Then , I had to wait in line to buy a few copies of the book. Yet again , I waited in another line to get a wristband that would allow me to get my books signed. THEN , I waited in the actual line to get my books signed. I waited. And waited. I made friends with other people in line who share many same foodie/shopping fanatic/domestic tendencies as I. It was like a book store filled with my people ! At last , I found people who were just as nutty as me. YAY ! </wait.v.890><wait.v.891>Is an enormous pleasure to write this blog.

Arch had organized an over night event for the kids , with presentations about how to embrace diversity. The students did work shops , saw movies , ate pizza..and had a little Driscoll concert. That evening we all went over the the Victims Vigil , where the Arch youth team performed some of their ... " Differences , got ta have them ! " skits.

I have seldom read a less satisfying book. I was n't bothered by the recapitulation ( it 'd been 12 years after all ) or the descriptions of the landscape and technology , which I have come to expect.

I have seen her put on a display in a Wal*Mart while waiting for a price check that would have sent that comparibly wimpy green man running for the hills.

Is waiting on God a work so difficult , that , for that too , such words are needed , " Be strong , and let your heart take courage " ? Yes , indeed. The deliverance for which we often have to wait is from enemies , in presence of whom we are impotent. The blessings for which we plead are spiritual and all unseen; things impossible with men; heavenly , supernatural , divine realities. Our heart may well faint and fail . </wait.v.909><wait.v.910>At some point years ago , the Faulkner Hospital had an ambulatory care clinic and an ER.

In addition , I am supposed to drive back to Best Buy today or tomorrow to pick up the new stacking kit and exchange it for the one I was incorrectly sold , return the other hoses to O.S.H. , and then spend another weekend waiting around for an installer. In the end , after all the time and frustration , I may or may not have a property installed washer and dryer , using parts and methods which Best Buy deems unfit , and which may violate Whirlpool 's warranty and may create a fire hazard in my home ! </wait.v.922><wait.v.923>Hi uncle Jojo and auntie Val , i 'm so excited.

They are her photographs. Thanksgiving in North Dakota , the photo album is called. I click through them and see Michael at a strange family ' s dinner table , cuddling a cat , cuddling the shiny-haired girl. I know the expressions on his face. I cry. I am in a six-star hotel room in the middle of a resort in the middle of an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean and I am looking at Michael spending a foreign holiday in a right-wing state with another woman four years after he said I have to leave , I have to leave , and I am crying . </wait.v.925><wait.v.926>Our great Commander organizes every campaign , and His generals and officers do not always know the great plans.

Blessed is the man who gets into God 's secrets and works under God . </wait.v.926><wait.v.927>Prosdechomai is the primary word used in the New Testament for the concept of waiting. It is a compound word from pros , to or towards and dechomai , receive , accept. Prosdechomai means ( 1 ) to receive to one ' s self , receive favorably , ( 2 ) expect , look for , wait for. 2 Compare its use in Mark 15 : 43; Luke 2 : 25; 12 : 36; Acts 24 : 15; Titus 2 : 13; Jude 1 : 21. The focus of this word is on the coming of the Lord in either His first or second advents . </wait.v.927><wait.v.928>The hope I offer out of this terrible state is a lesson I draw from astrological traditions , that is , of cycles. Everything changes in this world and a person ' s life evolves in complex , interwoven cycles. So as we are carried along in this life through circumstances we can ' t control , and as we face these circumstances and make choices to pass through the fire , we can count on only one thing : change. And things may change without or within. And it ' s the latter that can put us back on the path of meaning. Sometimes just waiting is the answer , be it hopeful waiting or just being open to receive the message . </wait.v.928><wait.v.929>I arrived in Salta , Argentina expecting to be there for a few days while waiting for a part for my bike. The bike was doing something which I referred to as wobble and it was driving me crazy it was impossible to ride. It turns out that my wobble ( low speed and high speed ) seems to be due to some combination of materials , part selection , handlebar bag use , and total weight being carried. This baffled me as I was not carrying too much gear. In fact , there was not much extra in there for an extended trip such as this one ( OK there is a lightweight computer and a book or two but that is only 4 lbs more ) . It is not a design flaw though it is simply a limitation of the pieces. My last bike also a steel frame touring bike had the exact same problem ( and I was carrying much less weight ) . As it turns out , removing the handlebar bag solved the problem for the time being but I had hoped that a stronger headset would allow me to continue using the oh-so-useful handlebar bag . </wait.v.929><wait.v.930>Please , Buffy.

This has made me realize jsut how precious my ruby is and that im really worth the wait. Destiny , VA </wait.v.931><wait.v.932>Handling a long wait. Not so good at this. I try to remind myself that until the high-tech age , everybody had to wait all the time for everything. Mail took forever , even when trains came along. Travel took forever. When people came to visit , they frequently stayed for weeks , because travel was so difficult and took forever. In our instantaneous-response universe , it ' s hard to remember how slow the pace of human life was until only recently. So I try to remind myself of that fact. And then I can use overdue tasks and long-delayed pleasures ( reading , especially , and pulling weeds ) to distract myself. Reviving the social life is always good . </wait.v.932><wait.v.933>As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert and business-like , put her clothes on , knotted the scarlet sash about her waist , and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked , and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London , stored away from innumerable community hikes. The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come , and brought him out at a different railway station. ' Never go home the same way as you went out , ' she said , as though enunciating an important general principle. She would leave first , and Winston was to wait half an hour before following her . </wait.v.933><wait.v.934>See ya later , Honey ! The old woman smiled fondly as she watched the young woman run outside , letting the screen door bang shut behind her. Felicia had called the old woman honey since she first learned to talk , mistaking the endearment the older woman called the child for the womans name. By the time she was old enough to know the difference , the name had stuck. Honey parted the faded blue and white checked curtains and , frowning , watched as the younger woman jumped into the honking pickup truck waiting outside. She sighed and turned away , back to the kitchen. How many times had she told Felicia that a properly brought up young lady shouldnt be running and slamming doors , much less jumping into trucks whose drivers didnt have the decency to come in instead of waiting outside honking. Felicia would be twenty-one tomorrow and the old woman hadnt mentally prepared her mind , or her heart , to let go of the girl she had raised from infancy . </wait.v.934><wait.v.935>Kris got a text from a mysterious lady and Rhianna flipped.

I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet , their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize , but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was , who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet ? </wait.v.937><wait.v.938>My friend Jeff and I arrived in Colonet at about 5 : 30PM and set up the house.

Kaylie took the other and together , with Jules waiting on the outskirts , they lifted Marty to his feet. Jennifer groaned softly; he seemed even heavier than before. She managed to turn her head to look at him. Marty 's eyes were half-closed , his head resting against Kaylie 's shoulder.

The pattern challenge is currently with test knitters and the tech editor so it is well on its way to reality. I ca n't tell you a lot about it because the testers are doing it as a mystery KAL. It has been fun teasing them about it. And one of my design challenges , Bright Copper Kettles which had been patiently waiting in my design idea notebook since the last Ravelympics , is about one-quarter through. I did have a couple of temporary set-backs with it ( lost the needles and had to frog a mistake or two ) but I am currently reknitting the frogged section so I am back in the race - a little behind the front runners but not out of the race entirely . </wait.v.941><wait.v.942>WOW I have heard so many things about you !

We are to wait expectantly ( Romans 8 : 19 ) and we are to wait courageously ( Psalm 130 : 5 ) . </wait.v.943><wait.v.944>As I evaluate the pros and cons of this caliber , the cons out-weigh the pros. I started to take the prophecy ' s very seriously as I got older. And the more chaotic my life became the more I held to every prophecy that was uttered. Some prophecy was to the whole church and some were specific to me. Obviously , the more personal ones I held up with vigor. Waiting on the Lord , year and year to do what he promised eventually ended in me going through deep depression. Some of the problems could of been dealt with right away , but I wanted to wait on God to fix it. After 5-7 years , my faith , my hope , my dreams were all destroyed. I still remember coming home after work one day and crying out to God. I ' m not even sure who I was anymore. I held on until I fainted under the weight of current circumstances.

Really badly. The school bathroom was about 50 feet away from where I was parked , but around a slight corner so I could n't see it. We 're not supposed to leave our cars once in the carpool line so I could n't take her. I explained that we 'd be home soon , but she quickly tired of my explanations and cut me off.

In terms of quality , I have to agree. The first person storytelling in Evermore , is intimate and emotional. Ever 's voice is realistic; all of her reactions as a grieving teenager make sense. Many times , in YA novels , authors make little blunders portraying teenagers. I have to say that Alyson Noel manages to do it pretty darn well , if not perfectly. . .And I definitely ca n't wait till the second book in the Immortals series comes out ...

Only had to wait about five minutes before I saw his Black Chevy truck with the beautiful red car on the trailer behind it. It looked absolutely gorgeous ! We chatted for a couple of minutes then we headed out for the house. Aaron came out as we arrived , fired up his souped up V8 Chevy S-10 pickup and brought the neighbors out from their house to see what was going on. Jeff and his son Steven came just in time to help unload the car from the trailer. No brakes so we had to ease it off.

I want to borrow Zach 's aluminum foil hat , but Sam is already waiting not too patiently for it to be his turn. I want a turn too. The past is gone forever; long live the past. For most of my adult life my childhood memories have been primarily blank spots; absences , that were occasionally punctuated by a remembrance of something phenomenally positive or profoundly tragic. The memories are mostly static : white noise , detached and distant and more like someone else 's experiences. The channel between channels.

This is what happened to the Elam mishpocha on the 5th night of Chanukah this year. A little boy and his brother rang my door bell. To do this they had to walk passed my Chanukiah burning in a glass display on the steps. Their parents were waiting patiently at the curb in the family car. The sweet little fellows were spreading Christmas cheer. They handed me a gift bag with cookies and candy including a personalized Christmas card with family photo and bio. Turns out they live on the same bock. We decided to give them a Chanukah package. My wife made latkes for them. Then I signed our names to a Chanukah card. We made two little gift bags with candy and sufganiot. I typed an explanation of Chanukah. My son through in a draydel and some gelt with directions on how to play. We promptly delivered our holiday package to their front door , latkes steaming. We have n't heard from them yet. It just seemed like the thing to do at the time.

I 've lived what I feel is an honorable life , but see no less hardship because of it. I make no complaints ( or apologies ) , but I do have questions. I question the prerequisite that one must suffer for salvation. I question the plan of a God that encompasses all manner of tragedies and disasters. I question the legitimacy of religion when it 's own followers commit despicable acts. I do not , however , question one 's right to believe ... to prepare ... to eagerly anticipate Christmas. Although , I do question their reasons , because I feel that Christmas has become more tradition than a day of faith. Sir , I hope you and yours have a wonderful holiday season. As for me , I will celebrate December 25th with family , but my faith has been broken and the true significance of that day has been lost to me for some time. You asked repeatedly in your posting what we are waiting for.

Lots of research to do will let you know about the meeting tonight . </wait.v.1046><wait.v.1047>It seems what is anticipated always takes its sweet time to arrive. It is for this reason that many businesses try to occupy the customer ' s time while waiting to be served. From televisions in the waiting areas to magazines and newspapers on stands , businesses try to take away the customer ' s attention from the passage of time and by so doing end up creating the impression that waiting and service times are shorter than they actually are . </wait.v.1047><wait.v.1048>God 's plan for us may require that we do a lot of waiting , and this really can feel like a crucible. Learning patience during this time can be developed as we focus on the person of God and trust that He is acting for us. There are many reasons for waiting , but all are concerned with the fulfillment of God 's plans for us and His kingdom. Much can be lost if we rush ahead of God , but much can be gained by maintaining an attitude of trust and delight in Him . </wait.v.1048><wait.v.1049>Paul began without a dream from God. Then in Troas the Spirit of Jesus blocked Paul ' s way and made him wait for a vision. We may most certainly become anxious during the waiting; but like Paul , who received a vision of a man in Macedonia , we too must learn to wait. Paul was told to go to Macedonia and was able to go with a conviction in his heart. Any dreams , big or small , given by the Holy Spirit will come true. It was He who put those dream in our hearts and it will be the Holy Spirit who will hold onto our lives until He fulfills them . </wait.v.1049><wait.v.1050>* Photo taken in Big Bear a few weeks back.

Why was she ashamed , cake mixes offer a fine , trustworthy cake ? I ran home anxious to procure the appropriate ingredients and try out this delightful treat. My mother remembered 7 Minute Frosting , she said that no one really made it much anymore , but we would give it a try. One hour later , the cupcakes cooled in their individual cups , we piled the icing high atop the cakes. I even waited a half hour , until the frosting got that crackly shell before I dove in , eager to taste the mellifluous cupcake. But it was n't the same. Maybe the flashing lights of the disco ball had at the roller rink had been disorienting , making the dessert treats actually seem better than they were. My mother pronounced them too sweet , and the 7 Minute Frosting and Strawberry Cupcakes were filed away , only to be thought of from time to time when my sweet-tooth particularly acted up . </wait.v.1051><wait.v.1052>Am trying the irish ticketmaster , the wait doesnt seem to be as long as I am waiting now for 9 mins !

We 've inherited an economic crisis as deep and as dire as any since the Great Depression. And economists across the spectrum have warned , if we do n't act immediately , then millions more jobs will disappear; the national unemployment rates will approach double digits; more people will lose their homes and their health care. And our nation will sink into a crisis that at some point is going to be that much tougher to reverse. So we can not afford to wait. We ca n't wait and see and hope for the best.

Many neighborhoods are homogenous. There is one group of people , one mindset , one general income , and one standard of living. I was able to see different family structures and different ways that people manage money. I was able to see that people had old parents because their parents waited until they were financially stable before they had children. I was exposed to different standards of living.

He then said , " no you do n't , you 're not going to give that to him , you are going to have him sign it ! " I laughed and assured him I was giving it to Sheed.

He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps , picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves , potato peelings , sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed , and which , when they jolted over the bad patches in the road , sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake . </wait.v.1065><wait.v.1066>Upon arriving at the hospital , I signed in with the information desk while Tim parked the car and was asked if I wanted a wheel chair. I said that would be great for when they need to bring me up and so the lady brought one over and insisted I sit down. I informed her that my contraction were easier if I was standing and I 'd wait to sit if that was ok only to be told by her that it was hospital policy that I sit in the chair. Now I 'm not usually a confrontational person and if this was my first labor I probably would have just sat down , but this is my third and I know what I want. I kindly said again that I am much more comfortable standing and that I would just stand by the chair and wait for my escort. Again , she insisted I sit down. I should let you know that during this back and forth time I 'm of course having to pause for a contraction. In the end I won out.

In the Texas game , the Longhorns opened as 20-point favorites. With the loyalty to Texas , and the lack of appeal of Iowa State , you could be fairly confident that that spread was going to get bigger. If you like Texas , then , it makes sense to get in early , while Iowa State backers would want to wait until the last minute.

It get ' s hard sometimes , but through it all I ' m very happy to be waiting for the ONE God has ordained to Love me whole heartedly . </wait.v.1097><wait.v.1098>After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home , where I am employed , she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready.

But even though I 'm a die-hard Tiva fan I REALLY DO NOT want them to get married that would so ruin the show ! *crings* that 'd be horrible ! All I 'm asking for is a real kiss and some dating possibly ... idk ... .I 'M SO EXCITED ! ! ! !

I ' m a complete morning person I ' m one of those obnoxiously cheerful morning people but after lunch , I start my slow decline and by the early evening , I ' m ready for bed.

She glanced around the clearing , and noticed the inviting pool , just waiting for her. It had been a long day on a dusty road , and she was tired and hot . </wait.v.1107><wait.v.1108>" Where we all wait in earnest with pudding in hand for the Upton comet to sail through the roofed skies , so that we may meet Him.

" She said curtly , and then turned and left the room , leaving Xena alone. The Warrior Princess paced impatiently , doubts clouding her mind. This was a mistake. She could n't possibly want me in her life after I hurt her the way I did. She was turning to leave , when Gabrielle entered from her private quarters , no longer dressed as an Amazon Queen , but in her accustomed garb. She faced Xena coolly , her expression belying nothing of what she was feeling . </wait.v.1110><wait.v.1111>I did not consider the repercussions of watching that and now my young , chuck like dog is in the backyard barking at whatever that noise was he just heard. Oh wait , now he 's back in the living room standing at attention , waiting to hear it again. I think for the neighbors ' sakes I 'll refrain from watching the rest . </wait.v.1111><wait.v.1112>No , Hillary should not quit. Obama 's friend " Tony " Rezko 's trial has just begun today and Hillary and all the dems should wait to find out what comes out that trial because Federal prosecutors recently revealed that Nadhmi Auchi , an Iraqi billionaire who lives in London , wired $ 3.5 million to the financially strapped Rezko in Chicago less than a month before the Obama-Rezko purchases. I have a feeling that right after Hillary quits , things will go south for Obama and dems will loose in genearal election . </wait.v.1112><wait.v.1113>Not sure which it is.

I am so happy that Lucas and Peyton are together. I 've been waiting for this like ages. The last episode made me cry , and now Peyton and I of course might be losing Lucas. No way. Do n't think I can handle this. Peyton just found her love , please do n't take him away . </wait.v.1114><wait.v.1115>Derek , Philip and Alex sat patiently waiting for Nick to join them. He rushed in with copies from the database records of the newest Satanic cults. He passed one out to each of his associates -- keeping one for himself -- and sat down. " Where 's Rachel ? " he asked , noting the doctor 's absence. " Is n't she coming ? " </wait.v.1115><wait.v.1116>Today I have one month of sobriety. And I am psychologically preparing myself to go bankrupt tomorrow so I am filled more with a sense of failure than accomplishment. The papers are prepared and I will head down to court tomorrow to hand them over to a clerk. Then I will wait , go to court , publicly admit that I 'm a deadbeat , and hopefully be absolved of my financial sins. I 'm immersed in my own misfortune and the consequences of my poor choices right now , and I 'm feeling sorry for myself. A dangerous psychic spot for an alcoholic. A place all too familiar to me . </wait.v.1116><wait.v.1117>The application of the truth to wider circles , to those we labor among or intercede for , to the Church of Christ around us , or throughout the world , is not difficult. There can be no good but what God works; to wait upon God , and have the heart filled with faith in His working , and in that faith to pray for His mighty power to come down , is our only wisdom. Oh for the eyes of our heart to be opened to see God working in ourselves and in others , and to see how blessed it is to worship and just to wait for His salvation ! </wait.v.1117><wait.v.1118>Kenneth MacMillan 's " Romeo and Juliet " is a ballet that relies on its two leading dancers more than other ballets do. In Petipa , if the leads are mediocre , one can still be delighted by the elaborate patterns of the corps , the brilliance of the soloists ' choreography , or the grand spectacle his ballets generally present. MacMillan 's choreography is weaker than Petipa 's , and I spent a good deal of the ballet waiting for the principal dancers to come back on as the choreographer fumbled about with the crowd scenes , trying to create a lively , exciting atmosphere but never really succeeding. Fortunately , the leading dancers were worth waiting for , even though the performance got off to a slow start . </wait.v.1118><wait.v.1119>Part of the process of waiting is often as important as the message itself. As we wait our faith is strengthened. We prepare ourselves to receive what God is telling us and respond with obedience. As we immerse ourselves in prayer and devotion God is drawing us closer. We experience an intimacy with Him that we wouldn ' t have otherwise . </wait.v.1119><wait.v.1120>Edwards was my hero and he seems to have softened in an odd way. I wish Edwards would have spoken about how awful John McCain is rather than pump up Hillary , good grief. President Obama needs to start the campaign against the Republicans , Hillary , it ' s over. It ' s time we move onto the real debates about the Republican disasters in our country and the world. I ' m waiting for the Jimmy Carter endorsement ! </wait.v.1120><wait.v.1121>Well this is your dream , and for some reason our eleven year old is out there running amuck all over London. And you have me here waiting at home like some 50s housewife , so get your ass in gear and find her ! Buffys voice screamed . </wait.v.1121><wait.v.1122>It is always wise to wait on God. First , it is wise to wait because God gives clear direction only when we are willing to wait. Second it is wise to wait because God uses that waiting time to get us in step with His timing. Third , God uses the time of waiting to prepare us for the answer. Fourth , waiting strengthens our faith. Sometimes we want to say , Okay God , my faith is strong enough so lets get on with answering the prayer. But what we need to realize is that God is more interested in our character than in our comfort. Fifth , waiting on God gets our attention and corrects our motives . </wait.v.1122><wait.v.1123>On the Platform , by Denis Emorine , takes us to a crowded platform where impatient travelers wait for a train from Paris. We are introduced to a character named Laure. She is waiting for her fianc Julien to arrive. Is it chance or fate that Laure meets a man named Marek ? What transpires is an encounter we may all one day face. How extraordinary that in this crowded landscape , Laure realizes her destiny and his are intertwined . </wait.v.1123><wait.v.1124>I truly believe time to be moved along by our common belief in it. There is a place , existing now where we are joy. There is a moment existing where we are happy. As of now my love , I am trapped here in this parallel place; waiting to love you </wait.v.1124><wait.v.1125>Rock on Sheila ! ! ! I ' ve been a fan since 1984 , and still listen to your music. I love all kinds of music , and country is no exception , so when I saw you were going to be on Gone Country , I couldn ' t wait to watch. It is awesome , and I hope you win ! ! ! ! You definitely have what it takes. Best of luck ! ! ! ! </wait.v.1125><wait.v.1126>I ' m actually willing to be persuaded that this might be the most practical approach. There would have to be very strong selection criteria regarding criminal records , background checks , employment history , long waiting periods , etc. , etc. But if this is not coupled with strong and effective border security , that is actually implemented , I won ' t go along with it . </wait.v.1126><wait.v.1127>" I have been waiting for some time now for God 's promise in my life to finally get fulfilled and it 's gotten to that point of 'how long Lord ' ? The frustration on waiting and things getting harder as you 'wait'. Your song came in a perfect time to remind to and encourage me worship and serve Him while I wait rather than get frustrated and give up. Thank you and thank you ! You do n't know how this is making a difference in people 's lives as we wait upon the Lord. " </wait.v.1127><wait.v.1128>I ' m going to have to agree with Jessica for the people that think Alicia ' s family is crazy seriously GO TO HELL and as for the capital letters yes i am shouting and as for Michelle , how can you back up a angry man like that , did he knock you up too ? That just seems to be the case. Can ' t wait to see you Alicia you ' re in my prayers see you soon </wait.v.1128><wait.v.1129>We were one of the last people in line , joining the queue at the intersection of 7th and Cedar. ( Practically at the MPR building ! ) Despite knowing we 'd NEVER get in , we still waited patiently , then walked to the corner of 7th and Kellogg to see Obama on the big screen. It was pretty powerful - see my blog for more pictures . </wait.v.1129><wait.v.1130>Thanks for the list checker , I found mine was eaten by my PC , so now I ' m waiting for it to reappear. How long should I wait ? </wait.v.1130><wait.v.1131>And so it goes with the yarn. And with the mail. Mail and yarn. It 's a good thing I can satisfy 50 of the urge to amass yarn at any time of the day or night. All I have to do is log on and there I go. But my problems begin when the waiting begins. Oh , the hours. The days. The long days. When four o'clock comes around , there I go , looking out the window when I hear a sound. A certain sound that means Mr. Mailman may be near. I tell you what : I can bound up the stairs to get a birds eye view at the drop of the safari hat. And I know exactly where to stand so he does n't see me from the street. I 've got this thing down pat . </wait.v.1131><wait.v.1132>I know , Giles said simply. The rest of the Scoobies had gathered in the living room and were waiting the return of their best friend and the bleached menace that had been living with them for the last couple of days . </wait.v.1132><wait.v.1133>" We see lots of prices online too. My suggestion is to wait until the 3GS ships and THEN see what the prices are , hopefully having less variations by then.

We 're waiting to be offically recognized as a couple : ie : A fromal blessing ceremony . </wait.v.1134><wait.v.1135>Today was a full day. We had appointments for passport photos , medical exam , and visa application at the police station. Every appointment was crazy with lots of adoptive families being pushed through the system like cattle. The police station reminded me of the DMV. Many people sitting is chairs waiting for their number to be called . </wait.v.1135><wait.v.1136>" That 's right. Catch you later , Brother. I might be a while , but I 'll be back. You 'll just have to wait - patiently. " </wait.v.1136><wait.v.1137>wow , I am late to the party - but congratulations Cactus-Fish family and Welcome to the blogosphere Owen ! Ca n't wait to " meet " you ! </wait.v.1137><wait.v.1138>As promised , here are the Armed &amp;Magical bookmarks ( as you can see , they 'll print four to a sheet -- front and back ) . You can click on the image and get a larger version that you can read -- hopefully. The resolution is a little fuzzy since I had to convert the nice , crisp PDF to a JPEG to get it to post on Blogger. I 'm still waiting on another sized design from my graphics person , but I should get that soon , then I 'll have them printed , and whoever wants one can just send me an email with their name and address. ( I 'll send you MLTF and A &amp;M postcards , too . ) </wait.v.1138><wait.v.1139>Will a rework of what you 're waiting for suddenly bring into focus a man you did n't consider before ? It might. But even if it does n't , when we wait patiently for what we long for  and what we 're longing for conforms to God 's design  God uses the waiting to align our desires with His and refine us in the process . </wait.v.1139><wait.v.1140>I was very proud of Gale. She is truly a working mother. She would work in the corrals and each break she would get into the pickup and nurse her pups. Then when the shearers started shearing again she would come back to work. She is the hardest working dog on this ranch. The boys just have to work , they do n't have to try to raise pups as well. Mick mostly laid under the shearing wagon waiting for me to call him to work. He will NOT work for anyone but me. He likes the herders but he will not work for them. I was doing wool-handing ( grading , skirting , working the press ) and not work in the corrals much. Jorge would call Mick to come to work and Mick would just act like he did n't hear him. Jorge knows Mick will not work for him but that does n't stop he from trying to get him to come to work . </wait.v.1140><wait.v.1141>The top photo is Old Noey , first made and sold in February 2005. She was one of my very first batch of kitten softies. After Noey travelled across the sea , she was given to a little girl and was much loved and cuddled for almost five fabulous years. But after all that cuddling she started to wear thin. Stuffing started to come out and her head had become distorted. There was a little breakfast cereal on her stockings and my hand stitching had started to unravel so much so there was a fair chance that her head would come off altogether. So Old Noey came back here again for some R &amp;R , special stuffing based chicken soup , and Australian sunshine. She ' s had a good holiday and now has roses in her cheeks and a fresh spring in her step. She ' s packed her new spare sundress and her journal and she ' s heading back to Georgia , USA to little Tess who has been waiting patiently for her return . </wait.v.1141><wait.v.1142>When we had eaten we returned to see how Leo was getting on , Billali saying that he must now wait upon She , and hear her commands. On reaching Leo 's room we found the poor boy in a very bad way. He had woke up from his torpor , and was altogether off his head , babbling about some boat-race on the Cam , and was inclined to be violent. Indeed , when we entered the room Ustane was holding him down. I spoke to him , and my voice seemed to soothe him; at any rate he grew much quieter , and was persuaded to swallow a dose of quinine . </wait.v.1142><wait.v.1143>Grace had n't been too concerned when she had awakened alone that morning; she knew that Nick would have to leave and go to work. She herself had work to do that day and could n't wait to get to it ! She was excited to see Ariel and tell her of her fantastic evening with Nick; she knew that Ariel would be excited for her. She also could n't wait to go and hold a meeting with her new loyal followers. After all , the sooner her and her people could help Lucifer reign in San Francisco , the sooner she would be rid of Nick 's pesky friends and associates ! </wait.v.1143><wait.v.1144>I 've done a lot of research on this subject because I too am waiting for an iphone on verizon. From all of the sites that i 've been on , almost everyone is holding out for a verizon iphone. Of all the comments , everyone who has an iphone currently , absolutly hates the service of at &amp;t except the few areas where the service is acceptionally well.Still , with all my years with verizon , i have never experianced a drop call so i do not want to switch to at &amp;t where the iphone users are mentioning dropped called in every other sentence.So , I too will wait for a verizon iphone , it is inevitable because on the businees side of things apple can not go wrong in providing for verizon since there are thousands and thousands of people ready to buy the iphone on a dime on verizon but thats just my 2 cents; P </wait.v.1144><wait.v.1145>I definitely recommend upgrading , with two important exceptions. First , if you need to run Classic , you should stick with PowerPC ( Intel Macs do n't support it ) . And second , if you have a high-performance application that 's not Intel native ( e.g. , Photoshop ) , you might want to wait until it 's ported over. For everyone else , feel free to pull the trigger whenever your checkbook permits . </wait.v.1145><wait.v.1146>Virtually any flavor salt can be made : chili and lemon grass for a Thai bent , basil and lime zest for a summery flavor , or a blending with cumin and tumeric for an Indian version. Once the salt is made , it lasts for weeks closed tightly in a jar , waiting to be used any way you choose , sprinkled on a grilled skirt steak , or lightly flavoring a soft-boiled egg. So go bash about , and salt with abandon ! </wait.v.1146><wait.v.1147>I didn ' t buy a lot. I thought I just didn ' t find anything I needed in KL. Shopping was not my intention in KL. But the girls were crazy about the Vincci shoes. Every mall we stopped at , the first thing they would find was Vincci ' s outlet. And all the guys had to wait patiently outside . </wait.v.1147><wait.v.1148>Many of you have been waiting 5 weeks for an invitation.

It was just after 8 PM , and the line was still wrapped around the store , even though the store was closing in an hour. I was able to go straight in , and after about half a dozen employees looked over the phone and scratched their heads , an Apple Genius took me over to the iPhone sales area and approved me for an exchange. Since I had had so much trouble , the extremely helpful and understanding clerk walked me through activation and let me make some test calls and sample photos before letting me leave the store. Finally , after nearly 38 hours and two attempts waiting in line , I had a working iPhone . </wait.v.1149><wait.v.1150>And countless other young women are " just waiting around " for their future spouse.

Felicia had called the old woman honey since she first learned to talk , mistaking the endearment the older woman called the child for the womans name. By the time she was old enough to know the difference , the name had stuck. Honey parted the faded blue and white checked curtains , and frowning , watched as the younger woman jumped into the honking pickup truck waiting outside. She sighed and turned away , back to the kitchen. How many times had she told Felicia that a properly brought up young lady shouldnt be running and slamming doors , much less jumping into trucks whose drivers didnt have the decency to come in instead of waiting outside honking ? Felicia would be twenty-one tomorrow and the old woman hadnt mentally prepared her mind , or her heart , to let go of the girl she had raised from infancy . </wait.v.1153><wait.v.1154>What I 'm reading right now : The Bible ( I 'm up to Luke ) , I just finished re-reading Jim Butcher 's Proven Guilty ( awesome ) , and am now re-reading Jim 's Grave Peril ( loved it ) . Then again how could I not love these books enough to re-read them ? As you regular readers know , Jim Butcher is my favorite fantasy author; his Dresden Files books are simply the best. Period. And each one is even better than the last. The man is talented. One of these days I hope to meet him and tell him that.; ) And this weekend I 'll be getting Linnea Sinclair 's The Down Home Zombie Blues. I simply can not wait to read this book. For a peek , see Linnea 's link to the right . </wait.v.1154><wait.v.1155>For that , the lady got a more sincere smile , although it was still tempered by a heavy bout of self-consciousness. Surely , the lady must have been wondering why she ' d come here and sat waiting for so long. The girl suddenly decided that she should have taken a cookie , since they were offered , and now mentally kicked herself for not. She pondered a moment whether it would be the right thing to take one now , but then decided against it and finally got to her feet . </wait.v.1155><wait.v.1156>In the process of coming to church and waiting before the Cross , the Holy Spirit comes into our hearts and reveals to us our new identity in Christ.

He breathed deeply , twitching his ears as he listened , making certain that it was n't his Ezra 's voice. No , not his man , rather it was a female sound. He stood stock still while Badger continued his slow consumption of the low grass. The cry ended and the house became silent again. Chaucer waited another minute before he took up his pacing once more . </wait.v.1158><wait.v.1159>The concierge posted at the door was taking in about 10 people at a time , so about every 15 to 20 minutes , the line moved quite a bit.

Absolutely. Like Estara , my first thought was of P.C. Hodgell. I also read the first book of the God Stalk Chronicles in 1982. When To Ride a Rathborn arrived in 2007 , I held the book with joy and fear. Fear because God Stalk was published when Hodgell was a grad student and Rathborn was published after she retired from University of Wisconsin. I wondered if the 25 years from student to retirement would change the magic. To my joy , the books had the feel and focus , the same layering of myth and legend , and the same engaging characters.

I do not believe a Christian can have his heart scripturally right , unless he is looking for God 's Son from heaven; for there could be no such thing as attempting to set the world right if its sin in rejecting Christ were fully seen. Moreover , there never will be a correct judgment formed of the character of the world until that crowning sin be apprehended by the soul. To a Christian who is looking and waiting for Christ to come from heaven , Christ Himself is unspeakably more the object before the soul. It is not that I shall get to heaven and be happy , but that the Lord Himself is coming from heaven for me , and for all the Church. It is this which gives its character to the joy of the saint; so Christ Himself says , " I will come again , and receive you unto Myself; that where I am , there ye may be also. " Where I find my delight , there shall you find yours also , I with you , and you with me - for ever with the Lord . </wait.v.1169><wait.v.1170>Just like I 'll wait for that extra writing job that will make me happier than my last in-office job and not break my spirit doing so.

I attribute me staying a virgin to God as I am now in a culture that does not value virginity. I have only been in the US fairly recently. I made the decision to wait to have sex until marraige when I was 12. That was the first time I had an opinion about pre-marital sex. I had heard in church not to engage in pre-marital sex and when I was in school around 8 we had a talk about AIDS. I was not a Christian until I was 12 but it made sense to me to wait . </wait.v.1180><wait.v.1181>But the good news ? There ' s still time. You can still be that person.

And with the hecticness of the wedding , those five days may give you a chance to reconnect so that it 's really special. That said , it 's going to be special pretty much no matter what : ) </wait.v.1189><wait.v.1190>It isn ' t easy , because in our now culture of instant gratification , waiting is a lost art. Waiting has been lost as we have lost our sense of rhythm , and found a way to cheat seasons , cheat aging , and streamline nearly everything into rational patterns of efficiency. The only ones in touch with rhythm are those who have learned to pray , or those who live by the sea , or perhaps women , who still know rhythm in their bodies and in the waiting for birth . </wait.v.1190><wait.v.1191>I even turned on the Destroyed in Seconds marathon on Discovery to watch while I waited for the haircolor to develop. I did as best a job as I could do. It is a little easier to color my hair while it ' s this short. It ' s when my hair is long that I really have a hard time. I tried my best to get all the roots and saturate the ends. At the end of my 15 minute waiting period , I turned on the shower and got ready to hop in. About then , apparently Kile had heard the shower start and he came in the room. Apparently , he thought I was skipping the haircolor and just going for the shower . </wait.v.1191><wait.v.1192>IMO they could ' ve done more with ' Mimi ' .

I wasn ' t exactly sure what to do at that point. I ' d looked at the pictures in Terry ' s book , but I had not actually read the text. I figured it must be like fishing.

He is waiting patiently with expectant faith , without fear and without doubt. He does not believe that the Lord should , nor could , be hurried.

This could be either a really good thing , or a really bad thing , depending on her mood at the time , but after all , she was the one who suggested it. No , ordered it , in fact.

Women who were referred for surgery directly after their initial procedure had a median waiting time of 24 days , as compared with 32 and 48 days for women with 1 or 2 intervening diagnostic procedures , respectively. The only diagnostic procedures considered in our study were related to the breast. We did not include procedures such as bone and liver scans , which may have been used for cancer staging. The question is whether the increasing availability of complex diagnostic procedures adds important advantages that outweigh the disadvantages that might result from longer delays to definitive surgical procedures. In other words , are all of these additional diagnostic procedures necessary ? </wait.v.1202><wait.v.1203>When we are at crossroads , and there are more than one option , waiting on God is indispensable. Deciding between good and bad is easier than choosing between good and better. What is apparent may not be the actual. Only God knows which is best for us. He alone knows the end from the beginning ( Isa 46 : 10 ) . We are concerned about the immediate but He cares for the ultimate. Many a headache and loss can be avoided if only we take time to wait on God to see how He would steer the events. Eliezer made a trip to Mesopotamia to hunt for a bride for Isaac. When he saw Rebekah who was exquisitely beautiful and exceptionally helpful , he was quite excited. However he " remained silent so as to know whether the Lord had prospered his trip or not " ( Gen 24 : 21 ) . Interestingly , during that time , the groom was also waiting on God by spending time in meditation out in the fields ( v 63 ) . What a lesson for parents and youngsters ! </wait.v.1203><wait.v.1204>Three months after we returned from China I saw a little boy with albinism on the CCAI waiting child list. Out of curiosity , I decided to spend come time researching albinism. Based upon the information I gathered , I believed that our family would be able to care for a child with the disease.

While waiting in the security line at the airport , my Dallas friend noticed an Asian girl in line with her parents and noted that she kinda looked like one of his ex-girlfriends -- an ex-girlfriend with whom he 'd rather not interact. We really did n't need to get closer to confirm , given the way our luck was going. And , yup. He was right. What are the chances of bumping into an ex-girlfriend while you 're on vacation ? Pretty high , I guess , when karma has it in for you . </wait.v.1205><wait.v.1206>For some of us we explore our desire in the complex of commitment to one other in the forming of a union that seeks to be life long.

I don ' t mind waiting for 10-15 minutes without being compensated for my wait ( after all restaurants are not run like trains ) , but more than that is a nuissance , especially if you have after dinner plans. If a restaurant makes one with a reservation wait for more than 30 minutes , then it shows little respect for one ' s time. It rarely happens , but when it does I leave ( some people don ' t tip but I see no point in punishing the servers when clearly it is not their fault ) .

Okay , we ' re taking a shower now , I whisper , and I mumble shampoo into my hair and toothpaste into my mouth and stand mesmerized in front of the coffee machine. At times , the procedure seems heartbreakingly complicated grinding the beans into dust , separating the filter from the packet ( which requires the same kind of fine motor skills as threading a needle ) , bringing water from the sink to the reservoir of the automatic coffee maker.

I stand there at the counter holding my mug , waiting as the water burbles through its cycle and trickles into the pot. Okay , I encourage softly. Okay , go Go !

After only a short while a total stranger came up to where they were seated and told them they were going to reseat them at a different location. They were then lead down to the floor to be seated behind the competitors to watch the closing ceremonies up close and personal. Unbelievable ! Tell me there was n't angels guiding this project ... ... .one in particular named Regina . </wait.v.1236><wait.v.1237>God made Jax , right ? When he was alive , every time I came home and I mean every time he could hardly wait to jump and start licking me ! In my mind ' s eye I can still see his stubby tail wiggling. The more I think about it , our dog ' s love was ever-constant , even after those rare occasions when I had to spank his terrier-fanny for pooping or peeing on the carpet. No matter what , his love remained. Truly , Jax was a super-affectionate dog . </wait.v.1237><wait.v.1238>The phrase " waiting on the Holy Spirit " may well bring to mind our Quaker friends. They place great value in learning to wait on the Holy Spirit even in the leading of a worship gathering. The Quakers do n't rush pell-mell through a pre-arranged order of service ( like we sometimes do ) . Our Quaker friends expectantly wait for the Lord to lead in ways that can seem very strange to those of us who have carefully crafted orders of service which we distribute beforehand to worshipers. There 's a spontaneity about Quaker gatherings. When they gather for worship , there 's an attentive waiting for God to move and speak . </wait.v.1238><wait.v.1239>My baby planners are some of my most favorite clients there is something so special for me in seeing a family grow and change during their little one ' s first year.

To tend my plot , to live by that punctual rape of every blessed day. To watch the hour hand rise and fall and rise again , its only hope a paycheck and a kept-to schedule.

One door holds more human clothes and shoes. It 's got a separate door to a connected space right next to it where the humans stockpile food. I like to jump and climb on the shelves. These doors also make a satisfying thump-thump noise when I open them at night. I like to wait until the humans are sleeping before I do this . </wait.v.1241><wait.v.1242>Congratulations !

I called a UPS store in Temecula where I had originally sent the package. I spoke with Anita and explained my situation , she then gave me the number to the UPS station in Boise , ID. I called the number in Boise and spoke with Cynthia. I explained to her our desperate situation and how important it was to track down the package. In the mean time , my cousin was called down to the Convention Center where the games were being held because there were reporters that wanted to interview her on her quest to supply the jerseys to the young men of El Salvador. Her husband Phil stayed home to accept the package. Cynthia called the driver to see where his location was , gave Phil 's number to the driver to have him call Phil so that Phil could drive to where the package was. Are you still with me ? I 'm ( not so patiently ) waiting a phone call from anyone to tell me what is happening on their end. The print place is also waiting ... . </wait.v.1243><wait.v.1244>I would love to wait for the trade on all my books , but I think I have to wait until comic book culture shifts to that method , and trades become more frequent.

The darkness hung with us. The excitement began to grow as the families gathered in the big room with the joy and excitement building with each announcement of their movements. Our Marine Homecoming shirts proudly displayed. Sharing hugs with families we did not know. Waiting waiting. Finally , the announcement came the buses are moving. Some of us were drawn outside stretching our necks to see those great buses bring in our loved ones , Our hero 's , our Marines. The lights in the darkness were moving toward us , waiting waiting. Our American flags were waving high , the sounds of our cheers echoed into the night , here they come , here they are , in front of us. Our Hero's. The buses stopped and doors opened.

I have n't been feeling too good , I 've been sick all week and have just been trying to rest up so I did n't do much practice the last couple of days. I wanted to get some solid runs in today but had a pretty dirty crash in some rocks again and banged myself up a little so I just waited to qualifying after that. I had a pretty good run and played it safe in a couple of sections , Fabien Barel just beat me in qualifying by 0.56 all the times were pretty close but I know I can go faster tomorrow. I definatly want to win tomorrow and feel confident but also at the same time I know I need to ride smart for the championship so I will have to try and find somewhere in the middle.

I ca n't believe I have to wait for two whole years " I wanted to cyberslap them and say bitch , please I got really annoyed. I 've been waiting for Acheron 's book since 2000. That 's the year two thousand. I still remember talking to this friend I had that loved the series as much as I did at the time and just bemoaning over the fact that it was going to be YEARS before Acheron 's book would come out. How were we going to wait that long ? We would surely die if forced to wait that long. Back then , five to seven years seemed like an impossibly long time. Holding my baby and thinking that he was going to be at least five years old when Acheron 's book finally came out was just unfathomable to me . </wait.v.1255><wait.v.1256>Sooner or later I ' ll catch the other stuff I ' m waiting for.

Christians believe he rose again and ascended into heaven , and while antisupernaturalists may find that impossible to believe literally , in either case he is no longer here. Advent , then , is a season of waiting in darkness for the light to return , both in the celebration of an innocent baby ' s birth long ago , and also in the hope for the breaking forth of a future Kingdom governed by divine principles of justice , equity and compassion , where the meek are raised up and the haughty brought low. It is the arrival of this glorious Kingdom , governed by its glorious King , that orthodox Christianity has by long tradition called the Second Coming . </wait.v.1259><wait.v.1260>I am always shocked by how much difference one day makes. When I initial hear about something it usually makes me very upset and even angry. My righteous indignation swells and I 'm ready to charge off like a bull in a China shop and " deal with it. " But if I wait , the next day brings different feelings. My indignation is the same , but I am slower to act and more thoughtful about how to proceed. The patience ( which is always so difficult at the time ) tempers the anger within and allows for a more amicable , and henceforth a more biblical , outcome . </wait.v.1260><wait.v.1261>That is my worst fear : being late to anywhere I go.

Hundreds of families were gathered , anxiously waiting through the last few minutes of a deployment that began last August. Other families could not attend and a few Official Huggers were on hand to welcome home the Marines who had no one waiting. As the busses drew closer , announcements were made and cheers rang out. Finally , they were through the front gates , weapons delivered to the armory , back on the busses to Wrigley field , and pouring down the steps into the arms of waiting family members. The waiting was over. Our hearts were full and tears were flowing . </wait.v.1262><wait.v.1263>I love the site ... After a baby and dealing with the same old guys that only wanted me for a 'feeling ' , I decided that i 'm worth waiting for.

I thank God for my second and a second and a second chance ( lol ) . This time i 'll make it right ... I always wanted to break out of my shell and be a motivational speaker about values and respect. I guess you beat me to the punch lol..God Bless you . </wait.v.1263><wait.v.1264>What ' s the point ? How do we wait on God ' s name ? Remember that names in the Bible have great significance especially the names of God. The reason for this is because the names of God stand for His character , for who He is , what He is , and will do. They stand for the principles and promises of the Bible. For instance , the name Yahweh means God is the self-existent and independent one , the God of revelation and redemption. As such , He has revealed Himself as El Shaddai , Almighty God , as El Elyon , God Most High , as Yahweh-Jireh , the Lord will provide , and as Yahweh-Tsidkenu , the Lord our righteousness , among others . </wait.v.1264><wait.v.1265>There was an article in the Boston Globe ( thanks Jill F and Rebecca for the link ) in which big name writers felt the pressure of producing even one book a year. Authors like Dennis Lehane and Brad Meltzer refused to do so because it takes more time for them to craft their novels. The norm now , it seems , is for authors to produce at least two books a year. It is uncertain the genesis of the pressure to produce because the publisher and agent would say it is from the readers and while the reader always wants more , it doesn ' t mean she isn ' t willing to wait either . </wait.v.1265><wait.v.1266>He took her hand before she could stop him and raised it to her lips.

While I ' m listening to the sermon in church , I ' m getting article ideas I want to write down. When I ' m writing , I ' m thinking of what time to start dinner and what to start first , the chicken or the salad. When I ' m making dinner , I ' m thinking about which projects I need to work on with the kids the next morning.

Very often , we wait simply because its not time yet. The prophet Habakkuk said : For the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it will speak , and it will not lie.

We had to change trains in Lida , and from there continue back to Gdynia. The train schedules told us that the train would arrive in an hour , and since it was a nice day , we decided to wait on the ramp.

What do you expect these people to think about Gayle ? They ca n't possibly think she is a trustworthy person. You can say all you want about how she was going to contact these people if they would have just given her some time. That is not how it works. They should be in contact with her on a weekly basis. You do n't give someone thousands of dollars and then just sit back and wait for them to get in touch with you at their convenience. She is not doing this the right way. She needs to resolve all of these problems and then reevaluate her breeding situation once these problems are taken care of. If it were just one person making these accusations I would tend to think maybe they were taking it a little overboard , but when this many people have a problem there is something wrong. Tell Gayle to think hard about how she can get out of this mess and get on with her life. I hope she can figure it out . </wait.v.1284><wait.v.1285>For years I avoided having testing done , instead I chose a surveillance program as my breast surgeon suggested , assuming I may be positive. Then , about 8 months ago I had a breast cancer scare , and while I waited for results , I had the genetic testing done. All I could think was that I did n't want to have to go home and tell my kids I did n't try everything possible to avoid cancer. Turns out , luckily , I did not have breast cancer. But while I was waiting the couple of weeks for the results to come back , I started working with my breast surgeon on moving forward with a prophylactic mastectomy , interviewing plastic surgeons , researching reconstruction methods , and talking to my gynecological oncologist about hysterectomy . </wait.v.1285><wait.v.1286>We have said more than once : waiting for the answer to prayer is not the whole of waiting , but only a part.

Then you clean up that resume , send it in and express your interest. You do n't sit at home and wait for the company to call you , nor do you walk in the front door -- want ad in hand -- and simply ask the boss to hire you. You play the game , you do the dance and you see what happens. Same with dating.

The scandal is that currently available information can neither confirm whether such problems actually exist nor determine which needs should have priority. The result has been resource claims based on anecdote , interest-group pressures and political perceptions of need , more often than not unsubstantiated by clear analysis and reliable data. The discussion about waiting lists has become a duet of charge and countercharge about the sustainability of the system and the " curative " powers of money. Our survey data illustrated the clash of opinion : government respondents insisted that waiting-list problems are neither serious nor worsening , whereas all other respondents maintained the opposite.1 , 2 And the sparse " harder " data that do exist suggest that opinion is a dangerously poor substitute for careful measurement and analysis.7 </wait.v.1291><wait.v.1292>This is also a class issue.

Today is my 28th birthday and I am proud to say that I have been waiting for a year now since God put it in my spirit to purify myself.

" There was no apology for keeping me waiting , or for making me comeback. In fact , the manager walked passed me a couple of times and basically ignored my presence. Unloading the truck was more important looking after customers . </wait.v.1305><wait.v.1306>There are many important spiritual reasons that we will experience waiting times. First , waiting can refocus our attention away from " things " and back to God Himself. Second , waiting allows us to develop a clearer picture of our own motives and desires. Third , waiting builds perseverancespiritual stamina. Fourth , waiting opens the door to develop many spiritual strengths , such as faith and trust. Fifth , waiting allows God to put down other pieces in the puzzle of the bigger picture. Sixth , we may never know the reason we have to wait; hence , we learn to live by faith. Can you think of any other reasons for waiting ? </wait.v.1306><wait.v.1307>But my advice is to def wait until he is ready to get engaged that way you can enjoy planning together and he is not bitter about you pushing him into something he is not ready for yet.

How has life changed for her both in the UK and here in India ? I have got a lot of adulation and respect these last six months.

Compare this with the former chapter. He comes after long waiting for him. The church waited for him , and waited in the use of all means. She runs to the watchmen , and then inquires after him of the daughters of Jerusalem. After this she finds him. After we have waited and expected Christ in the use of means , Christ at length will discover himself to us; and yet more immediately , it was after the church had so deservedly exalted him in such lofty praises , 'This is my beloved , the chief of ten thousand; he is altogether lovely. ' when we set our hearts to the high exaltation of Christ above all things in the world , proclaiming him 'the chief of ten thousand , ' this at the last breeds a gracious discovery , 'I am my beloved 's , and my beloved is mine , ' for Christ when he sees us faithful , and so loving that we will not endure his absence , and so constantly loving , that we love him notwithstanding some discouragements , it melts him at the last , as Joseph was melted by his brethren . </wait.v.1310><wait.v.1311>Women have a waiting list whether they know it or not. This is very important to remember because women as a whole do n't have to do much to find a date or boyfriend.

I turned back to make sure the white-haired man did n't shout anything after me , some huge part of me wanting to get back and attack , but he was looking at the fire truck. I walked to Smith then down towards home , shooting furious glances at all the men and women out for dinner and drinks. How can they laugh and tell stories and eat and drink with this ignorance in the world , with bombs about to go off two blocks away ? Any other night I would be one of them . </wait.v.1312><wait.v.1313>Lafayette opened in December , and has perhaps also been waiting awhile to strike a chord with neighbors. It occupies a former antiques business remodeled by partners Mondher Khayat and Ramzi Boughamni , who replaced everything but the old-timey ceiling and a pair of lovely chandeliers whose amber glass harks back to Depression-era humbleness. The menu has something of a modest , dated quality to it , as well. Tunisian-born Boughamni runs the kitchen. He injects the occasional North African note into his meals , but mostly sticks to the canon of American-style Mediterranean cooking . </wait.v.1313><wait.v.1314>" I have no idea why we got this , " said a recipient of the offer , which was addressed to a generic official of the organization he works for. " Nobody here ever signed up for the waiting list. They even misspelled our name. " A note to Snyder and the Redskins : It does n't make you less of a person to admit you are having trouble selling as many season tickets as you 'd like -- especially in this economic climate. This could have even been another case of self-sabotage -- which Snyder should know plenty about when it comes to the Redskins -- where he pontificated about how it was so impossible to get tickets that many people did n't even try . </wait.v.1314><wait.v.1315>The other answer points to what has been said before. The giver is more than the gift; God is more than the blessing. And our being kept waiting on Him is the only way for our learning to find our life and joy in Himself. Oh , if God 's children only knew what a glorious God they have , and what a privilege it is to be linked in fellowship with Him , then they would rejoice in Him ! Even when He keeps them waiting , they will learn to understand better than ever. " Therefore will the LORD wait , that he may be gracious unto you. " His waiting will be the highest proof of His graciousness . </wait.v.1315><wait.v.1316>I was the bystander who stopped to help. If I had not , and everyone had waited for the police , what would have been the cost to Need 's victim ? I did not intervene with my gun waving in the air.

Waiting for that package to arrive that we ordered online in record speed. Waiting in line at the self-checkout station at the supermarket , designed to eliminate the evils of waiting. Waiting for the phone to ring on Saturday night. Waiting for that great job to come along. Or waiting for that elusive perfect relationship. It never ends. Researchers tell us that the average person will spend 5 years of his or her life waiting in line , 2 years playing telephone tag , and six months sitting at red lights. That is over 7 and a half years of waiting , at best doing nothing , or at worst experiencing great aggravation ! The bottom line is that even in our fast-paced world , with postmodern conveniences , we are all waiting for something. However , as strange as it sounds , during the Advent season , we discover a purpose to our waiting. Let me explain . </wait.v.1318><wait.v.1319>Jim Caruso , throws this fabulous party on Monday nights. It 's like a B'way open mic.and you never know who is going to drop in.

It was magical and I ca n't wait to go back . </wait.v.1319><wait.v.1320>I am amazed at what God is doing with a song that was literally written in 10 minutes ! I think it took so little time to write " While I 'm Waiting " because I had been and still am so intimately acquainted with what it means to wait on the Lord for something. I figured after I wrote the song that I would be " graduating " from waiting. Nope. Josee and I are now more familiar with waiting than ever. It reminds me of how ... " we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but we have one who has been tempted in every way , just as we are-yet was without sin. " All of you " waiters " out there , I can so relate and I pray that the " word of our testimonies " encourage one another.

" </wait.v.1321><wait.v.1322>At our first entrance into the school of waiting upon God , the heart is mainly set on the blessings which we wait for. God graciously uses our needs and desires for help to educate us for something higher than we were thinking of. We were seeking gifts; He , the Giver , longs to give Himself and to satisfy the soul with His goodness. It is just for this reason that He often withholds the gifts , and that the time of waiting is made so long. He is constantly seeking to win the heart of His child for Himself. He wishes that we would not only say , when He bestows the gift , " How good is God ! " but that long before it comes , and even if it never comes , we should all the time be experiencing : it is good that a man should quietly wait. " The LORD is good unto them that wait for him.

Every time I come home he waits for me at the top of the stairs. He 's quite a naughty and clever " little monkey " ( that 's what I call him ) . Pibo still loves to bark , as you may recall. That habit has been a little hard to break. He has gained 4 pounds since he came home so we had to cut back on his portions which , as you all can imagine , Pibo was not too happy about. We are thinking of adopting a new sibling for him but , at the end of the day , it 's Pibo 's call so we 'll see. He 's very jealous when it comes to his " mommies " . Pibo is so loved by his aunties and my nieces and nephews. For Christmas he had quite a few presents. Pibo has truly been a blessing to us. Thank you for choosing us as his family.

Most of us have had times when we were waiting and longing for God to do something. The Psalmists , " Come to save us " may be one of most frequent prayers of our life. True enough this prayer likely comes in those most difficult moments of our lives but even this is reflected in the scriptures. The lessons from Isaiah and the Psalms were both spoken in some of the most painful moments in Israels history . </wait.v.1327><wait.v.1328>After the clinic Ochoa spent an hour signing autographs and posing for pictures. Patiently awaiting their turn at the end of the line were a half dozen men from the maintenance crew , all of them in their 40s or 50s.

When Ochoa finally reached the men , she put them at ease with a smile and a few kind words , and they crowded around her for pictures . </wait.v.1328><wait.v.1329>And I 've been patiently waiting for the second half to come online.

According to this spokesperson : </wait.v.1330><wait.v.1331>I have found that before almost every significant decision in my life , there has been a time when I have been forced by God to wait. Because His answers do not usually come on my schedule , he forces me to step aside. Sometimes that may mean a trip to be alone , or just pulling away for a day or two or a weekend , Just to wait in silence for him to clear the fog and quiet my spirit . </wait.v.1331><wait.v.1332>I was waiting for Kail to get there and help him unload , I was looking over my truck , I found that the front rim on the passenger side had a huge crack in it. I got a different tire and rim from the irrigation specialist on the farm ( thanks Tom ) and changed it out. I can not believe it did n't just come off the truck while I was driving. That would have be a huge mess. I just had this truck inspected by a mechanic and a federal sticker put on it. I can not believe they missed this crack . </wait.v.1332><wait.v.1333>Shane ' s enjoying his 4 walks a day and his run over the fields at the weekends. He is really attached to us now , especially me. Hubby says Shane lies at the front door when I go out , waiting for his mum to come back. He also sits there when he knows it 's walk time. He loves giving Mackenzie a big kiss in the morning to wake him up. He has a girlfriend he sees in a garden most days and he loves to have a good sniff through the fence. Doesn ' t bark at her much now. He loves his rug in front of the fire and he loves cuddles.

I can hear Guns and Rose ' s November Rain being played in the background. The music is actually quite loud.

I thought that was awesome. I can ' t wait until I leave . </wait.v.1335><wait.v.1336>good and our protection. I have since learned that I am worth the wait ?

Also , serving food is only one part of waiting table , and server is the natural word for the those who , in some restaurants , do a part of the serving that waiters and waitresses do n't do. ( And in small restaurants that are not dysfunctional , anybody in the front of the house'' will water tables and do similar stuff to take some of the pressure off any waiters or waitresses who are headed for the weeds . ) </wait.v.1337><wait.v.1338>They meet very interesting people also onboard other boats sailing in these waters. These are really long distance sailors who are here. One family with their children they met on a Jeaneau-boat was from Marseille in France and on their way to Troms where they plan to stay for the winter with their children. One other Swedish couple living in England had just received a spare half year in a sudden. So they did not have the time to wait for a new boat and bought a second hand Hallberg-Rassy 39 instead now sailing from England to Lofoten and further on north. On another boat there was a 6 year old child , who already had sailed 16 000 miles , which is more than half way around the world ( we sailed 530 nm this summer onboard REGINA ... ) . These sailors do not just come from the next village along the coast ! And you should hear their discussions ! What do you think about the port of Tahiti ? , etc. It is another world Karolina is in right now. Maybe more global ! I hope she will find her way back again.

We started our paperwork but knew we could work at a slower pace this time. We knew we wanted a little boy and we wanted to name him Eli. We also knew we wanted to do the Waiting Child Program again. So once again , I started looking at the profiles of waiting children. I also filled out another Medical Conditions Checklist for Deniece. She said she should be getting another batch of profiles in a couple of months. I said we had plenty of time to find our son . </wait.v.1339><wait.v.1340>This is the human cost of public hospital waiting lists , and why waiting lists matter.

No matter who the candidate may be , it takes extraordinary courage to stand in front of an entire Nation and run for this office. I do worry , however , that an ongoing ( and increasingly hostile ) dispute could very well dampen the enthusiasm of the young voters that are showing up in droves. This is something we have waited for decades to see and to undermine that now would be a tremendous loss for all of us. Hopefully it will be settled tomorrow and we can move on . </wait.v.1341><wait.v.1342>Careworks in Clarks Summit is great. The line is usually short ( if there is one ! ) .

During the 40 years of my walk with God ( 1963-2003 ) , I have always experienced calm at the depth of my heart in spite of roaring waves above because I have believed every one of the 40 verses of this Psalm. Here is a sample passage from this golden Psalm : " Rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for Him; do not fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. Cease from anger , and forsake wrath; Do not fret it only causes harm " ( vv 7 , 8 ) . </wait.v.1346><wait.v.1347>As the clock slid towards one pm and the office staff resumed treating patients , those of us who were still waiting patiently , began talking to one another and there 's something about being in close proximity and in need that causes people to act differently than they normally would. Secrets often come tumbling out that the rest of the waiting room people really do n't want to hear or even know about. And the while , the dentist and his staff rushed from patient to patient , trying to fill the dental needs of the packed waiting room , thankfully oblivious to the drama being played out right in front of them . </wait.v.1347><wait.v.1348>One of the most important things you need to make your waiting time easy and short is obedience. You say " What do you mean ? I am seriously sick , I have troubled home , my marriage is not working , I am barren , ca n't have a child , everything I try to do never succeed - Obey who ? Well , I have a news for you. You must find out what God wants you to do about your situation and obey. Obedience includes agreement and surrender. There is no faith without obedience. " </wait.v.1348><wait.v.1349>However , to do so for them because they have been here longer- in essence broken the law longer-than another immigrant is completely unfair. There are people in African countries and Asian countries that have been on the waiting list to get into this nation for years and years , and they do not have the benefit of a shared border with the US so they can not just be smuggled in so easily and bide their time until granted amnesty . </wait.v.1349><wait.v.1350>As I still follow a carwith my dad in itI realize why he sleeps every night in the middle of the staircase : his mind has lost track of the time that has gone by , and thats why he sleeps there , waiting every night for his wife to come back home so they both can go upstairs to their bedroom.

And the person who has already gone on up to a higher grade needs to wait and seek some more in order to grow too. The thing about God is that He keeps beckoning you to go higher. Thats all well and good , but the glorious problem is this : just when you think you are about to get to that point where you have finally reached your place in God , He moves on you and takes you higher still . </wait.v.1352><wait.v.1353>Oh children , for Love of your Being I have called again and again.

Everything that followed in his life was just the opposite. The imprisonment in Egypt on false charges of sexual misbehaviour provided for him an excellent time to wait on God who never fails His Word. Joseph had written the vision clearly in his heart. He had been assured that the vision was yet for an appointed time; though it delayed , he must wait for it; it would surely be fulfilled ( Hab 2 : 2 , 3 ) . The divine record says , " The word of the Lord tested Joseph until the time came for its fulfillment " ( Psa 105 : 19 ) . If we are really waiting on God , we will not employ fleshly methods to work out things for our promotion. You get the chicken by hatching the egg , not by smashing it open ! </wait.v.1355><wait.v.1356>I was wrong. After we had thought you were dead , I watched Buffy from a distance because after that night with Wood we were never as close as we once had been. All the life had left her. She walked around as if she was waiting to die almost like she was biding her time until she could be with you. Her behavior echoed her lack of , dare I say , Buffiness that she had after Willow brought her out of Heaven. It made me realize that had Wood and I succeeded then I would have been the one that done that to her. Without you at her side , she would have never been able to defeat The First.

Plead with God , and take no denial , rest on the promise of God , and never give it up. Wait at the throne of God , and let nothing drive you thence. If the Lord seems to be turned against you , and if everything seems to conspire to discourage you , still persevere. Remember the woman of Canaan , how she was discouraged; but she persevered and succeeded. Remember Jacob , how he was discouraged , and yet succeeded. Remember Moses , to whom God said , " Let me alone , " but he persevered and succeeded. Remember Hezekiah , what a death-blow he got , but he persevered and succeeded. The Lord will turn again; he will have compassion upon you; for he will cast all your sins into the depths of the sea. Trust , then , in the Lord forever , for in the Lord Jehovah there is everlasting strength; and that strength shall be put forth , and be made perfect in your weakness . </wait.v.1366><wait.v.1367>On Sept. 29 , she was told that her modification had been approved , but she still had to wait for some delayed paperwork -- perhaps another 30 to 60 days . </wait.v.1367><wait.v.1368>Listen to the voice of one who was deeply tried : " I waited patiently for the Lord , and He inclined unto me , and heard my cry. " Hear what he passed through : " He brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings. And He hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our God. " Patient waiting upon God brings a rich reward; the deliverance is sure; God Himself will put a new song into your mouth. O soul ! be not impatient , whether it be in the exercise of prayer and worship that you find it difficult to wait , or in the delay in respect of definite requests , or in the fulfilling of your hearts desire for the revelation of God Himself in a deeper spiritual life - fear not , but rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for Him . </wait.v.1368><wait.v.1369>I 'd introduced everyone and we were moving on , getting ready to start the authors ' panel , when Jon said , " Have n't you forgotten someone ?

Yeah ... so , I 'd forgotten Stephenie , who was waiting patiently in the wings to hear her name. I could not stop laughing , as you can see. She had to wait a while longer . </wait.v.1369><wait.v.1370>I am a 27 year old God-fearing , attractive virgin woman. For many years I have felt alone in being the only one in my social circle that did n't give in to the pressures of having sex. It was n't until about a month ago that all of that almost changed. I had a close call for the very first time , but the Lord kept me. I thank Him for that and appreciate a site such as this one. I no longer feel alone on this journey. I am now in a relationship and am blessed to have a man that respects my decision to wait until marriage. I pray that the Lord will continue to cover me and I want to thank you for encouraging young people or old for that matter to hold on.

We paint them many colors , but we wait for this day to paint their eyes. Because people believe dragon is true if this day give them eyes it will be very lively. There are races all day and people eat rice tamales. Then in midday we try to stand an egg up on the floor , according to the custom. At night , some people wear special clothes and paint their faces to dance the dragon dances.

Why was it that in the house of Cornelius , when " Peter spake these words , the Holy Ghost fell upon all that heard him " ? They had said , " We are here before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. " We may come together to give and to listen to the most earnest exposition of Gods truth with little spiritual profit if there be not the waiting for Gods counsel . </wait.v.1374><wait.v.1375>Hm..six steps. Easy right ? Alcoholics have twice as many steps and they complete them with no problems. I wait patiently for my meal. I gaze at my watch a few times. Surely they didn ' t forget me. Maybe there were busy , maybe they had to slaughter the cow , maybe they were arguing over who will get to cook it for me. Whatever the issue , you people are taking far too long to cook a simple burger. Ten minutes is all it takes. No fifteen , not twenty. No exaggerating.

Waiting lists addressed in isolation may entail a claim on resources ( e.g. , operating room time ) that must come from elsewhere in the system.

In biblical terms , you might say he " waited upon " the wrong thing. The familiar phrase from the prophet Isaiah points to another kind of waiting.

I told the AT &amp;T rep that just before calling Apple representative , I was told by another AT &amp;T rep that she had updated the SIM card information - what happened ?

They are equine specialists , and their heated stall was waiting for us. They called us as we were driving home though and asked if there was any way we could overnight somewhere else and bring the colt in the morning. They said it was just storming too hard there for us to make it safely. We did n't think it could be any worse than what we were already driving through , and we did n't know if the colt could survive another night on his own. So the Clinic agreed that one of their Doctors who lives near the Clinic would meet us there when we called . </wait.v.1386><wait.v.1387>It is nearly dark when I get home. There ' s a current of fresh smelling air as day turns to night. I remember walking down Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn on fall evenings when I was a child , carrying home a loaf of rye bread still warm from the bakery. The streets were filled with men coming home from work. Men carrying brief cases and adult concerns. I want to be a child among them now , comfortably invisible , my hands tucked into my pockets , a loaf of warm bread nestled under my jacket , cool fresh air with the smell of burning leaves in my nose , knowing that when I get home there will be a hot bowl of soup waiting for me . </wait.v.1387><wait.v.1388>P.S.

We really wish that things will be better in 2009. But what if 2009 is worse than 2008 ? Do we have much control over things ? No. But we can still have this glorious hope of the resurrection no matter what happens. We have access to God ' s grace of salvation now and forever. In fact , the best for each of us is yet to come. This is a fantastic hope and promise for each of us , and we will never be disappointed. At this time of the years , let ' s us refocus our thoughts and place our full confidence in Him who is faithful and trustworthy. Let us not worry too much but come to the Lord in prayer and abide in him through His words and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. With this glorious hope in mind , let us wait patiently for His glorious redemption and give ourselves fully to the work of the Lord , because we know that our labor in the Lord will not in vain.

I always check to see who ' s making a series I ' m hearing about and if it ' s doing well. If it is and I ' m reasonably likely to see a trade later , it ' ll go into my memory and I ' ll grab it then. That ' s why I just now started picking up the Fraction run on Iron Fist.

Simple survival requires activity and that activity entails habits , will , memory and common sense. If we passively waited upon mystical prompting before we made any decision or took any action , we would n't last long. Moreover , emphasis on special guidance ignores the truth that our very survival requires God 's continual presence and power. This does not deny the important role special conscious prompting of the Holy Spirit plays in the Christian life , only that it is one small facet of the whole complex manner in which God leads and directs our lives. Moreover , the clear call of Scripture is to holy activity . </wait.v.1403><wait.v.1404>Today we have something nice to look forward to.

Saying nothing , Selari turned and led the way through the dense copse of trees. The latest information they had been able to piece together from their own patrols and the Centaurs , who were still keeping a close eye on the civil war raging just across the river from their lands , was that Arleia 's camp must lie to the northeast of the village. All the reports had pointed to the same conclusion. Each time an attack was thrown back from the village , the raiders chose a different path in retreat , but Ephiny and her scouts had finally discovered their rally point deep in the forest , and the tracks unmistakably led to the northeast.

The criteria for such status , under the framework which took more than two years to formulate , are three-fold : a program must be well-established at Yale , it must have a strong background as an established discipline , and Yale must have a graduate program in the area. These standards were set forth in a letter from the Provost to the faculty announcing the new role for Af-Am studies. If the criteria sound uncannily well-suited for the ascent of Af-Am studies , it is with good reason. Carby explained that she was heavily involved throughout the process of crafting the framework , which relied on Af-Am studies as a " model.

There is such scope in the study of coming events for imagination and reason and human ingenuity , that nothing but deeply humble waiting on God can save us from mistaking the interest and pleasure of intellectual study for the true love of Him and His appearing. All you who say you wait for Christ 's coming , be sure that you wait on God now. All you who seek to wait on God now to reveal His Son in you , see to it that you do so as men waiting for the revelation of His Son from heaven. The hope of that glorious appearing will strengthen you in waiting upon God for what He is to do in you now.

When he got up stairs , I sat him in front of the stove and gave him some food. He opened the door so he could see the flames of the burning wood.

I sit here and think back about all the times when talking with your mommy &amp;daddy that they spoke of you. You are so real and we have n't even met. What an amazing thing love is. When you can dream , hope , pray and love someone so much and you have n't even met them; is a gift that God has given all of us. You are so lucky for the family you will have , they truly are God 's children working in his love for you. Mylee you are so precious and will be such a wonderful addition to the Reynon's. May God keep you close and shower you with love until you can be with your " forver family " ! We ca n't wait to see you precious little one. Blessings &amp;Love always , Auntie Buffy &amp;Cousin Ryan Foley and some love from Uncle Richard in heaven ! : ) xoxoxoxoxoxoxox </wait.v.1495><wait.v.1496>But wait a minute , you say. Shouldn ' t Johnson get some punishment for making a specific threat at these cops ? Yes. If you threaten a cop , there should be consequences.

This sounds like more injustice and harassment to me . </wait.v.1496><wait.v.1497>Rhiannon whimpered softly and her eyes closed as she felt the peer 's strong fingers part her folds and rub the slick flesh gently , thumb teasing her nub; only her white-knuckled grip on Lina 's shoulders and her lover 's other arm around her waist kept her from falling over. She pressed herself against the offered palm but waited ... </wait.v.1497><wait.v.1498>I see quite a few are writing about Dynaformers not being precocious.

A time , which is familiar to us , and yet something which most of us find distasteful , something we seek to avoid. A waiting time -- a time to which we , as the church , need to return over and over again. Like the disciples , we need to wait -- or maybe , we need to learn how to wait. During the in-between times , what can we learn from the disciples ? For the way in which they waited prepared the disciples for what was ahead . </wait.v.1499><wait.v.1500>Psalm 119 : 43-44 , 74 And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth , For I wait for Thine ordinances. 44 So I will keep Thy law continually , Forever and ever. 74 May those who fear Thee see me and be glad , Because I wait for Thy word . </wait.v.1500><wait.v.1501>Ca n't hear us ? ? ?

In early versions of the script , we actually wanted to show just that -- Burke and Cristina having great sex , but not saying a word. Silent sex. It works in theory , but in execution ( on broadcast television ) how the hell do you show two people having sex , and know they ' re enjoying it if it ' s completely silent. You can ' t have silence on television. Unless it ' s for dramatic effect waiting for a verdict on Law and Order. Or for comedic effect. The awkward but brilliant silence of The Office. But silence during sex ? On TV that usually conveys boredom . </wait.v.1504><wait.v.1505>Are you waiting for the Lord ? There is both strength and peace in this approach to life. That is good for now. But in the end , when the kingdom is delivered up to the Father , that is when our reaping will reach wonderful heights far beyond present expectations. Hardly a day will go by when you will not be called upon in some way to wait for the Lord. But in the final scheme of things , It will have been worth the wait . </wait.v.1505><wait.v.1506>It 's funny; I re-read the HP books during chemo.

A Psalm of David. My soul waits in silence for God only; From Him is my salvation. 2 He only is my rock and my salvation , My stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken. 3 How long will you assail a man , That you may murder him , all of you , Like a leaning wall , like a tottering fence ? 4 They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouth , But inwardly they curse. 5 My soul , wait in silence for God only , For my hope is from Him. 6 He only is my rock and my salvation , My stronghold; I shall not be shaken. 7 On God my salvation and my glory rest; The rock of my strength , my refuge is in God. 8 Trust in Him at all times , O people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us.

We are delivering the Roadster to our customers. Already 9 production Roadsters have arrived in California , another 3 arrive this weekend , and they will keep arriving at the rate of 4 per week ( except for the scheduled factory shut down in the last two weeks of August ) . In fact , currently there are 27 Roadsters in various stages of assembly.

My problem was that I started driving when I was about 12. Now before any of you that age get too excited , I must tell you that I grew up in the country where I could drive a great deal without ever getting on the highway. Even so , I could not enjoy the thrill of cruising down Shelton ' s main streets , a town of about 6 , 000 people. I found waiting for this great moment in my life most difficult. When preachers spoke about the rapture and the soon return of our Lord , I was terrified -- not because I was a lost sinner -- but because I , as a believer , would be taken before I could legally drive . </wait.v.1510><wait.v.1511>No matter what way you slice it , the restaurant business is customer-dependent , and they need to remember that the customer is there by choice. And , they can choose to leave. Nothing annoys me more than having to wait when I have a confirmed reservation. You can comp anything you want , it will not make up for the inconvenience of being forced to wait for something that should be set. I pay my bill with the same currency that whatever celebrity who took my reserved table pays with , and it shouldn ' t matter an iota that they are in Page Six and I am not.

" In either case , what the passage asks for is a transformation of consciousness , in effect saying " you keep looking around you for it , but you are within it already -- would you but awaken to it ! " No wonder we have a hard time grasping it. It would be perfectly clear had we but " ears to hear. " Through such teasing , challenging , and off-putting suggestions , Jesus calls us to be new-minded , he calls us to metanoia. It is a power which is " within your grasp , " hence available. You can not passively sit back and wait , you must actively lay hold of this spiritual energy. You must appropriate it. The community of God calls for your participation.

I do cherish my family , and in the darkest of times , they are all that keeps me going. But my search for purpose and reason goes on. Even when my faith was at its strongest , my belief was that all men and women have a higher purpose or calling in their lives. While being a parent is honorable , I do not feel that is my sole reason for being. When my eldest daughter died , it changed who I was. When my military career forced me to be something I was not , it distorted what remained of the idealistic , young Christian man I was. I no longer attend church services and do not affiliate myself with any organized religion. My faith in God is weak , at best , in that I believe in a higher power ... though I honestly feel that I lack the ability to ever truly embrace the concept of God , much less a messiah. I can not call myself a Christian , a believer - nor can I call myself truly atheist. I just do n't know.

After waiting for about 15 minutes I got a rep on phone and she patiently heard my whole story ( not sure if really was listening or not ) , but when I stopped talking , she simply told me that she can not file a complaint against another AT &amp;T store rep. I will need to go back to the same store and speak with the store manager ! ! Very upset at this point , I asked to speak with her supervisor and to my utter shock , she outright REFUSED to let me speak with the supervisor. She said there were no supervisors on duty ! When I asked the rep 's name , she gave her first name as Cynthia and refused to give any other identifying information. I asked her which call center she was from and she told me it was in South East. That 's all she could give me and then she hung up on me . </wait.v.1564><wait.v.1565>Excellent overview about this model Vincent. I expect it to be my next camera. It ' s really great to see infos and photos that were taken by a pro , with credibility and sense. It seems to be that 5D Mk II is going to be a revolutionary camera in this segment and like the ad showed , we waited and we are going to see the evolution. Congratz my friend , also for your excellent photographic work. Here in Brazil , most of us apreciate it a lot ! </wait.v.1565><wait.v.1566>Before you migrate , it 's a good idea to profile your system and see what applications you 've got that are PowerPC or Universal. One easy way to do this is to use Apple 's built-in System Profiler ( /Applications/Utilities/System Profiler.app ) . Switch to the Software - &gt; Applications section and wait a moment ( it will need to index your drive ); then , maximize the window. You 'll see a complete list of apps on your machine , their version , modification date , and " kind " . This last is what you want; just sort by kind to see what PowerPC applications you 've got installed. Then , you can just visit the developer 's Web site ( s ) to see if they have upgrades available . </wait.v.1566><wait.v.1567>Mylee , we pray for your health , that you recover quickly.

I ' ve never been diagnosed or treated for depression , nor have I ever taken medication. The best word that describes me is , introvert . I have friends , but for the most part , I prefer to be alone. I ' ve worked at the same job in law enforcement for the last 22 years. You would think that would provide some excitment for me , wouldn ' t you ? It doesn ' t. I sleepwalk through the work week , waiting for the weekend , only to hibernate until it ' s time to do it all over again . </wait.v.1570><wait.v.1571>Waiting on God is an exercise by which we calm our minds and tune them up to receive signals from Above. An agitated and turbulent mind can not recognize God ' s voice. Psalmist David prayed , " Show me Your ways , O Lord; teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth and teach me On you I wait all the day " ( Psa 25 : 4 , 5 ) . This sounds like a morning prayer. Having made such a prayer at dawn , David had been waiting for the answer all through the day . </wait.v.1571><wait.v.1572>At 7 p.m. Monday , bartenders around the city of Charleston gathered up their ashtrays and pointed to their new , city-issued no-smoking signs. And now they waited to see what will come of this less-hazy new world . </wait.v.1572><wait.v.1573>I ' m not saying this to condemn those who are not waiting for a particular thing at a particular time. I ' m just saying that there are seasons in our lives , my life , when it is just not time yet. And you have to live with the reality that many others all around you are not in that season. Advent is just that sort of waiting to me . </wait.v.1573><wait.v.1574>One of the nice things about surfing ist that if you get cut up by reefs and rocks and your board , you can still surf and not feel the pain and have just as much fun. So I looked at my wounds and laughed at myself , and also watched a few other people get in the water 50 yards up from me , so I saw the good entry point and headed over there. Once I was there , I waited for the right moment and scurried down the rocks and jumped in the water , simple and easy . </wait.v.1574><wait.v.1575>Tim was a little disappointed that he had to go off to work this morning because he really thought the baby was going to come over the weekend ! I am fairly certain he 'll come before his due date , but I 'm still willing to wait patiently if he needs a little bit longer. After all , it 's all about the little guy ! </wait.v.1575><wait.v.1576>1. " A mandarin fell in love with a courtesan. 'I shall be yours , ' she told him , 'when you have spent a hundred nights waiting for me , sitting on a stool , in my garden , beneath my window. ' But on the ninety-ninth night , the mandarin stood up , put his stool under his arm , and went away. " </wait.v.1576><wait.v.1577>This was another warm spring day , so I opened the stall door allowing the ewe to decide what she wanted to do. She gradually moved her little family from place to place carrying on a conversation with them the whole time. When one would lag behind , she would wait until the lamb found her again. If it took too long , she would return to the lamb and then retrace her steps. The lambs are very attentive to her and stick close by. They have their little noses to the ground most of the time , sniffing everything . </wait.v.1577><wait.v.1578>I 'm always for giving the man room and the process time when you have this gut sense of a relationship 's rightness -- no matter what anyone else says. For one thing , feeling good in the relationship itself is what matters most ( after you get married , you 're still in the same relationship ! ) . For another , if you were to break up with him , you 'd have a whole other courtship -- all its phases , all its stops and starts , all that man 's history and hesitations -- to live through all over again. And as one woman I know who 's waited two whole years to get to the committed-dating phase puts it , " I have worked so hard on myself and on him and on the relationship , I 'll be damned if I 'm going to hand over to another woman the fine product of my labor ! " </wait.v.1578><wait.v.1579>I met with the surgeon who did a physical exam , went over my family history ( I had since discovered that my grandmother 's sister had been diagnosed at 25 and died at age 30 from breast cancer. ) She too dismissed the notion of a family link since my great aunt , grandmother and aunt were all on my paternal side. She looked me in the eye said that she does not think that this was breast cancer and that we could either wait 6 months or that she would remove it because it was causing pain. I told her that I wanted it removed right away so I called the next week and had to wait for six weeks since I was n't a priority. The lump was removed and Chris was told that everything looked normal and she was sure that it was a fibrosistic mass . </wait.v.1579><wait.v.1580>Now I am about to be told how to use what I already have and profit from it ? Excited ? I would say yes am extremely excited. Am ready and eagerly awaiting your email for tomorrow.

A good deal of time goes by waiting : waiting for the acrylics to dry on paintings that lie scattered about the studio; waiting for the next move to emerge in my minds eye from the dialogue I hold with them; waiting for the moment when the peak is reached inside me the one that rescues me from my fear of destroying everything Ive done up to now and execute the gesture I had a preview of and practiced in my head while I waited . </wait.v.1582><wait.v.1583>He waited in the living room while Berta went upstairs to dress. It was only when he was sitting on the couch with his schoolbag at his feet that he noticed the blanket folded neatly and placed at the foot of the cushions. It was robin-egg-blue and one of his own; Berta wrapped it round his bed sometimes when the weather was especially cold. Its peculiar appearance triggered recollections of similar oddities hed failed to recognize this morning. Who had dressed him in these pyjamas and put him to bed ? He recalled having to leap over his discarded train-set last night and yet now he did not see it anywhere; the lounge room was tidier than hed seen since Bill left. The kitchen sink had been clean and empty; it was usually so cluttered cockroaches scuttled out when dishes were disturbed. Clearly someone or something had visited them in the night. Humphrey turned into a dog and sniffed for clues . </wait.v.1583><wait.v.1584>Because there did n't seem like anything else to do , CJ started from that morning. The thing about Gina was that her occupation had given her an uncanny knack for just watching , listening and waiting. She did n't interrupt or gasp or do anything that would keep CJ from continuing her narrative. She just waited until CJ admitted , " It was inconclusive. " </wait.v.1584><wait.v.1585>In August , Petrovic joined an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed in Northern California against the federal government. She is waiting to become a U.S. citizen so she can sponsor her elderly parents , who live in Canada and visit often . </wait.v.1585><wait.v.1586>Waiting for babies to be born is not my strong suit. Oh , who are we kidding ? Why qualify it ? Waiting is not my strong suit. I decided to devote some of this interminable wait to knitting up a long overdue gift. I settled on knitting a stole ( recall that around here , we don ' t call them shawls ) for a woman who has helped me enormously with my medical school applications. After much deliberation , Muir seemed the perfect combination of easy and interesting. I feel a bit too absent-minded these days to work on anything complex; thus , I needed a pattern I could not easily mess up ! </wait.v.1586><wait.v.1587>Stop the struggle ! It now is most uncomfortable , and extremely difficult to continue to live life under the rules of the old energies ! It is time to realize that while the past is really familiar , it is no longer usable information ! Knowing that the territory is really uncharted requires a certain amount of courage and trust in the universe , and each of us needs to figure out what works best for us as literally , no one can tell you. The next page is blank , patiently waiting for each of us to decide who we want to be now and what we want to create. And that technique is way different from the past ! </wait.v.1587><wait.v.1588>Ben 's family home is right out of a cozy book. His mom and dad were waiting for us when we got in , along with 3 cats ( I was in heaven ! ) I became particularly fond of " Little Man " day one , and then " Marmalade " on day two. When was the last time anyone prepared you dinner with a bouquet of flowers and a " welcome , we 're glad you 're here " card ? I was stunned. His folks are very sweet; I can see where Ben gets his demeanor . </wait.v.1588><wait.v.1589>" No problem. I got bored with waiting , " Xena said , a smile playing at her lips , and stepped away from the prone bodies of the three men she 'd been fighting . </wait.v.1589><wait.v.1590>If you are tempted to switch lines , there was a study of line switching ( probably funded by the federal government ) which showed that switching lines usually results in a longer wait. In fact , your chances of a longer wait are directly related to how many lines are available. If there are four lines , the odds are four to one for a longer wait seven lanes means a seven to one chance of more delay. You get the idea. Very bad news for people who hate waiting . </wait.v.1590><wait.v.1591>I ' d rather go to a restaurant that will let people linger a little and make amends to people who have to wait for the table than one that will tell you outright they need the table back in two hours before seating you. ( Yes , that really happened to me. ) It feels unwelcoming , and honestly , that stuck in my mind more than the food . </wait.v.1591><wait.v.1592>Still , the benefits of the bond are so far reaching that it behooves us all to ask the question : Am I missing some or all of this powerful healing influence in my life ? If you answer in the affirmative , don ' t mourn your loss. Rejoice in your new insight and do something about it. There are plenty of animals out there just waiting for you to become the most important person in their lives. While not exactly people like us , animals have feelings , too. They get lonely , frightened , and suffer greatly when they lack food , warmth , friendship , and love. Some animal out there may need to be rescued by you. If you do , you may find they will return the favor by rescuing you from depression and loneliness as well . </wait.v.1592><wait.v.1593>Now he 's just tired , tired and ready to go home.

It combines the deep sense of our entire helplessness of ourselves to work what is divinely good , and our perfect confidence that our God will work it all in His divine power . </wait.v.1594><wait.v.1595>As usual , I owe thanks to those members of the InfoDesign-Caf list who have , for several years now , cheerfully supported me in my various research projects no matter how obscure the subject , or how tedious my presentation of the issues.

Jennifer heard him breathing hard , as if he had just jogged a mile , then his footsteps abruptly headed off , in the direction of the front door. It opened and closed softly , then there was silence. Jennifer waited a minute , and when she was sure she was alone in the apartment , she crept out from under the table , quickly moved towards the closet , dumped the equipment there , quickly concealed it with the coats again , then quickly hurried back to the bedroom . </wait.v.1602><wait.v.1603>Why worry about being late to a doctor ' s appointment ?

" Nick whispered in her ear , preparing to be swatted or otherwise punished for sneaking up on her. His grin faded when there was no reaction. He came around , sat on the corner of her desk and looked at her. She was still staring at nothing , her expression one of unutterable sadness. For a moment , with no one to see , he let down his own guard , and his face came alive with tenderness , love and longing. He closed his eyes , waited for his control to return , then reached out and touched her cheek . </wait.v.1605><wait.v.1606>Today we begin Advent , the season of waiting in our church calendar. We made it through the long Season after Pentecost , Ordinary time , and we ' re beginning a new year as we both remember Jesus ' birth at Christmas and anticipate Christ coming again.

At our local Wal-Mart , 20 people were in line awaiting the stroke of midnight EST to pick up their consoles. It does look like the Wii 's bigger availability for launch ( at least one million units for the US ) will keep people from shooting each other for the console as was the last a couple of nights ago for the PS3 . </wait.v.1609><wait.v.1610>I Love You.

( anyway , I finished watching it on the net but still need to watch it ) . These sound like I have appointments with Ella everyday. Came back home and watch her at the night. Go to work and read her news in the day ! ! Oh well , she really really affECt my life much.

My initial response was one of dismay. After all , who likes to think the most real thing about oneself is that he or she is waiting ? Americans especially prefer to think of ourselves as active rather than passive participants in life. Our reigning philosophy appears to be " Carpe Diem : Seize the Day ! " And , in fact , one of the great attractions of being a part of this society lies precisely in this buoyant energy , this bubbling , churning optimistic faith that we can make just about anything happen if we just set our minds to it. That energy is infectious. Indeed , such energy is usually far superior to passing through life thinking of oneself exclusively as a passive victim of circumstances or bad luck . </wait.v.1615><wait.v.1616>" Why now ?

Christians need to wait to get to know the will of God so they can follow it. Jesus said , He who stands firm to the end will be saved. Therefore do not get discouraged if you face unexpected difficulties. God is testing us whether we are willing to wait for Him. Why is He concerned for us ? He bought us with the precious blood of Jesus. You are most precious to God. God knows your every sigh in each and every temptation and trial you face; and He intimately knows who you are. God ' s will be done in you. Let us learn to wait on God ! </wait.v.1621><wait.v.1622>So for the next few days , I 'll just deal with normal things.

I have never been surrounded by so many positive people. There was the guy with the fancy hand-carved cat gym , the guy who ' d flown in from Pennsylvania to talk about his special gizmo for little league dugouts , the four ladies from Connecticut who had a line of maternity clothes and once the line moved indoors , took turns going to the ladies room to put on their fake pregnant bellies to make the clothing look appropriate.

" Yes , we need to be strengthened with all Gods might , and that according to the measure of His glorious power , if we are to wait on God in all patience. It is God revealing Himself in us as our life and strength , that will enable us with perfect patience to leave all in His hands. If any are inclined to despond , because they have not such patience , let them be of good courage; it is in the course of our feeble and very imperfect waiting that God Himself by His hidden power strengthens us and works out in us the patience of the saints , the patience of Christ Himself . </wait.v.1638><wait.v.1639>I don ' t know what you may be going through at the moment , but whatever it is the challenge of Scripture is to wait on the Lord because , unlike temporal man and the fleeting world in which we live , the sovereign Lord of the universe loves us with a steadfast love and personally cares for us like a father.

Other hospitals rejected Sana ' s application for surgery outright due to the complexity of her congenital structural heart defects.

In Hebrew , the word wait can mean to bind together , perhaps by twisting. Or to expect and gather together; look patiently. Hebrew for continually means to stretch , continuance , extension. As I meditated on this idea of being bound together and stretching , the Lord gave me a simple picture : Tying a shoelace. You know how you stretch the loops apart to tighten the knot ? That was the picture the Lord gave me , of being stretched in my faith but being bound closer to the Lord. And it ' s the place I want to be because if I ' m being stretched , I ' m relying on the Lord for sustenance and comfort and peace. It ' s when I ' m comfortable that frightens me , because I know my heart and how easy it is for me to become self-reliant and drift away from the Lord and His will in my life.

We spent a few hours there doing some shopping. Poor Dad spent the day standing outside of each shop waiting for us.

After the ultrasound , I waited again , this time for the doctor ' s exam. Hours later , after all that waiting , I finally headed home . </wait.v.1715><wait.v.1716>At first , the argument to wait makes sense on the grounds of protecting yourself from something you 're not emotionally or physically ready for. Later , it makes sense on the grounds that it will be better if it happens in the context of a committed , adult relationship. But what about now ? You 're in your 20s or 30s; your career is taking off , and your body and emotions are about as developed as they 're ever going to be. And though you 're not married , your relationships with the opposite sex are mature and adult-like in every other respect. So why keep waiting ? You 're not a kid anymore. And even if sex is marginally better inside of marriage than outside , what if your prospects for marriage are n't that good ? Is n't sub-optimal sex now better than no sex at all , ever ? </wait.v.1716><wait.v.1717>Spike leaned over and pressed a quick kiss to her mouth. " Morning , luv.

In other words , in the space waiting creates. What if , it 's not about getting over the waiting , or having answers for the waiting. In other words , it is not about absence , but awareness. Truth is , we do n't know what Mary learned as she pondered. What we do know is that she made space. To receive. To welcome.

It ' s aesthetically pleasing , it increases in challenge and uses the wonderful internal workings of the iPod Touch to add interest.

We lack the imagination to see God ' s newness , and hope would be hope for the wrong thing. We place so much trust in our own knowledge and abilities , and get discouraged , because our love has been love for the wrong thing. Yet we must believe , there is yet faith , even when our own weakness causes us to doubt , because the brokenness of Jesus became the path to the new world. The paradox is this : there ' s a crack in everything / that ' s how the light gets in ( Cohen ) .

She had no choice than to wait interminably , with a throng of other hopeful petitioners , outside the hall where the ambassadors from Ch'in were being received.

A few minutes later , the Empress , in her formal purple gown and tiara , came out followed by her attendants. The crowd of petitioners stirred , and the bard cursed her short stature. Somehow she managed to elbow her way to the front; miraculously , Xena looked straight at her -- and right past her.

He stayed very still and listened to the breeze waiting for it to carry any sounds of Santiago 's men to his ears. He felt like he had been holding his breath the entire time but finally there it was. A creaking sound , very faint , almost imperceptible , but a creak just the same. He gripped his dagger tighter and focused his attention on the plank. There was one shadow and then another.

Amid the chaos and the mania , there is much to be said for the spontaneity and liveliness of a decent waiting job. After all , at its very best , waiting tables can be like hosting a festive dinner party in which you not only meet new friends but also earn your rent in the process. Though waiting tables is rarely any sort of long-term career goal , it is at least a fascinating alternative to the " normality " of a nine-to-five job. So until we get signed onto a worthy music label or find a publisher for our first novel , until it is time to travel once again or finally get hired for that dream job ... well , I guess we 'll just keep on waiting . </wait.v.1747><wait.v.1748>When the PCP finally decided it might not be migraine , one of the suggestions was that she go to a biofeedback doc.

Just on the hither side of the crest of the first wave we halted for the night. My first act was to examine Leo 's condition. It was , if anything , worse than in the morning , and a new and very distressing feature , vomiting , set in , and continued till dawn. Not one wink of sleep did I get that night , for I passed it in assisting Ustane , who was one of the most gentle and indefatigable nurses I ever saw , to wait upon Leo and Job. However , the air here was warm and genial without being too hot , and there were no mosquitoes to speak of. Also we were above the level of the marsh mist , which lay stretched beneath us like the dim smoke-pall over a city , lit up here and there by the wandering globes of fen fire.

A look of realization swept across my face as I figured out that he had probably gone to the restaurant to surprise me. I had left early , so we probably missed each other in transit. I picked up the phone and listened patiently as the ring went to voice mail. Oh god , I hope hes not picking up flowers or something to surprise me.

Miss Jazz is quite sensitive to any messes and the two litterbox system is officially declared a failure , as far as I am concerned. It has to work like this : one box needs to be standing in the wings , clean as a whistle , waiting to be whisked in when the other one needs to be scrubbed out. Putting down two at a time makes the job doubly-messy and freaks out Miss Jazz when both need to go out the door for cleaning. Leaving one dirty one behind for her emergencies while the other is cleaned simply will not do , which means I come back inside to still another mess on the floor . </wait.v.1768><wait.v.1769>Now why am I bringing this up ? The reason is because of another conversation that I overheard yesterday. Yesterday , while waiting for the bus to go back home ( yes , it happened in the bus stop again , there are plenty of interesting conversations that happen in bus stops ) , two students were talking about music. By the looks of them , they both look like graduate students , and international students as well. You know , they are n't the iPod-plugged , I-don't-really-care student type. Rather , these are more of those intellectual bunches . </wait.v.1769><wait.v.1770>I joined one myself last December after months of illness that antibiotics could n't get the better of , and after waiting a further 4 months gave up and paid for the surgery myself at a private hospital. I 'm lucky that I was able to do that. What about all the people who could n't afford to ? </wait.v.1770><wait.v.1771>( 8 ) Waiting is not necessarily a time of passivity. Have you ever watched what people do while they are waiting ? Some do absolutely nothing. But I notice that some people ( not just men ) may crochet or do needle work while they wait. There are constructive things to do while one waits. David waited over 20 years to reign over all Israel , but that was a very busy time in his life. David did much more than merely flee for his life. David delivered the people of Keilah ( 1 Samuel 23 : 1-5 ) , and he did good to the people of Judah ( 1 Samuel 30 : 26-31 ) . One of the things we can do while we wait is to praise God and to pray , as David and others did in the psalms. While we may not be able to do what we would most like to do , we can do what God has given us to do , while we wait on the Lord to fulfill His promises and purposes . </wait.v.1771><wait.v.1772>Many of us have had to make this painful choice based on a positive BRCA test result with or without a breast cancer diagnosis. I had my double mastectomy done prophylactically back in 2002 after finding I carried a BRCA2 mutation. I already had two lumps on watch on my mammogram and did not feel the overwhelming odds of breast cancer from this mutation gave me the option to wait . </wait.v.1772><wait.v.1773>I arranged to have today off so I could be with Paul and Virginia. Unfortunately I have been chasing a bug ( or two ) all week so decided it would be best to stay away. The doctors are most concerned the first 4 days that Paul not get pneumonia. They recommend that any potential visitor who is the least bit under the weather stay away. I will wait until at least Monday before I try to see him . </wait.v.1773><wait.v.1774>The ability to wait on the Lord stems from being confident and focused on who God is and in what God is doing. It means confidence in God ' s person : confidence in His wisdom , love , timing , understanding of our situation and that of the world. It means knowing and trusting in God ' s principles , promises , purposes , and power . </wait.v.1774><wait.v.1775>The Old Testament emphasis is clearly on the daily walk and the need to wait on the Lord and His providential care in the pressures of life. As we will see , in the New Testament , the focus is on the promise of Christ ' s return. The emphasis , however , in most contexts where the words for waiting occur , is on the impact waiting on the Lord ' s return should have on our daily walk . </wait.v.1775><wait.v.1776>Perhaps also because Mary Oliver is just so movine. And Wild Geese in particular. We do n't have to DO anything; just BE who we are ... Powerful ! What a great focus for those waiting places ... so often filled up with negative self-talk instead . </wait.v.1776><wait.v.1777>Waiting until the cookies are cool before you eat them. Waiting for school to end and vacation to start. Waiting for that Saturday afternoon when you can finally get the tree. Waiting until it is light on Christmas morning before getting out of bed . </wait.v.1777><wait.v.1778>I wonder what it was like in that Upper Room.

" When I was a kid , we lived down tah Bath and I guess I was about six years old and we lived near the railroad tracks. My brother and I used to climb up on the tops of tha railroad cars and wait till they 'd git started and after they was goin about twenty miles an hour , we 'd jump off and head for home. My mother always warned us to stay away from them trains but we didn't. " Everybody looked at him and waited for the next confession . </wait.v.1779><wait.v.1780>&gt; &gt; So , is it normal not to be notified ? Do committees wait until their first choice actually signs a contract to make the " sorry , you did n't get it ... " call/email/letter ? Or do they usually not even bother ? </wait.v.1780><wait.v.1781>Damn ! Not the meeting I was hoping for them , but not surprised. Give Xander thirty seconds and WHAM , Spikes gone. So glad you gave her the bracelet , just to confirm in his mind , that she was the one. His Elizabeth. Looking forward to seeing Xanders face once Buffy sets him straight about Spike. Thanks for posting again so soon , and not making us go through the next three plus years , waiting for her memories to catch up. So excited to see their reunion !

He still waits for me to go for a walk ... ... .just what the doctor ordered and he is still just so amazing ! ! </wait.v.1783><wait.v.1784>What we wait for , however , is far less important than what God is doing while we wait. In such times He works in us to develop those hard-to-achieve spiritual virtues of meekness , kindness , and patience with others. But more important , we learn to lean on God alone and to rejoice and be glad in Him ( v.4 ) . </wait.v.1784><wait.v.1785>I can not wait to take it for a spin.

Luckily , Showalter has a sequel in the works called , Unraveled , and all I can say is that I absolutly ca n't wait to get my hands on it , it scheduled for release in September of 2010.

So now all of my friends and I am starting to freak out and think of all the possible terrible things that could happen ... . but at 10 : 15 mom called again and said she got tickets then complained about the price.

I can not count the times I have discovered support and blessings simply by doing Christ 's ministry of Love for my neighbor and kindness to all God 's children. The bisexual support group that led me out of a growing pit of despair as I was finding no support to speak of from the gay or heterosexual communities was discovered by me as I was doing volunteer work for an AIDS Services Agency. The first client I had as a volunteer emotional support counselor was a bisexual man with AIDS who had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion and who understood what it was to be attracted to women and men. When I was in places waiting for patients I had driven to doctors appointments , I discovered positive resources in the books and magazines I read while I would wait for them. This I know -- God never ever leaves us , even when we doubt. Especially when we doubt . </wait.v.1792><wait.v.1793>While investigators combed through yesterday 's shooting scene , Rolando Mancco waited for permission to cut across the area to reach his apartment complex.

She saw a woman with the name Jewel printed on her nametag , grey-flecked hair , soulful eyes , a round body. A woman with no hard edges. Pam covered her face with her hands and burst into tears. Jewel sat down , waited patiently and then asked , " Do you want to tell me about it ? " </wait.v.1797><wait.v.1798>In our previous studies of this series we saw some things concerning the mystery of WAITING. We saw it as being much more than sitting in our easy chairs and biding our time until the Lord acts in some manner or another. In a measure , we saw what it really is " to be in waiting "; namely , that it speaks of being united with God as a result of the hard bread of adverse TWISTING and the bitter water of AFFLICTION ( PIERCING ) . It was in this union where we find the ability to be taught the difference between the holy and the profane and to discern between the unclean and the clean ( Ezk 44 : 23 ) . Once the twistings and piercings of God 's ordained waiting have worked their intended purpose , we can rest assured that we no longer fit into the category of worshiping the unholy , profane images of silver and gold. As painful as this holy waiting upon God is , the price paid is not comparable to the rewards that follow . </wait.v.1798><wait.v.1799>I remind you there is a real danger of falling away in our walk with God if we do n't make an effort to get to know His ways. When we simply let time pass while waiting on God without applying constant and real faith that He will answer our prayers we will experience disappointment. With disappointment comes apathy -with apathy comes drifting away ... </wait.v.1799><wait.v.1800>I 'm not complaining. I thank my husband often for giving me the gift of being a stay at home mom.

Waiting for the dough to rise , waiting for the oven to preheat , waiting for the actual baking and then waiting for the item to cool. Waiting is one of the most difficult things that we do as humans. We are an impatient people and want what we want when we want it. In baking though , to get the desired end results there is no option but to wait. Most importantly , we must wait the FULL length of time . </wait.v.1806><wait.v.1807>Fun and frolics were had by all but then , sadly , it was all over.

The word advent , in and of itself , simply means a time of waiting , or a time of anticipation. It means awaiting or anticipating any kind of significant or momentous event that you hope will in some way transform your life. Vladimir and Estragon are actually observing their own version of advent as they sit by the road waiting for Godot. Theirs just happens to be an advent that never comes to any kind of fruition. The Christian Advent is the time of awaiting the arrival of a Savior who will transform the world and the lives that make up the world . </wait.v.1808><wait.v.1809>I mentioned this in the chatroom after the show on Thursday , but Ian is going to be out of town on both Sunday ( our usual recording time ) and Monday this week.

I recall a blog with you having to finally admit that Zenyatta had left the state of California and had run on dirt in the Apple Blossom and won ... so this " poly horse " statement you keep repeating is getting old. I also recall your statement saying basically that you were impressed with her after finally viewing it. Zenyatta has and can run and win on dirt and beat champions in the process ( Ginger Punch ) . So do us all a favor and start acting like a true gentleman and just agree how great it is that Zenyatta will race this year and will hopefully get to face RA who is a great horse. I do n't think that the Mosses have any intentions of not facing RA and if the two of them are entered together and one has to scratch let 's remember that it 's up to the trainers and if they feel that their " girl " is n't up to it on that particular day then give them the benefit of the doubt and wait patiently for the next possible match up.

Having the maker 's name on the knife and taking the knife in to refinish it does not negate the fact that the knife is someone else 's property. Extreme care and diligence must be taken while someone else 's knife is in possession , and that includes protecting it from theft , damage , or unforeseen events , including responsibility for shipping , handling , and storage. Like many busy knife makers , I 'm years in backorders , so the refinishing job should take a place in line , just as custom orders do. That means that if I have a three year waiting list , I will not push back the client who 's waiting on his order to be filled so I can refinish a knife. Meanwhile , the knife waiting to be refinished sits and waits for years and I 'm responsible for its safety , preservation , storage , and care during those years. Like most makers , I have too much to care for in my own business without taking on added responsibility of someone else 's knives . </wait.v.1823><wait.v.1824>In today ' s economy , anything that points to a new niche , would be priceless.

He said that he was not in a position to donate as there were proper channels for that. I told him anything that he could do to help would greatly be appreciated. Mike said that he would check to see what he could do and call me back.

First He told us to have more kids. Brad wasn ' t so excited , but wanted to walk in obedience , and I had felt we were to have more so for me it was mostly exciting that Brad + God + I were all in agreement. That was one year ago this month and I haven ' t gotten pregnant. We have two kids , and both were conceived very quickly , so I have no doubt that this is God. What is He saying ? Did we not hear Him ? A year later it is easy to question , it is actually natural. But , then I stop and realize God will give in His time , for His purpose and to His glory- not ours. I am waiting , and most of the time with a very patient attitude ( unless my hormones get the best of me ) . </wait.v.1833><wait.v.1834>It had happened at last. The expected message had come.

Finally , the captain 's finger was inserted as deeply as it could go , as were the balls , and both channels abruptly spasmed as the Borg was unable to resist this tender assault on her senses. Janeway waited a few seconds for the young woman 's climax to subside , then slowly began to move her finger in and out of the Borg 's rear channel. This area of Seven 's anatomy was more flexible than her lower passage , more responsive , and before long , Janeway was able to work a second finger into the sultry passage , pushing both in as far as she could. This was another new experience ... never had she attempted more than one digit at a time ... and Seven moaned , clutching her pillow . </wait.v.1835><wait.v.1836>The comment about the bridge expresses our normal dislike for waiting , especially in our I want it now ! society. Ours is a society that has grown accustomed to immediate gratification.

Just think of the speed of the latest computer technology in comparison with the computers of only a few years ago . </wait.v.1836><wait.v.1837>The question is : Is it pleasant to wait ? Absolutely not. The flesh does not enjoy pain. There is a lot of pain in waiting; you get tired , you get weary , discouraged and at the extreme hopeless . </wait.v.1837><wait.v.1838>Berta spoke at length with Julian indoors before joining her son in the car , a cigarette sparking in one hand , the cello case in the other. She did not immediately reach for the ignition however; instead , she leaned back in the drivers seat , allowing the vinyl to wrap around her slender frame. She took a long drag and expelled her breath out the wound-down window. Smokey words like know-it-all and disrespectful hovered in the air outside before being quartered by the wind. Casting her eyes up through the windshield to a featureless sky , she waited . </wait.v.1838><wait.v.1839>Pa stood at the head of the table , his forehead drawn into severe lines above his grey eyes.

Fall in boys for Fritzy wants to play. Chorus : Left , right , left , right , on to march we go , To the front line trenches to tease Old Fritz you know , Shoot your guns , drop your bombs , until you get your fill , What the deuce do we care for Kaiser Bill. Verse 2 : Now Percy left his home one day to join the flying corps; He said I ' ll make those horrid boys and girls feel very sore; The first time that they took him up , it made him feel so queer , When in the clouds they looped the loop , he yelled out Whoops , my dear. Verse 3 : The Kaiser ' s beard was turning blue , so he went to get a shave; He waited there about an hour then heard and old man rave ! The razor slipped and cut his throat , which made the barbed , vexed. He threw the dead man off the chair and said to Bill You ' re next. </wait.v.1840><wait.v.1841>Do you understand what that means ? A terrible danger in Christian work , just as in a Christian life that is begun with much prayer , begun in the Holy Spirit , is that it may be gradually shunted off on to the lines of the flesh; and the word comes : " Having begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ? " In the time of our first perplexity and helplessness we prayed much to God , and God answered and God blessed , and our organization became perfected , and our band of workers became large; but gradually the organization and the work and the rush have so taken possession of us that the power of the Spirit , in which we began when we were a small company , has almost been lost. Oh , I pray you , note it well ! It was with new prayer and fasting , with more prayer and fasting , that this company of disciples carried out the command of the Holy Ghost , " My soul , wait thou only upon God. " That is our highest and most important work. The Holy Spirit comes in answer to believing prayer . </wait.v.1841><wait.v.1842>Only those of you who followed Tucker 's story could possibly understand how significant this is to our family.

Since 1949 the island has in fact been independent. On the basis of population Formosa ranks thirtieth among the members of the United Nations. We must cease imagining ourselves to he a big power and face reality , establishing a small but democratic and prosperous society. Some say that Chiang has become an emperor , and we must only wait until he dies. But we must not overlook the possibility of a desperate young Chiang handing Formosa over to Communist China , nor should we even for a moment forget that Formosa may become again the victim of international power politics. We can not wait passively for " progressive reform "; the history of the Nationalist party and government clearly shows that any form of compromise </wait.v.1845><wait.v.1846>With his hand firmly curled around hers , he led her down another narrow passage and out a side door. They found themselves in the walled-in courtyard where the leaves of orange trees drooped in the oppressive air and water dripped steadily from the sloping eaves of the hacienda 's roof. The snort of one of the waiting horses helped to guide them across the small garden , through a gate , and into the stable yard.

It had , of course , Asian squat toilets , but was otherwise reasonably clean. I was armed with my tissues , so it was no problem. But I smiled at the fixtures there. The squat toilet was of the brand called American Standard  - you ' ve probably seen that brand in public toilets in the US. I didn ' t realize they supplied Asian countries too. But what a hoot !

Median waiting times for all specialized services have remained relatively stable between 2003 and 2005 at 3 to 4 weeks , depending on the type of care. There were some differences noted in selected provinces. Most individuals continue to report that they received care within 3 months . </wait.v.1862><wait.v.1863>The members of the party , powdered with dust and in no very pleasant frame of mind from the delay , took refuge at the village inn , an old-time hostelry close to the roadside , with wide , brick-paved , white-pillared piazza across the front , and a mysterious hedged [ 166 ] garden at the side. There were many plain wooden rockers neatly adorned with white crash on the piazza , and one or two late summer boarders loitering about with knitting work or book. The landlord brought cool tinkling glasses of water and rich milk from the spring-house , and they dropped into the chairs to wait while the men of the party gave assistance to the chauffeur in patching up the car . </wait.v.1863><wait.v.1864>Well , I got on the phone immediately this morning and gave them a polite earful about waiting to the last day to inform me about my delayed shipping date.

I waited about another 15 minutes and finally heard someone else come on the phone and say hello ? I answered back hello. And then he said can you hear me ? And I said yes , can you hear me ?

When I 've lived in Big Cities , lines were more the thing when waiting for service , but here it tends to be more amorphous. For example , when trying to buy something at a convenience store there are often a few people standing at different distances from the counter , but not in line. When a space opens up everyone looks at everyone else and either the person who 's been waiting the longest moves up or you start the game of " You go ahead " " No you go.

She took me to breakfast at our favorite bagelry and bought me coffee at my favorite coffee shop , talking and bantering to ease my nerves. She joked with me about the amount of paperwork at the clinic , and sat with me in the waiting room while I fidgeted. I made arrangements at the clinic to come back on Thursday to get the first set of pills. On Thursday , they gave me the first pills , which I took there at the clinic , and they gave me the second set of pills to be taken Saturday morning. The doctor was patient and thorough in explaining the process , and gave me literature explaining what I was likely to experience over the weekend. I made arrangements with my mom to go home for the weekend , so she could keep an eye on me and make sure I wasnt having excessive bleeding or reactions to the medication . </wait.v.1872><wait.v.1873>At least a thousand people waited in line for rebooking at the main Alitalia counter.

A man 's cool self-appraisal when it comes to his ability to love or be faithful is not just charming , self-effacing bait to which to rise. Says my friend Janine , who spent four years with a man who boasted , " I only cause pain to the women I love " : " I was vain enough to think he did n't mean he 'd hurt me.

This kind of waiting can be called watchful waiting. We don ' t know what God has in store for us. Its full wonder and mystery is always beyond us. We don ' t know God ' s timing either. We don ' t know when or where or how God ' s miracles in our lives will occur.

But if we remember who we are waiting for the righteous and just king that all today ' s readings point to then we will recognize our task is not simply pie-in-the-sky other-worldliness , but the task of working for those things that the King values righteousness and justice in the kingdom of God that is near.

In the land of Canaan , in the days of Joshua , the only three failures of which we read were owing to this one sin. In going up against Ai , in making a covenant with the Gibeonites , in settling down without going up to possess the whole land , they waited not for His counsel. And so even the advanced believer is in danger from this most subtle of temptations taking Gods word and thinking his own thoughts of them , and not waiting for His counsel. Let us take the warning and see what Israel teaches us.

As the soul learns its secret , every act or exercise of waiting becomes just a quiet entering into the goodness of God , to let it do its blessed work and satisfy our every need. And , every experience of God 's goodness gives new attractiveness to the work of waiting. Instead of only taking refuge in time of need , there comes a great longing to wait continually and all day. And , however duties and engagements occupy the time and the mind , the soul gets more familiar with the secret art of always waiting.

I do not believe a Christian can have his heart scripturally right , unless he is looking for God 's Son from heaven; for there could be no such thing as attempting to set the world right if its sin in rejecting Christ were fully seen. Moreover , there never will be a correct judgment formed of the character of the world until that crowning sin be apprehended by the soul. To a Christian who is looking and waiting for Christ to come from heaven , Christ Himself is unspeakably more the object before the soul. It is not that I shall get to heaven and be happy , but that the Lord Himself is coming from heaven for me , and for all the Church. It is this which gives its character to the joy of the saint; so Christ Himself says , " I will come again , and receive you unto Myself; that where I am , there ye may be also. " Where I find my delight , there shall you find yours also , I with you , and you with me-for ever with the Lord . </wait.v.1893><wait.v.1894>So I was apprehensive about leaving , but my Dad picked me at up at 11 : 30 for my 11 : 45 am appointment.

Were the disciples not constantly asking when the kingdom would come and trying to hurry up the plan ?

He had thought , that once they were able to wipe their paws free of Dehvor and the mess her son was causing , that they would be able to return to her homeland and make it a more permanent residence. He had gone ahead and spoken to her brother without her , seeking a home for what Laike hoped would last him throughout the rest of his years and long into retirement. He had n't looked for her recently , but she always had the uncanny ability to find him somehow , somewhere. His madame was being quite stubborn about coming home and she was being unpleasantly mute about the entire situation. With a frown he continued on his way , lounging about the various sunny sections of Auvrea while he waited for her to come around. And she would , eventually. Come around , that is. They 'd been waiting for the time when they could freely enjoy their own company and she would eventually come to terms with whatever qualms fretted her mind . </wait.v.1906><wait.v.1907>The one lesson our text teaches us is this , that when we set ourselves to wait on God we ought beforehand to resolve that it shall be with the most confident expectation of Gods meeting and blessing us. We ought to make up our minds to this , that nothing was ever so sure , as that waiting on God will bring us untold and unexpected blessing. We are so accustomed to judge of God and His work in us by what we feel , that the great probability is that when we begin more to cultivate the waiting on Him , we shall be discouraged , because we do not find any special blessing from it. The message comes to us , " Above everything , when you wait on God , do so in the spirit of abounding hopefulness. It is God in His glory , in His power , in His love longing to bless you that you are waiting on. " </wait.v.1907><wait.v.1908>Kaley Maddox was twenty-seven when she first met Lee Jordan. She was working at a gas station on an isolated stretch of US 29 between Lynchburg and Charlottesville. One sweltering summer night , she was perched on her high stool behind the counter waiting for her six-to-midnight shift to end. All at once , a truck screeched to a halt in the parking lot. A tall man strode through the door and hurried to the beer cooler. He threw some money on the counter , drumming his fingers until she gave him the change. Then he jumped into the idling truck and roared away. She had time to notice how handsome he was. His hair , cut short on the sides but hanging in a long curly mass on his neck , was really blond , not dyed the ugly yellow many of the local boys affected. He had a blonde mustache , wide-set blue eyes , and a hawkish nose that had probably been broken at least twice . </wait.v.1908><wait.v.1909>But many people refuse the homes they are offered , or stay in them only a short time , while others languish at the bottom of the list.

When you first install Google Desktop , it makes use of any idle time to meander your filesystem , email application , instant messages , and browser cache. Imbued with a sense of politeness , the indexer should n't interfere at all with your use of your computer; it only springs into action when you step away , take a phonecall , or dose off for 30 seconds or more.

I believe he did this with Adam and Eve in the garden. I believe this is at the core of Satan 's temptation of our Lord at the beginning of His earthly ministry. Satan was saying to our Lord , Oh , sure. I know that you are God 's King. But rather than deny yourself ( by obeying God and being 40 days and nights without food ) , why not serve yourself ? Why wait to eat ? Why get to your kingdom through suffering ? Why not worship me , and I will give you a kingdom now ? Is n't that the way Satan thinks and acts ? </wait.v.1914><wait.v.1915>You are truly blessed to be a Beringer ! God has given you an incredible forever family.

The best way to do that , I ' ve often argued , is to write more novels in English , or to get our best novels in Filipino and our other languages translated into English. And then we need to get noticed by publishers and agents through such means as by joining and winning international competitions , participating in literary festivals and conferences , contributing to major literary journals and magazines , securing writing fellowships , and getting into university-based writing programs abroad. These , of course , are the traditional means of doing things , and I ' m sure there are other , though largely untested , alternatives. If you self-publish , for example , the burden on you to promote your work will be even greater , since you ' ll be working without a network or a system in place. Publishing first on the Internet and gaining a wide following might conceivably also be a new way to gain attention . </wait.v.1916><wait.v.1917>YAAAAAAAY ! ! ! ! *happydancehappydancehappydance ! ! ! * My night is made !

The doc was right , there was more color in his cheeks and his skin felt warmer to the touch. And yes , there were signs of movement; Jess had dislodged his good arm from under the covers and had it flung out to his right , as he was oft to do when lying flat on his back. His eyes were also flickering , pupils darting back and forth beneath the lids , indicating he was now in a more natural state of sleep instead of the deep unconsciousness he had previously resided in. Still , it could be a while before those brilliant blue eyes opened. Slim settled down in the chair to wait and was soon overcome with drowsiness. Instead of fighting it he allowed himself to be pulled down into the welcome embrace of a deep , refreshing and much needed sleep . </wait.v.1929><wait.v.1930>" He claims to be that ... what he is creating is great television and I said 'Well what you 've created is doubt in my character.

As you described , many hours at the hospital over a 11 month period made for plenty of times to meet people and exchange moments of both gladness and sadness.

Throughout this section the emphasis of the writer has been on the uniqueness of Christ 's death. Again and again he has called it " once-for-all " ( hapax or ephapax ) . That thought comes to the fore again in verses 27-28. Just as any fallen human being is destined to die once for all time , with judgment awaiting beyond death , so Christ also died once for all time to deal with sin. For the many who trust in him , it is not judgment that awaits beyond their personal death. This judgment has been forever removed by the sacrifice of Christ. Instead , they may confidently expect that he will appear a second time , not to bear sin , but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him . </wait.v.1937><wait.v.1938>STILL waiting for the iphone app. This is my FAVORITE messaging program by far.

I then drove to the hospital and waited for about 15 minutes in emergency before being seen and taken in by the staff. I was told that I would most likely be operated on , but needed to have a Cat Scan before they would know exactly what my condition was. They immediately connected an IV to me and after three hours and drinking some clear fluid that was supposed to help with the scan , I was finally told that I had Acute Appendicitis. They weren ' t 100 sure if they were going to need to cut me open or perform a Laparoscopic Appendectomy ( also known as an Appendicectomy ) . During a Laparoscopic operation they make three small incisions and use a camera to guide them. I am happy to report that they did end up performing a Laparoscopic Appendectomy. The doc scared me a bit because he said that if my appendix was ruptured that they would need to cut me open . </wait.v.1940><wait.v.1941>Have an awesome trip , Leela !

In waiting upon God , our eye , looking up to Him , meets His looking down upon us. This is the blessedness of waiting upon God , that it takes our eyes and thoughts away from ourselves , even our needs and desires , and occupies us with our God. We worship Him in His glory and love , with His all-seeing eye watching over us , that He may supply our every need. Let us consider this wonderful meeting between God and His people , and mark well what we are taught here of them on whom Gods eye rests , and of Him on whom our eye rests . </wait.v.1942><wait.v.1943>In the midst of our impatient waiting , we must realize that any holdup likely is n't with Him. It 's most likely caused by us. We may incorrectly conclude that the Holy Spirit ( or Holy Ghost as some older English Bible translations say ) is tardy about moving. The issue may actually be about our learning to wait , one of the things that classic devotional writers have sometimes listed as an important " spiritual discipline. " </wait.v.1943><wait.v.1944>Waiters are a gregarious and eclectic bunch. Although a consistent majority of wait staffs are composed of artists from every field and philosophy , there is still a sizable showing from the ranks of international travelers , persevering moms , and lately , hordes of dot-com refugees humble enough to take up the apron , even after thinking they 'd finally cast it off. " Waiting " is in fact the perfect term , for while backgrounds vary , the theme of transition is consistent from top to bottom , and the characters quickly become familiar : the actor waiting for his first major role , the many students waiting to graduate , the mother waiting for the means to buy her daughter braces. Yes , a server job can be a great way to weather one 's transitional periods. By focusing on the vibrant social atmosphere , sizable cash pay , flexible schedule , and attractive coworkers , it is easy enough to temporarily block out the servile role you 've agreed to perform . </wait.v.1944><wait.v.1945>Dripping , dropping , and swirling smidgens of icing like an action painter on the surface of these cooled cookies was an amusement , and a temptation. Gazing at each intricate design , I could hardly wait to bite into these chewy marvels. They were chewy , bursting with ginger and molasses , and the small doses of white icing ( just powdered sugar , water , and a bit of shortening for body ) was the ideal sweet foil for the spiciness of the cookie. And , they were a bit bourgie to boot . </wait.v.1945><wait.v.1946>I ca n't wait ! I am soooo looking forward to April 27. Two of the three books I 've been waiting ( not so ) patiently for are coming out on that day. Bewitched and Betrayed being one of them , of course ! I got my neighbor hooked on your books , too , so we 're both very much looking forward to April . </wait.v.1946><wait.v.1947>After I spoke to you on the phone that night , I read the testimonies on the i am worth the wait website and they were really empowering. There must of been over 200 stories from random people all over the country who posted their own experiences on how they are committed to being celibate or waiting till marriage for sex and even more so I feel grateful that I still have my virginity and that you have introduced me to this. Before I didnt realize the extent of saving myself for god and I thank him for this prize. I should cherish it till marriage. I spoke to my guy friend afterwards and I told him about the missionary and he was very moved by it and we both had a thorough conversation about it. He even wants to know when they come through new york so he and his friends can participate in the modelling show. Im telling you..he 's looking forward to this ! lol. Anyways , just wanted to let you know. I love you Tash ! ~K " </wait.v.1947><wait.v.1948>I saw a sign for something called the Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas. I followed some stairs up and happened upon an intriguing scene. The Hall turned out to look like a hall in a conference center , with lots of folding chairs and a stage. There seemed to be programs going on at certain times , but I couldn ' t read any of the signs. And what I saw was lunchtime ! There were little flocks of people sitting around with picnic lunches they had brought steamed buns , fruit , slices of meat , jugs of soup , and of course many thermoses of black tea. The whole hall smelled of the same Chinese tea they serve in most American Chinese restaurants. Were they waiting for something to start ? What ? I have no idea what was going on , but it was certainly interesting to see them . </wait.v.1948><wait.v.1949>But Will did see the people and that did not make sense to him either. He had noticed both that Bootstrap had n't looked him in the face when he answered and that he sounded guilty. Now that he thought about it , he supposed he should have noticed and long ago asked why some of the crew members , even his father , would frequently leave the ship and go ashore for as long as they could before it was time to head out to sea once more. It was n't until Will mentioned the seemingly odd custom to one of the crew that he learned his own mother would often be there waiting for Bootstrap. At first , he was hurt by the idea that she had not wanted to see him too. She had raised him virtually alone. He was her only child. How could she wait so patiently for the man who had abandoned her and her son to go pirating , but not for that child too ? Had he been more burden than beloved child to her ? </wait.v.1949><wait.v.1950>Feb 28 , 2010 . Basically so far I have been rejected from VMRCVM , CSU , UF ( my in state ) , . .

The men and women in the line were waiting patiently. Many of them were well-dressed a little bit churchy , a little bit board meeting. They were all black. ( In Chicago , you do n't notice. In Boston , you do. ) I had come to the theater to see a press screening of the new Farrelly brothers movie , The Heartbreak Kid , but I knew that 's not what this crowd was waiting to see. They were waiting for a sneak preview of Tyler Perry 's Why Did I Get Married ? , the director 's new romantic dramedy featuring , among a lot of other people , Janet Jackson.

Amid all we praise God for , there is , alas , much to mourn over ! Were it not for God 's promises , we might well despair. But , in His promises the living God has given and bound Himself to us. He calls us to wait on Him. He assures us we will not be put to shame. Oh , that our hearts might learn to wait before Him , until He Himself reveals to us what His promises mean. In the promises , He reveals Himself in His hidden glory ! We will be irresistibly drawn to wait on Him alone.

Maybe , just then , I subsconsciously harkened memories of November 2008. I had prepared for the possibility that the interviewer might ask me why I 'd waited so long to apply for citizenship. I was going to tell him that I had n't felt compelled until the recent presidential election , when the frustration of sitting on the sidelines during a momentus occasion made me feel ashamed for not having done what was necessary to be a participant.

Golden rule : Always wait a couple of days , then read the dev team blog to know whether or not updates are safe. Moreover , the dev team developers do not want to publish new exploits for iPhone 3.0 before Apple officially releases it. That 's because it would be too easy for Apple to plug the holes during a beta cycle , ahead of the public release . </wait.v.1963><wait.v.1964>CS5 wo n't be here for another year.

They can try to use a busted CS3 for the next year or so , or upgrade now to an already aging version and maybe forgo the next iteration altogether ... but that would mean spending dollars on a 1.5 year piece of software that wo n't be updated for another 3+ years ... </wait.v.1964><wait.v.1965>[ The word " LORD " at the end of verse 18 was translated from the Hebrew word " Jehovah " .

There is a lot of talk about safe sex today and very little about abstinence. This is because waiting for the pleasures of marital sex is taboo. Virginity is disdained as a curse , not a gift which one mate gives to the other. Waiting on God for the joys and pleasures of marital sex enhances the joy and pleasure of this gift , if and when God gives it. The point I wish to make here is that sexual purity is about waiting , and waiting is a good part of what the Christian life is about. Let us not look upon this matter as something God is cruelly withholding from us , but as a good gift , for which we are willing to wait upon the Lord so that we may enjoy it fully and without guilt . </wait.v.1988><wait.v.1989>" That 's a long time , " Sam said.

Schechner refers to this as make belief , where the performances of everyday life create the very social realities that they enact. ( Schechner , 42 ) . In other words , what we do over and over again in certain ways , places , and times actually continually creates the existence of social structures rather than the existence being something that can survive without collective acquiescence.

As in our other passages , Paul waits for Christ ' s imminent return , but he also waits for the opportunity to return to his friends in Thessalonica. Earlier in this third chapter of I Thessalonians , we learn that Timothy has recently returned from visiting the Thessalonians with a good report of their perseverance in the faith. But Paul longs to be with his friends himself in order to encourage them further. He understands the insidious daily pressures against faithfulness , and he wants to encourage them first-hand as they wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. This is the why of his and their waiting. Since he doesn ' t know when he will be with them in person , he takes this epistolary opportunity to encourage them to righteousness while they wait. Paul prays that they will increase and abound in love for one another and for all and that their hearts will be holy and blameless. According to Paul , they can not wait passively. They must continue loving and living righteously . </wait.v.2039><wait.v.2040>I am a 22 year old male virgin. I 've been holding on since birth.

People were milling on the sidewalk , waiting for the band to start. Four elvin Bloods in poet ' s red clustered near the doors , looking sharp ( and aware of it , I ' ll bet ) against the building ' s black-patent paint job. A halfie woman with a lion ' s mane haircut dyed black and white was practicing some synched dance step. She was coached by a black human woman with silver bells in her elflocks. An elf kid had his seedybox balanced on one shoulder , and people were dancing to its music. Four members of the Pack pulled up on two cycles , their jackets trailing bright motley streamers. One of them asked the crowd at large if the music had started. One of the Bloods by the door shook her head , not really friendly but not like anyone expected war , and the Pack kids drove off again . </wait.v.2048><wait.v.2049>Last week I said that often the essence of faith is patience. They go hand in hand. The Bible says for us to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. ( Heb. 6 : 12 ) . God wants to teach us to be like Him , and one of His characteristics is His amazing patience. He ' s called the God of patience in Rom. 15 : 5. Part of being patient is learning to wait. And I don ' t think it ' s wrong to think that God is waiting on Abram either.

I can remember just before I turned 13 you would have thought I was about to become a millionaire or something. 13 a teenager ! ! ! Wahoo !

Once I turned my life over to God and realized how precious my body is and that it is the temple where the Holy Ghost dwells , I no longer allow the enemy into thinking that way. I am not a virgin but I am celibate and will remain so until I marry. Young and older ladies-do n't be tricked by the enemy. If he loves you-he WILL wait !

Fear that you might get something you like and then lose it. Yeah , I agree , there doesn ' t seem to be any point. The only thing I do is search out what I consider to be beautiful and lovely and just appreciate that for whatever merit it has. No expectations , no fear of losing the beauty after I ' ve found it , but just cherishing it in the moment. Every time I notice I ' m feeling way down , I force myself to look for something beautiful and l smile , at least for a little while. This way , at least while I ' m waiting to die , I ' ve had some enjoyment along the way . </wait.v.2070><wait.v.2071>3. There sure are quality gaps.

So I think that besides spell check , POV check , and check of time/place errors , there also should be a stereotype check. I can see Jenny doing it with care because her novels only contain cliches when they have an intended function and not because she can not imagine a woman wearing anything else than silken camisoles . </wait.v.2071><wait.v.2072>The actress , who recently celebrated her birthday , couldn ' t help but share her only birthday wish.

Gospel precepts are all promises , a revelation of what our God will do for us. When you first begin waiting on God , it is with frequent intermission and failure. But , do believe God is watching over you in love and secretly strengthening you in it. There are times when waiting appears like just losing time , but it is not so. Waiting , even in darkness , is unconscious advance , because it is God you have to do with , and He is working in you. God , who calls you to wait on Him , sees your feeble efforts and works it in you. Your spiritual life is in no respect your own work; as little as you begin it , can you continue it. It is God 's Spirit who has begun the work in you of waiting upon God. He will enable you to wait continually . </wait.v.2077><wait.v.2078>After about an hour of this amusement , in the latter part of which Job did not participate , the mutes by signs indicated that Billali was waiting for an audience.

Shortly afterwards we all rose , and , Ayesha having thrown a dark cloak ( the same , by the way , that she had worn when I saw her cursing by the fire ) over her white wrappings , we started. The dance was to be held in the open air , on the smooth rocky plateau in front of the great cave , and thither we made our way. About fifteen paces from the mouth of the cave we found three chairs placed , and here we sat and waited , for as yet no dancers were to be seen.

My pathology report showed I had pre-cancerous cells in on of my breasts that would have developed into cancer had I not had the surgery. Under no circumstances do I think what I did was " radical " in the common sense of the word , which usually translates as crazy or freakish. Merriam-Webster 's online defines , " radical " as : " marked by a considerable departure from the usual or traditional. " That is exactly what I ( and Christina ) did. Informed of my genetic makeup , I departed from the usual or traditional treatment for high risk women , which was waiting around with a target on my back.

A lot of races require you to be in the starting corrals by ten minutes prior to the start time and I find that time is crucial to find a decent spot in the lineup , do some light stretching and get my watch and iPod keyed up.

If 1000 people with minor visual impairment are awaiting cataract surgery and all are served within 3 months , there is no problem. Time , therefore , is the key indicator , both clinically and in terms of public perception . </wait.v.2097><wait.v.2098>8 : 00 AM Well , I ' m here at the Apple Store at Lenox Square Mall and the line is forming ! I got here when the doors opened at 8AM and I am still about 25th in line. I will be here all day , until the 6PM launch of the iPhone when I hope to get my hands on the most anticipated consumer device this decade.I ' ve been talking with some of the people in line and it seems that Lenox Mall got it better than most I ' ve already gotten reports of AT &amp;T stores that had hundreds of people waiting in line this morning.Only time will tell if I get an iPhone , but I ' ll be here all day taking pictures and talking with other iPhone campers so keep your address bar tuned to TAB today for all-day coverage of the iPhone launch.Here is the line where I am standing ( and sitting ) .

She 's just working the plan that she 's had in her scary little head for all these years , apparently she has been using and abusing people for years. Has anyone else thought that she might need treatment for Narcissistic Personality Disorder ... Fits several of the criteria ... Is " interpersonally exploitative " , i.e. , uses others to achieve his or her own ends " " exaggerates achievements and talents to the point of lying , demands to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements " " firmly convinced that he or she is unique and , being special , can only be understood by , should only be treated by , or associate with , other special or unique , or high-status people ( or institutions ) " " requires excessive admiration , adulation , attention and affirmation - or , failing that , wishes to be feared and to be notorious ( narcissistic supply ) " i.e. , the Pit Bull and/or the Barracuda " feels entitled. Expects unreasonable or special and favorable priority treatment. Demands automatic and full compliance with his or her expectations " " arrogant , haughty behaviours or attitudes coupled with rage when frustrated , contradicted , or confronted " Maybe that is what " they " meant when they said she was a Whack Job ... . </wait.v.2100><wait.v.2101>As long as we are being plain about choices , there is another way you can decide to wait upon the Lord. Again , it is a choice to move to safety by doing your duty. It takes a decision both about how to use your time and where to put your ego. And you can use it in the next week.

At the end of our meal we didnt have any room for dessert and the waiter brought out 3 roses for my 5 yr old daughter and 8 yr old niece and myself. Nice touch ! We were really impressed and walked out totally satisfied. Cant wait to go back and visit ! A must if your visiting Monterey ! The price was right for us too ! </wait.v.2109><wait.v.2110>Are you trying to handle your life by yourself and you never let God in ? Your waiting time will be longer than normal if you do n't agree with and surrender to God. God has promised you prosperity. It will only manifest at God 's time. If you feel it is taking too long and you take laws into your own hand and seek riches in the wrong way , you will end up in prison and what that means is that your waiting time has been prolonged. You can not replace ritual or sacrifice with obedience , you will be mocking God by doing that. God wants you to obey7 Him; all will be well with you At your convenience , please read Deut. 28 : 1-14 . </wait.v.2110><wait.v.2111>UPDATE I ' ve just reduced the number of contacts on my Exchange server from 3500 to 10 and waited for that to propagate through to the iPhone and went back out to the car , it paired up , showed all the old contacts briefly , wiped all the contacts off the screen and then showed the waiting clock  finally it said no contacts available !

For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption . . . the redemption of our body. ( Romans 8 : 19 23 , kjv ) </wait.v.2113><wait.v.2114>Dasher went to the vet 's Puppy Play time again yesterday. First he was in with the " small and delicate " , then he went in the enclosure with some of the " big ones " . I weighed him on the vet 's weighing machine and he is 5.5 kilos or 12 pounds and about 35 cm or 13 , 7 inches high at the shoulder. Afterwards , he got his second injection against a number of serious " doggy illnesses " .

Not enough to justify my existence. I don ' t want to be in this waiting to die situation. If I could see reasons to fight on and carry this ripping , tearing emotional pain I would embrace life , but I have never seen the sense of it all. When I was younger I had hope that the reason for living would eventually reveal itself to me. Now that hope has greatly diminished . </wait.v.2116><wait.v.2117>I ' m French and I try to improve my english , I realise that there is nothing best than read a great book in English and this one seems totally amazing ! !

I have a daughter; if this happened to her , it would kill me. . </wait.v.2118><wait.v.2119>I have to confess that the issue of waiting is one of those areas of my living where God has richly blessed me with an opportunity for much growth ! I am one of those people whose heart sinks when my wife and I go to one of our favorite restaurants where the sign says , " Please wait to be seated. " When the host or hostess says something like , " It will be about 40 minutes , " I find myself thinking , " Maybe McDonalds would be better this time. " My wife knows I am apt to do a U-turn when I see a parking lot crammed full at the place we were going to eat. She hates it when I look for an empty parking lot Shes probably thinking , " If no one is eating there , can it be very good ?

We are both teachers at a private school and just recently we were both told that we will not have jobs next year.

He is always on time. Thanks again . </wait.v.2121><wait.v.2122>Ron waited until Josh walked away , then he turned , sighed in relief , and clenched his fist in jubilation. " Yessss !

Dr. Bravura , the director , greeted them cheerily at the door . </wait.v.2122><wait.v.2123>One more thing to be excited about : my sister was originally planning to have a vacation with my parents in Madrid. Initially , that was the plan , that they will go to Madrid while I am still in Buffalo , and then when I fly there , the three of us ( since my sister will be back to Manila ) will go to Casablanca-Rabat. But since we have a two-week period to spend together , my sister cancelled Madrid , and instead is joining us so that the whole family can go to Casablanca-Rabat. Wonderful. I can not wait for this winter to pass and summer to come . </wait.v.2123><wait.v.2124>So my definition of suffering is wanting what you do n't have or having what you do n't want.

With both husband and son out in the mountains , the Ox Princess was as avid for company as Bulma. The two women had grown on each other during the year waiting for the Saiyans , and they got along reasonably well , even having so little in common. The visit began pleasantly , with both women drinking tea at Chichi 's kitchen , and , of course , complaining about the eternal selfish children that happened to be men. Bulma started to talk resentfully about Yamcha having gone straight to the desert without even saying goodbye , but Chichi cut her off . </wait.v.2133><wait.v.2134>Valorina and Clipord ! !

Someone observed that there are two kinds of people in our lives people we keep waiting and people for whom we wait. For example , at lunch today it bugged me when I had to wait for a table , then a waiter. Of course , it didn ' t bother me that the waiter had to wait for me to make up my mind ( Don ' t they get paid to wait ? ) . </wait.v.2136><wait.v.2137>bcb - Yeah , I know.

What were they waiting for ? They were waiting for the redemption of Israel. What does the redemption of Israel mean in Luke ' s gospel ? It does not mean that salvation is only for the Israelites. It means that salvation is for all people of all nations. In fact , Simeon praised God , saying For my eyes have seen your salvation , which you have prepared in the sight of all people , a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel. ( 30-32 ) The salvation that God our Father prepared for us in Jesus Christ is a fantastic salvation and is worthy of our eager expectation. Let ' s see if what we wait for is worthy of waiting . </wait.v.2139><wait.v.2140>Wow. I must say I have never encountered a problem like that where I work thankfully. Libraries are a huge magnet for the oddest people. Actually it is sort of sad they have nowhere else to go. As for Harry I should have waited to start it over a weekend. It ' s hard watching the clock waiting for my next fix I have to wait for my break , I have to wait for lunch , I have to wait until I get home , until dinner is finished it would be nice to have a long afternoon free to read.

Slowly , she dropped to a squatting position , then knelt down on one knee , holding herself upright by her crook , looking to all the world like a loyal warrior knight paying homage before her king. Moonlight bathed Super Collie 's face as she gazed upwards , the statue above her reflecting the luminous radiance from the full moon above as the breeze teased and played over her fur and cloak. Her soft leather boots quietly creaked as she shifted slightly , putting more weight on her crook as she waited expectantly , joyously , for whatever might happen next . </wait.v.2141><wait.v.2142>This past Tuesday Dr. Michelle came out to the sanctuary and she too was concerned. Wacipi has been losing weight and not eating well the past few days. She took blood for testing but the results are not back yet. We were waiting for the results but Saturday it was obvious he was getting too weak. As we take the wolves for walks on Saturday , we took Wacipi for a very short one because he so looked forward to going. Little did we know that it would be his last , but I 'm glad Marilyn got to take him because it made him very happy to go even for a very short one . </wait.v.2142><wait.v.2143>This did n't surprise Giles , he had been waiting for this phone call. It had been a gamble sending Andrew but Giles could n't resist.

He changed condoms so quickly that CJ was impressed despite both her experience and her now building need for a second orgasm.

And I believe you might be in that situation right now , in pain of cancer and life threatening diseases , separation from a loved one , loneliness and depression. Can you cry ? They cry ! Cry to the Lord , believe , endure and wait. There is no sin in crying; but you have to cry with faith. You see , babies do n't just cry , a baby cries to get the attention of the father and the mother. Whose attention are you trying to get with your cry ? If it is God 's attention , you must cry with faith and endurance. You can not give up while you are waiting on the Lord . </wait.v.2152><wait.v.2153>Case in point the guy in the suit at the bakery.

Reporters and eyewitnesses told of voters who had given up after humiliating or frustrating waits , and who often cited the unwillingness of their employers to accept voting as an excuse for lateness or absence. In some way or another , these bottlenecks had a tendency to occur in working-class and , shall we just say , nonwhite precincts. So did many disputes about provisional ballots , the sort that are handed out when a voter can prove his or her identity but not his or her registration at that polling place. These glitches might all be attributable to inefficiency or incompetence ( though Gambier had higher turnouts and much shorter lines in 1992 and 1996 ) . Inefficiency and incompetence could also explain the other oddities of the Ohio process from machines that redirected votes from one column to the other to machines that recorded amazing tallies for unknown fringe candidates , to machines that apparently showed that voters who waited for a long time still somehow failed to register a vote at the top of the ticket for any candidate for the presidency of these United States . </wait.v.2213><wait.v.2214>You guys ROCKED THE HOUSE ! ! ! !

Your case can not be desperate while God is omnipotent. However great the difficulties that lie in your path , however impossible it may appear for you to escape or overcome them , there is nothing too hard for the Lord. He can make a way in the sea , and a path in the deep waters. Let nothing therefore dishearten or discourage you. You may be brought into such a state as to be entirely dependent on the Lord , having no friend , adviser , or helper; and that may be the most blessed season of your life.

Nonetheless , this does n't mean we can neglect the needs of our neighbour , ignore the directives of Scripture , or refuse to make decisions in our waiting.

Her body condition score was a 1 , extremely emaciated. So we knew what our chances were. She ate well for 5 days and started to feel safe and cared for. So she decided to lie down and rest her old bones. We knew this moment would come , and we did n't know if she would be strong enough to get herself back up. She was not. In her emaciated condition , Shanty 's struggle to regain physical strength would have been long and painful. With our DVM Director Steve Tornberg , we decided Shanty 's struggle should end. We are glad she waited until she was in a safe , soft , dry spot to lie down; instead of out in the mud , snow , or creek where she came from. She was humanely euthanized and the procedure was very peaceful. " </wait.v.2303><wait.v.2304>I ask , What has God promised you , and what can God do to fill a vessel absolutely surrendered to Him ?

As tempting as it would be to come right then and there , he wanted to allow himself and Gabby the opportunity to experience this fully. He exerted every ounce of willpower he possessed , then closed his eyes for good measure. Trying to watch what she was doing was too distracting and far , far too exciting to continue doing it. And if Xena continued doing what she was doing with those long , strong , clever fingers of hers , he might not be able to wait for Gabby to finish exploring him. He was n't about to ask Xena to stop , though , not for anything . </wait.v.2308><wait.v.2309>So here ' s the latest.

By the mariners in a shipwrecked vessel; by a benighted traveler in a dangerous country; by an army that finds itself surrounded by an enemy. The morning light will show what hope of escape there may be. The morning may bring life and liberty. And so the saints of God in darkness have longed for the light of His countenance , more than watchmen for the morning.

But something about this silence felt slightly less disconcerting. Maybe it was the more subdued fear on her breath , rather than the blatant , pungent fear and distaste she had first held for him. Whatever the case was , he had brought her safely home. Remedy was waiting in the den , awaiting the return of her family. Probably anxious and nervous about their disappearance. Keoto smiled , amused as he contemplated Remedys face when he arrived back at the den with shy little Rosalie behind him.

In some cases Marvel in particular puts the paperback edition at such a time that if you did wait for it , you would end up being a whole year behind the original issues. By which time the story might well have been spoiled to you by someone who blurted it out in the comic shop or on the internet somewhere , or you might be more interested in whatever the current thing is , or you ' ve forgotten you were waiting for this and already spent all your money on a lifetime supply of Doritos.

And yet it seems to me that that exclusive kind of message is the opposite of what Jesus ' own actions communicate around his own baptism , especially according to the gospel of Luke. It seems to me that what Jesus was saying was " I am here , like everybody else. I am in your midst. And you may not notice me , because I 'm not the celebrity who has just jumped the queue , I 'm not the squeaky wheel who takes their place at the front of the line. But I am here beside you.

" </wait.v.2357><wait.v.2358>" In patience possess your souls. " " Ye have need of patience. " " Let patience have its perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire. " Such words of the Holy Spirit show us what an important element in the Christian life and character patience is. And nowhere is there a better place for cultivating or displaying it than in waiting on God. There we discover how impatient we are , and what our impatience means. We confess at times that we are impatient with men , and circumstances that hinder us , or with ourselves and our slow progress in the Christian life. If we truly set ourselves to wait upon God , we shall find that it is with Him we are impatient , because He does not at once , or as soon as we could wish , do our bidding. It is in waiting upon God that our eyes are opened to believe in His wise and sovereign will , and to see that the sooner and the more completely we yield absolutely to it , the more surely His blessing can come to us . </wait.v.2358><wait.v.2359>A few thoughts I don ' t think that having a satisfying sex life in the long term hinges on whether or not you have sex before the wedding. I really think it depends more on whether or not the spouses are able to communicate with each other about sex. I was a bridesmaid in a wedding where the couple waited for the wedding night , and my friend said that her pastor put a lot of emphasis in premarital counseling on the fact that sex would be an important part of the marriage and they needed to feel comfortable talking about it with each other. This is just as important for couples who don ' t wait , because having sex before marriage isn ' t a guarantee of lifetime sexual compatibility ( and I say this as someone living with my fiance ! ) . Sex drives and desires change over time , and to be successful in the long term I think a couple needs to be able to talk about those changes . </wait.v.2359><wait.v.2360>I missed Rachel Getting Married.

Should I have pointed out to my neighbor that sleeping alone wasn ' t so bad ?

We made it to Armadale Castle at 5pm so they let us into the museum for half price ( 2.50 GBP each ) since they were closing at 5 : 30. We sped through the Clan Donald exhibits but didn ' t have time for the library. We really enjoyed it even at that pace , and were pleased to see a panel on the Clan Donalds that emigrated to Cape Breton , since they would be our ancestors. The grounds and castle ruins were open until later so we were able to explore a bit. We had the whole castle grounds to ourselves and we spent awhile meandering about and I , of course , took lots of photos. It was getting quite cold by this time , so we got back in the car and headed for Portree . </wait.v.2364><wait.v.2365>After waiting in Amman for over seven weeks , the mothers of Aros , Shaima , Zhino and Cheya were overjoyed to be travelling at last to Israel. Of course the children too were excited about moving on to the next place in their journey to get well. We were all thankful for the cooler weather which had moved into Jordan a few days before so that the trip to the border was pleasant for us as we crowded into the van. Even so , the cooler weather did n't stop us from enjoying some ice cream while we waited to board the bus which would carry us over the Jordan River into Israel . </wait.v.2365><wait.v.2366>Hey ! !

He has been so much fun to have around and we ca n't wait to get him started into the companion program as well as obedience training. We are so happy to have him as part of our family. We hope that the family who left him at your shelter reads this and knows that he has a good home and will have a happy life with us. He has 5 acres to run and another lab to keep him company.

In fact , the phrase " wait patiently " was translated from the single word chuwl , which literally means " to twist , whirl , dance , be in anguish , be pained " , and can also be used to mean " to wait anxiously " . In other words , the original Hebrew text in no way promotes a " passive , patient waiting "; instead , it promotes an anguished waiting , a fidgety , " dancity " waiting imbued with pain and anxiety. This gross mistranslation reveals how different natural man 's understanding of the word " waiting " is from God 's understanding of the same word . </wait.v.2381><wait.v.2382>Well , I for one do not intend to wait till I get a knock on the door in the middle of the night or till we see a mushroom cloud over a major American city due to the feckless cowardice of President Obozo or till my electricity is only available 12 hrs a day or till the entire economy is in the toilet ..it behooves ALL of us to practice our own form of the Bush Doctrine domestically .that is to say we start busting Obozo ' s chops preemptively from day one till he is exposed as the chocolate coated clown that he is .after watching the left trash GW for nearly 8 yrs , I have no intention of ' playing nice ' and giving Obozo any slack or benefit of the doubt much less giving him time enough to bring America to its knees .I ' ve had a gut full and I ' m going to start giving it back in spades </wait.v.2382><wait.v.2383>Shiver is a wonderful book that capures your imagination , and heart !

Normally , they could only be seen by the people they were waiting for , but every time they returned Will could see more and more of them.

It has mystery , love , and intrigue. Throughout the whole book , I could n't put it down , due to needing to know what was really going on and how Ever fit into the whole big picture. Ever is a great protagonist and never bored or irritated me. Alyson Noel is one of my all time favorite authors and she does n't disappoint this time. The ending is also nice to where you can wait for the next book ( out later '09 -- titled Blue Moon ) and not feel like you 're going to pull your hair out.

But in that coming day , no weapon turned against you will succeed. And everyone who tells lies in court will be brought to justice.

Because of this concern , 6 the Rabbis decreed that one who wants to eat a dairy product must wait six hours7 after eating meat.8 A person is " fleishig " , 9 even if he chewed the meat and removed it from his mouth. The waiting period is also required if one ate meat or chicken soup , or a tavshil shel basar , food cooked with meat , even though one did not eat the meat ( e.g. a cholent potato ) .10 One must wait six hours after swallowing the last piece of meat. One is not required to wait six hours after Birchas Hamazon.

If I remember correctly , Frank was the guy at the video store at checkout ( either that or the one standing just outside waiting to go in ) . The fact that it was Frank on the trap would mean that the zombie-esque creatures would have been watching him go to the rental store and interact with him , knowing that this alone would freak him out enough to fall into the trap. So , I think it was his own which he forgot about Makes sense since he was going pretty crazy. The only issue with this alternative is that it also seems unlikely that Robert , who is somewhat superstitious ( not the right word ) and a bit obsessive compulsive would put Frank in the trap in the first place , since Frank was obviously one of his few manikin friends. It ' s as unlikely as him putting the woman in the rental store in the trap.

She felt more than a little guilty about the grief they would feel , but on the other hand , she knew her parents well enough to know that they 'd be pleased she was marrying a Delauney. She was n't entirely right on that score , given the reputation Charles had for running wild , but it certainly soothed them a little. Her note had urged them to go ahead and set sail , and she and Charles would come to New York to visit them over Christmas , but they were not as cavalier as that , and they waited patiently , and very angrily , for the young lovers ' return , with every hope of annulling the marriage and squelching the entire affair before it became a proper scandal. Of course the ambassador knew what she 'd done , because they 'd sought his help , and he had made discreet inquiries.

I was able to upgrade to a 3GS for less than $ 20. Part of that fee was the iPhone restocking fee that I knew about and I believe tax. AT &amp;T sent me a fee return label and I have 30 days to return my 8G 3G. I asked the AT &amp;T person how come I could n't find the deal on their web site , I was told my type of deal was only available by calling. Sure glad I did. My new phone came in Friday.

Nonetheless , this does n't mean we can neglect the needs of our neighbour , ignore the directives of Scripture , or refuse to make decisions in our waiting.

The first ( the Zelda Tote ) I received for my birthday from my Mom a few years ago , the second ( the Zelda Grand ) I bought for myself , and now this one ... the Zhivago Weekender. You can see a comparison of all the sizes here , which is kind of fun to see . </wait.v.2569><wait.v.2570>" Hey Finn. Whats up ? Did you ever fall back asleep last night ? We were all waiting for you. " Charlene replied quickly . </wait.v.2570><wait.v.2571>I think people like you , Andrew ! Look at all these emails. I write to you as someone who has been tired for 11 years. That ' s how long we have had our beautiful , brain-damaged , tough , cheeky , food-spitting-out , one-problem-after-another daughter Bethany. We wouldn ' t be without her. Susan is right. Life isn ' t fair. But your music has helped people like me find beauty in a damaged world. Take care and take your time. We can wait </wait.v.2571><wait.v.2572>Ranger turned a corner and stopped , waiting to hear if Jean would follow him or proceed to the hold. As Jean 's footsteps grew further and further away Ranger smiled. He carefully looked down the hall and was glad to find it empty. He made his way back up to the deck quickly and headed straight for the gang plank . </wait.v.2572><wait.v.2573>When in God ' s waiting room , we need to be quiet and still. Our heart ' s attitude should be one of listening and reflecting on God , His way and our hearts. Sometimes , my focus becomes intent on working out the solution the way I think it should be done , in stead of waiting on God. In pride , I spend my time fretting or complaining. Why is it that we think we have the right to vent ? When I vent I am complaining against God instead of trusting him. Venting is prideful and self focused , it robs us of faith. We can become focused on how unfair or wrong we think our situation is . </wait.v.2573><wait.v.2574>My appointment at the clinic was very thorough , and I was sent away with a saliva kit so that I could send my sample to the lab. I have n't yet done the saliva sample , because I am still menstruating , which means it must be collected on day 21 ( 2 weeks from now ) . The test turned out to be $ 200 , not $ 100 as I had said before.

Time should be respected with communication being gold. if Mingle is indeed overloaded for whatever reason , an email , or a phone call , is hardly much to ask in today ' s age of rapidfire technology , especially if are to demand similar from students using the mingle site . </wait.v.2576><wait.v.2577>I could see the anger on all those faces as these jerks just added a few more minutes of waiting to everyone behind them.

I really like to share with you these difficult moments and open quwstions and worries of tomorrow. I have had so many great moments during my life when listening Andrews ' solos and music. Andrew has given me hope and light when things have gone bad. Since 1980 I have been your fan. You have been my band. And you are my band. If I ' d get a similar problem now than Andrew has gotI ' d certainly go and find Camel ' s music to encourage me and be with me through difficult times. Today I ' m a vicar in my congregation in Finland. Today I pray for You all and especially for Andrew. I pray to God that his Good will happens. Thank you for all. I ' ll be waiting for good news before christmas . </wait.v.2581><wait.v.2582>Why didn ' t the President give Libby a Full Pardon ? The judge was Extremely Bias in his sentencing. Clinton did not get any Jail time for his perjury and obstruction. Clinton also waited until his last day in office to give hundreds of Criminals Full Pardons. Also , did a women come forward and say that Clinton Raped her ? This is a very bad offense in my opinion and should have gotten some Jail time.

She did n't like them seeing her at those times , pale and weak and miserable , but Sam 's cool hands would spread over her lower back , Donna would patiently hold a cool wet rag to the back of her neck , Toby would supply her with a misting glass of ice water. All these things became comforts that kept her sane in the worst moments , when she forgot to remind herself that she could do this , that this would end , that she was better than this , that she was stronger . </wait.v.2584><wait.v.2585>If that alone does n't connvince the state to take those kids away , I do n't know what will , especially when the fired nurses on Dr Phil said she had to be chased down to actually feed her kids as she wanted to be gone shopping or stay hiding in her bedroom instead ... feeding them only 8 times in 5 days ? And she keeps saying what a good mom she is ? YIKES ! ! She obviously is not mentally competant to take care of these kids period. I think this mom is feeling she is some rich b*tch who has " help " to do all her bidding for her , and after seeing how she treated her mom , talked to her mom when her mom lost her home and retirement income trying to support this deadbeat daughter and her kids , yep , I think that octa mom feels she deserves to be waited on hand and foot . </wait.v.2585><wait.v.2586>Kashyapa went away and Diti began to observe the rites that the sage had prescribed. But Indra had got to know what was afoot and he was naturally in no mood to permit the birth of a son who would be the cause of his own destruction. He hung around Diti ' s hermitage , pretending to serve his aunt. He brought her firewood and fruit and served her in other ways. But in reality , he was merely waiting for an opportunity. He was waiting for the moment when Diti would fail to observed the norms of cleaniness that had been laid down for her . </wait.v.2586><wait.v.2587>Excellent news ! Of course , waiting is never easy. There is a different tone in you message today , optimism. That tone made me smile . </wait.v.2587><wait.v.2588>I have just discovered your blog. I must say that it cheers me and frightens me at the same time. I was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer 6 years ago. I know that for me the most difficult part was waiting to know what path I would be taking . Once treatment started and while I was undergoing treatment , my mind was at ease. Even though the process can be difficult at least it was a positive after hearing one of the worst negatives of my life . </wait.v.2588><wait.v.2589>We relaxed over breakfast , and it was a blessing that we didn ' t have to walk all the way back to the lodge; we were waaaaay too comfortable after our long walk and delicious food. Instead , the Rover was waiting for us , and we loaded up and began the dusty drive back towards Ol Malo. Thoreau once said that An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day . We had a lot more in store for us on this day , but I can assure you that by the time I closed my eyes that night , had a full and deep understanding of that sentiment. There were a still a wealth of experiences yet to be had , and we had barely begun to scratch the surface of the day . </wait.v.2589><wait.v.2590>now , as for the body tied to the propeller ... .that was Cousin Whoever that they were waiting for in the beginning , the reason why the boat was late leaving . </wait.v.2590><wait.v.2591>And come Friday evening , all your years of waiting will finally be at an end.

Is this not why Abram spoke of Eliezer of Damascus as his heir ( Genesis 15 : 2 ) ? Is this not why Abram gave in to Sarai 's suggestion that they have the promised seed through Hagar , her handmaid ( Genesis 16 : 1-2 ) ? </wait.v.2597><wait.v.2598>Further , I don ' t have to wait however months to read a full story arc and I can read it all in one shot.

I then will travel 6-8 weeks after that to pick her up. I am hoping to be going there by June or July of 2006. This weekend , I picked out a bedroom set for her. I plan on ordering it next week.

We all expect the future to hold such promise , and we wait for our good fortune to shine through the seemingly endless abyss of fear and uncertainty.

I begin to question my assumption that music is the only path. I ask myself a question : What would you like to do if you could do anything ? What if you didn ' t try to make a living with your musical skills ? I made of list of every job that had even an ounce of interest to me. I tried to imagine myself in all of them. I kept adding and subtracting from the list. What did I like to do ? What am I good at ? What interests me ? Which of these actually involved a paycheck ? As I made changes I found the list evolving to include more technology related fields than others. I was always obsessed with computers but considered it a hobby , not a possible profession. As I reconsidered previous beliefs and suggested directions from others that thought shifted. Why not at least try it ? Take some classes , see if it suits you. No harm in a little taste . </wait.v.2608><wait.v.2609>Try to get your boss to let you have formal training , but understand that it often not much better than the same amount of time spent simply playing with the new skill you want to learn. It is , however , easier to ask for training than playtime in our imperfect world , even though a lot of formal training is just sleeping through lectures waiting for the dinner party . </wait.v.2609><wait.v.2610>I wrestle with this. Sometimes I can know the truth intellectually that God is willing to help me , but when I am in the midst of a lengthy difficulty it is not so easy to believe. I start out seeing it clearly , but as time moves on and things become more difficult or are not working out the way I want them to , my ability to trust God ' s goodness towards me can falter. I lose perspective and begin thinking things like , God is not helping me ,  God is blessing others , but not me ,  What have I done that God is punishing me ? Statements like these reveal my lack of faith. My focus is on me , my feelings , my understanding , my situation , but not on God. When this happens , I am not waiting in faith . </wait.v.2610><wait.v.2611>All the strength of God , if needed , will be put forth for you , if you wait upon him.

People and cars were everywhere. I had left my home early to allow a few extra minutes to review my study aids prior to taking the test. My extra study time disappeared as I searched for parking in the crowded lot. The crowd shocked me. There must have been more than 500 people waiting to be admitted to their testing rooms. I joined the herd of people at the entrance as the gate-keeper started allowing admission by corralling people in the proper direction to their testing room . </wait.v.2612><wait.v.2613>Working with the whisk attachment or with a hand mixer , beat the meringue on medium speed until it is cool , about 5 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment if you have one , and add the butter a stick at a time , beating until smooth.

During this time the buttercream may curdle or separate just keep beating and it will come together again.

Everyday we watched out the window as every hour or more , hospital trains sped by at high speed carrying wounded Germans home and fresh troops and supplies to the Russian front. My mother and Edmund Lang became friends. Now he was like a father to us. Christmas time came and the Germans at the station put up a Christmas tree for us with gifts around it. We felt like we were home. Often dances were held in the large waiting room at the station and local people were invited to attend. There was a barrel of free beer and everyone was having a good time. Then it seemed that my mother found out that she had a rival. Edmund Lang had previously had a lady friend by the name of Podbierewska and my mother was so occupied keeping her away from him , that she seemed to forget most of her other problems. That lady friend became a pest in my mothers life . </wait.v.2618><wait.v.2619>So I ' m just waiting to hear that they ' re ready to send the next team , which should be leaving somewhere between Feb 2nd and 4th.

Weeks ago , I was at a store with a friend. She stacked her food on the counter and whipped out a food stamp card , paid and quickly put it in her purse. She stiffly walked ahead feeling how ashamed I was of her. When we sat down she said , I didn ' t want you to judge me. I apologized too quickly and then put myself in her place. How scared she must be of the stigma pouring out of my eyes. How would I feel if I were ashamed to even buy food ? I looked at her and apologized again and meant it. She leaned to me and said , It ' s okay. She waited a moment and took out the food stamp card , This is who we really are. </wait.v.2644><wait.v.2645>I ' ve always been far too much of an instant gratification type to wait for the trade .

I ' ve wanted to do the same with Fables , but I started out way behind ( picked up the first collection about a year ago ) , and my disposable income isn ' t sufficient ( especially nowadays ) to catch up , so I guess in that case , I ' m waiting for the trade by default . </wait.v.2645><wait.v.2646>Dominic Hobbs : Had a bloody bear leave group from Oculus today.

The dark man ahead dove into a side alley , and Amansam turned to continue after him. The alley ended in a high fence , and Amansam spotted his quarry clearing it to the other side.

He decided to go down and pick them up himself but when he got there , the UPS employee looked up our tracking numbers and frowned. Apparently they got so backlogged with packages that they had to put them in storage trailers and could not even tell us which trailers ours were in. The employee told us that we would probably get our packages around Jan. 2. We were able to rearrange our gift giving so that Santa ' s were covered. I can understand delivery being delayed , but I would have appreciated getting the straight scoop from the beginning. Plan B would have had more options on December 20th </wait.v.2714><wait.v.2715> On the first leg , I sat with a very nice young man who was heading to Oregon to work for the winter. His sister crochets and he had a lot of questions about all the needles. I was also approached several times while sitting in the various airports waiting for flights by people who knit or crochet. Apparently dpns are still a mystery and intimidating to knitters. It ' s just sticks and string . </wait.v.2715><wait.v.2716>The dealer also shouldn ' t have sold you the cradle if he knew you had a 3G iPhone , the cradle is designed for the original ( 2G ) iPhone ONLY !

Even then I do not fully press it in , the 3G is too big for the cradle and ultimately you will damage you iPhone casing , the cradle and the iPhone port on the bottom with repeat use.

It immediately sounds , taking the slack out of my breakaway line. I feel the line whizzing across my shoulder and burning the skin on my cheek. I do not want to die from chasing tunas , so I back away from the line fast.

Teachers who had enjoyed high prestige were forced to sell their possessions one by one. I saw a number of my Takao Middle School teachers peddling small objects in the streets.

But when there is a real moral issue and your brother refuses to obey the teaching of the Word of God , then there must come a separation. You can not follow him and follow the Word of God at the same time. These exhortations are practical , but they are all linked with the command to be patiently waiting for the Lord ' s return.

In the meantime ( which might not be that long , if Utah closes things out ) the Lakers can bask in the glow of their first playoff series win in four seasons. The fork-sticking win did n't come easy , unlike the first three , because Denver finally showed up to play all 48 minutes. They made LA 's 10-point halftime lead disappear , took a lead in the third , and kept things tight in the fourth , but it was n't enough to overcome a huge fourth quarter for Kobe Bryant , who had 31 points as Carmelo Anthony continued to struggle for Denver. But it was n't just Bryant -- Pau Gasol , Lamar Odom , Vlad Radmanovic , and Luke Walton all played a role in the win and the box score shows once again that the Lakers used some solid ball movement to score points . </wait.v.2776><wait.v.2777>Every time I use the Careworks clinic I ' m treated great.

The Gemara Chulin ( 105a ) states that Mar Ukva waited until the next meal before eating dairy. The overwhelming majority of Rishonim are of the opinion that this means one must wait six hours. The halacha , as stated in Shulchan Aruch YD 89 : 1 , is that one must wait a full six hours ( Chamudei Doniel as brought in Darchai Teshuva 89 : 6 ) . It should be noted that some Rishonim hold one hour or three hours. Although the prevalent custom is to wait six hours , many individuals of German descent wait only three hours. [ Original Dutch Jews wait only one hour. ] If a woman of German descent , who is accustomed to waiting three hours , marries a man who waits six hours , she must then wait six hours. Similarly , if a woman who waits six hours marries a man of German descent who waits three hours , she may then wait only three hours . </wait.v.2781><wait.v.2782>Pillar and Victor circled each other slowly like a pair of predators in the wild.

In the first book , he meets Quinn and there is an instant attraction between the two. Alaric wants Quinn , but he believes in his duty as a high priest. If he is n't a high priest , he ca n't serve Conlan or Poisedon and Atlantis means a great deal to Alaric. Back when I actually checked the Yahoo Groups , Alyssa Day said that we would n't have to wait years for Alaric. I believe he was actually compared to Acheron and Day shot that down. Since then , I believe she went on a hiatus for personal reasons but has since returned to the writing world.

I 've learned over the years little things that do it for her , many of which do n't even involve touching her and that I can do when we are not together. I find that , for my wife , the more contact I have with her on a non-sexual basis ( e.g. , holding her hand whenever we walk together , hugging her while waiting in line , kissing her forehead when I hug her , etc. ) , the more into sex she tends to be. I also make sure she knows how good-looking I think she is ( she 's more into sex when she feels good about her body ) , and tell her when we are out , or when she gets out of the shower. When she turns me on , I tell her and explain exactly what she 's done to turn me on.

Luckily , it did not , and he did n't have to wait very long before a doctor saw him. The diagnosis came fairly quickly -- not food poisoning , unfortunately , but the stomach flu. There was nothing that they could do for him , aside from giving him some over-the-counter free samples of medication that would ease his symptoms.

I had been hovering at the nurses ' station , wearing my collar and waiting for a parishioner to get out of surgery and back to the ICU. This was years ago when I was a newly ordained minister , all of 25 years old ( and looked about 15 ) , and this dear woman said to me in her finest , most sincere southern drawl , " Son , " dragging it out into a three syllable word " I have great respect for the clergy , but you need to understand something.

There 's no reason NOT to set your table with the crystal candlesticks from Aunt Mary , the expensive china from cousin Charlie , the fancy silver setting from your parents , the handwoven tablecloth your college roommate brought back from her semester abroad in Ireland.

It is not about what God created " in the beginning , " but what is being created here and now. It is not about what God requires you to do , either to " set things right " or to justify yourself; it is about the powerful goodness " in the midst of you already , " waiting to be grasped.

He was often the center of action , but the very best stories had his Companions at the forefront , with him acting like the protector and guide in the background. He seemed to gain strength from his Companions he was always bold and in your face , but moments like after Ian and Barbara left him reveal him to be frail. He deflates when those who stay with him depart , and it takes some doing to build him back up again. His need for company is perfectly displayed in The War Machines when he is shown standing outside the TARDIS waiting patiently for Dodo , who never comes. He seems so feeble then so sad and alone. But the moment he discovers that he accidentally takes Ben and Polly along with him , he fires right back up. He becomes so angry with them for stowing away , but you know that deep down he is relieved he isn ' t alone once again . </wait.v.2822><wait.v.2823>Update 4/1/08 : Sticking to my resolution has gone pretty well so far.

The Father and the Spirit are never without or separate from each other. The Father is always in the Spirit; the Spirit works nothing but as the Father works in Him. Each moment , the same Spirit that is in us is in God , too. And , he who is most full of the Spirit will be the first to wait on God most earnestly to further fulfill His promise and to still strengthen him mightily by His Spirit in the inner man. The Spirit in us is not a power at our disposal. Nor is the Spirit an independent power , acting apart from the Father and the Son. The Spirit is the real , living presence and the power of the Father working in us. Therefore , it is he who knows that the Spirit is in him who waits on the Father for the full revelation and experience of the Spirit 's indwelling. It is he who waits for His increase and abounding more and more . </wait.v.2827><wait.v.2828>When we were licensed to do foster to adopt the first time , we inquired about 5 different children in 3 different states.

However , as they placed her in my arms , this little girl who we had prayed for so earnestly seemed to know that she was home. She threw back her head and began to laugh.

It is a great thing for a soul not only to wait upon God , but to be filled with such a consciousness that its whole spirit and position is that of a waiting one , that it can , in childlike confidence , say , Lord !

It seems time freezes when you have nothing to do. In many of my customer-reception training seminars , I ask all participants to sit still without doing anything for just a minute and the 60 seconds always seems like an hour. However , as observed by Professor Maister , the music that callers are forced to listen to while waiting is more of a nuisance than an effective strategy to occupy time. He stated that this could be as a result of the fact the activity ( listening to music ) is totally unrelated to the service activity to come. He further advised that to occupy the customer ' s time , the activity provided to ' fill time ' should ( a ) offer benefit in and of itself , and ( b ) be related , in some way to the following service encounter. </wait.v.2833><wait.v.2834>I wanna hear a little usher , So I ' ll be looking forward to his album more than Mariah ' s.with Usher..you can always be sure that he ' ll be releasing something good.Not no half-done album..with a few good tracks.So , I ' m glad he ' s making folks wait . </wait.v.2834><wait.v.2835>In the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings.

In praying we are often occupied with ourselves , with our own needs , and our own efforts in the presentation of them. In waiting upon God , the first thought is of the God upon whom we wait. We enter His presence , and feel we need just to be quiet , so that He , as God , can overshadow us with Himself. God longs to reveal Himself , to fill us with Himself. Waiting on God gives Him time in His own way and divine power to come to us . </wait.v.2867><wait.v.2868>Hi I 'm new to the Rain series too ! I loved the book.

I soon got elected to fill his place owing to my obvious qualifications ( I was the only dishwasher wearing a black T-shirt ) . The world beyond the kitchen grime was a lively mixture of pleasure and pain. I flirted with bridesmaids , listened to drunk uncles jabber , and fielded the senseless requests of old ladies.

A business owner can fall into the trap of leaning on his debtors ' list , and making great plans based on their word that they are going to pay. Over time you get to trust wholly in them , such that you elevate them provider status. Soon you start confessing with your own lips that if they do not pay by this time , I will not be able to do this or that. After putting so much faith in them way past due date , you realize they are just but men , as the Psalmist puts it in Chapter 9 Verse 20.

They wait patiently for you , never complaining , never taunting you to read the last few pages to see what would happen in the end , and it can wait for a long time before you actually read it without complaints . </wait.v.2876><wait.v.2877>The reason why we should wait is to prove the sincerity of our faith. The one who believes can wait to the end. If someone does not believe in genuine faith , he will give up waiting. At the age of 85 God promised Abraham a son. Abraham waited another 15 more years before God fulfilled His promise to him. Abraham did not give up but completely believed God ' s word to him. Then at the age of 100 Isaac was born to Abraham at last . </wait.v.2877><wait.v.2878>So rocky and so beautiful totally Gavin DeGraw , now I am waiting for your CD release , I can not wait !

It is often the case that clients come with an expectation that I will have an answer for whatever it is that is troubling them. They are not certain what it is that I do , but whatever it is , they trust that I will have an answer that might be of help to them. Most of the time I am afraid that I am quite disappointing. That is not because I am uninterested in helping them. It is because I know that any answer that I provide will not really be especially helpful. It is because I know that whatever answer they seek is already forming in an incipient stage somewhere deep within them even though it appears to be inaccessible in the present moment. And so a large part of what I do in the practice of psychotherapy is to help my clients to wait . </wait.v.2917><wait.v.2918>These were godly men and women.

It seemed so far away to her ... Well , probably because she was growing increasingly tired and was beginning to not want to do anything but sleep. Perhaps Officer Casey had been right about only walking to the dorms ? She would most likely just fall over when they got there from the strain finally getting to her.

I 'm not sure why I was surprised , but probably it was rubbing against my middle-class American upbringing. I never had servants or people waiting on me. I even felt somewhat embarrassed that we had taken about 5 minutes of this serving woman 's time. Surely she had other things she could have been attending to at the restaurant. Notably , my Indian colleague was right at home. She comes from upper-class India , and is used to having a household staff. When I expressed my concerns for the woman 's time , she assured me that such service people see their jobs as taking care of the host , and are happy to do it ( or at least understand that that 's normal for their work ) -- so the woman probably had no such qualms , according to my colleague . </wait.v.2933><wait.v.2934>The Lord tells Habakkuk that he has to wait.

I stood with the hundreds of screaming fans waiting outside , holding Jon 's book and my cool pen. Everyone came out , but I kept thinking , where is Jon ? Lorne Michaels came out. Chris Kattan. Then it happened. " Everyone has gone , clear out , " the security guard said. No ! Where 's Jon ? My sweet Jon ! ! ! </wait.v.2990><wait.v.2991>Chakotay sat next to Kathryn and watched the scene in front of him with awe. Now I think thats the best shes eaten yet. This is what she was waiting for.

I wonder if she has quietly moved somewhere near where he is training. If a break up were there the media would be all over the Middleton home waiting for Kate. As for that picture of her falling while on skates she looked more dignified than the born royals did during Edwards 80 ' s work It ' s a royal knockout . </wait.v.2993><wait.v.2994>Adults with no health insurance face waits up to a year or longer for gallbladder or hernia surgery in Los Angeles County , a backlog that community clinic doctors say has worsened since the county downsized Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital last year . </wait.v.2994><wait.v.2995>I am waiting until I am ready for long term commitment ( marriage ) to date anyone.

So it 's just difficult to be patient . </wait.v.2995><wait.v.2996>so i think its a lie that jen did not want to give brad babies..itsd not her fault if a ) she cpould not immedietely conceive , b ) changed her mind &amp;decided to wait a while longer -it is her body and her film career had only started to blossom back then .this should not be reason enough for a 7 yr relationship to end or a husband to give up on his brand new marriage.plus anyways i just think thatwas a convenient xcuse for farty brad to chase tarty angie .they shd tatoo </wait.v.2996><wait.v.2997>When our son , Justin , was 9 , he was in a youth theater production of " Snow White , " which had an original script and music. Because a number of younger boys had auditioned for the show , the director created a role entitled , " Lord in Waiting " -- presumably to match the " Ladies in Waiting. " Their cameo song nearly stole the show , as 8 younger boys , sang , " We 're the Lords in Waiting ... When you 're a Lord in waiting , all you have to do ... . is wait. For the ladies in waiting , there is much to be done. Sewing , dancing , studying its lots of fun. But for Lords in waiting , there 's only one thing to be done. Guess ? We wait ! " With looks of enormous boredom , they fully convinced their audience that waiting was not an activity to be enjoyed . </wait.v.2997><wait.v.2998>There is indeed a fear that hath torment , that is cast out entirely by perfect love. But there is a fear that is found in the very heavens. In the song of Moses and the Lamb they sing , " Who shall not fear Thee , O Lord , and glorify Thy name ? " And out of the very throne the voice came , " Praise our God , all ye His servants , and ye that fear Him. " Let us in our waiting ever seek " to fear the glorious and fearful name , THE LORD THY GOD. " The deeper we w bow before His holiness in holy fear and adoring awe , in deep reverence and humble self-abasement , even as the angels veil their faces before the throne , the more will His holiness rest upon us , and the soul be filled to have God reveal Himself; the deeper we enter into the truth " that no flesh glory in His presence , " will it be given us to see His glory.

Those that noticed , the more discerning of them , nodded politely , greeting her on her inspection of the ship and its crew , still somewhat surprised to find her out this late , but having grown used to her nocturnal excursions over the past little while. The bridge was quiet , soft beeps and the soft hum of the systems operating at standby , waiting for the alpha shift hours hence and the tasks they would be expected to perform. The beta shift , commanded by Tuvok , looked up at her arrival , but otherwise ignored her. They had little less than half an hour before duty transition to gamma , and with the ship at station-keeping in orbit around a class J planet , there was little they had to do beyond think on what would happen the next day . </wait.v.3003><wait.v.3004>As someone who is not ust a writer but has also lost over 100 pounds , I find myself being asked about motivation to lose the weight all the time ( which works out in the same way as inspiration for writers does ) . And my answer is always he same. Don ' t wait for motivation ! The motivation ( or inspiration , whatever you want to call it ) will come to you AS YOU DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. If I had waited for the motivation to strike , I ' d still be fat . </wait.v.3004><wait.v.3005>Do n't get me wrong , I love to paint !

Abstract Expressionism , line drawing with oil pastel , mixed media on hand-built paper.oh , the diversity of it all.and the more challenging the better ! I love color and I am inspired by the textures , shadows and lightness of reflected color in an incredible room with walls patiently waiting for just the right finish.the icing on the cake. Art Work created specifically for particular spaces is the ultimate in creativity and the height of distinction for those who know what they would like to see , as well as for those who need a little direction . </wait.v.3005><wait.v.3006>The entire creation is frustrated , says the apostle.

There were four people in front of me at the time , and I only had to wait about 40 minutes.

Xena did a flip over the line and walked a dozen yards down the slope to better observe the enemy. After a few moments Odyseus joined her , then Ephiny. They had to sqiunt against the late afternoon dazzle of the sun. It hung low and had turned into a fiery orange ball on the horizon. They could see Varrus again on his warhorse pointing and gesturing with his sword. The withdrawing Phalanx split in two and started marching north and south. As it did another waiting line of pikemen was revealed. Two unbloodied phalanxs of Carthaginian veterans and the best of the mercenary phalanx 's reformed for another attack. Seventeen hundred men ready for a final assault . </wait.v.3008><wait.v.3009>I am not referring to situations that we have the responsibility to change , but rather those over which we have no control. In those tough circumstances , we still need to wait actively , not passively. In our actions , we should trust in the Lord and do good , delight ourselves in Him , commit ourselves to Him , be still and wait patiently for Him ( Ps 37 : 3-8 ) and trust in His Word ( Ps 130 : 5 &amp;6 ) . </wait.v.3009><wait.v.3010>Elizabeth , for instance; she had been childless for two decades.

And while the economy sucks for everybody , private school does not strike me as an absolute 100 " this must be saved at all costs , even at the expense of the marriage " thing here. It 's something that can be cut from the budget come fall 2009. I do n't think this situation can wait X number of years , continuing as it is. I 'd say keep the kids in till the end of the school year , but after that , it 's time for Joe Public School and Mommy and Daddy working on their marriage during Daddy 's new free time . </wait.v.3011><wait.v.3012>I think that long distance relationships are hard , but they are workable. Why would she NOT wait for him ? I 'm confused. I guess if he 's going to go " find himself " ( whatever the heck that means ) , I suppose that there 's nothing she can do. But if they 're just considering a break because he 's joined the military , that 's kind of silly. My husband and I do n't " take a break " every time he 's gone . </wait.v.3012><wait.v.3013>Even as we wait on Him , let 's be energized by the eager anticipation of what He will do. Every encounter with Him can be an empowering moment. The fulfillment of His promises always means something good even if -- like those gathered in the Upper Room -- we do n't know all the details about what is coming. We can be assured , however , that it will be worth waiting for . </wait.v.3013><wait.v.3014>Hi Andy and Susan.

Life has been one rehearsal after another , and most nights I come home staggering to my bed. My Superman has been so wonderfully patient , sending and picking me up every single night , most nights waiting for 15 minutes or more in the car before I 'm done. My spine is still straight because of him ! Otherwise I think I 'd be bent over with all the work , pressure and stress . </wait.v.3018><wait.v.3019>Overall , we were waiting in vain , it turned out to find the " thread " of the program , its truth , its reality , its ground. Most of all , there was the waiting that is the heart of meditation : following the breath and waiting. Waiting for what ? Just waiting , waiting without end , as a way of being . </wait.v.3019><wait.v.3020>tonight , Old Christmas , the twelfth day in the ancient festival , is the end of it all. the orange glow of electric pillar candles will disappear from the windows of the city tomorrow; the neighbour ' s spruce will no longer cast a pall of sparkling blue on the snow by our driveway. the strings of outdoor lights , unplugged , will mostly hang around ' til spring , increasingly unseasonal decorative accents waiting patiently for their owners to drag them from the meltwater and retire them in favour of lawnmowers. but after tonight , few will shine . </wait.v.3020><wait.v.3021>First , the disciples held on to the memory of Jesus ' presence with them by remaining together as a community of faith. They remembered who they were , and to whom they belonged. They remembered what they had experienced with Jesus , and what that meant to all of them. This was not an individual affair , but an event shared in common. By their actions , they demonstrated that they cared passionately about their mutual life. They waited together. The disciples did not take these relationships within the faith community for granted. Each one of the disciples is listed by name , and women are acknowledged as being among the those who were there -- reminding us that each one mattered -- that every follower was valued. We are those who have been claimed by God through Jesus Christ. We are loved. Even when we mess up -- and surely we all do -- we are loved. Even , perhaps especially , when our own resources are inadequate , we are deeply and profoundly loved. Like the disciples we need to remember to whom we belong and that we are in this together . </wait.v.3021><wait.v.3022>Perhaps those waiting in court could read The Apprentice by Lewis Libby ( Amazon.com Sales Rank : 411 , 682 ) and underline the dirty parts . </wait.v.3022><wait.v.3023>The cruise , four nights to the Bahamas , gave us lots of time to visit and relax. It also presented Charlie with numerous opportunities to meet the Disney characters , many of whom were utterly foreign to him but no less beloved for it.

I got all the acheivvement points and stuff to see if it unlocked the beta early , but nothing fine , I said , I 'll get my munny 's worth later. I 'll wait until the " official " launch date , whateva. So I waited. Like , a lot. I bought an xtra X-box 360 ( an ELITE , which is awesome BTW ) just in case I got red-ringed before the beta. I took the whole week off work so I could play it without being interrupted and I told my mom to leave me alone. I did all of that , and what do you give me ? nothing . </wait.v.3024><wait.v.3025>I can wait til IE7 becomes main streem and i will be watching my site statistice closely the monts folowing the release. I hope that future update that adresses major updates for css suppor will all be distributed threw critical updates . </wait.v.3025><wait.v.3026>But we also know from scripture that God is a God of wait. David said " I waited patiently for the Lord , and He inclined to me , and heard my cry " ( Psalm 40 : 1a ) . The prophet Isaiah penned " ... they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. . . " ( Isaiah 40 : 31a ) . The Psalmist teaches us to wait on the Lord , and be of good courage; He shall strengthen thine heart ( Psalm 27 : 14 ) . I noticed in each of these passages that God either did , or promised to do , something in response to our waiting. To me , that 's good news because that tells me that my waiting period is never in vain if I trust Him. It is always good to read the whole verse , rather than just a portion of it; and then not too fast because you might run over something . </wait.v.3026><wait.v.3027>But for the difficult and dreadful terrain the Psalmist walked through , he would not have given us so many priceless Psalms. The call to wait on God is not so loud and repetitious in any other book of the Bible. Take for example Psalm 27 : 14 , " Wait on the Lord; be of good courage and He shall strengthen your heart; Wait , I say , on the Lord ! " David confessed that he would have lost heart if he had not waited on God in faith ( v13 ) . </wait.v.3027><wait.v.3028>Ororo was pushed to join the gaggle of unmarried women waiting for Kitty to throw her bridal bouquet , but like Teri Lieberman she tried to find a place out of the way. She need not have worried.

If you 're having teething issues with Tiger , you might wait for the 10.4.2 update ( rumored to be imminent , and the installation of which will ruin my ever-ascendiing uptime ... grr ) , or go for the clean install.

We humbly beseech Thee , Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed; no , not one. Some are weary , and the time of waiting appears long. And some are feeble , and scarcely know how to wait. And some are so entangled in the effort of their prayers and their work , they think that they can find no time to wait continually. Father , teach us all how to wait. Teach us to think of each other , and pray for each other. Teach us to think of Thee , the God of all waiting ones. Father ! Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed. For Jesus sake. Amen . </wait.v.3033><wait.v.3034>First let me say my week had been so stressfull that I had waited till the last minute to clean house. Molly was not feeling all that well so I did not get much sleep. I got up early that Sat and began cleaning. I did not stop ! I think the first time I sat down was around 6 : 00 . </wait.v.3034><wait.v.3035>My parents had always waited until the second week of December to get our tree. I remember that to be the official start of the holidays for us. After waiting until well after most of our friends had their trees , we would head on over to the nearest tree farm and begin the selection process that would take 4 days it seemed . </wait.v.3035><wait.v.3036>I 'm okay with line-ups , as a rule. But then there are things that happen that I just do n't get like the man who came into the walk-in clinic about half an hour after me , and who was told by the receptionist , " I can take you right away , if you 'll follow me. " And you start wondering if there are some magic words , or maybe even a secret code that lets some people jump the queue and go right to the front of the line. Or there was the time at the pharmacy , when I was waiting ten minutes to speak to the pharmacist , who was very busy that day , with a long line-up of clients , and yet he was taking his time to make sure each of his clients was well-informed about doses and side-effects and all. And I was finally first in line , after politely and patiently waiting my turn , when the assistant said to the pharmacist , " The antibiotic ( that was me ) is next in line , but this woman ( pointing to someone who had just turned up ) does n't want to wait. " And so he served her first . </wait.v.3036><wait.v.3037>One of the toughest disciplines in our walk with God is the discipline of waiting. Our culture works against this discipline with its 'have it now ' mindset. Call it instant jello pudding , yet one still must wait for it to form . </wait.v.3037><wait.v.3038>The trouble is that as a spiritual person , I am challenged in my waiting times to see the purpose in these moments and of course , there is purpose , meaning in the delays the simplest example I can give happened recently. The traffic was very bad for a good part of my trip to Toronto . Despite leaving early , I knew that I would be late for my first appointment. Time after time , I 'd just get moving on the highway when the traffic would stop and I 'd be waiting again to make matters worse , I 'd forgotten to charge my cell , so I could n't call the client to let him know. Instead , I prayed and meditated , kept breathing into my frustration and finally arrived , 20 minutes late only to find that my first client was himself delayed and my entire schedule had to be reworked to accommodate him ... and of course , as usually happens , the changes proved to be to my advantage . </wait.v.3038><wait.v.3039>Waiting in our society is a bad word. It projects images of frustration , being stuck , disgust , complaining , impatience , boredom , anger and hopelessness. We have seen people pacing , despairing , cursing , loudly complaining , even being enraged and abusive while waiting. We live in an age of instant everything. We are an impulsive , restless and at times a demanding people. We have automated tellers because we don ' t want to wait in line at the bank; microwave ovens so we don ' t have to wait for food to cook; self check outs so we don ' t have to wait in line at the grocery store; e-z pass for the roadway , and instant access to information and communication all over the world with the click of a mouse. We want things quick and easy. So for us waiting is pass , but not so with God . </wait.v.3039><wait.v.3040>I guess I want it all I hate waiting too long between releases , but on the other hand , I ' m disappointed if it seems like the quality of the writing/editing suffers because the writer ' s under too much pressure to crank out the next title. I LOVE when the publishers release a trilogy three months in a row. I can see needing more time after that to get the next book in the channel ! </wait.v.3040><wait.v.3041>I waited a few days and got a call back for a second interview. I didn ' t even know people do second interviews. But oh well it works for me. I told some people at work about it. They are upset that I might leave. The managers don ' t know. I don ' t feel like telling them till I decide. Then it will be their problem. So I am back at the place for my second interview. It goes over well for the most part. They can ' t pay me what they said they could. They said I need a little more experience and time before they can review me and maybe , maybe being his keyword. Maybe , give me a raise to what they originally offered . </wait.v.3041><wait.v.3042>i was seduced by the subject position , by the strange , sheer power of being tested. sitting in that Star Trek chair , i felt like a mystery waiting to be solved : a terribly interesting problem waiting to be identified. i liked feeling terribly interesting. was the red side of the square the machines projected clearer , or the green ? for me , one was brighter , the other crisper : i couldn ' t figure out what clearer meant. so i made it up as i went along. i felt obliged to be somehow worthy of the visit . </wait.v.3042><wait.v.3043>This is the best explanation of the Second Coming I have ever heard. I mean , I 'm willing to believe that Christ will come again as in a sort of Cecil B. DeMille epic in the full splendor of IMAX some day. But I 've never marked the date on a calendar , and I 'm not moving to Waco or some remote mountaintop to wait for Him. Too busy today , sorry. But to remove all obstacles to his presence so that he may dwell spiritually in our hearts ? I 'll do my best . </wait.v.3043><wait.v.3044>We trailed the feeder Lambs again today. This time to new Alfalfa pasture along the state-line road. There was a bit of traffic but I think most people did n't mind waiting for us. It was Katie/Zack , Guillermo/Dos and me/Mick. Katie really wanted to do the trailing so I spent most of the time in the SUV with Ethan. We followed along with our flashers on listening to the radio. Mick was not happy at all. He had to sit in the back and watch the other dogs make mistakes and take his job. I got him out a couple of times to help things when they were getting out of control. But , for the most part Katie and Guillermo did it all. It was a short 2.5 mile trail. They did it without getting into the plowed fields and off the road too much. I was very proud . </wait.v.3044><wait.v.3045>The waiting rooms filled with sick people , the " this wo n't hurt a bit " , the " the doctor will be right with you " followed by 90 minutes of boredum , the needle sticks , the smells and taste of medicines , the going home , feeling sicker and sicker for a week. All of it makes me so tired , I 'm sick of it. I 've had enough. If there was hope for a cure , I would say " OK " , but they tell me that the best I can hope for is this , for the rest of my life. If the treatment " works " , I 'll live another year , if not , another 9 months. ( Those are my guesses ) . I 'm thinking 9 months may be the way to go . . . I just hope I can be comfortable . </wait.v.3045><wait.v.3046>When Jones died , it was like someone took the sunshine away from our house. The yard was so strange and empty , and way too quiet.

But there is a hell , I have been there , I have conversed with the devil , why then does one exist but not the other. I do not know the answer to that question. I have looked back on my little slut , she is starting to clean herself up a litlle , she is still the closet I have been to living again. My mind is becoming a burden I want to leave it behind , but if I do will I lose everything that I am or was , I do not know. I want to be alive in your world because of what I know now , I would live my life to become a better person then I was . </wait.v.3047><wait.v.3048>As far as I can remember , airports have always been boring.

As we read this Psalm , and learn to look upon all life in Nature as continually maintained by God Himself , waiting on God will be seen to be the very necessity of our being. As we think of the young lions and the ravens crying to Him , of the birds and the fishes and every insect waiting on Him , till He give them their meat in due season , we shall see that it is the very nature and glory of God that He is a God who is to be waited on.

The deeper the darkness , the greater the need of appealing to the one only Deliverer.

I have spent several times recently in a hospital setting waiting area with my friend who was recently diagnosed with cancer for the third time. As we sit and wait in the waiting rooms of various departments we have met so many wonderful people. My friend says I attract them but I say it is her but in reality we know it is God who connects us all. Just last week , in a strange city to us , we began talking with a husband and wife. The husband was having the same tests as my friend. We began to talk and then someone else overheard the conversation and joined in and then another man joined in. God connects us all and we believe truly sends angels to us when we least expect them and most need them. May your path be richly blessed with the amazing way that God brings angels into your presence. Be always open to receive His presence no matter how it may be presented . </wait.v.3130><wait.v.3131>I keep waiting to hear concrete answers to precisely those questions from SSM opponents.

He is love an unceasing and inexpressible desire to communicate His own goodness and blessedness to all His creatures. He longs and delights to bless. He has inconceivably glorious purposes concerning every one of His children , by the power of His Holy Spirit , to reveal in them His love and power. He waits with all the longings of a father 's heart. He waits that He may be gracious unto you. And , each time you come to wait upon Him , or seek to maintain in daily life the holy habit of waiting , you may look up and see Him ready to meet you. He will be waiting so that He may be gracious unto you. Yes , connect every exercise , every breath of the life of waiting , with faith 's vision of your God waiting for you . </wait.v.3132><wait.v.3133>Yet , the acknowledgement process is broken and has been since it was established in 1978. Tribes routinely wait decades without getting a decision. Some tribes , including one tribe which will present testimony at the hearing , have been stuck in the federal acknowledgment process since 1978 with no decision. The prolonged process cost tribes funds urgently needed elsewhere , and denies tribes that are eventually recognized access to benefits and programs , often for decades . </wait.v.3133><wait.v.3134>I lost my virginity when I was a Sophomore in college. I always wanted to wait until I was married , but I became so curious because the friends I hung around with were constantly talking about sex. And the next morning after it happened , I felt sooooooooo bad. See , when you are saved and you really love God , and you try to do what everyone is doing , you do n't even get to enjoy it like others do. So I repented and I told God I would wait till I got married. Thank God He is faithful when we are not , because a few years later I fell in love with a young man that I just 'knew ' was my husband. However , our relationship was rocky , and during a rocky time when we should have just broke up , I went back on my promise to God and had sex. Long story short , I got pregnant. Then all of a sudden , it finally hit me like a ton of bricks : all this time I thought God was trying to constrain me , and He was only trying to protect me. If He says not to do something , it is always for our </wait.v.3134><wait.v.3135>Shall I be clearer ? If I look for Christ in every person I meet , eventually I will see Christ. If I look for God working a plan out among the people of First Baptist , eventually I will see God 's movement.

We stand by him in his waiting. The book of Hebrews tells us that after Jesus Christ had offered up himself for us , he sat down at the right hand of God , and since then has been waiting until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. </wait.v.3136><wait.v.3137>So here I am at the famous Brixton Academy , site of so many fabled shows. It ' s a fine venue , rather like the Glasgow Academy. But I ' ve been spoiled , I ' m afraid - this audience is definitely rougher and rowdier than Glasgow , lots more shoving and pushing. And where in Glasgow the security staff nicely passed out cups of cold water to the folks in the front , here the Brixton crew offers squirts from sports bottles ! But even so , it ' s a far cry from the states , where it often feels as if the security staff is there to thwart your good time rather than aid it. We ' re waiting for the band and enjoying the brilliant work of DJ Scratchy , who goes back to the early days of punk , and who I ' m pretty sure I heard DJing at my first Clash gig. In Glasgow , he knocked me out when he played The Bureau ' s Only for Sheep , and tonight he does it again - Roadrunner from the Modern Lovers , Dexys ' cover of the Bar-Kays ' Soulfinger ( must have been for our so-named Medusan ! ) , and lots of great reggae. I ' m actually disappointed when he cuts off Madness , then quickly realize he ' s playing Straight to Hell .

There was apparently some kind of agreement in place , as a circle of men -- mostly human , though one Wookiee stood sentry -- was waiting for them to disembark.

While waiting for our appetizers , I pulled the iPhone out to snap a few pictures and take a look at it. Here I noticed that the protective plastic covering was n't on properly. The back seemed creased , the tab looked like it have been pulled away , and on closer inspection , there was a chunk of foreign material in the camera lens. I had n't even turned the thing on , and already my iPhone bliss had been spoiled again ! </wait.v.3145><wait.v.3146>The sad news is that Steve and Sophie are not with us. We finally had a glitch in our adoption and it was a doozie. Our courier who was returning to Vlad with Sophie ' s Passport , Visa , and all other of her important original documents , got delayed when her plane had a mechanical problem. In the end , the courier flight , which was due in at 11 : 00 am from Moscow , was 4 hours delayed and didn ' t come in until 3 : 00 pm. Our flight out of Vlad was scheduled to depart right at 3 : 00 pm and they would not budge as far as waiting for the other flight for our sakes. We had decided earlier in the day that Steve would stay with Sophie and bring her home in the event that this happened. We were sad that it ended up actually happening , but we are trusting that God has some purpose in it or that He will somehow use it for His glory. Still , it was so hard to be sitting on the plane and see the Moscow plane pull in while we ' re on the tarmac and know that the documents we so desperately needed were on that plane just meters away . </wait.v.3146><wait.v.3147> I was watching the world news tonight , and the headlines are still of Haiti , showing tragic images of people crying for the loss of their family , or digging out the bodies of their dead children , or camped out in a park because their home was destroyed. I was so discouraged I decided to go for a walk , and ended up in the most hopeful place you can imagine , in the hospital ! Here people are patiently waiting to receive care , or have gone through surgery and have started the recovery process. Here I see lives that were physically compromised , but are being restored. Here I see hope ! I pray Haiti will no longer be spiritually compromised , but will find Hope in Jesus Christ.

For each missing person there is not only one person suffering but there are whole families who wait for information or the return of their loved ones. With the daily violence currently inflicted on the lives of Iraqis , tens of bodies are found every day , while countless persons go missing. While some of the bodies found can be identified , others cannot. According to official sources in Iraq , from 2006 until June 2007 some 20 , 000 bodies were brought to the Medical-Legal Institute in Baghdad ( MLI ) . Almost 50 per cent of these bodies were unidentified and brought to morgues throughout the country. When unclaimed , they were buried in cemeteries. Since 2003 , according to some sources , 4 , 000 unidentified bodies have been buried in special cemeteries in Najaf and Kerbala . </wait.v.3149><wait.v.3150>Like a number of others , I was looking for some relief from this numbness mixed with pain that is life and I came across this site. Depression runs in my family and my paternal grandmother spent her whole life waiting to die. I never wanted to turn out like her , but I have. At 26 , I feel like my life has no meaning to anyone ( including me ) and I no longer see the point of a long life. Living to a ripe old age means many more years of numbness and loneliness and pain and I don ' t wish for it. But , I don ' t think I ' m suicidal if that makes any sense. I wish there was some non-medical cure for this , but I ' ve given up hope. I hold down a job , but on my days off I often can ' t bring myself to leave the house and face the world. There seems to be a whole world out there , but not one that needs me in it. I don ' t want to be medicated and I ' m not a fan of mental health professionals.

I first hate myself because although I know she is in need I don ' t do anything. My excuse of course is I ' m depressed. But also I find a parallel with her and myself. It dawned on me she is waiting to die. Then I cry and ask my self WHY AM I WAITING TO DIE ? That is how I feel about my life. Like I am wasting time , being depressed and sleeping and doing nothing. Like for example instead of feeling like shit and doing nothing in my room , wasting time , I could be out doing something living , hanging out with people. That ' s another thing. I have no friends.

He thought he heard the door squeaking and so , when drying himself , called out , Nava ? Is that you ? But there was no response. He put on clean underwear and a pair of khakis and left the bathroom , searched the kitchen , went to the living room and checked the easy chairs facing the TV , then walked into the bedroom and out onto the enclosed terrace that Nava used as her creative studio. She would shut herself in on the terrace for long hours , sculpting figurines in clay , fantasy creatures as well as tiny busts of boxers with square jaws and sometimes broken noses. The kiln was in a shed in their back yard. So Benny walked to the shed and turned on the light and stood there for a moment , blinking , but all he could see were the disfigured figurines and the cool kiln , surrounded by dark shadows , which also covered the dusty shelves . </wait.v.3161><wait.v.3162>Of course , the geek will have his day , and he finally gets up the nerve to talk to Alexis the very same day that Gink sets his evil plan in motion.

Hezekiah was humble and accepted the situation from God saying , ... but what can I say ? He has spoken to me and he himself has done this. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of soul. Lord , by such things men live; and my spirit finds life in them too surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish.

An honest smile peeled across his thick black lips , searing into his clean white visage like a dark fissure. His big head bobbed in a friendly nod , and Rhett moved to sit right next to Drake. He still sensed that uneasy nervousness that had plagued the friendly male from their first encounter. It would pass , Rhett was sure. In fact , if nothing else , Drake 's temporary nervousness was merely born from his need to be valuable to Auvrea , a desire to fit in. Rhett only hoped after this first meeting , the new male would find himself far more confident. Again , nothing was spoken , but those mint green eyes conveyed the friendly nature of his approach. Sitting side by side with Drake , he patiently waited for the others to file in and for the meeting to commence. He could taste the intensity in the air , and curiously wondered of its concern and severity. Though if the young male was worried , he did not show it . </wait.v.3268><wait.v.3269>Um , ew ?

The waiting on God for His presence and power in daily life will be the only true preparation for waiting for Christ in humility and true holiness. The waiting for Christ coming from heaven to take us to heaven will give the waiting on God its true tone of hopefulness and joy. The Father , who , in His own time , will reveal His Son from heaven , is the God who , as we wait on Him , prepares us for the revelation of His Son. The present life and the coming glory are inseparably connected in God and in us . </wait.v.3276><wait.v.3277>It must also be clear to us , on Whom we are waiting. Not an idol , a God of whom we have made an image by our conceptions of what He is. No , but the living God , such as He really is in His great glory , His infinite holiness , His power , wisdom , and goodness , in His love and nearness. It is the presence of a beloved or a dreaded master that wakens up the whole attention of the servant who waits on him. It is the presence of God , as He can in Christ by His Holy Spirit make Himself known , and keep the soul under its covering and shadow , that will waken and strengthen the true waiting spirit. Let us be still and wait and worship till we know how near He is , and then say , " On Thee do I wait.

Apparently her original approach was n't quite doing the trick , but then again neither had Xena 's fancier style. Right , time to try something a little different. Instead of aiming for the base of his shaft , she concentrated on its head. She ran her tongue around the tip , keeping her strokes light at first , then intensifying them into tight little circles. Joxer 's entire body had stiffened and he trembled from head to foot. He was so close , she could almost feel the orgasm waiting to happen , that was when Xena rather maliciously cooed , " Time.

The problem is , both kids and moose are somewhat unpredictable. Young kids will take their cues from adults; if you take chances , they might also. Keep kids away from moose. If a moose is hanging out at a school bus stop , ask the driver if he or she can pick up the kids one or two blocks away along the route. Establish a parent patrol to wait at the bus stop with the kids ( more to control the kids than the moose ) . If your kids walk to school , show them another route to walk if they see a moose on their normal route. If you know a moose is in your neighborhood , kids should probably avoid walking on long paths through the woods where it is dark and there is no easy escape if a moose runs down the path.

As the familiar commercial might remind us , we are in good hands when we are in God ' s caring , powerful , wise , and loving hands.

Because very many Christians have no sense of the great difference between the religion of the mind and the religion of the heart , and the former is far more diligently cultivated than the latter. They know not how infinitely greater the heart is than the mind.

Giving a seperate Pro reservation day would not work unless they adjusted to where pro registration was done well before the TP site went live.

God alone can work out His will in you. You can not work out God 's will , but His Holy Spirit can; and until the Church , until believers grasp this , and cease trying by human effort to do God 's will , and wait upon the Holy Spirit to come with all His omnipotent and enabling power , the Church will never be what God wants her to be , and what God is willing to make of her . </wait.v.3328><wait.v.3329>Hi everyone this is me Fiona I just wanted to let everyone know that I am doing very well and just patiently waiting for a forever home.

Consider : 5 issues at $ 2.99 is $ 15.00. Most trades now collect five books. For about $ 12.99 to $ 14.99. So you save as much as $ 2.00 to as little as a penny. And you have to wait five to six months for that privilege. Not worth it. The equation tips the other way in the case of a hardback where the cover price is higher than the individual issues , and even more so for a prestige edition . </wait.v.3330><wait.v.3331>Psalm 40 : 1-12 For the choir director. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; And He inclined to me , and heard my cry. 2 He brought me up out of the pit of destruction , out of the miry clay; And He set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm. 3 And He put a new song in my mouth , a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear , And will trust in the LORD. 4 How blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust , And has not turned to the proud , nor to those who lapse into falsehood . </wait.v.3331><wait.v.3332>And then , let it be very clear , too , that we are waiting. Let that become so much our consciousness that the utterance comes spontaneously , " On Thee I do wait all the day; I wait on Thee. " This will indeed imply sacrifice and separation , a soul entirely given up to God as its all , its only joy. This waiting on God has hardly yet been acknowledged as the only true Christianity. And yet , if it be true that God alone is goodness and joy and love; if it be true that our highest blessedness is in having as much of God as we can; if it be true that Christ has redeemed us wholly for God , and made a life of continual abiding in His presence possible , nothing less ought to satisfy than to be ever breathing this blessed atmosphere , " I wait on Thee.

We have never to wait until he is ready , but he has often to wait until we are. He waits for us long , and therefore we must not be surprised if sometimes he makes us wait. But the longer we wait for the blessing , the sweeter and richer will it be when it comes. As the Lord is even now waiting for the fittest time to bless us , confer his favors on us , or deliver us , it is but right and reasonable that we should wait on him , and wait for him . </wait.v.3335><wait.v.3336>( 10 ) Finally , be assured that God always makes it worth the wait. If you want to eat in a hurry , you can drive through McDonald 's and buy a Happy Meal. But if you want a gourmet meal , you know you will have to wait a while. That is because great meals do n't happen quickly , or easily , no matter what the TV commercials tell you. I have never once seen or heard of anyone putting food into a microwave oven because they thought that it would be tastier than something which comes out of the oven , or a crock pot. We make use of the microwave oven because we want to eat , fast. We use the oven when we want to eat well. God 's plans and promises are not of the microwave variety. God slow cooks His plans and His people , to bring out the very best in them. You can almost always plan on the fact that God will make you wait for what is best. He is never late , but He is also seldom quick. But of this fact I can assure you : When God 's plan is for you to wait , He will make it all worth the wait . </wait.v.3336><wait.v.3337>Have you ever wished for a dog that was already trained and needed a good home ?

Downey 's accent was fine. And as you can see above , this version is far closer to Doyle 's work than many acclaimed Sherlock Holmes adaptations of the past. The " mystery " ( if that 's what you meant by plot ) is indeed transparent to one of our age , but to his it would not be. The point of this movie was to re-introduce us to the characters and their world , to Holmes ' methodology , to Holmes ' and Watson 's relationship ( the best part of the movie ) , and to , of course , set up for future movies. Was it a good mystery ? Nope. But the characters were the real point of this movie , and they were fantastic ( except for Irene Adler , for aforementioned reasons ...

" It is good that a man . . . quietly wait. " Take time to be separate from all friends and all duties , all cares and all joys; time to be still and quiet before God. Take time not only to secure stillness from man and the world , but from self and its energy. Let the Word and prayer be very precious. But remember , even these may hinder the quiet waiting. The activity of the mind in studying the Word or giving expression to its thoughts in prayer , the activities of the heart , with its desires and hopes and fears , may so engage us that we do not come to the still waiting on the All-glorious One; our whole being is prostrate in silence before Him . </wait.v.3348><wait.v.3349>She had thought it might have been advisable to ask the coachman to wait; she did not know in what sort of environs three young gentlemen might find lodgings.

It 's something that we all have to learn to deal with on a regular basis. With our new " instant " messaging -- e-mails , chats , twittering , we hope that everyone will be available when we need them. When we have an urgent e-mail ( and what we define as urgent is always up for examination ) , we hope that our e-mail recipient is on-line at that moment , ready with an answer. It 's as if the world is just waiting for us and our questions. When we are under a good deal of stress due to time pressures ( which are almost unrealistic on occasion ) or personal issues , it is easy to get frustrated . </wait.v.3350><wait.v.3351>Waiting always seems like such a waste of my time I can think of so many other things I could be doing or how the wait is delaying other plans. If there is nothing to read , I usually try to distract myself with prayers , or working through some problem , or fleshing out a new plan sometimes I like waiting , it is useful. Being between appointments can be a chance to meditate and clear , to take a walk in an interesting neighbourhood on a beautiful day , or to grab a bite to eat at a neat ethnic restaurant but most often waiting tries my patience waiting , under almost any circumstances is very hard on me . </wait.v.3351><wait.v.3352>I hate to say it , but I ' m willing to wait and let you guys do your work It looks so great so far , and you ' ve done such great things in just your spare time The only bad thing about the waiting is that a friend of mine got her invite a while ago , and has been testing for you guys , as she tells me all the great stuff that ' s going on , it makes me seethe with jealousy ! *huge grin* </wait.v.3352><wait.v.3353>The stringing of the lights was another elusive and time-consuming process of the tree trimming ceremony.

They said that since he was only 25 years old and seemed healthy that it was n't a heart attack but a virus that had similar symptoms to a heart attack. They told him to wait in the ER waiting room which he did for FIVE HOURS before they called him in to examine him. Sure enough that is when they realized that he DID have a heart attack. What ever happened to when someone is complaining of chest pains - no matter age , race , etc - they are considered a high priority ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Being the mother of a 16-month-old , I don ' t have time to be sick or under the weather. Shara told me there wasn ' t a wait , and I told her I ' d be there in 5 minutes ( I was right up the road ) . I did wait about 20 minutes for her to take care of another patient. In the meantime , I called the hot-line and gave the lady on the phone all of my info. So my chart was ready when I was called. All Shara had to do was ask me a few questions and fill out the rest of my chart and take a look at me. This was quick , painless and my prescription was filled right there at Weis afterwards. I would definitely go there again. ( 1/26/10 ) </wait.v.3391><wait.v.3392>Marriage truly is an example of Jesus and the Church.

With few exceptions , there are no rigorous rules governing who belongs on a list and who does not. Data from the United Kingdom and New Zealand in particular reveal that failure to audit and update lists can lead to significant inflation , with overcounting of patients commonly at 30 8-10 and sometimes as high as 70 .11 Despite the heated rhetoric about long and growing lists , we were unable to find even one publicly available report of an independent waiting-list audit in Canada . </wait.v.3403><wait.v.3404>More and more , I ' m waiting for the trades Sometimes it ' s because I ' m joining a book late ( Whedon ' s Astonishing X-Men run , and Vaughan ' s Y and Ex Machina both ) , but now it ' s more a case of dropping stuff and waiting to see if the story is really any decent or not.

I think that people have Kate in a catch 22 position. They expect her to do great things. Meanwhile that same population of people would say how dare she get involved in doing things designated for the royals. There you have her problen.

When we wait on Him , the spiritual powers overrule our natural abilities. This is the meaning of the famous passage in Isaiah 40 : 29-31 , " God gives power to the weak , and to those who have no might He increases strength. Even the youths shall faint and become tired , and the young men shall utterly fall. But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not grow weary; they shall walk and not faint !

There was a panel of buttons I could ring to the individual apartments , but I was not sure of the number; all I had written down was 6-9.

I remember Rush one day on the radio swearing up and down he was converting to a liberal ( a similar show was done by his shadow Hannity , or as I like to call him 'repeat ' ); of course , and thank God , it was all a prank.

Then one day I read that Psalm again and realized I had missed a key point. I was waiting , and I was praising and serving Him while waiting , but I was not waiting patiently.

One ladie even told me I was exactly what she needed that day ''an angle with a message'' she said , she was questioning completing her treatment because of the side effects , she was on the exact treatment I was.

In 1997 we had been trying to have children for several years when we decided that was enough and found CCAI. We met Joshua and Lily and knew we were in the right place. So by early 1998 we had sent our dossier off to China and had begun the long wait. It was early in the year when we found out that we were indeed pregnant and were due in September. The words still ring in my ears when my husband realized our situation and said Ah , I guess we will have twins ! That was what I had hoped to hear and the wait then became for TWO.

To her , ten minutes was so short a time that I had no right to complain. This incident left me with a very bad image of that bank.

It is inescapable because as human beings we love and we don ' t know the future. For consider : If we loved nothing an no one , not even ourselves , we wouldn ' t care about what comes next , so there would be nothing to wait for. And neither do we know what comes next. I can ' t imagine what it would be like to know my personal future in detail. But I am sure that if I did , waiting would be a very different experience , if it existed at all. These two basic truths about us as human beings , that we love , and that we don ' t know the future , make it inevitable that we will find ourselves waiting. Caring about but not knowing what comes next , we fear the worst and hope for the best.

Parmesan cheese is an example of hard cheese. Romano29 and Swiss cheese may sometimes be a hard cheese. American , Muenster , and Mozzarella are not hard cheeses , 30 nor are cottage cheese and cream cheese. If a hard cheese is cooked it does not lose its status as a hard cheese.

The other lion- a full-grown male- was some two paces behind her. At this second he got his forepaws onto the bank , when a strange thing happened.

Stop the complaining , stop the wrestling , stop the fighting , stop the inner churning and wait and see what God says to you about what you are facing . </wait.v.3601><wait.v.3602>So let me get this straight , McCain lost because he tried to shove SHAMNESTY down our throats and dems &amp;reps both rose up and defeated him. I ' ll let you in on a little secret : Hispanics are PEOPLE ! ! ! Some are liberal , some are conservative , and some are mushy moderates that haven ' t picked a side. Most of them obeyed the law , waited in line , and were told by McLame : Boy were you suckers ! Amnesty for everyone. </wait.v.3602><wait.v.3603>Donnie , I am still so excited that you guys finally got together again. I have always played your Cd ' s over the years.My sis and I never got to see you guys when we were little , now that we are grown , we can buy our own tix. And , we passed your music down to our own children. You were AWESOME in CLEVELAND ! ! ! We had T-shirts made for the concert.Can ' t wait to see you in Columbus in April. Love ya guys , ya ' ll Rock ! NKOTB 4 LYFE ! ! ! </wait.v.3603><wait.v.3604>Thanks for keeping in touch. My Omar is still the Best Boy in the World ! He still has not learned to play nice and probably never will. He is so much fun and he loves to please and play. He tries to go everywhere with you and he sure knows when we point to the house for him to go wait on the porch. I try to walk everyday - a miles and 3/4 and he patiently sits and watches me from the house. He knows he is not allowed to leave the yard and follow me. When I get to the end of the lane , he waits until I call him. We inherited 2 cats about 6 months old and he sure wanted lunch for the first 2 weeks but now they are inseparable. If only he had another dog to learn to play nice with. Just thought I would let you know how things were going and how much we love Omar ! I would have loved another Champion in the house on paper but in our hearts he is our Champion ! I would still like a girl again so you never know ... .. </wait.v.3604><wait.v.3605>Good afternoon family ! ! ! Love those dimples. She is soo cute. Ca n't wait to kiss those chicks in person.

This living , mighty God , oh , let us fear Him and hope in His mercy. And let us humbly but boldly say , " Our soul waiteth for the Lord; He is our help and our shield. Let Thy mercy be upon us , O Lord , according as we wait for Thee. " </wait.v.3608><wait.v.3609>Dear J. , thank you very much for your kind words. Looking at this swing I just wished to have my small son with me , but he was waiting home for me to end lessons on that day. Looking at doors , I do love to open them up and take a look inside.

Never have I seen a happier or more deserving Mommy and Daddy ! It has been a long journey for all of us waiting for just this moment and the rest of your lives together.

Congratulations Reynon Family ! ! Your friend at FTB , Mary ( Honorary Auntie ? ) </wait.v.3612><wait.v.3613>But we never have to resist them alone. Even now our Lord is at work , resisting those enemies who molest his people. To be sure , even our Lord is waiting for that day when all the enemies of his people are made his footstool. But until that day , he isn ' t waiting around , loitering. On our behalf he resists those enemies he has already defeated , waiting for that day when defeated enemies are dispersed forever. We genuinely wait for our Lord only as we wait with him as he continues to resist everything that molests his people , and all of this in anticipation of that day when his enemies ( ours too ) have been dispersed . </wait.v.3613><wait.v.3614>The words are nearly the same as in our last meditation. But I gladly avail myself of them again to press home a much-needed lesson for all who desire to learn truly and fully what waiting on God is. The lesson is this : It is with the heart we must wait upon God. " Let your heart take courage " </wait.v.3614><wait.v.3615>Staying in the shadows , Susanna watched , over the next few days , hoping to find the secret of the magically appearing twigs.

Within days , Hsu found an empty storefront in the hub of the city ' s trading activities. It had once been a doctor ' s office , so it was perfect for their needs. It had a large storage space in back , a waiting room and retail store area in front , and a small study off to the left where Lady White could keep her books and talk with customers privately. Lady White took on the decorating , and Hsu went out in search of inventory. By the Mid-Autumn Festival , an OPEN sign was hanging from the front door . </wait.v.3616><wait.v.3617>You are not waiting to die you ' ve just been suckered. If you were , you ' d be dead.

" It is but a rude life that thou must live here , for these people are savages , and know not the ways of cultivated man. Not that I am troubled thereby , for , behold my food , " and she pointed to the fruit upon the little table. " Naught but fruit doth ever pass my lips- fruit and cakes of flour , and a little water. I have bidden my girls to wait upon thee. They are mutes , thou knowest , deaf are they and dumb , and therefore the safest of servants , save to those who can read their faces and their signs. I bred them so- it hath taken many centuries and much trouble; but at last I have triumphed. Once I succeeded before , but the race was too ugly , so I let it die away; but now , as thou seest , they are otherwise. Once , too , I reared a race of giants , but after a while Nature would no more of it , and it died away. Hast thou aught to ask of me ? " </wait.v.3618><wait.v.3619>" Well , she is , rather more than you , come to that , " he said , taking his hat determinedly. " I 've wanted you to be , and I 've waited with the patience of Job , and I do n't see that I 've got anything by my self-denial. I shall certainly give her something , and hear what it is she is so anxious to tell me; no man could do less !

All around me are others also looking for a touch from the gracious hand of God ( because of my state of spirit , I can see them more clearly ) . </wait.v.3620><wait.v.3621>The verb wait is intransitive , although there is an established idiom wait your turn.'' There 's a perfectly serviceable transitive verb await , but with some exceptions ( like await further developments'' ) , it seems to be regarded as stiff or formal. Thus , what would be the direct object of await is normally drafted into a prepositional phrase , to function as an adverbial modifying wait. As recently as the 1990 's , the standard preposition was for. To await clearance was to wait for clearance , for example. One waits for an event , and the object of the preposition for is either the event , or an object ( person or thing ) whose arrival , availability , readiness or whatever is the awaited event . </wait.v.3621><wait.v.3622>If I don ' t get something .well .I have a great deal of TLE yarns stocked.

I rolled by where I thought the plant was supposed to eventually be and there are still no signs of construction. Anyone have an estimate of when ground breaking is expected. I ' m not whining about the development rate or Roadster costs; I think Tesla has the right plan in action. Nothing better than to have those who can , and will , afford it finance the R &amp;D for those of us who cannot.

I am a stay at home Mom too and this is the toughest job I ever loved. I am on call 24/7 , have n't eaten hot food since March 2005 , and have read Goodnight Moon about 5000 times. Plus , since I am home anyway , I cook and clean. And that 's before I hit the sports mom stage where I become uber-chaffeur ( sp ? ) . NEVER imply you do n't have a job again. Casey and I swapped places for one day last year ( long story ) and his first comment was 'I do n't know how you do this every day love'. I 've never seen him so tired.

I work with a lot of first time home buyers and their segment is flooded with properties. The trade-up buyers I am working with have a bit more trouble finding inventory these days especially in the " starter " single family home on the North Side in a quality school neighborhood. The first-time buyers are all looking to take advantage of the $ 8 , 000 tax credit by April 30 so the fire is getting hotter ... The trade-up buyers are more interested in getting their places sold rather than getting excited about the potential $ 6 , 500 credit available to them . </wait.v.3625><wait.v.3626>Imported 500 fake contacts went to the car and it worked but I noticed that the same z-contact was on the screen so the car did not refresh the contact list.

He was walking down the corridor , waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was coming in another moment. Everything was settled , smoothed out , reconciled. There were no more doubts , no more arguments , no more pain , no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily , with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love , he was in the enormous sunlit passage , a kilometre wide , down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the Golden Country , following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees , faintly stirring , and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows . </wait.v.3629><wait.v.3630>Hey I work for At &amp;T; activations myself , well here is the truth the system works by going through a queue and pinging every unactivated phone in turn to activate them. If the system can ' t see your phone , you lose your place in the queue and have to wait for the next time. So keep your Iphone on the dock connected to Itunes so you don ' t have to wait longer. Why some agents are telling you guys/girls somethings is crazy too. If your porting your number over make sure your zip code matches where your phone number came from originally or else there are going to be even more issues , which sucks , but we can also fix that too by changing your address to activate the phone and then change it back after we activate it ! ! !

It ' s not without its compensations : Having waited my entire life to get an award for something , anything ( okay fine , not acting , but what about a tiny award for writing ? Nope ) , I now get awards all the time for being mentally ill. I ' m apparently very good at it and am honored for it regularly . [ I ] t ' s better than being bad at being insane , right ?

But aren ' t we sons and daughters of God by faith now ? To be sure , scripture insists on the distinction between creature of God and child of God. Every human being is a creature of God , made in God ' s image , loved and cherished by him. Children of God , however , are those who have heard and heeded the gospel invitation , and who now cling in faith to the Incarnate One , Jesus Christ , their elder brother. Believing people are God ' s children now. We are born of God and have been granted a new nature from God . </wait.v.3634><wait.v.3635>Principle : Things can not satisfy. Unless we enjoy a vital and dependent relationship with the Lord , we will invariably tire of things and end up in the never ending pursuit of new relationships , better working conditions , new hobbies , greater pleasure , etc. But something will always seem to be missing. We will never truly be happy or content. Why is that ? Because we are looking for the right things but in all the wrong places. Our focus and our basic foundation for life must be anchored in the Lord. While waiting on Him , we need to prayerfully look to Him to lead us and supply our needs and wants in His timing and in the way He deems fit . </wait.v.3635><wait.v.3636>At Disney you are constantly waiting in lines for rides and attractions.

On this last short run across to Formosa I shared a first-class cabin with an old Chinese gentleman dressed in a simple Chinese gown who at first impressed me as a simple , traditional back-country type. To my surprise he turned out to be a rather distinguished old scholar named Chien Mu , later the first president of a new Chinese university in Hong Kong. For reasons unknown to me he was taken up by General Chiang Ching-kuo and after that treated with great distinction , courtesy , and consideration . </wait.v.3639><wait.v.3640>" Well , first I am going to need as much fresh water as you can carry in and set to boil for me.

Here are some suggestions from my experience to help you learn to wait with grace : </wait.v.3642><wait.v.3643>WAITING TABLES IS fascinating. It is also humiliating , demented , menial , haphazard , and exhausting. But , most important , waiting tables is fascinating. Night after night , at table after table , the strengths and frailties of human nature intermingle to create every possible combination of friendship , disaster , and romance. And what better city than San Francisco to take part in such a self-mutilating experience involving so many potential characters : punchy seniors , hokey tourists , sexy couples , families somehow even more bizarre than your own. Just as baby-sitters can not remain wholly indifferent to the antics of the children they watch , so too do servers rarely respond with stoic silence to the various personalities and fiascoes they come to experience in an evening . </wait.v.3643><wait.v.3644>I waited until all the rest of you were done pestering the poor man and then I called him.

If they could manage their pain , they could still be independent and less a drag on all our precious precious tax dollars ! It 's a stone cold b*tch when you have managed to make it into the upper limit of human age by being healthy and then have to surrender your autonomy because you are just in so much frakkin ' pain . </wait.v.3646><wait.v.3647>Deep and almost overwhelming were the trials , distresses , and soul troubles of David , but though his soul was cast down within him , he waited on the Lord , and he has recorded the result " I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me , and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings.

The fan boy treatment of Obama really turns me off. While we waited for the caucus to start we were subjected to a amplified microphone and high school football type chants against the Clinton caucus supporters. Not very dignified , and a real turn off. But yes , I know what you mean about Hillary 's " drone " . And if someone would actually cover Edwards , well , he might actually connect with more voters. I like what he has to say , when you can find video of him or transcripts. If you actually read what the candidates say , instead of watching them , you get very different meanings , Obama 's comes across as good , but well , not special , Clinton is smart , and Edwards actually is something special . </wait.v.3654><wait.v.3655>Thanks for everything you do !

So , instead Joan and I waited while Lee got some food and then we ( um , they ) ate in the grass outside the restaurant ( it was very casual ) - plus other people were waiting for a table and drinking beer and other drinks while they waited. It was kind of a fest. The only thing is a lot of people think I 'm cute and they want to come over and pet me. Now , we know that I AM cute but I AM also a little scared.

And for this end our working must cease. We must see how entirely it is to be the faith of the operation of God , who raised Jesus from the dead. Just as much as the resurrection , the perfecting of God 's life in our souls is to be directly His work. And , waiting has to become , more than ever , a tarrying before God in stillness of soul , counting upon Him who raises the dead and calls the things that are not as though they were ( Rom. 4 : 17 ) . </wait.v.3667><wait.v.3668>We form queues with such panache and mathematical accuracy anywhere , anytime with the slightest ' provocation ' .

However , we are good are forming lines to get service.

Oh , how I wanted to love them , but I became a " prisoner of love. " As they began to grow , I became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs , poked fingers in my eyes , investigated my ears , and gave me kisses on my nose. I loved everything about them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I would 've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams , and together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway.

Am I being naive in my recovery ? </wait.v.3674><wait.v.3675>Following this momentous hour of waiting we can expect God 's blessing upon those who look for Him , but we can also count on the breath of His chastisement to come upon many others : " Behold , the name of the LORD cometh from far , burning with His anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : His lips are full of indignation , and His tongue as a devouring fire " ( Is 30 : 27 ) . On one hand those who have been joined to the Lord due to being twisted and pierced ( Those In Waiting ) are seen as a great benefit to some; while on the other hand , they come as fierce judgment to others . </wait.v.3675><wait.v.3676>WTH ? !

The paper called The Psychology of Waiting Lines enumerated a series of propositions on how customers experience waiting and how businesses can take advantage of these psychological factors to take away the frustration from the wait.

" Squid Vicious grumbled to himself , crumpling the half-full can of green tea in one hand and tossing it in the general direction of a pile of rubbish bags. At first the idea of getting a drink from one of the ubiquitous vending machines while he was on stake-out had seemed a good one , but his uncharacteristically good mood lasted only until the moment he had tasted the contents of his selection. What had put Squid off his drink was n't the fact that green tea was n't what he had ordered , it was that for some reason it had been cold ... He shuffled about , staring down each street in turn , ignoring the babble of alien language behind him as one of the locals tried to remonstrate with him for littering. Three hours Squid had stood on this Nagasaki street corner , the overweight journalist acting like a lighthouse withstanding the buffeting waves of people , and having waited here all this time without so much as a luridly made-up gaggle of Japanese teenagers for a photo opportunity Squid was starting to get just a little annoyed.

Advent is a time for preparation and anticipation. It is the final days of increasingly dark nights and then the coming of new light and life. Historically , the anticipation and preparation for Christmas have been celebrated probably since the 5th century. There is some evidence that Advent has been celebrated with a wreath and candles , as it is today , in Germany since before the Protestant Reformation. Some believe it is one of many earth-centered , pagan celebrations adopted by early Christians. In any case , and regardless of one 's faith , the winter season is an appropriate time for slowing down; reflecting on the new light and new life that spring will bring; preparing for the new year; waiting patiently and restfully for what is to come . </wait.v.3684><wait.v.3685>I bet you cant wait to deliver that message !

" In the King James Version , the thought is that no eye has seen the thing that God has prepared. In the American Standard Version , no eye has seen a God , besides our God , who works for him who waits for Him. To both , the two thoughts are common : that our place is to wait upon God , and that what the human heart can not conceive will be revealed to us. The difference is the following : in the American Standard Version , it is the God who works; in the King James Version , the thing He is to work. In 1 Corinthians 2 : 9 , " But as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him , " the reference is in regard to the things that the Holy Spirit is to reveal , as in the King James Version , and in this chapter we will keep to that . </wait.v.3703><wait.v.3704>Feelings of guilt and frustration in the light of Christ 's admonition of Martha are not new and have produced different responses by Christians through the ages.

There was not the slightest hope of his recovery out of his state of death , but in God , His power and mercy. It is God alone who began the work of redemption; it is God alone who continues and carries it on each moment in each individual believer. Even in the regenerate man there is no power of goodness in himself : he has and can have nothing that he does not each moment receive; and waiting on God is just as indispensable , and must be just as continuous and unbroken , as the breathing that maintains his natural life . </wait.v.3734><wait.v.3735>" Ephiny , the last thing we need to do now is split up.

The creation waits in eager expectation that even as we groan in prayer in sighs too deep for words , we wait eagerly for redemption. For in this hope we were saved.

Much more so is the Holy Spirit. He is God , present and working in us.

" When you pray , you love to go into your closet , according to the command of Jesus , and shut the door. You shut out business and company and pleasure and anything that can distract , and you want to be alone with God. But in one way even the material world follows you there. You must eat. These men wanted to shut themselves out from the influences of the material and the visible , and they fasted. What they ate was simply enough to supply the wants of nature , and in the intensity of their souls they thought to give expression to their letting go of everything on earth in their fasting before God.

Waiting on the Lord takes burnt up , weary hearts and rekindles the passion and fire until we are set ablaze , burning for more the Lord. I think it 's interesting that if you look at the three words they could be characterized by rest ( being still ) , desire ( to long for ) and faith ( eagerly anticipating ) . You need each one of these elements to truly wait on the Lord , but I think that one you start waiting on the Lord each one of these will start to burn brighter in your life.

Waiting in lines is not the most pleasant experience one can have , especially when it comes to receiving service from a business. It can be so irritating , sometimes.

To which of these two ought the larger place to be given in your approach to Him ? Undoubtedly , to the heart of God : every thing depends upon knowing and being occupied with that. But how little this is done. This is what waiting on God is meant to teach you. Just think of Gods wonderful love and redemption , in the meaning these words must have to Him. Confess how little you understand what God is willing to do for you , and say each time as you pray : " And now , what wait I for ? " My heart can not say , Gods heart knows and waits to give.

My husband and I were on the brink of separation when we went to see the movie Fireproof. We had allowed obstacles in our lives to steal our focus off of God and all that He has for us. We have a little girl who was born with a rare , genetic syndrome and she requires total care because her brain is only 1/4 the size of what it should be. And we wait everyday for a miracle from God. The flesh in us had allowed this 'situation ' to weigh us down , but as we sat there at the movie , your song came on. We both looked at each other , with tears streaming from our eyes , because we knew EXACTLY what you were singing about. Everyday we have to praise Him through this storm in our lives , while waiting on a miracle for our little girl. When the song was over , He reached down , grabbed my hand and has n't let go since !

No one can tell you more about him than he can , yet it 's amazing how many women will heed everyone else 's evaluation of a man 's intentions ( their hairdresser 's , their mother 's , their neighbor 's ) -- and ignore what he himself volunteers. Thus a man who , say , is n't going to be available for what you want will probably tell you so in straightforward English. When Fred said to Adrienne , " Never again , " each time the subject of marriage came up , he was so adamant , so funny , that she laughed and ignored him. " Never again , " he 'd say whenever he got off the phone with one of his twin boys and , because she knew he loved them so much , she 'd marvel at his vehemence.

Suddenly Jesus turned round and asked them , " What do you want ?

We just want you - as a person , we want to see you at home. " And Jesus said , " Come and see , " as if to say , " Come and be with me , and know me as a person.

So Sarah tells Abraham to sleep with Hagar , their servant. This was actually a common practice back in the day , since women were looked down upon when they had no children. Abraham slept with Hagar and she became pregnant. She had Ishmael , who was n't necessarily part of God 's original plan. Ishmael reprensents Sarah and Abraham 's mistake and impatience.

But waiting lists do more than serve bureaucratic functions. For example , many patients ultimately decide not to undergo scheduled procedures.11 , 12 Immediate access preempts the possibility of reflective second thought or opinion , adaptation to a new condition or trial management with more conservative measures. Undergoing intensive diagnosis and surgical treatment is not a trivial decision. For some conditions , a short wait is certainly preferable , but for others , low burden associated with the condition and a period of reflection are not an unhappy combination.

The only sound was that of muffled sobs. It was summer but in the overwhelmingly sudden situation I was cold all the time. We were soon disheveled-looking. For two weeks we ate only bread and drank tea. I know that we were all secretly hoping that mother ' s health would improve. We were waiting for a miracle. Not only did the miracle not come , but mother ' s condition got worse. From being immobile and on her back she developed open wounds , and because she was not able to call for help , some nights she lay in her own urine. Although the hospital did not have enough staff , they were strict about not letting families come in to help at night. When he realized that her constant moaning was the result of the pain from her open wounds , Adek made the decision to bring mother home . </wait.v.4017><wait.v.4018>Oh , I can ' t wait to see phish play in front of a bunch of spun out kids that wish they were around when phish was a band not a memory. have fun with the sloppy seconds kiddies. losers . </wait.v.4018><wait.v.4019>Well , similar story.

I have an AT &amp;T acount , so I was promised a seamless transition ... not so. I was prompted by iTunes that my activation required additional time and that I should wait for an email ... no dice. I 've waited long enough. Called AT &amp;T and got the same run around that most of you did. The girl on the line said that they honestly did n't expect the iPhone to sell like it did , so they really were n't prepared for the call volume ... PC people will never learn ...

And they talked together , or Paul taught Edgar the songs he himself had learned from Annie at the piano. And often all the men , Mr. Leivers as well , had bitter debates on the nationalizing of the land and similar problems.

I am writing this sermon on a reasonably fast computer ( though not as fast as I would like -- I can hardly wait to get a faster one ) . Because the main processor chip runs so fast , some of the other components can not keep up; thus a certain number of so-called wait states are used. A wait state ( in my limited grasp of the inner workings of the computer ) is like having to pass in a card game when you have no card to play. When I buy ram ( random access memory ) for my computer , I will not accept 70 nanosecond memory; it must be 60 nanosecond memory.

I know that through this commitment to God , I will not only be ready to receive God 's best as my husband , but I will also be worthy of my husband because I will be fully restored , undamaged and molded into God 's best as his wife ! I am still SOOO excited by having met you and having been touched by your faith. Last night I found myself unable to put your book down ! Thank you for allow ing God to use you in my life ! </wait.v.4086><wait.v.4087>A year after we got on the waiting list ( which was about seven months after we 'd started the process , so more than a year and a half total of WAITING ) , we received a referral of an 8-month old baby girl. We fell in love with her and readied her nursery and had baby showers and did everything that excited , expectant parents do to prepare to welcome their child home. A few months later , when we thought we were going to be traveling soon to bring her home from Vietnam , we received a devastating call : our agency had discovered that she had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and had severe motor , cognitive and developmental impairment as a result. We made the agonizing decision , after consulting with lots of expert-types in this area based on the new medical information we had , to withdraw from her adoption . </wait.v.4087><wait.v.4088>Victoria , stop. He put his hands on her shoulders , turning her on the bench to fully face him. Now , you 're tired , and this should probably wait until you are more rested , but I want you to know that I have no intention of becoming the tyrannical husband and demanding anything. I ... I wo n't touch you except in the same friendly fashion we 've shared for years. I know how strong your feelings are for Zorro. Victoria , please do n't cry ! </wait.v.4088><wait.v.4089>I ' m an expert on waiting in line for Apple products.

Spiritual darkness had settled in around me. You could see them on the street corners with their beautiful robes and scowls of judgment , but something about them reminded me of whited sepulchers. The voices of our leaders were authoritative , yet lacking any compassion. So we waited . </wait.v.4092><wait.v.4093>Anyways , I really ca n't wait for this. I get this really good feeling whenver I read a series , I just grow to really love the characters. Could you try to not give us a 3-year wait between books from now on ? No offesne , I ujst a suggestion . </wait.v.4093><wait.v.4094>Public healthcare works in other parts of the world just fine.

A bit of good news gives me an uplifted feeling. So great that you have some options and that you do n't have the kind of patience to just stop and wait for something bad to happen . </wait.v.4095><wait.v.4096>12 months later , at the end of 2000 my best mate was praying for me backstage .

If you two are patient enough then go for it. It would probably be more traditional and your right the ambiance would be a lot more romantic at your honey moon. Where are you guys going to for your honeymoon ? </wait.v.4099><wait.v.4100>The Hebrew prophets foretold the coming of a Messiah who would free the people of Israel from bondage and would restore them as a nation. They continue to wait. His name would be Emmanuel , meaning God within us. Emmanuel would be the light shining in the darkest hours. In Isaiah chapter 40 , verse 31 it says " but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.

I was excited to see others my age , outsite of my church , waiting like I am. I brought the book and love it so far. I would love to do an 'Unplugged ' at my church; telling the truth , and getting through to individuals younger or the same age as I. Keep pushing forward , speaking the truth , trusting God , and I know He will take this far. I would love to really connect with this ministry.

Perhaps the recognition that any poetry reading is beautiful. Perhaps the very fact that this woman filled the waiting spaces with poetry as she sat in the car waiting for her husband to finish his doctor 's appointment . </wait.v.4105><wait.v.4106>I ' ll never forget the trio of girls who barged in to the Gents ' , one night. The first in grabbed the cubicle , and her two mates , waiting behind my back , then attempted to engage me in a pissed so where does it all go from there ? discussion about the plumbing of the trough. While I was still at it. Disconcerting , albeit not the strangest thing that ever happened there . </wait.v.4106><wait.v.4107>The word patience is derived from the Latin word for suffering. It suggests the thought of being under the constraint of some power from which we fain would be free. At first we submit against our will; experience teaches us that when it is vain to resist , patient endurance is our wisest course. In waiting on God it is of infinite consequence that we not only submit , because we are compelled to , but because we lovingly and joyfully consent to be in the hands of our blessed Father. Patience then becomes our highest blessedness and our highest grace. It honors God , and gives Him time to have His way with us. It is the highest expression of our faith in His goodness and faithfulness. It brings the soul perfect rest in the assurance that God is carrying on His work. It is the token of our full consent that God should deal with us in such a way and time as He thinks best. True patience is the losing of our self-will in His perfect will . </wait.v.4107><wait.v.4108>Congratulate me. I got her to take a nap today. The little bugger REFUSES to stay in her bed. We have covered all forms of discipline , punishment , bribing , and the like to no avail. Today I pulled the rocking chair right into her doorway and sat there nursing Piper while she waited for me to leave ... . and waited and waited. She finally got so tired of waiting she crashed. It only took a half hour . </wait.v.4108><wait.v.4109>For them , waiting is n't intentional delay , it 's circumstantial.

The cracker , hat , motto and gift will find their way into the rubbish bin soon enough , and I know that my friendships will not always be enough.

But through trials You are testing me. It is You who lets me wait , grow , and become a humble person before You. A humble person can serve the Lord. It is only You who has put this holy dream in my heart. Lord , cause us to obey the absolute sovereignty of God. During waiting times you challenge us. Waiting is necessary in a life of faith. Let us not be in a hurry but wait for You who in turn waits patiently for us . </wait.v.4120><wait.v.4121>He knew that sooner or later he would obey O ' Brien ' s summons. Perhaps tomorrow , perhaps after a long delay he was not certain. What was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. The first step had been a secret , involuntary thought , the second had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words , and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But it was frightening : or , more exactly , it was like a foretaste of death , like being a little less alive. Even while he was speaking to O ' Brien , when the meaning of the words had sunk in , a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave , and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him . </wait.v.4121><wait.v.4122>Great idea , really utilizing the PS Store in a smart way , in fact I dont think I ' ve ever seen something like this ever released , so its new..

The big plot is written; they needed structure so they could write in the details on their own schedule. While they waited they had to do a couple of lame filler episodes. After that it was rock solid , leading up to a spectacular mind-fark at the end of Season Three. Season Four was consistently fine , mind-screwing entertainment . </wait.v.4125><wait.v.4126>I 've been there.

But ya know what ? We all waited , patiently , to hand back our 3D glasses , despite the fact the kid kept dropping the bag. Nobody swore , or tried to push through. Then we waited in line for the bathroom , all of the ladies washing their hands reflected pleasant expressions in the mirror. And driving out of our rather stupidly-planned local theater , not a single person honked his or her horn. People even waved through those waiting to cut in , and those who were let in waved their hands in front of their rear-views , in thanks . </wait.v.4127><wait.v.4128>Yeah ! ! Brendan and I have been planning on getting a 1-2 result for a while and waiting for it to happen. Well Bernardo won the giant slalom today and I finished 2nd.

Tomorrow is the downhill finals and it 's raining a little now which will make the track interesting if it keeps on. It will be a lot slower and really slippery on all the rocky sections. I do n't mind if it is wet tomorrow because it will just make riding that much wilder . </wait.v.4128><wait.v.4129>Thank you Sherry Johnston way to give us some of the information we need for solving this puzzle of who is Trig ' s birthmother !

I said in my last post that I 've been accepted by several schools. Unfortunately , I was so wrapped up in the crappy day I was having that I did n't even mention how wonderfully excited I am , how grateful I am , how relieved and how thrilled I am by those acceptances. Instead , it seemed like I tossed the information off like it did n't matter. That is not the case at all. As anyone who as applied to grad school knows , those letters of acceptance make the world a little brighter. Suddenly , I have a future ! I am still waiting on some schools , and as more time goes by , the more convinced I am that those schools are going to reject me. It stresses me out and , quite frankly , scares me. That 's all I was trying to say in my last post.

Currently , I ' m suffering from anhedonia the inability to experience pleasure. Nothing excites me. And nothing looks appealing enough to pursue , either. In fact , I feel like an old person just waiting to die , like I ' ve experienced all that life has to offer and that I , at some point , stumbled upon what I was supposed to do in this life , and now there ' s nothing left to do or work towards.

We recieved a complementary truffle each for our inconvenience , which was a nice touch. However the lack lustre service tainted my experience to the point that I felt extremely embarrassed about recommending " She " to others. Even after my query regarding the length of time it was taking to receive our food ( I stated we had been waiting for 1hr but was corrected by the waitress that it was not one hour since she had taken our order but in fact only 30mins ) we still had to ask for items that should be a normal part of service ( i.e. requesting the dessert menu ) . </wait.v.4143><wait.v.4144>As they waited for the planes to arrive , family members and friends all said they were relieved to have the Soldiers return safe and sound.

I think of this a quite a good sign and added into what she said Saturday and Sunday I think she does want to be with me.

You must wake up every day , confident that the plumber is working his way to you. Do not let doubt creep in . </wait.v.4155><wait.v.4156>The first 3 years after my brothers death I would often call Jerin , went to visit him in person and spent limited time with him at his home twice , ( though I attempted to more than that , but was only told by his mom that they would n't be home ) . After several attempts of trying to stay in contact with my brothers son and repeatedly becoming more and more aware that I was n't welcome , our side of the family all thought it was best to wait until Jerin turned closer to 21 to try to reconnect again. All this going back in time of old feelings brought out all the many different emotions again. Before I knew it I was sobbing like a baby in heavy , heavy tears which stained my face , neck and eye 's bright red. It hurt to know I lost such a great brother and then to know I lost the only link to him; his son. I know my brother would not have liked this in the least . </wait.v.4156><wait.v.4157>CJ took the dress home , tried it on in front of her own mirror , and then took it off. She did n't allow herself to rush into another set of clothing as she was used to doing at this point. She faced the mirror , faced it with her eyes open , faced until she said aloud , " This is still you. You 're still taller than most men , and that still makes you a little uncomfortable , even though you know it shouldn't.

The sense memory was almost overwhelming ... flashes of so many moments in the library ... especially the research parties ... and the early times when just him being there , waiting , was reassurance enough after slaying , and in the mornings , after the nightmares. She did n't need to tell him about them , because they all went away when she walked into his office , to be enveloped by the tweed , the aromatic tea , the books ... his cologne. Her brows knitted in surprise at that , but it was true ... all those predictable , unchanging aromas and scents were Giles ... were her security blanket for three years . </wait.v.4158><wait.v.4159>Having admitted to you that I do not like to wait , I may now remind each of you that you do n't like waiting either. Why do we have so many fast food chains ? Why are microwave dinners so popular ? It is all because we do n't like to wait. Several years ago , someone had the bright idea of how congestion on North Central Expressway could be improved. They installed a computer system to monitor traffic flow , and then metered the entrances to the expressway. At the beginning of the entrance ramp was a little traffic light , which would turn green when you were allowed to enter the road. This had nothing to do with whether there was room to get on the expressway , only that the computer now thought the expressway could handle you. Those lights are not there today. There may be other reasons , like road construction , but I believe one reason was that people simply refused to wait. If the way was clear and the light was red , people entered the expressway anyway. How foolish to wait ! We must all confess that we are not a nation of waiters . </wait.v.4159><wait.v.4160>* We are strengthened - Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength; They will mount up with wings like eagles , They will run and not get tired , They will walk and not become weary.

Prayer can be a time of waiting. If we are impatient , our prayer time can be filled with our petitions. But prayer is a relationship , not just asking for help. In prayer we turn our gaze to the face of God. We turn to God willing to receive the grace and love of Christ. That gift is not a matter of our making. What we receive is what God gives. If we wait , we will receive. If we are impatient , we deny ourselves what God wishes to give us . </wait.v.4163><wait.v.4164>( ok , tal or tigress , waiting for one of you to give off statistics on my name. oh , tal 's been beaten to death by Regis/JJ the alien ) </wait.v.4164><wait.v.4165>Andy , take your time and get well.

This is the only place in the New Testament where the return of Christ is called a second coming.

Instead , he took his turn in line like everyone else. He waited until it was his turn , until all the others had taken their turn and had experienced their moment of grace.

" All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer. " Their waiting was not passive , idle time. They actively sought the presence and direction of God. Together they waited for God 's leading and direction , God 's assurance and guidance. When confronted with a situation which overwhelmed them , they paused , stepped back , and waited -- on God. Prayer -- conversation with God -- both talking and listening -- was their primary activity. They did what they had seen Jesus do so often -- they stepped aside from the demands of the day , and purposefully sought God 's presence . </wait.v.4181><wait.v.4182>The cake is ready to serve as soon as it is assembled , but I think it ' s best to let it sit and set for a couple of hours in a cool room not the refrigerator.

After returning home with our second adopted child , Shelby , we were approached by Deniece Hess regarding a little boy in the waiting child program. We couldn ' t say no. What better way to cheat fate , than to not only adopt a child , but to adopt one with a special need ? We chose child number three , our son Alex , with a bad heart. We watched Max the surgeon fix that heart , and now Alex plays sports and eats junk food and watches too much TV. And then , from the Waiting Child list , we chose his best friend from the same orphanage in Shantou , who had been left behind when the other children had been adopted , our daughter Avery who has Hepatitis B.

If our waiting begin by quieting the activities of nature , and being still before God; if it bows and seeks to see God in His universal and almighty operation , alone able and always ready to work all good; if it yields itself to Him in the assurance that He is working and will work in us; if it maintains the place of humility and stillness , and surrenders until Gods Spirit has quickened the faith that He will perfect His work : it will indeed become the strength and the joy of the soul. Life will become one deep blessed cry : " I have waited for Thy salvation , O Lord. " </wait.v.4227><wait.v.4228>I ca n't wait until Kingdom Keepers 2 to come out ! LOL 2 to !

One thing : waiting for instructions , waiting on God. " On Thee do I wait all the day. " We want in our times of prayer to give clear expression to our sense of need , and our faith in His help. We want definitely to become conscious of our ignorance as to what Gods war may be , and the need of the Divine light shining within us , if our way is to be as of the sun , shining more and more unto the perfect day. And we want to wait quietly before God in prayer , until the deep , restful assurance fills us : It will be given - " the meek will He guide in the way.

I was learning that sometimes it is quite important just to stand there. On my final day I sat with Mary and explained to her that my time in the hospital had come to an end , and that I would not be coming to sit with her any more. I told her that I had been grateful for our time together , and that I would miss our visits. Then an extraordinary thing happened. Without ever looking at me or uttering a sound , Mary just ever so gently reached her hand over and barely touched mine. That was all , a slight gesture to say " thank you. " In fact , I had been grateful for our time together.

But Ayesha strong and happy in her love , clothed in immortal youth and godlike beauty , and the wisdom of the centuries , would have revolutionized society , and even perchance have changed the destiny of Mankind. Thus she opposed herself against the eternal Law , and , strong though she was , by it was swept back to nothingness- swept back with shame and hideous mockery ! </wait.v.4288><wait.v.4289>There is something mad and tragic about being a writer sometimes , I think.

I do not want you to think only of the change in Peter , in that boldness , and that power , and that insight into the Scriptures , and that blessing with which he preached that day. Thank God for that. But there was something for Peter deeper and better. Peter 's whole nature was changed. The work that Christ began in Peter when He looked upon him , was perfected when he was filled with the Holy Ghost . </wait.v.4290><wait.v.4291>Hi Girl Friends , I sure love your beautiful outfits ! !

When another person arrived and asked who was last , you would let that person that you were last.

It 's a waiting game for the next couple of days. Best case scenerio is that everything he left is healthy and they reconnect. If this is possible , G-d willing , she will be on TPN for 6-12 months and then they will try to wean her off the TPN. Some kids can get weaned and others have to stay on for life. Next best scenerio is they have to take out more of the bowel and she gets a bag and TPN for life.

But though I really think Waiting for Normal is wonderful and would recommend it to any other adult readers of children 's books , I would be much more inclined to recommend Hilary McKay to a child than Waiting for Normal. Both have unstable families , and vulnerable people of all ages. Both have happy endings , which are really feel-good in the best sense. But something about the end of Forever Rose made me feel safer. I 'm still not totally sure why , but think it has something to do with the way the ending was won through to by a complex weaving together of a lot of many kinds of behaviour by all the characters : selfishness , loyalty , love , neglect , avoidance , stubbornness , giving ... In Waiting for Normal , it seems more a case of luck , in a funny way.

A beloved brother in Holland was speaking about the expectancy of faith being the true sign of the bride. I ventured to express a doubt. An unworthy bride , about to be married to a prince , might only be thinking of the position and the riches that she was to receive. The expectancy of faith might be strong and true love utterly lacking. It is not when we are most occupied with prophetic subjects , but when in humility and love we are clinging close to our Lord and His followers , that we are in the bride 's place. Jesus refuses to accept our love except as it is love to His disciples. Waiting for His coming means waiting for the glorious coming manifestation of the unity of the body , while we seek here to maintain that unity in humility and love. Those who love most are the most ready for His coming. Love to each other is the life and beauty of His bride , the church . </wait.v.4344><wait.v.4345>The question isn ' t whether you will have to wait during the publishing process. You will.

God is faithful in His way , not our own. But truly , He is faithful. The question is , like Elizabeth and Zechariah , what will be said of us during the time of waiting ?

However , there are times when there is only so much that a business can do about the length of time a customer stands ( or sits ) in line waiting to be served. Even when there are enough servers , faster serving times and a very efficient queuing management system , the volume of customer activity can still make customers wait in line for a while. If the average waiting time in an industry is say 10 minutes , it becomes very difficult ( not impossible ) for a business in that industry to reduce its waiting time to 1 minute. It might be that the standard procedures that customers have to follow make it humanly impossible to achieve a 1 minute waiting time for customers . </wait.v.4409><wait.v.4410>When Hannah finally allowed her mind to submit to the sedative , she was so still and the work on her was able to be accomplished with amazing results all within 20 min.

So , you sit and wait , and since you are already soaking , it 's not like you can get up and leave.

As wives we must cheerfully , respectfully and lovingly honor what our husband asks of us , but as we wait upon him , we must find a way to obey what we believe is right , until the Lord releases us or changes him. Setting those personal goals is just what you are doing . </wait.v.4425><wait.v.4426>" Let him wait ! I gave you my permission to train , alright , ( and I 'll regret that my entire life ) but it does n't mean I 'm going to have you pushing your studies aside. Today we 'll review everything you have learned . </wait.v.4426><wait.v.4427>Rhiannon shrugged good-naturedly. Ever since an earlier confrontation with her lover over Lina 's tendency to coddle her unmercifully , the other woman had been fairly careful to include Rhiannon in as many decisions as possible. If she says she will , then she will. I 'll just have to wait a bit . </wait.v.4427><wait.v.4428>There were so many of us that we always had interventions. Someone was always doing something they had no business doing , getting on somebody 's nerves , sad about a boy , grades , or family issues waiting at home. These talks happened randomly so they could be in anyone 's room. Everyone but Kennia I worked at Dobbins so sometimes we would go to Dobbins and eat with Kamille and Ashanti after they finished their shifts. We would laugh and update each other on all the trouble we had gotten into over the weekend . </wait.v.4428><wait.v.4429>February 4th , 2007 I just had a great week. My friends at work gave me a shower Thursday night. It was so much fun. I received so many beautiful presents. Everyone was way too generous. Jenna officially has more clothes than me ! They served delicious Chinese food. The cake was the best. There were so many people there. I was so overwhelmed and I am not over it yet. I am still waiting on my travel arrangements but will post them as soon as I know. I feel like the luckiest person in the world . </wait.v.4429><wait.v.4430>6. Morgan CD , Sykora K , Naylor CD.

Insults , abuse , then 'put the kettle on , would you , ' he muttered as he ambled into the little kitchenette. He started filling the tin kettle , then paused , and grinned to himself. Among the packets of candy , cans of food , and other shopping on the cupboard waiting to be put away was a new jar of hot chocolate mix with little marshmallows already in. He shot a look over the breakfast bar at the Watcher 's grey-sweatered back , shook his head and put the water on to boil . </wait.v.4432><wait.v.4433>They wanted the red meat of the event - they wanted the poets. They loved the poets , they laughed heartily at all their jokes , bought their books and waited attentively for them to be signed. Noone asked me to sign a book afterwards. At least I got to stand at the bar looking as if I just happened to be there , rather than sit behind a table being ignored. ( And Thank God for the nice couple with the holiday cottage in Northumberland who talked to me. ) It was one of those character-building experiences - I 've written one book , one of the poets the brilliant Sophie Hannah has written seven novels , two children 's books and her latest poetry was nominated for some massive prize. She 's 37. Another of the poets Kit Wright has written 25 books. Jackie Kay may be the next Poet Laureate and has an MBE.

I like not having to worry about alot of things that come along with relationships outside of marriage. Nothing can compare to Living for Christ. I know that the Lord is pleased with my efforts.

But Orient ' s smart. He ' d weigh the possibility , and it wouldn ' t work any better than any of the rest. You don ' t carve up a crazy boyfriend. You just wait patiently until he finds someone else to pester. No wonder Orient seemed so frustrated in his last notes . </wait.v.4438><wait.v.4439>God ' s promises are true for you and for your children. Our period of waiting seemed long at times , frustrating at times , difficult at times. But God remained faithful to the promises He gave us in His word . </wait.v.4439><wait.v.4440>" I 'm Nan. Sure , " I told him and waited as he drove a tow truck from behind the shop. He reached over in the cab and opened the door so I could climb in the passenger 's side. The car sat in the same spot , looking pitiful , but Dave wasted no time. He lifted the hood , jiggled a few things , and told me to try to start it. It started right up. " Wow , that 's amazing. Should I follow you back to the garage ? " </wait.v.4440><wait.v.4441>Dad never got better. He just got worse. So you might say , " Well , he waited upon the Lord , but he could n't run and he could n't walk. " But that was true only in this life. There will be a day for you and me when , whatever difficulties and limitations we have here , we will have that promise fulfilled for us. We will be lifted up as on eagles ' wings , and it will be those who have waited upon the Lord . </wait.v.4441><wait.v.4442>Waiting isn ' t easy. The road that we must take on this journey of waiting is often a lonely one. But it is a beautiful one , too . </wait.v.4442><wait.v.4443>Waiting on the Lord needs to be a lifestyle of Faith - an expectation of the answered prayer. Time passing has nothing to do with whether God will work in your life. Our faith has everything to do with answered prayer in the time we wait . </wait.v.4443><wait.v.4444>And so , early Christians created Advent as a time of preparation and anticipation -- of waiting for God , who came first as a baby in a manger. When children come , we wait patiently because we know that childbirth takes time and comes on its own schedule , not ours. And today , Christians wait patiently for the second coming of their Messiah ... but they were not the first ... . </wait.v.4444><wait.v.4445>She ' s also had two surgeries the past two years. The first surgery , the doctor waited 2 months to get paid. The second surgeon had to wait three ..guess who got the phone calls wanting their monies , that they rightly deserved ? </wait.v.4445><wait.v.4446>The danger with the messiah narrative is that the audience plays a passive role. Change comes to us , not from us. The power of the messiah is in direct relation to the suffering of the people; hence they have more value as victims than as political agents. We see this in the healthcare debate when MoveOn.org enlisted R.E.M. for a song. A melancholy guitar jangles in the video We Can ' t Afford to Wait as grim people bloated with chemicals , with tubes in their throats or surgical scars on their chests hold signs with their conditions. They are victims waiting for political deliverance . </wait.v.4446><wait.v.4447>- Men and Dogs : I made mistake of bringing this book to the gym to read a chapter as a sneak peak.

After waiting for about 20 minutes , a representative came on the phone. I explained my ordeal to her and she said that she could not do anything for me.

I demanded explanation and initially she denied providing me any details citing her inability to look at the status while the activation was being processed . </wait.v.4448><wait.v.4449>As I have mentioned before , we are waiting for Ms. Barnes to contact us personally so we can continue with our rights under the law. I really ca n't disclose anything further since I 've been asked not to by law officials and the attorneys handling this case. She will have to contact us in order to try to full-fill her obligation and I will not accept participation from anyone except from her. My suggestion that she divulges her attorney is a sound one since it may help if he intervenes at this point if she is sincere at getting this resolved . </wait.v.4449><wait.v.4450>Partly for the sake of inspiring would be hardware-makers and partly because we just like to think about this sort of stuff , we ' ve come up with a list of 5 ( plus ) iPhone accessories we ' re not-so-patiently waiting for.

Angel had been waiting out in front ever since shed had her talk with Xander , and she never actually got to say good bye to him. Fine. Be that way , she thought. You might have forever to carry a grudge , but I dont. Anya was still perky despite the fact that Hallie appeared to have abandoned her once again for Wes company , once the need to get Anya out of the room had passed. Wes looked both perturbed and intrigued at that , and she found herself wondering what exactly had happened to the twitchy little Englishman she remembered. How come Angel had a good effect on him ? The rest was a blur , and she was left closing the door on them with such relief that she felt almost but not quite guilty over. She actually leaned against the door for a moment , pressing her face to the wood. Then she turned and leaned her back against it , reaching out with one hand to jiggle the knob to make sure it was locked . </wait.v.4458><wait.v.4459>My mom died when I was 24. She was my best friend. She suffered from depression and alcoholism died of lung cancer. She was so lonely and I think she too was just waiting to die. When she died , I realized that she had gone to a way better place than where she had been. No more suffering , loneliness , depression , drinking. She was spared years and years of self loathing and torture. I go through the motions. Nothing excites me. Nothing moves me , no passion , no energy to do anything. I feel I am doing a disservice to my children and husband. I have no original ideas , I just go with the flow. I look forward to seeing my mom again , wherever she is , I hope I go there too and I hope there is happiness to be found. It ' s been almost 20 years since she died , how much longer do I have to wait ? How much longer do I have to pretend I want to be alive ? </wait.v.4459><wait.v.4460>I was thinking more in terms of the Harry Potter series which became the ultimate event books. Even the unveiling of the cover/title became an event in that series by the end.

Things that look unusual or cute have me at hello. So by the time I set foot outside the store , in my clutches were a few impulsive buys and I had somehow ended parting with $ 13.75. Something I did n't intend on doing at all. I never thought that waiting for a friend would cost me money . </wait.v.4461><wait.v.4462>Potatoes , too !

The Bible says , we should encourage one another. It is so amazing that you will not believe the strength you get when a Christian brother or sister sincerely encourages you. Another reason why you have to fellowship is that " Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God " ( Romans 10 : 17 ) . From time to time , people of God are coming to the end of their waiting and having so much to show for it. You will be so strengthened when you hear the testimony of the over comers , that you will walk in your affliction with joy knowing that God is faithful. If you have not been going to Church or you quit going to church for one reason or the other , it is time to find a church , because God has prepared someone ready that will meet you , encourage you , lift you up , and help you wait on the Lord . </wait.v.4464><wait.v.4465>Cameras quickly honed in on one knit capped teen , waiting since 6 a.m. to goof on the wildly popular Apple event.

Of course I left anyway. Arriving at the UPS office I was informed that the package was not there but at a different location. In a different town. What ? I could n't believe I was facing so much adversity with such an important task. Failure was simply not an option.

Spiders bring " luck " and she already had enough " bad luck " in her house . </wait.v.4479><wait.v.4480>I am sure you have been in God ' s waiting room before. Maybe you are or were here with a sick family member or friend; or with an unbelieving spouse or child; or with a rebellious teen; a difficult relationship at home , work or even in the church; a deep disappointment , or personal loss; financial troubles; wrestling with sin or faith. There are many reasons we come into this room . </wait.v.4480><wait.v.4481>Nevertheless it is true. It is not whether we are going to go through a lot of waiting in our lives , but how we are going to wait. Isaiah has the most important clue. " They who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. " The flip side of this is , " Those who wait without the Lord shall wear themselves out ! " </wait.v.4481><wait.v.4482>This IS the good news. If anyone should be expected to have the " magic words " to jump to the front of the line , it should have been Jesus. A simple : " Excuse me , excuse me , Messiah coming through " , probably would have done it. John was clearly waiting for Jesus , he knew that he was coming , and he recognized Jesus ' ultimate purpose in fulfilling God 's plan. John 's opinion of Jesus was so exalted that he said he himself was not worthy even to untie the thong of Jesus ' sandal , a task a mere slave or servant would normally perform. And yet Luke is very clear in his telling of this story : Jesus did not get or choose " front of the line " , " Executive " or " first class " status. He took his place in and amongst the people , the ordinary people , who had no special connections , no priority status , no magic words. Jesus chose to wait in line , with all the others , and be baptized in the midst of all their ordinary needs and expectations . </wait.v.4482><wait.v.4483>Wait on the Lord !

You 're right in one small respect - the FEC was n't available right at that instant; but there were people EVEN BACK THEN who said we 'd be better served by waiting a couple of years and trying to negotiate with FEC instead of CSX.

Then I have a 5 second memory gap. From reconstructing the crime , a Pathfinder zipped up in the the second right turn lane , made a fast turn , and slammed me with the passenger side of the car. I must have tried to body block the car with my head , shoulder , and hip. I ejected from the bike and do n't appear to have hit the pavement. Then my memory returns. I 'm standing woozily at the curb , looking at my bike in the middle of the road , with 4 lanes of traffic waiting for the light to change and the chance to run over it. As cyclists , you would have been proud of my instinctive rescue of the bike. I saunter over to a nearby emergency room , where I get the diagnosis of fractured distal clavicle , unfortunately on my strong arm. The hip is just badly bruised.

He asks one driver after another if she is coming , standing alone in the cold as daylight dims and snow begins to fall. The last wordless spread shows a snow-covered village with the tiny , almost imperceptible figures of a woman and child walking hand-in-hand through the storm. Readers need to look carefully at this spread to find the pair; otherwise the story is baffling and tragic. The Korean text , written in Hangeul , is accompanied by the English translation , although many pages are wordless. The lovely new pastel-and-ink illustrations depict life of the period. Some are simple ink drawings on ivory pages; others fill the pages with color and texture. The contrast is very pleasing. Changes in perspective effectively create movement and involvement. The text seems secondary to the setting and the art. An afterword on various details in the pictures is included. A worthwhile addition for its multicultural interest and its striking illustrations.

But neither today ' s Jeremiah passage nor our Luke reading suggests that we should wait passively. Luke cautions the readers of his gospel to wait patiently and expectantly for the Son of Man so that they don ' t miss him. Both patience and expectation involve action. If I sit and wait passively , I fall asleep. I don ' t notice that the fig tree is sprouting leaves and that summer is near. I miss the one for whom I am waiting. Luke also advises them to continue praying and not to allow themselves to be consumed with things that will distract them from their wait. This is how they should wait. They should keep doing God ' s work , but they should not lose sight of that for which they wait . </wait.v.4513><wait.v.4514>My mom let me stay home from school , but I ended up going in at 10 : 30 after I got my tickets.

It was really cool and touching , hearing Harper defend my acting skills like that. Before I could hear more though my phone went off and it was Mom saying she was waiting for me in the parking lot. So needless to say I was tossing and turning all night worrying about it. Then this morning I practically ran to Miss Harper 's room and low and behold , there 's my name at the top of the list.

He seeks to get us to act independently of God to obtain these things on our own , rather than to wait for God to give them to us. He seeks to raise doubts about the goodness of God , as though He is withholding something good from us out of pettiness. He works at promoting distrust in God , and especially in His Word.

This is one of several bridegroom sayings of Jesus recorded in the Gospels. It was obviously an important mystical symbol for him. The arrival of the bridegroom is an occasion of joy and festivity. And while the bridegroom is present there is no room for fasting or mourning. For us , the coming of the bridegroom prefigures the coming of Christ into our lives. In the Swedenborgian understanding , this arrival occurs not once but repeatedly as , piece by piece , we are remolded or regenerated into ever more capacious vessels for the expression of God ' s love and wisdom.

It was when God had given Jericho into his hands that Joshua thought the victory over Ai was sure , and waited not for counsel from God.

To me this number seems a bit high - if Apple 's is the bestselling App Store currently and they delivered something like 2 billion apps for 2009 and most of those were free. So we may find other research houses with more 'conservative ' numbers for apps sold in 2009 , but yes , Gartner has now given us a number of global sales that we can use as our first reference point. Do bear in mind that just non-messaging service revenues on mobile were over 80 billion dollars in 2009 so services exceed apps by a factor of roughly 20 to 1 ...

For the same year , using a proxy indicator of urgency defined according to whether the initial diagnostic procedure was a biopsy or a mammography , we found median waiting times of 23 and 38 days , respectively. Although not vastly dissimilar to the waiting times in Great Britain , those in our study were calculated from the time of initial diagnostic procedure and not referral. Assuming that referral would follow the initial procedure , this suggests shorter waiting times in Great Britain.

Finally , we see that waiting has a purpose : to see God move. It is so important that we don; t hurry Him because we will never know if what we are pursuing has truly been engineered by the Lord and when things do start to happen , we risk the sin of self-aggrandisement as we congratulate ourselves on doing something that really belongs to the Lord . </wait.v.4645><wait.v.4646>Here 's the big one ...

You are right , I am involved in a church that holds high standards with regard to sexual purity. I am not however , blind to the difficulties many face when striving to live by those standards , some do and frankly some slip up once in a while. In general however , the goal is to wait for marriage to be sexually active. I agree many times we are considered " odd " but that is the standard that the Lord has set , we are just trying to live it. Sometimes our youth get married just to have " legal " sex , and that can be an issue in itself. I appreciate your comments about me sharing my religious views of this institution of marriage , you have shown religious tolerance in a very kind way. Your own testimony of marriage is touching to say the least , thank you for contributing to the quality of my Hub . </wait.v.4647><wait.v.4648>The situation we find ourselves in may be just " mire and mud.

This doesn ' t mean we will experience instant deliverance always when we wait on God. Rather the night will shine as the day , and darkness as light ! ( Psa 139 : 11 , 12 ) . Our hands may be fettered with chains but our hearts will be given feathers to soar high. That was the experience of Paul and Silas in the Philippian prison. There ' s no way to be triumphant in darkness except by waiting on God with trust and confidence. God will send His servants to encourage us at such times. We must not be disappointed if their shouts of prayer do not lift us an inch. Here is the Scriptural prescription for our malady : " Who among you fears the Lord and obeys His servant ? If you are ( still ) walking in darkness , without a ray of light , trust in the Lord and rely on your God " ( Isa 50 : 10 ) . </wait.v.4648><wait.v.4649>When I have to wait as a customer for any unreasonable amount of time , I rediscover just how short a fuse can be.

" He shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be marveled at in all them that believed " ( 2 Thess. 1 : 10 ASV ) . Then , we will all meet , and the unity of the body of Christ will be seen in its divine glory. It will be the meeting place and the triumph of divine love. Jesus receiving His own and presenting them to the Father. His own meeting Him and worshiping , in speechless love , that blessed face. His own meeting each other in the ecstasy of God 's own love. Let us wait , long for , and love the appearing of our Lord and heavenly Bridegroom.

It would be very funny to see those guys ' disappointed looks. And then , they would talk to her again. She could even have a party to gather everybody , if everything ended up well. And would n't it ? Things here were a little different than in the mysterious boy 's timeline : Goku would live , he was already a Super Saiyan and probably Gohan and Vegeta would go Super Saiyan too.

In our brief span of years , we try all sorts of ways to gain glory in the eyes of others. True glory , however , only comes from the Lord ! Jesus longs to share his eternal glory with us. He had this with God before coming to earth. He has it now as he sits at the Father 's side. Even now , Jesus longs to share his glory with us. He longs to have us by his side and to gaze at him in all his heavenly glory along with the glory of his angels. Let 's look forward to this future with anticipation as we wait for the day we will see Jesus , face to face , in all of his glory . </wait.v.4703><wait.v.4704>Be sure and stop over at the Tuesdays With Dorie blog and take the links to see what everyone else came up with ...

God alone , who gave us the Holy Spirit , can restore the Holy Spirit in power into our life. God alone can " strengthen us with might by his Spirit in the inner man. " And to every waiting heart that will make the sacrifice , and give up everything , and give time to cry and pray to God , the answer will come. The blessing is not far off.

Were we ever wrong. Soon Paula and Michael Bare showed up at Best Friends Pet Resort where there was an adoption event. Things went well and paperwork was quickly filled out to start the process. The Bares could not believe an older guy , perfect manners , gorgeous full coat , tipped ears &amp;nobody wanted him. The tension ran high in the Bare household as they waited to see if they would be approved as adopters. Soon the home visit was completed , references checked and the humans involved in the process came to the same conclusion Spencer had over a week ago : the Bares would provide him a good home. When Paula and Michael come over to pick him up there were tears of sadness and tears of joy. We were sad because Spencer had become part of our life and he would be leaving our household , and we were happy for Spencer who was going to his forever home . </wait.v.4721><wait.v.4722>Sarah pulled open the heavy door of the Y where Eliza was attending day camp. They waited for the elevator and stood crammed in with other parents and children as it lurched unsteadily to the third floor , where the halls were lined with the garish primary colors of rainy-day art projects. As soon as the doors opened , Eliza ran out , her long legs , knobby and thin , splaying like broken wings. She had Todd 's body , all lankiness and limbs. Sarah watched her enter room 303 without looking back. She had never been a clinging child. Like her father , she was stoic , independent , stubborn. Eliza would wander out of playgrounds , out of sight; she would follow any stranger , certain she could fend for herself. They had to watch her carefully. Today , she was crackling with anticipation for the outing to Coney Island. Todd had taken her there last summer , and she still savored the memory of the crammed and swirling kiddie park , its dragon roller coaster and teacup whirligig. He had also taken her on a ride called Dante 's Inferno , which had given her nightmares for a month , though she now flatly denied any such thing . </wait.v.4722><wait.v.4723>I think more sellers are waiting to put their houses up.

It was Plekanec who , I thought , did the best work on the play by keeping a dump-in alive from behind the net. The puck then ended up back at the left point with Markov. He blasted a pass to Kostitsyn who was waiting in Kovalev 's spot ( you know the one ) beside the net.

God wants me to be , and God waits to make me; I want to be , and I wait on Him to make me , every moment , what He expects of mewhat is well pleasing in His sight. If waiting on God is the essence of true faith , the maintenance of the spirit of entire dependence must be continuous. The call of God , " wait on thy God continually , " must be accepted and obeyed.

Often I focus only on my circumstances and hurry through them without waiting patiently for the Lord. Forgetting the spiritual , I focus only on my temporal concerns.

Yet there ' s something innate in men that makes them believe we should wait on them no matter what. My theory has been proven in most of my experiences with important men in my life . </wait.v.4843><wait.v.4844>For many people Christmas is the time of the year they identify with the most.

I ca n't wait to see even more of her downfall tomorrow night on 20/20. I can see it now , this interview will put Obama/Biden 10 ahead in the polls.

You must believe the love he has to you , his watchful care over you , his delight in you , the promises he has given you , the provision he has made for you , the glory he will get by you , and the honor to which he intends to raise you. In so doing , the fear of man will die , joy in God will spring up , the peace of God will fill your heart and mind , your dependence on creatures will cease , and you will be happy in looking only to the Lord. " My soul , wait only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

And just as he was coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven , " You are my Son , the Beloved; with you I am well pleased. " And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days , tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him. Now after John was arrested , Jesus came to Galilee , proclaiming the good news of God , and saying , " The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent , and believe in the good news.

He goes everytime after he wakes up in the mornings and from his nap. I take his diaper off at home.. and yes it ' s hard to be consistent , but he usually goes every 30-40mins. Well he does great at home , but the daycare he ' s in isn ' t helping. His teacher seems to think he ' s not ready and not showing signs. I think he ' s doing an awesome job and she ' s just too lazy and doesn ' t want to be bothered. I ' ve never in my life heard of waiting til a kid is 2 or 3. I think it ' s ridiculous. Anyways , I make a REALLY big deal about it when he pee pees and when he doesn ' t .. well i don ' t. I just say uh oh no pee pee and we try again in a few minutes. But anyways , I ' m glad i ' m not the only one that thinks diapers are gross ! Thanks ! </wait.v.4859><wait.v.4860>Next day , we take time out of our busy schedule and go to the AT &amp;T store. Due to 4 people ahead of us on the sign-up sheet , we had to wait for 45 minutes before we got any service ( they should seriously consider adding more benches or chairs for people to sit while they are waiting. It becomes a challenge to keep standing for 45 minutes with a four year old child - while they are at it , they should perhaps also consider a play area for children if they plan on keeping their custmers waiting for 45 minutes. Some studies have also indicated that a HD TV and free refreshments in waiting area help reduce the aggrevation level in custoimers - just my 2 cents to AT &amp;T ) . </wait.v.4860><wait.v.4861>I embrace the fact that I do n't know what every literary agent would love to read.

My boss does not care to hear that I am tired the next day . </wait.v.4864><wait.v.4865>I am not just talking about waiting in traffic , or waiting for that delayed LRT train , or that customer service agent or operator. What has happened is that the most important events of our lives are now marked by waiting : We wait to register a birth , we wait to get copies of the birth registration when a child enters school , we wait for our transcripts of grades , NBI clearances , work clearances. We wait to register a business , and we wait to get permits to operate the business. We wait for permits to marry , and we wait for marriage certificates. We wait for permits to build that dream house and permits to renovate. The only permit , it seems , that we dont need is a permit to die. But yes , we do need to register the death when it happens . </wait.v.4865><wait.v.4866>In 2004 , I rededicated my life to Christ , and became filled with the Holy Spirit. It was then , things began to change. I began to discover for the first time my purpose as a woman and developed a hunger and a thirst to please God more than my fleshly desires. By renewing my mind with the word of God , changing my environment , and walking in faith , the same-sex attraction disappeared and was replaced with natural desires. Today I can say that I am excited about the possibility of being married and having a family , which is not a dream that seems far fetched. I know that I will receive God ' s best as it relates to my husband and I am excited about that. On the other hand , I will never compromise my holiness and purity while waiting for the manifestation . </wait.v.4866><wait.v.4867>Im so into the vampire , were-wolf saga.

I heard a preacher tell me that God will double my blessing if I suffer ( while I wait ) . She had us shout , " I may be suffering , but payday 's coming.

And all the while He is spreading His strong wings for you to rest your weakness on and offering His everlasting Creator strength to work in you. And all He asks is that you sink down in your weariness and wait on Him.

I still need to get used to the tap , hold and click combinations , but this is something I 've been waiting for since day one : ) </wait.v.4872><wait.v.4873>God advocates waiting. In fact , he expects us to wait and in some instances commands it. In the Old Testament , God ' s expectation for us to wait on His purposes and timing is seen in the example of Abraham as he patiently waited for 25 years for the promised son. David is an example of a man who waited for God to provide the right time for him to officially take his seat on the throne of Israel. During David ' s time of waiting , Saul pursued him around the countryside with the intent to kill him. It was in this time period that many of the psalms were written which reveal David ' s dependence on God and are an example to us today of a deeply personal relationship with God . </wait.v.4873><wait.v.4874>No wonder we smile so much , even if wanly at times.

Hillary was to give a speech about food safety and was the day 's big draw. When we arrived and went into the Green Room , she disappeared up a flight of stairs. About a half hour later she appeared with Bill and Chelsea. When she walked in and saw the faces of her staff , people who have worked with the Clintons for years , she said loudly , " Oh , my God ! It 's like a family reunion ! " For this family , that is the strange truth. As they waited to go onstage together , the TV monitors showed a montage of video clips being played in the auditorium , many from speeches by both Clintons. Chelsea , looking so soign in a flirty black dress and killer shoes , stuck close to her mother; Bill stood on the other side of the room , alone , staring at his notes . </wait.v.4886><wait.v.4887>As Winston stood up O ' Brien held out a hand.

Beyond him Winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. The incident was closed.

" When I questioned why there was concern for her safety , the principal answered , " Because she is blind. " </wait.v.4888><wait.v.4889>Such are Gods waiting ones. And now , think of the God on whom we wait. " The eye of the Lord is on them that fear Him , on them that hope in His mercy; to deliver their soul from death , and to keep them alive in famine. " Not to prevent the danger of death and famine this is often needed to stir the waiting on Him but to deliver and to keep alive. For the dangers are often very real and dark; the situation , whether in the temporal or spiritual life , may appear to be utterly hopeless. There is always one hope : Gods eye is on them . </wait.v.4889><wait.v.4890>When we think of waiting , we might envision just sitting back , not doing much of anything , just waiting for something to happen. But that is not the kind of waiting the Bible is calling for.

One , we were out of feed on the circles we were on. Two , the new ewes I have , have started lambing. I was told they were not going to lamb until Feb. and well they started lambing on the circles. I ended up paying another trucker to come in a take a load of sheep for me. So , we had Krebbs Sheep Co. , Gillespie Grazing Co. , Harlow 's Hills Sheep Co. and Mike come over with sheep trucks. Gillespie , Krebbs and myself trade hauling but I will have to pay Mike $ 6-700 for trucking one load of sheep for me. We lost about 6 lambs on the circles and that was too many to wait even one more day , for me to take a second load of sheep.

From the start , we also wondered if we might be able to be parents of a waiting child. But we did n't know anything , and we were scared. Scared of what having a child with a " special need " might mean , and scared that we would not be able to give such a child the care that she needed. We decided to finish our dossier as soon as we could , then take our time learning about the waiting child program. In early March 2006 , our dossier was logged in officially , in the traditional program. With that done , we began to find out about the waiting kids </wait.v.4895><wait.v.4896>It 's great to see someone who knows God and has made the decision to keep themselves until God causes their mate to manifest. I myself had intended to do just that and finally gave in and had this two night stand shortly after my 30th birthday. I wished had never let the enemy in like that telling me not to care anymore and go ahead and do whatever. That was two years ago and I have returned to abstinence. I wish now I had kept my virginity. I mean to wait 30 years and then just kick that to the curb ...

I visited your website and may you be blessed and prosper . </wait.v.4896><wait.v.4897>Between the good and the bad , The Force Unleashed struck a very happy medium with me. It 's only 7-10 hours long , but it 's a definite time-sink for those hours , and repeated playthroughs unlock more costumes and lightsaber options. While I ca n't recommend it at full sticker price , I do highly recommend it as a rental , or waiting for it to go down in price to about $ 30 . </wait.v.4897><wait.v.4898>Some of us are waiting for provision , some for a dream or vision to be realized , some for a spouse to surrender to Christ , some for a child to be healed; however , we are ALL waiting. Whether we realize it or not , we all wait and long for Jesus to complete the finish the work He started in us. A friend of mine said recently that God once spoke to Him in a very difficult moment. He had a gun in his hand , ready to end it all when the Father spoke ... " If you do n't give up , I promise to do what you can not " . If you are desperately longing in a state of waiting , do n't give up friend. He will do what you can not . </wait.v.4898><wait.v.4899>I was using a cycle-path crossing on a busy road a couple of years ago , when an idiot over-took a waiting car and jumped the red-light. He went straight into me , writing off my bike , permenantly scarring my leg , giving me severe whiplash and multiple cuts and bruises. My helmet saved my life , as the impact of my head on the road distorted it so much out of shape it was 5 mms thick at the point of impact. Thank God that was not my head. As it was , I still received bruising to my head , despite the helmet; Without the helmet I would be dead from a crushed skull . </wait.v.4899><wait.v.4900>I had left my packing to the last minute once again , but that was no surprise to my Mother - who helped me collect all the things I needed , put me a pizza in the oven and drove me to the station. We arrived at the station with about ten minutes to spare which was nice , and the train was on time , arriving at 2007 , and got in to Princes Risborough early - a bonus. If it got in on time , I would have one minute to get to a platform over the bridge in order to catch my connection to Birmingham. I casually strolled over the bridge and waited around - the only person on the northbound platform. The second train was also on time , and I 'm now on it - just about to pull in to Warwick . </wait.v.4900><wait.v.4901>Yukio. Amiko 's living with Yukio. In frustration Ororo shook her head and reluctantly dragged open her eyelids. It was all just an absurd dream. A mix of her anxiety over her conflicting feelings for Yukio and Logan with the over-sexed fantasies of her id. So that was why Wolverine was so tall and well endowed -- why had n't she noticed that at once ? After all , it was one of the constants of being an X-Man : You did not have to wait long to know exactly what your teammates looked like naked. There would always be monsters and villains to tear off clothing , teleport it away , dissolve it in acid , burn it or get rid of it in some other creative way. Despondently , Ororo buried her face in her pillow. She would still have to go through the meeting in the morning ... </wait.v.4901><wait.v.4902>I love this whole idea ! ! !

The same past. We both knew too much about being outsiders. Maybe that ' s part of the reason he became friends with me. Doesn ' t explain the rest of our friends , or maybe it does. Orient said I liked playing dress-up better than most of our crowd , and that ' s true so far as it goes. I like feeling a little less like something waiting for a silver bullet and feeling more like part of a community. But I could join any of the thousands of little gangs that form the greater gangs of the Pack , the Rats , the Bloods. Or even one of the independent gangs : Dragonfire , the Horn Dance , Commander X ' s Kids ... I don ' t want it.

If you are ever inclined to think this waiting only is too hard or too high , they will recall you at once. They are your absolute helplessness and the absolute sufficiency of your God. Oh , enter deeply into the entire sinfulness of all that is of self , and do not think of letting self have anything to say one single moment. Enter deeply into your utter and unceasing inability to ever change what is evil in you , or to bring forth anything that is spiritually good. Enter deeply into your relationship of dependence on God , to receive from Him every moment what He gives. Enter deeper still into His covenant of redemption , with His promise to restore more gloriously than ever what you have lost. And , by His Son and Spirit , He will unceasingly give you His actual divine presence and power. And thus , wait upon your God continually and only . </wait.v.4911><wait.v.4912>So they watched and waited and snuck up on strings , and discovered that these little rascals are using MOTION to do it.

David had to wait something like 15 years from the time he was first anointed by Samuel to the time he became king over Judah ( as recorded in our text ) . It was another seven years before David was anointed king over all Israel. This means David waited over 20 years of his life to be made king.

Or another example for me was when I was a little kid I would get so excited when my dad would be coming home from work or a business trip.

They could have included the young man ' s relatives; at one point he had believed that his father had been executed.

I told her that my teacher made an example of my homework in Polish class again today and she nodded and looked away as though she had barely heard me. Her face was pale and drawn as she waited for me to finish my afternoon snack of tea and a slice of bread and butter. Sometimes I think that if I had said something , anything about my concern that day I might have been able to change the course of events that were to follow. That is the emotional me talking.

The public needs access to lists so that they can make more informed decisions. Referrals to specialists are often a mysterious process to patients. A patient may languish on a particular physician 's waiting list for a long time without ever knowing that another physician could provide the needed service much sooner. Ontario 's Cardiac Care Network has a publicly accessible Web site that reports waiting times for heart surgery by location , 22 as does the Montr al-Centre R gie R gional.23 The trend , accelerated in the United States , is toward much more openness and transparency in the system , including public access to data such as physician-specific and hospital-specific outcomes . </wait.v.4979><wait.v.4980>We ' ve been waiting patiently to see the full extent of the iPhone OS 3.0 ' s superpowers.

Specifically , as if she was choking him from behind and he made attempts to get her off of him. The split lip and bloody nose again would come from the back of Chris Head probably slamming into her face to attempt to free himself.

Either God wants to strengthen us by delaying deliverance or He wants to sanctify us. It is when we wait on the Lord we will understand why. Here ' s a classic passage on this subject : Isaiah 59 : 1 , 2 , 9 , 10 , " Listen ! The Lord is not too weak to save you , and He is not becoming deaf Your sins have cut you off from God It is because of all this evil that deliverance is far from us. That ' s why God doesn ' t punish those who injure us. No wonder we are in darkness when we expect light ! Even at brightest noontime , we fall down as though it were dark !

Have you ever heard of the game Chicken . It can be done in many different situations , but the gist of the game is that one person/team is heading for a disastrous situation and the game is to see who chickens out first. In the 50 ' s young people use to drive their cars on the wrong side of the road and see how long they could head toward oncoming traffic before they chickened out and pulled back into their correct lane -- A dangerous game indeed. Honestly , the game should have been called Stupid , because so many didn ' t make it back to their lane in time. In many ways people play this same game with God.

And the way she wrote about Elling was as if she ' d just been chorined , to continue where Bennett left off. I just loved it to bits , she admits. The last time I felt quite like that at the Bush was watching the premiere of Beautiful Thing years ago. I ' m clearly not alone in my enthusiasm for Elling.

In the classic passage of spiritual warfare , five out of six weapons are for defense ! ( Eph 6 : 14-17 ) . This explains how waiting on God is the most powerful means of wrestling against Satan.

Sitting quietly in the line , waiting my turn , having my order/query/whatever stuffed up and politely pointing it out is a lot less effective than coming in , yelling for attention and demanding my needs.

Its driveway is cluttered not with Rolls Royces but with big old taxis whose drivers are puffing away , waiting for drunken tourists to tumble out. Its poker room is a corral of six tables covered in a disturbingly flesh-colored felt that you almost expect to bleed if scratched badly; the poker chips look as battered and shiny as ancient Roman coins. When I step in to sign up for the tournament , only one table is active , playing 2/4 limit poker , a game guaranteed to minimize your losses. I could kill some time there , but I remind myself that I ' m here to take risks , not to pose before the gondolas at the Venetian for souvenir pictures. Of course , with my floppy hat and my camera bag , I look every bit the tourist , but all that ' s camouflage for the killer within at least that ' s what I tell myself to calm my nerves . </wait.v.5055><wait.v.5056>When she came home on Saturday , she found a vase of roses on her front doorstep.

When we came back at 12 , the trains were still packed and I asked an RTD employee to call dispatch to see if they could get buses to take people to the Broadway station. The employee told me that this confusion was just standard business for RTD ( this is a great way to run a transit solution ) . We returned home at nearly three AM. Although RTD said that they had put more people and trains on duty it was clear it was just business as usual and RTD did not do anything to plan for the demand . </wait.v.5064><wait.v.5065>On average one does not gain awareness of impending disaster from within , more so from local or cable newscasting.

Nearly every citizen has waited outside for a bus in a grimace and damp business suit because the weatherman spoke dramatically of sunshine and cloudless skies instead of four inches of rain. Misinformation has caused the ill fate of many people including several workers of the World Trade Center buildings who returned to their desks per order instead of escaping to safety and thus , survival.

So , I will close with this encouragement : God rewards those who wait on Him. In Isaiah 64 : 4 , Isaiah reminds Israel that their waiting on God would be rewarded :  Since ancient times no one has heard , no ear has perceived , no eye has seen any God besides you , who acts on behalf of those who wait for him. We see a similar thought in Isaiah 30 : 18 ,  Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; he rises to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him ! And again in Isaiah 40 : 31 , he reminds us ,  those who wait on the Lord will renew their strength.

Others , like myself , who prefer organization might like prayer beads. Take some time to think about it , then do some research. Do some reading , ask around or search the Internet.

Because they just love it when you do that to them ! </wait.v.5119><wait.v.5120>Men test God by behaviour which constitutes in effect a defiant challenge to him to prove the truth of his words and the goodness and justice of his ways ( Ex. 17 : 2; Nu. 14 : 22; Pss. 78 : 18 , 41 , 56; 95 : 9; 106 : 14; Mal. 3 : 15; Acts 5 : 9; 15 : 10 ) . The place-name Massah was a permanent memorial of one such temptation ( Ex. 17 : 7; Dt. 6 : 16 ) . Thus to goad God betrays extreme irreverence , and God himself forbids it ( Dt. 6 : 16; cf. Mt. 4 : 7; 1 Cor. 10 : 9ff. ) . In all distresses God ' s people should wait on him in quiet patience , confident that in due time he will meet their need according to his promise ( cf.

JUST YESTERDAY at our doctor 's clinic , I met a proud daddy holding a NINE day old infant girl in his arms. His wife entered the waiting room , walking at a pretty good pace , but I noticed her steps were wobbly and tentative and she still looked at least 5 months pregnant.

Video iPods are equiped with a large HDD to cope with all it ' s media , you can ' t expect a mere 8G to suffice if one wants to integrate a phone , media player and browser. On the other hand Jobs did say that it is a new revolutionary product like the iPod and Macintosh.

It was unnaturally quiet except for the steady ticking of the clock that lay on the desk before her . </wait.v.5143><wait.v.5144>Therefore we should humble ourselves before God. As we wait for His guidance we should let our words be few. To obey the absolute sovereignty of God we need to wait quietly and remember His repeated grace to us.

God will then cause us to understand His absolute sovereignty. Then we can obey His will. When we acknowledge God ' s Lordship; He will lead us so that all things will go well with our souls and bodies. He will lead us into a full abundance of life. The fundamental power through which we can live blessed lives is in God. Until God returns to us and leads us we have to wait quietly. We have no need of being hasty . </wait.v.5146><wait.v.5147>( 7 ) Some waiting is not pious. How often we are prone to wait when we should work and to work when we should wait. Waiting to do what we know to be right , what God has commanded us to do , is not pious; it is sin ( James 4 : 17 ) . Waiting to accept the offer of salvation and forgiveness of sins in Jesus Christ is a most dangerous thing ( Hebrews 3 : 12-15 ) . The waiting which pleases God is when He has made a promise , which we can not bring about ourselves apart from unbelief and disobedience to His Word . </wait.v.5147><wait.v.5148>To do that , I 'd most likely have to gather all my multiple personalities . gymnastics - throwing herself into the air and praying on the way down. . ..

It was 45 minutes before the first person in line , having waited since 1 AM , walked out with his new iPhone. AT &amp;T employees came out to quell the crowd , which was quickly growing restless. As you 've no doubt heard , the iPhone 3G launch has been a clusterf*ck of global proportions , with Apple 's iTunes servers non-responsive most of the day. There were two issues at this particular AT &amp;T location : the store 's POS terminals were n't all operating properly , and they were having trouble activating iPhones via iTunes a necessary step before the phone will work. At about 9 AM , the assistant manager let us know that folks would just be sent home to activate the phone via iTunes later.

In all His dealings with man , sinner or saint , He is patient throughout. If He had not been so , everyone of us would have perished long ago. As He is patient with us , it is only right that He expects us to be patient in our relationship with Him. This is what the Bible calls as " Waiting on God. " So much is preached and published on the subjects of prayer , worship and meditation. But specific teaching on waiting on God is scarce though this exercise is quite essential for Christian discipleship and growth.

When waiting on God , we need to be very careful that we keep His ways; out of these we never can expect to find Him. " Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness; those that remember Thee in Thy ways. " Isa 64 : 5. We may be sure that God is never and nowhere to be found but in His ways.

He knows us better than we do. He is constantly at work in our lives. Do you think He may be preparing something greater for you that 's impossible to do with your limited powers ? Are you willing to wait patiently with faith and hope of a tremendous outcome ? God wants good things for us. Sometimes that means getting a better job or relationship than we could have dreamed.

Be content to receive from God each moment the inworking of His mighty grace and life , and waiting on God will become the renewal of your strength to run in His ways and not be weary , to walk in His paths and never faint.

Somewhere in there , the flock of doc 's showed up. Then they decided to give another unit of red blood cells. Later , Scott was having some bowel problems , and went off to rest in the family room. He was feeling a bit better later , and he and I went off to the Northlake Tavern for pizza. While we were waiting for pizza , Scott told me about some web research he did.

Yes , they could be right , but let them be stretched a little further and see how easily they will give up. I have always wondered why some people can not take pain , but I found out when I hit the bottom of my life and I almost gave up. But when I sought the strength of the Lord and got it , I was able to bear the unbearable. When you see people who are really waiting on the Lord strong and joyful , having their circumstance under control , believe me , they have the strength of the Lord. Men who can face physically hopeless situation with joy are doing so under the influence of a supernatural strength of God . </wait.v.5200><wait.v.5201>( 6 ) Refusing to resort to the manipulation of others ( like one ' s husband or wife or child ) because we don ' t want to wait on the Lord to work.

We then waited at an intersection-free stoplight counting down to zero as a soldier on guard gave his comrades across the street the finger from his post atop a small building. When the inexplicable light turned green , we rode up into the hills , past some military displays to an observation deck at the edge of a sea cliff. Not content to merely tempt fate by standing too close to the edge , I went to get closer pictures to a bunch of Danger : Landmines signs nearby while PR climbed across a small rocky bridge and up to an outcrop of stone high above the waves. There was also a military museum with , ironically and suitably depending on your point of view , an alternative serviceman sitting at the reception desk overlooking the old guns and other military paraphernalia on display.

Since she could not tell me whether they would be coming morning or afternoon , there would be no way I could schedule around my meetings during the week and I would have to wait for installation until Saturday , December 6. Angie would make the arrangements , ship me the stacking kit , and I could return the other one later. She just wanted to confirm one thing and she would call me back in 30 minutes.

Each toilet just drops straight into a wheelie bin , and each time you use it you chuck a scoop of sawdust down after your business. They use no water or chemicals , they don ' t smell bad ( even on day 3 ! ) , the bins are emptied into a truck that leaves 3 or 4 times over the festival to a nearby farm where the whole lot is composted.

I was touched from tail to toe. ( A second recollection. While sitting on our beds chatting , I said to ( Peng ) , " It 's a wonderful feeling to know that when there is someone in the world who is concerned for human dignity , freedom and self-expression for a given people , that there are persons around willing and eager to help.

I thought about calling Kevin from the pay phone downstairs , but the prices were exorbitantly high , so I decided to go out and buy something for breakfast instead. I passed Mara and Hillary 's dorm on the way , so I buzzed Mara 's room to say goodbye. She was trying to clean her room and glad of help , so I took some paper to the recycling bin and then left to get both of us some food. She offered me money , but I declined since I had more than I would need and was going to give the rest away anyway. We talked a bit when I came back , and she gave me a romance novel for the plane.

It speaks of the evildoer who prospereth in his way , and calls on the believer not to fret himself. When we see men around us prosperous and happy while they forsake Gods ways , and ourselves left in difficulty or suffering , we are in danger of first fretting at what appears so strange , and then gradually yielding to seek our prosperity in their path. The psalm says , " Fret not thyself; trust in the Lord , and do good. Rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for Him; cease from anger , and forsake wrath. Depart from evil , and do good; the Lord forsaketh not His saints. The righteous shall inherit the land. The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

" There 's both an upside and a downside to this reflection on waiting. The downside is that " waiting on the Holy Spirit " could become an excuse. It can become an excuse for doing nothing or else an excuse for eventually saying that my own human conclusions about something are truly revelations from God . </wait.v.5257><wait.v.5258>Well. This one ' s a hard for me. As I was a BF that was soo into making my ex wait and wait and wait. But I have learned to be better at that sort of thing.

Once I turned my life over to God and realized how precious my body is and that it is the temple where the Holy Ghost dwells , I no longer allow the enemy into thinking that way. I am not a virgin but I am celibate and will remain so until I marry. Young and older ladies-do n't be tricked by the enemy. If he loves you-he WILL wait !

However , the assurance that I was not ever going to be able to speak again came two days before I was to go home and I allowed the reality of going back to my very busy life silent overwhelm me . </wait.v.5266><wait.v.5267>The problem with waiting is the temptation of demons ... an emphasis on the future rather than the present ... of what is to come rather than what is. And so the question is n't so much , " What are you waiting for ? " as , " What are you doing here ?

For example , if we need a job or think we need a change of employment , we should pray and ask God for wisdom , for information , and for His sovereign leading , but we may also need to prepare for a job with education and training. Then we need to pursue looking for a job by putting together a resume , checking the classifieds , submitting applications , talking to friends , and going to employment agencies.

It said : ABS CBN reported to have received more than 100-Million pesos worth of donations in cash &amp;in kind but they have only released around 130 thousand of relief bags. Assuming that each bag contained 100 pesos worth of goods , that is only 13-Million pesos. There are more than 80-million pesos worth of goods and cash in their possession still.

I wondered also if any mortal eyes would ever again mark its passage , or any mortal ears be thrilled and fascinated by the swelling volume of its majestic sound. I do not think that they will.

So here ' s the million-dollar question : Are kids going to like this book ? And the answer is : Darn tooting. Darn tooting they will , because if nothing else Waiting for Normal is infinitely readable. Here ' s why I think the book is going to work for the kiddies. It ' s clocking in at 304 pages , but it reads zippy quick. I didn ' t feel a lull or a gap in action at any point. The drama is focused pretty squarely on the family situation , which means we don ' t have to have the rote scene where the best friend at school suddenly befriends the popular snob. Also , my library often hosts a pack of sixth grade girls who only want one thing : realistic girl books. Finding titles for the tween set is always difficult because you don ' t want to hand them stuff that ' s too mature and you don ' t want babyish fare either. Waiting for Normal is going to be perfect for all parties involved , and I can not wait to get it into their hands . </wait.v.5307><wait.v.5308>*The incident with which I have illustrated my opinion of the policy of those who would have us wait for a " reaction at the North , " may be found in Milman 's Latin Christianity , vol. iii. p133 . </wait.v.5308><wait.v.5309>But it was one thing to lose your luggage and have somewhere in the world a cosy home and a warm , caring family waiting for her.

East TN Friends of Babies with Special Needs , an organization which provided services to Tucker ( our whole family ) following his stroke , had contacted me awhile back and asked what they could do as a tribute to Tucker. Monty and I told them that while we were in the hospital in DC , one activity that Tucker LOVED was riding around the unit in a wagon. The room often seems to get smaller with each day of your stay , and a wagon ride is a WONDERFUL way to change the view a bit. The only problem is that the wagons can be hard to come by and are sometimes even obtained only after being on a waiting list . </wait.v.5313><wait.v.5314>As we motor away from the coast , the captain looks through binoculars for the boiling mass of birds and bait , locally known as carnada .

Have you ever noticed how many of the Psalms are written during times of waiting ? The question , How long. . . ? is found fairly frequently in the psalms , as is , wait on the Lord. David is often the author of such waiting psalms. Waiting on the Lord is good for us. It helps us to develop patience and endurance. It calls upon us to exercise faith in God 's promises and to act on the basis of what God has said , rather than upon what we see. Waiting enhances our appetite for the good things God has in store for us. Waiting requires us to deny fleshly lusts and to set aside our desire for immediate gratification some easier way. Waiting is one of the ways that we take up our cross and follow Him. </wait.v.5316><wait.v.5317>So I currently have my FireWire cable running from my Mac to an external hard drive.

After gently reminding the publishers I still exist , finally some months later they give the go ahead , we agree delivery dates and I start writing the whole draft , typing up the scribbled notes , adding resourced material , working out the diagrams needed creating what I call the Master first draft , which includes further reading list , bibliography and appendix.

The fulfillment of the words may , at times , be in such striking interpositions of God 's power that all can join in the cry , " Lo , this is our God . . . this is the LORD. " They may equally become true in spiritual experience , when God 's people , in their waiting times , become so conscious of His presence that , in holy awe , souls feel , " Lo , this is our God . . . this is the LORD. " It is this , alas , that is too much missed in our meetings for worship. The godly minister has no more difficult , no more solemn , no more blessed task , than to lead his people out to meet God. And , before he preaches , he must bring each one into contact with Him. " We are now here in the presence of God " these words of Cornelius show the way in which Peter 's audience was prepared for the coming of the Holy Spirit.

I also like the trilogies that put out the books 3 months in a row , or every other month.

I sure hope you find it worth the wait ! ! </wait.v.5336><wait.v.5337>What I really hate is Oversized Hardcovers that come out first. For example , this week Marvel released X-Men : World ' s Apart ( which already bugs me that they won ' t just call it a Storm mini ) as a Oversized Hardcover. Why does this four issue mini that is not a flagship title , critically acclaimed , or a high seller given this treatment ? Nothing against this title , I ' m slightly bitter because I really want to get it. But for HCs I have to wait six months to a year. Or the Uncanny/X-Men : Manifest Destiny Hardcovers a thirty dollar hard cover that has about 6-7 issues each. X-Men : Messiah Complex and most other Oversized Hardcovers generally contain 13 issues for the SAME PRICE ! So now I have to wait for a TPB that I most likely won ' t get because the TPB will also be overpriced as well. Am I going to get the single issues ? No , like I said I stick to TPBs. So I ' ll but them during a bargin sale , if at all . </wait.v.5337><wait.v.5338>" If all else fails , " Doc clarified. " You might want to wait a day or two to see if this is something temporary.

( She was married and pregnant at the time ) . I talked with her , and took the test home , deciding to wait until my boyfriend came over to take the test. Well , curiosity killed the cat ! I was pregnant. I did n't believe it at first , and I bought a second test ( thinking the first was a cheap test , and maybe it did n't work ) . The second confirmed my worst nightmare.

It had all kinds of mottled black areas in it. Very suspiciously black , gross metallic things. So I did what anyone would do : I called up the company , waited for a long time on hold , and then got somebody who wanted to know the secret code number on top of the can. I gave it to her and she went off to check with all the scientists who were hanging around on standby just waiting for consumers ' questions . </wait.v.5345><wait.v.5346>Each of the lectionary readings for today speaks of waiting. Isaiah is waiting and longing for God to intervene in his world where things seem all wrong. " Oh that you would tear open the heavens and come down " ( 64 : 1 ) he cries to God. The Psalmist pleads with God for forgiveness , " how long will you be angry with your peoples prayers ? " is the cry. " Come to save us ! " In his letter to the Corinthian church , Paul encourages the people who are waiting for the return of Christ. And in the gospel lesson , Jesus tells his followers to stay alert and cautions them to be watchful as they wait for his return . </wait.v.5346><wait.v.5347>" This is a rich state , and our inventory changes so much , " Barney says.

But I am going to wait on God to bless me with the man he has for me . </wait.v.5348><wait.v.5349>In today ' s psalm the Psalmist also waits for the Lord. He waits for the Lord all day long , and he asks that those who wait not be put to shame. He waits because those who wait will be rewarded with steadfast love and faithfulness. This is the who and why of his waiting. As in Jeremiah and Luke , there is certainty that the God he waits for will be faithful. But we can learn more here about how we should wait. The Psalmist ' s waiting is not passive either. He asks the Lord to continue to show him truth and teach him about righteousness. He continues to learn. He must not just be alert and faithful in his waiting , but he must be faithful in his learning and doing as well . </wait.v.5349><wait.v.5350>Today I 've burned the oil , and the aroma still fills my home.

As it was a day or two before a 1st Thursday Night Hook In , she suggested that I wait until then as it was easier to talk about it in person than describe the process over the phone. When we got together , she described her beginning point as the pig tail , then proceeded to show me how everything had to go together just right. It ended up being just easier for her to do it , me not being familiar with the process and she being able to do them in her sleep. The same was true for the braiding part. In no time flat she was able to whip out about 3 feet of of braided length , folding in the wool expertly as she went. It was a thing of beauty to watch her work. I did do a few braids , just make sure I got the concept down , but I was hesitant to interrupt her rhythm . </wait.v.5354><wait.v.5355>Their Christmas cards turned out totally chic and unique too bad we can ' t show you the whole card here.

When I grow discouraged or disheartened , I think of the verse in Psalms where it says that as I wait on Him He shall strengthen my heart. I guess the most important thing in life right now is to behold the beauty of the Lord  that was David ' s greatest desire and it should be mine too ( Psalm 27 : 4 ) ! </wait.v.5361><wait.v.5362>Our souls are so little accustomed to hold fellowship with God; the God on whom we wait so of ten appears to hide Himself. We who have to wait are often tempted to fear that we do not wait aright , that our faith is too feeble , that our desire is not as upright or as earnest as it should be , that our surrender is not complete. Amid all these causes of fear or doubt , how blessed to hear the voice of God , " Wait on the Lord ! Be strong , and let thine heart take courage ! YEA , WAIT THOU ON THE LORD ! " Let nothing in heaven or earth or hell - let nothing keep thee from waiting on thy God in full assurance that it can not be in vain . </wait.v.5362><wait.v.5363>Starsky sat back in his chair and said unabashedly , Well , you can ' t fault a guy for trying.

My car only carries about 85lbs ( 14gal , 513kW ) of gas but it ' s carrying around 1000lbs of engine/tank/pumps/etc. to use it. That leaves a systemic energy density of 472W/lb , vs. 6032W/lb for just the fuel. Considering that the Roadster is only carrying ~200lb of drivetrain around ( along with 1000lb of batteries containing 53kW ) its system density is around 44 W/lb.

To a large extent Doctors have control of waiting lists but putting patients on them. This has alot to do with referal patterns by GPs. Do the GPs consider the amount of patients already waiting when they refer to their favoured specialist ? Why do n't Specialsts want their waiting lists publicised ? If a patient is waiting too long why does n't the specialist suggest someone who can do it quicker ?

We were huddled together in a rocky chamber , some ten feet square , and scared enough we looked; that is , except Ayesha , who was standing calmly with her arms folded , and waiting for the lamps to burn up. The chamber appeared to be partly natural , and partly hollowed out of the top of the cone. The roof of the natural part was formed of the swinging stone , and that of the back part of the chamber , which sloped downwards , was hewn from the live rock.

Managers in hospitals , regional health authorities or provincial ministries ( for some highly specialized services ) are accountable for how the system performs and for balancing competing resource demands. If they do not have complete , accurate and up-to-date information about waiting lists and waiting times , they can not make informed decisions. They will , instead , be forced to respond to criticisms and charges often based on individual physicians ' privately held lists. These lists are almost certainly unstandardized and unaudited , but are no less useful to their owners in debates about system quality and making resource claims . </wait.v.5383><wait.v.5384>I am stood in a bus queue but I am not waiting for a bus. I decided to do it because my other options are just as nullifying and because I heard that we spend an average of twenty two days of our life waiting in queues. As I never go shopping and very rarely venture out into public I thought I better get my twenty two days out of the way whilst I am young and have the ability to stand upright for long periods.

Priest Zacharias kept on serving God till his very old age while waiting for an answer to his prayer for a child ( Lk 1 : 5-14 ) . David once lamented , " I am exhausted from crying for help; my throat is parched and dry. My eyes are swollen with weeping , waiting for my God to help me " ( Psa 69 : 3 ) . Nevertheless he kept on composing songs for God which became the Messianic prophecies and promises , like this Psalm. Servants of God down through the ages have testified that they had been soaking their pillows at nights with tears , but God anointed them with the oil of gladness when they stood on the pulpits.

We compared groups using 2 tests for categorical variables. We used Spearman 's coefficient of rank to compare differences between actual and requested waiting times , and we used the Cox proportional hazards model to identify independent predictors of major cardiac events ( death , MI and CHF ) . Variables included in the univariate analyses were chosen for clinical importance and relevance. The multivariate analyses included all the variables to provide magnitude of effect adjusting for each variable. Symptoms classified according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society functional classification16 and the New York Heart Association functional classification17 were handled as class III/IV versus class I/II based on a previous report that patients with higher grades of symptoms may be at higher risk for adverse events.18 </wait.v.5413><wait.v.5414>Estara : It ' s a fab series.

Seven was as conscious as anyone on the starship , if not more so , of how limited Janeway 's time really was , of how difficult it was to completely isolate the captain from the demands of her responsibilities.

The Donn would be cool , but I do n't think they would race her in that race w/o a prep first. If she did she would face QR at his best distance over his favorite track. That would be the way to kick the year off ! </wait.v.5472><wait.v.5473>As for me , I was working. I had to let those squirrels know who was boss. Some of the other dogs tried to help me out with my job which was okay. So I spent my time running over to a couple different oak trees just when the squirrel had taunted me enough by coming down out of the tree onto the grass. Those squirrels. I would take off , running at them , a few other dogs might come too , and we 'd jump up the trunk of the tree. Then , I 'd turn and run back to Joan and Lee and wait for , yet again , another opportunity to police. I did this for quite some time ! </wait.v.5473><wait.v.5474>I 'm not into resort or cruise collections because honestly I find most of them to be a bit much , or perhaps an over-extension of the designers prior or next collection. But who am I to deny a designer their right to flood the market with collections ? This is more of a personal stance than a creative one. All that aside I 'm completely smitten with the cruise 2010 collection from Vionnet , the fashion house of master couturier Madeleine Vionnet. The house is being reintroduced with Rodolfo Paglialunga as the creative director and what a timely feat , considering there is an exhibition in Paris now honouring the designer. She knew how to dress the female body , which is an art not a technique. The pieces below match the draping and ruche that Vionnet was known for , so kudos to Mr. Paglialunga for capturing the essence of Vionnet. I 'm excited and ca n't wait to see more ! I leave you with you a quote from Madeleine Vionnet , designers make dresses , artists make dreams . </wait.v.5474><wait.v.5475>" Jessica Simpson Keeps Us All Waiting For Part Two Of The Ear Wax Drama " She 's not keeping me waiting by any means.

I am growing old and I don ' t want to die with a burden on my head , says Ghaus , who is now more worried for his son , Zubair , who is handling the business with him these days.

Again , the repetition underscores the psalmist 's commitment and resolve. Do you see the significance of this picture ? You who have to work nightshift know the tedium , the nauseating boredom , when there is little work to do. It is tough enough enduring a dayshift under those conditions let alone a night shift. On a nightshift , under such circumstances , one can hardly wait until the morning comes. There is agonizing anticipation. You wait and wait , and the minutes seem like hours. Now , think of someone who is a sentinel on guard. It is lonely and quiet. There is no other activity; and he walks back and forth , back and forth , longing for the morning. But such longing does not compare to that of the psalmist. The psalmist anxiously waits for the coming of God with grace and healing -- the full experience of sins forgiven and joy restored . </wait.v.5492><wait.v.5493>Some women see the signs but they stick around because they are waiting for him to change , waiting for it to get better.

He looked like a petty clerk. Without identifying himself , he opened his little bag , took out a sheaf of blank paper , and forthwith began very formally to ask me once again all the routine questions I had already answered a score of times. I felt very strange , as if I were repeating a had dream. " What is your name ? " What is your profession ? " and so forth. This interrogation was carried over into a second day , at the end of which I was asked to sign the record as a formal statement. Then followed about ten days in which I was left entirely alone. I learned later that all the formalities had been completed , and all these investigators and committees and advisors were now waiting for the final decision to be made at the highest level . </wait.v.5495><wait.v.5496>Oh yay ! ! !

I had the film in a ziploc bag just waiting to take them to be developed but somehow that bag has disappeared. Either my sweet lil daughter who loves to hide stuff has done something with them or they got thrown out when we moved into our new house last year. I catch alot of nice fish but do n't say much cause I do n't have anything to back it up.

Blessings was the spot , the place where everybody came for a little pleasant conversation. Never mind that Blessings was a beauty shop. The way people ranted and raved throughout the place , it could easily have been mistaken for a town hall meeting arena. While women with nappy heads waited patiently on the faux leather sofa for hours and sisters with half-wet locks bent over shampoo bowls scratching their dandruff , the conversation between the two beauticians brewed on. Once again the subject had turned to the Juice , and as usual , the conversation was heated. So heated , that even the time-conscious clients had to get in on it . </wait.v.5506><wait.v.5507>Almost all of my hand-selected Brit care package is gone. The Kit-Kats have all been munched upon ( including the cloyingly sweet , strawberry-white chocolate ones by my husband ) , the prawn cocktail crisps have all been marveled at , and the Cadbury Crunchie bars eaten quickly , the honeycomb centers crackling away. But a few choice morsels still remained , among them a box of cake mix , waiting for the right moment to be baked , or the right person for whom to bake . </wait.v.5507><wait.v.5508>Oh , if we would wait and wait patiently , I tell you what the result would be. There would spring up a relationship between us and Christ so close and so tender that we should afterward be amazed at how we formerly could have lived with the idea : " I am surrendered to Christ.

The branch calls us to absolute surrender . </wait.v.5508><wait.v.5509>It was amazing and pleasing to me that my heart shifted in this manner.

Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged. There was no real reason for discouragement , since nothing very dreadful had occurred; but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would never learn to like teaching. And how terrible it would be to be doing something you did n't like every day for. . .well , say forty years. Anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there , or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home. Before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor , and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison 's on an overdressed female he had seen in a Charlottetown store. " She looked like a head-on collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare. " </wait.v.5510><wait.v.5511>I never waited tables , they always made me hostess. But I do understand.

But she can ' t imagine waiting around for him because she ' s used to being able to talk to him multiple times a day , and she ' d be going from that to just staring at his picture.

I stood for two hours at the very front of the Meeting Point area scanning the face of every single person who arrived to EZE the international airport of Buenoes Aires. After some time and listening to the people around me it turned out that most of us that had been there awhile were waiting for the same flight the flight from Miami.

This stands opposed to running ahead of the Lord and taking matters into our own hands and turning to our own human strategies. For instance , when one ' s spouse is acting in disobedience to the Word ( as it is perceived by the other spouse ) the great temptation is to nag and brow beat the other partner with arguments and complaining , etc. , but Peter ' s direction to us in such situations is far different.

I 'm completely in love with the story I 'm writing , and I 'm eager to tell it in a way that will do it justice. That helps me not get impatient or rush the work. Even though I 've never been published , and even though the publishing world may use my manuscript to decorate their offices with crudely folded origami animals , I ca n't wait to finish the novel.

" Of course we know that there are times when waiting is not the only or even the best approach. There are times in which we are required to act with courage even when all the evidence is not yet in. But most of us tend to act too impulsively. Most of us need to learn the art of patient waiting , an orientation of the heart that will allow the answer to germinate quietly within before rushing off to act. " For , " as St. Paul put it , " who hopes for what he sees ? But if we hope for what we do not see , we wait for it in patience.

This is what we ought to seek and dare to expect , because God is able and waiting to work it in us . </wait.v.5547><wait.v.5548>Since Bible prophecies are often fully understood only after they are fulfilled or are in the process of fulfillment , we will have to wait and see. It is of interest , though , that Paul compared the sudden destruction following the cry of " Peace and security ! " to the birth pang of a pregnant woman. Over a period of about nine months , an expectant mother becomes increasingly aware of the baby that is growing within her. She may be able to hear her baby ' s heartbeat or feel its movements in the womb. It may even kick her. The signs often become more and more pronounced until , one day , she feels a sharp pain , a pang , indicating that the hoped-for event the baby ' s birth has arrived. Hence , however the prophesied cry of " Peace and security ! " may be fulfilled , it will lead to a sudden , painful , but ultimately blessed event the destruction of wickedness and the beginning of a new world system . </wait.v.5548><wait.v.5549>Alicia has had AMPLE opportunity to leave like when he was deployed to war.

After seventeen years of marriage , Nava and Benny still loved each other , but their daily interactions were characterized by a measure of mutual politeness mixed with suppressed impatience. She didn ' t like his bureaucratic dabblings; nor did she like the way his work followed him home or the evenhanded congeniality that he dispensed abundantly and indiscriminately.

What I did n't anticipate was that people would panic and start hording film now. For example , Polaroid 600 film ( the integrated stuff that most people are familiar with ) is supposed to be manufactured until at least January of next year according to Polaroid 's own discontinuation schedule , but most places have been completely sold out. That 's not a bad thing except that when they get new film in stock they 're charging almost double the original price. Polaroid film has always been pricey ( $ 1/exposure is usually a good price ) , but $ 2 an exposure is insane. I was going to wait until January to stock up , but seeing that kind of mark up has motivated me to find packs locally ( for the decent price of $ 1.10/exposure ) . </wait.v.5604><wait.v.5605>04.02.09 22 : 18 Asa : Guys , she said she was planning on redoing it from the start.

If you ca n't reproduce it , set a trap for it by building a logging system , a special one if you have to , that can log what you guess you need when it really does occur. Resign yourself to that if the bug only occurs in production and not at your whim , this is may be a long process. The hints that you get from the log may not provide the solution but may give you enough information to improve the logging. The improved logging system may take a long time to be put into production. Then , you have to wait for the bug to reoccur to get more information.

This was partly because going into her seventh year in this job she still somehow maintained her belief in free speech and the separation between media and government. Partly it was because she knew Danny would smile at her and possibly ask , " How are you ?

Undefeatable ! " Achieving density somewhere between Budgie and Johnny Thunders &amp;the Heartbreakers , the She Wolves are in a pretty good place if you desire equal portions of catchy tunes and heavy rock. Bonus points accrue when the band backs the mighty Syl Sylvain on a wall-of-sound take on " Sheena Is a Punk Rocker "; at song 's end is a clip of Joey Ramone fondly musing about seeing Syl 's New York Dolls at the Mercer Arts Center.

It is unfair to do this and probably illegal in some way , too. Lionhead is losing a huge customer base because of this. I personally will not be buying/renting any game made by them in the future , and I encourage all of you to do the same.

I loved this book and it drew me in with Grace ' s obsession with her wolf that saved her from certain death. How she knew she could see more behind its dark eyes than just an animal. Maggie Stiefvater ' s realistic portrayal of two young people who struggle to find acceptance from their families and friends is something many of us can relate to and something which is explored with taste and understanding. Grace and Sam ' s relationship remains strong despite the fear that it could all be lost with the touch of a cold breeze. I found myself clinging onto this fragile relationship as much as the characters themselves despite the fact I knew in my heart the end was inevitable.

As he unpacked , he explained that if he did n't come back , he wanted me to know that. And , he did n't understand why I cried.

The philosopher Thomas Nagel argues for a language of sexual immaturity that he calls " asymmetrical " sexual practices.

Carla was there and Kathryn wasnt , and when it came down to it , he needed affection from someone and he needed to express his feelings , too. It was ironic that now he noticed how Kathryn always showed him affection , just in her way. He didnt regret his relationship with Carla , but the baby was unplanned. Oh , he was excited about it coming , but now that it was inside Kathryn , he wasnt sure what excited him more , that there was a baby coming or that Kathryn was carrying it. Carlas treatment of Kathryn upset him because she rarely had anything good to say about her , and when Chakotay spent time with Kathryn , Carla would rant about it for hours. It didnt matter that his job required him to spend nearly everyday with her , it still made Carla mad.

Can we get something going ( like petitions or constituent email ) to pressure the border state governors to order their respective guard units to enforce the border. Posse Comitatus does not apply when ordered by a states governor and they would not be acting against citizens anyway. They could even have the guard unit ' s construction battalions build the wall. I think the governors would be more vulnerable and easier to pressure to act than waiting for the federal government to do anything about it. The senators and congressmen want more voters and want amnesty. If enough people in these border states threaten their governors I think they can get something done.

Explaining why he waited to publish his " radical " book until after he retired , even though he had been speaking much of his thoughts quietly in church groups over the years , he said that colleagues and parishioners had urged him to wait. They did not think it appropriate for a minister to say what he really believed while still serving the church. I think that is appalling. It is also sad and basically dishonest , on his part and the church's. My decision to leave the church ( small " c " -- Presbyterian ) was to be honest with myself and the people who looked on me as a leader even though " just a chaplain " ( no one would ever say this , but it was reinforced over the years ) . My further decision to leave the Church ( capital " C " -- Christianity ) was of course more profound and radical. But it really came natural to me.

It is the confession of our desire to sink into our nothingness and to let Him work and reveal Himself. Do let us wait quietly.

If we draw nigh to God , it must be with a true heart. There must be perfect integrity , whole-heartedness , in our dealing with God. As we read in the next Psalm ( 26 : 1 , 11 ) . " Judge me , O Lord , for I have walked in mine integrity , " " As for me , I walk in my integrity , " there must be perfect uprightness or single-heartedness before God , as it is written , " His righteousness is for the upright in heart. " The soul must know that it allows nothing sinful , nothing doubtful; if it is indeed to meet the Holy One , and receive His full blessing , it must be with a heart wholly and singly given up to His will. The whole spirit that animates us in the waiting must be , " Let integrity and uprightness " - Thou seest that I desire to come so to Thee , Thou knowest I am looking to Thee to work them perfectly in me; - let them " preserve me , for I wait on Thee.

Regarding this Jeremiah wrote : </wait.v.5802><wait.v.5803>Let 's see if we can start looking at waiting differently -- not as something to " just get through. " Let 's wait actively , not passively. Let 's ask God to help us learn from the times we are in " holding patterns , " and to use us to minister to others even while we are waiting. Sometimes other people can learn from how we handle waiting. Sometimes , we do n't find out until later , that we are blessing people. Sometimes , we might not even find out until we are in Heaven ! But you can be sure that God can use EVERYthing . </wait.v.5803><wait.v.5804>The context of each of these two passages points us to times when God 's church was in great straits , and to human eyes there were no possibilities of deliverance. But , God interposes with His word of promise , and pledges His almighty power for the deliverance of His people. And it is as the God who has Himself undertaken the work of their redemption that He invites them to wait on Him , and assures them that disappointment is impossible . </wait.v.5804><wait.v.5805>Sep 9 , 2005 . So the pattern for the night was that I would turn up to a patient , and then spend 30 45 minutes waiting for a crew to take the patient to . </wait.v.5805><wait.v.5806>One would be hard pressed to say Ish-bosheth has been installed as king over Israel by popular demand , or out of the godly motives and intentions of Abner. Abner seems to be seeking his own interests in appointing Ish-bosheth king. Nevertheless , David grants the fact that he is , indeed , king , and thus that it is God who ultimately put him in this position of power and authority. He will not resist the king , even to become king in his place. Furthermore , David made a promise to Saul , a promise not to cut off his descendants , and not to destroy his name from his father 's household. David will not remove Ish-bosheth because he can not do so and keep his word to Saul. Here is a man of principle , a man who will wait seven more years just to keep his word , just to wait on the Lord . </wait.v.5806><wait.v.5807>The day that I was admitted into the UEL was a significant day for me. I was 17 years old , and had finished high school. Then , I took the college entrance examination for 4 public colleges. I had studied very much , but the tests were very difficult. About 1 month later , the test results began to appear in the newspapers. The first one was the most difficult and I was not approved. Day after day the results came. I had not been approved in any university by a few points. But in the UEL ( University State of Londrina ) , I was on the waiting list. If somebody renounced their admittance , I would be admitted. I called the university and the secretary told me to call back in 7 days. I dreamed of that day every waking moment . </wait.v.5807><wait.v.5808>That is , expecting that he will work for you , give good things to you , or effectuate your deliverance. Say with David " I will hope continually , and will yet praise you more and more. " The promises are intended to raise your expectation , and past experience should strengthen it. There can be no reason to doubt , while you wait upon God; nor can doubting do you the least good. Hope will cheer you , brighten your prospects , and save you from despondency and gloom. Therefore hope in the Lord. You may be deeply tried , severely exercised , and at times almost overwhelmed; but at the very worst , you should expostulate with yourself , and say " Why are you cast down , O my soul ? and why are you disturbed within me ? Hope in God; for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. " </wait.v.5808><wait.v.5809>That 's the article I was referring to in an earlier post on this thread.

Still they find themselves single and waiting . </wait.v.5810><wait.v.5811>Never mind that Nastia Liukin is the reigning world champion on this event. When other girls jump up ahead of her , she stretches and practices skills on the floor , patiently waiting her turn . </wait.v.5811><wait.v.5812>Maybe we should wait and see if there any any real reason for her resignation. The woman has tried to convey several legitimate messages on issues and instead of listening to her substance people have insulted her life , her values , her looks , her family. She must be a stupid low life since she did n't graduate from Harvard and does n't live in LA or NYC. I frankly found it refreshing that a real person could move into the " good ole boy " political world and try to use a little common sense. God knows politics has gotten out of hand , and become so hateful. I do n't blame her for leaving , she is tired to the feeding frenzy surrounding herself and her family . </wait.v.5812><wait.v.5813>The business side of making confirmed reservations wait just might be as painful , maybe more so.

But it is not so this morning. Sitting there waiting for the tow truck and my son , I am much aware of how blessed I am and how little I am asked to give up or do without . </wait.v.5819><wait.v.5820>The discipline of waiting on the Holy Spirit is a powerful reminder to me that I 'm not to be the one ultimately in charge. I need to be reminded of that often. When we truly learn to wait on God , we discover how great He is , how immense His love is toward us , how powerful He is and how involved He wants to be in our lives . </wait.v.5820><wait.v.5821>I pulled myself up against the tree , put my wallet in my pocket and wiped my eyes. I clapped my hands to call Ralphie back to me. He skidded to a stop at my feet as Death rose from the ground. " You made my mother wait , " I said , not looking at Death. " Now it 's your turn. " </wait.v.5821><wait.v.5822>Now , we have here a solemn discovery of what the great want is in the church , of Christ. God has called the church of Christ to live in the power of the Holy Spirit , and the church is living for the most part in the power of human flesh , and of will and energy and effort apart from the Spirit of God. I doubt not that that is the case with many individual believers; and oh , if God will use me to give you a message from Him , my one message will be this : " If the church will return to acknowledge that the Holy Spirit is her strength and her help , and if the church will return to give up everything , and wait upon God to be filled with the Spirit , her days of beauty and gladness will return , and we shall see the glory of God revealed among us. " This is my message to every individual believer : " Nothing will help you unless you come to understand that you must live every day under the power of the Holy Ghost. " </wait.v.5822><wait.v.5823>So , not really frustrating , because in a sense , I do n't think anybody really cares. It 's sort of like , " You 're making this movie , who really cares ? " I know if I would 've gone into it , even in 2001 , saying , " You know , this is going to take us five years to make , " I think I would 've , even myself been like , " Ah , it 's just fuckin ' too long. Who wants to fuck with that ? " Even in thinking that it was going to take seven years , if I had told anybody that it was gon na take seven years , they would 've said , " Well dude , I 'm out of here. I do n't wanna wait around that long. " </wait.v.5823><wait.v.5824>One day at at time , right ? I know the treasures of earth will pass and we are only here for a season , but God gave us life and breath , and we are here. Waiting on Him , but present in the moment , cherishing each one , and thanking Him for it . </wait.v.5824><wait.v.5825>Tues.- So , one day , Edward has different colored eyes , Topaz. He seems friendly after missing a few days of school. He talks to her and asks her to sit with him at lunch. The other guys that like her get mad , well , more like jealous. So , she finds she likes Edward , but he moves so swiftly , after saving her from several injuries. She can ' t figure out what he is. So one day she goes to the beach with some friends and a bunch of other people. She meets this guy , Jacob , who ' s a little younger than she , and she squeezes a secret out of him.

I went through the same thing when I was applying for pHD programs ( except my GPA sucked ) All I can say is I wish I had n't given up. Go with the school you have and things may change after the 1st semester or 1st year. You may be able to transfer or maybe a grant could open up. You have come so far and should be tremendously proud of yourself. I really regret not going for my pHD I ca n't imagine how long I will have to wait to go back now , and I have forgotten so much already. When the job market is bad , it is harder to get into grad school because no one wants to leave school to go and work , and it makes it harder for those like you who really want it. Persistance does pay off. With a GPA like yours , if they see you apply again , they may take you because they know you will try your best . </wait.v.5828><wait.v.5829>hey Ridley I ca n't wait for it to come out !

Curling starts on Tuesday , by the way. ) Whether it was by foot , by Metro , and especially by road , it looked a total fustercluck out there. This editor helped push a car out of wintry distress in Dupont Circle last night -- I 'm sure my friend 's boyfriend would have helped , had he not been stuck in a cab for an hour. ( But hey , at least the cab driver was n't allowed to tack on the snow emergency surcharge ! ) DCist 's twitter account was laced with replies from readers who were plum stuck in traffic or interminably waiting on Metro , and sorry tales of three-hour commutes.

I was a Cingular customer from day one with dropped calls and inability to use my phone even in my own home. I had hoped the merge with AT &amp;T would have helped but there wasnt any difference still poor service. I have been with Verizon since and although I do not have an iPhone , I would never consider switching. I never lose a call and I have great service. What an awesome combination it will be when it does occur ! </wait.v.5832><wait.v.5833>Well fill you in when we get home , yeah ? See if you cant do something about putting up a few more wards on the house , something that will keep the Council out. We tried to lead them away from there but theyre bound to have someone watching it by now. Itd be best if the Slayer and I could be able to disappear altogether for a time when we arrive through the sewer entrance outside the house , figuratively speaking of course. Spike waited silently to see if Giles had picked up the hint . </wait.v.5833><wait.v.5834>Face it we do a lot of waiting. It may not be easy , but we 've had lots of practice at it. So hang in there , everyone , and take a couple of breaths. Maybe open up that ten year old bottle of wine while you 're waiting. Open it up , but wait at least an hour for it to breathe . </wait.v.5834><wait.v.5835>" Do you think they 'll forgive us eventually ? " She was concerned about them as well. Like him , she was an only child , and her father was so much older. And they expected so much of her , particularly her mother. Marielle had been presented to Society in New York the winter before , and now they had done the Grand Tour , their expectation was that in a short while , she would find a suitable husband. And in some ways , Charles was certainly that , in terms of his family at least , but there was no denying that his life-style was , at the present time , a little eccentric. But in time , her father would say , he would settle down. But when she tried to broach the subject to him that night , he suggested that she wait until he did that . </wait.v.5835><wait.v.5836>" No , I 'm serious. You 're awful in the kitchen because you can never wait for anything to finish cooking or baking or even cooling. You like what you do because it has you constantly moving , constantly thinking.

I cleared my debt and am slowly saving some money. I am also putting myself through university. The lifestyle I live here is a bit excessive but not nearly as much as some people. I miss the natural beauty of home and the democratic freedoms ( no , wait , after the Zuma " aquittal " I 'm not so sure ... ) but there was limited opportunity in SA and I needed to start thinking of the future . </wait.v.5837><wait.v.5838>There is a happy ending to my Christmas adventure. I did n't get home until midnight , and I fully expected mom to be asleep and my siblings and their families gone. But everyone was still there , wide awake , and eager to greet me. We exchanged gifts and my Christmas dinner was hot and delicious. As I was waiting at the airport , my family was waiting for me , no matter how late . </wait.v.5838><wait.v.5839>This morning I was listening to Pastor Chuck Swindoll on the radio. I like him because he 's always practical and usually very funny , but this particular story was more somber than most. He described going to his sister 's house to help his brother-in-law pick out clothes to give the mortuary for her burial. The bereaved husband opened a drawer and took out a beautiful piece of lingerie , soft satin with wisps of delicate lace , with tags from a pricey boutique still attached. " I bought it for her on a trip to New York eight or nine years ago. She was saving it for a special occasion , " he said bitterly. With tears in his eyes , he turned to Chuck and said , " She waited too long. Do n't wait for a special occasion. " </wait.v.5839><wait.v.5840>" I wait for them. My mercy is immense. If they accept , their repentance is sufficient. I ask for faith , intimacy and confidence. Cloister everyone in My Heart ! I want you to be universal.

The devil has taken possession of their souls , instilling in them that My Eternal Father does not exist. " </wait.v.5840><wait.v.5841>Second it a simple fact. It is just a phone people ! And if you 're complaining , it means you have an iPhone 3G. What exactly about the new phone is so 'must have ' that warrants the need to buy it on day one that waiting 6 months to a year would be a problem ( besides the obvious need to just have the latest and greatest of everything Apple makes ) ? </wait.v.5841><wait.v.5842>Dusk had fallen and supper time was approaching when I was taken in to Room 2 in the prison cell-blocks.

I feel in the end they will remain friends at least. Once she/he or they tell the full story of their relationship ( I feel it must be done to help both of them out ) public perception will start to change. If she admits she was abusive in the past and has gotten help and he admits he snapped and was wrong they will both be ok and can move forward.

Remus was waiting for him at the door. Inside , Harry shivered and stomped off his shoes. It struck him that Uden had touched him and it didnt bother him. That was a kick to the shin , though , not the chest , and it was hard not to listen to Irene Uden . </wait.v.5849><wait.v.5850>How did they fail to wait ?

They have been a great deal of support . </wait.v.5870><wait.v.5871>On a different note : I continue to be appalled at the speed of the concessions stands at Key Arena. Seriously. I went for a beer at halftime , was eighth in line , and managed to blow a good 10 minutes waiting for the people behind the counter to stop playing grab-ass with one another. The next time some team owner complains that you " ca n't make money in Key Arena " , tell them to hire more folks to , you know , actually take an order and collect money. The line behind me was pissed . </wait.v.5871><wait.v.5872>Jon Mclean Saturday morning ...

The first thing to be done is this : " I will wait on the Lord , who hideth His face from the house of Jacob. " Let us wait on God , in the humble confession of the sins of His people. Let us take time and wait on Him in this exercise. Let us wait on God in tender , loving intercession for all saints , our beloved brethren , however wrong their lives or their teaching may appear. Let us wait on God in faith and expectation , until He shows us that He will hear. Let us wait on God , with the simple offering of ourselves to Himself , and the earnest prayer that He would send us to our brethren. Let us wait on God , and give Him no rest till He makes Zion a joy in the earth . </wait.v.5874><wait.v.5875>1.

This past Tuesday , the day I had set aside to work on this sermon , entitled , " Waiting Time , " I stopped at the post office to mail two Mother 's Day packages. ( Yes , I was down to the wire ! ) . I had to refrain from groaning as I walked in and saw a line of at least ten people , with only one clerk serving customers. I watched as the woman being helped slowly and carefully chose the style of stamps she wanted , walking back and forth to the wall that displayed special , designer stamps , and as she casually contemplated the number of stamps she wished to purchase -- a transaction which took at least 5 minutes. I watched as the faces of the folks in line turned grim , as arms got crossed , and felt my own anxiety rise. I did n't have time to wait ! I had a sermon to write ... .about waiting !

The repairs are getting finished and I ' m still waiting for a good weather window for the next leg to East London. The trip to EL is only about 250 miles and I should be able to do that in 2 days easily. The problem comes when a storm from the southern ocean rips up the coast changing the wind direction and pushing the swells against the current making massive breaking swells. So it is extemely important to get a good weather window which will hopefully be here by the end of the week. I ' ll be going up the mast tomorrow to finish up the rigging work.

Many a 1980s day in elementary school , I rocked that same hairstyle and waited patiently for the admiration to flow freely.

They are just jealous . </wait.v.5884><wait.v.5885>My brothers and sisters , tonight I have talked about the little I know about waiting upon the Lord. I have given some examples of prayer , of choosing to be as far on the Lord 's side as you can get , of listening to the Brethren and trying to hear in their voices the voice of the Lord. If you will think about it , you will realize that for me to tell you too many details of what you ought to do is itself not wise , because you should wait upon the Lord to find out for yourself . </wait.v.5885><wait.v.5886>Life is full of battles and enemy attacks.

She seemed to have become completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything that was needed cooked , washed , mended , made the bed , swept the floor , dusted the mantelpiece always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion , like an artist ' s lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed , nursing his young sister , a tiny , ailing , very silent child of two or three , with a face made simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything. He was aware , in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness , that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen . </wait.v.5898><wait.v.5899>Open-heart surgery statistics for adult Ontario patients.

His heart beat faster , though , and , almost without thinking , he reached down , and patted his hand against the side of his leg. There was a small , answering rattle from his pocket , but he waited , and eventually his heart began to slow to a steadier rhythm.

There may be other times we think we do know , and when it would just be so good for us to realize that we do not know what to ask as we ought. God is able to do for us exceeding abundantly above what we ask or think , and we are in danger of limiting Him , when we confine our desires and prayers to our own thoughts of them.

And to know what it is like to be the source of joy and pleasure for another person is to begin to experience being the object ourselves of God 's love , of God 's delight in us. In the same way God tells Jeremiah , the Divine lover says to you and me , " before I formed you in the womb I knew you. " How else would the Psalmist 's sing , " Lord you have searched me out and known me; for you yourself created my inmost parts -- my body is not hidden from you , while I was being made in secret and woven in the depths of the earth.

In the first weeks after my arrival I was extremely tired. Relaxation of tension made itself felt. I was quite prepared to learn the Swedish language , but this would take some time. Fortunately the husband of one of the Amnesty International 's active members was curator of the Asian Section of the Stockholm Museum of Ethnography and was custodian of materials relating to the Sven Hedin expeditions , books , documents , maps , which had not yet been fully catalogued.

The Minstrel Soldiers and I played 2 great sets , and the audience sang at the top of their lungs every chance they got ! It was a full house , and unfortunately we ran out of space and had to turn at least 50 people away. The Falalas performed for 15 minutes in the middle , and what with the choir all dressed up in red and us belting out one Christmassy tune after another , I think everyone left that night with intentions to put up their Christmas trees straight away ! : P </wait.v.5946><wait.v.5947>Another thank you. the list checker is brilliant.

My wife and I have six children , the oldest 26 and the youngest , 8. The season of Advent one of patient waiting has starkly different points of view. The youngest ones wait for the ocming of Baby Jesus . The older ones doubt wondering if it is all a fairie tale , but yet struggling to believe. The old folks , a/k/a parents , know that the Church offers us this Season as a reflection that we must patiently wait our meeting with God at death and ultimately the Second Coming. It is such a challenging yet happy time. It challenges our faith and intellect. It ' s a joyous time because we can contemplate God who is Love by DOING.

It ' s a reflex action that ' s common to humankind. But in this era of swift and lethal weaponry , no place is absolutely safe unless God protects us. Because our times are in His hands and we are in His palms , we must learn to relax in any situation. The profitability of waiting on God when we are threatened and hounded is best explained in Isaiah 30 : 15 , 16. " The sovereign Lord says : Only in returning to Me and waiting for Me will you be saved. In quietness and confidence is your strength. But you would have none of it. You said , No , we will flee on swift horses ... But the only swiftness you are going to see is the swiftness of your enemies chasing you.

To achieve these goals , all providers ( including those referring patients ) will need to accept the notion of integrated , audited waiting lists that allow patients to switch providers to reduce waiting times. In the current system , the allocation of operating room time also effectively allocates incomes. If long lists lever more operating room time , some practitioners will either actively build long lists or resist reallocation of their patients to those with shorter lists. For example , the mean waiting time for ophthalmological surgery ( 92 of which was cataract removal ) in Saskatoon in late 1996 was more than 12 months for 2 high-volume surgeons and 5 months for 8 others ( John Mowbray , Policy and Planning Consultant , Saskatchewan Health : personal communication , 1998 ) .

The questions result from BYD 's history , including dismal sales figures for the company 's plug-in hybrid F3DM and a moving target release date to bring the E6 to the U.S. We were supposed to get it in 2010 , but now it 's looking like 2011 at the earliest.

If he were jolly and , as she put it , flippant , she waited till he came back to her , till the change had taken place in him again , and he was wrestling with his own soul , frowning , passionate in his desire for understanding.

For every condition in which you may be placed , there is a promise; by that promise the Lord stands pledged to appear for you and help you; he is ever ready to deliverer you; only he will have you believe his word , exercise confidence in him , plead the promise at his throne , and wait for its fulfillment. Wait , then , on the Lord at all times. Times will change , creatures will vary , but the Lord remains always the same. In youth and health , in manhood and prosperity , in old age and its infirmities , we should wait on the Lord. He will adapt his mercies to us , make all his goodness pass before us , and cause all things to work together for our good. He will never leave us , change his views of us , or withhold his tender mercies from us. He is faithful to his word , true to his character , and full of love to his people . </wait.v.6021><wait.v.6022>The second most frequently used word translated wait is yachal.

Then they are not loosing anything , they are selling their home for less but buying the next home for so much less , there is a net gain , not a loss. There is actually a shortage of good clean houses priced to sell , i encourage buyers to sell now rather than wait until spring , teh competition is less now , interest rates are still low and they are still offering loans.

Frequently in this epistle it has been indicated that a true attitude of expectation regarding the coming of the Lord carries with it a practical daily life. In other words , God did not intend for us , after we have learned the precious truth that Christ is coming back , to sit with starry eyes and folded hands and look up to the heavens. That is not what He wants us to do. He wants us to face the challenge of each day recognizing that it might be the last day before Christ comes. We should make every day really count for the Lord. Christ should be first in the day. We should do the things that He wants us to do. This is a practical point of view . </wait.v.6049><wait.v.6050>I hope they throw out all of these waitlists.

As the hospital stay lengthens , relatives fan out , waiting at the doors of richer relatives , or friends , hoping to get a loan to pay for the bills.

Chief Little Shell at the time rejected the US Governments offers and went on what is now known as the " Last Buffalo Hunt " . While the Chiefs were away , the US Government appointed their own " Chiefs " and signed a fraudalent treaty that is now known as " The Ten Cent Treaty " where the US government took the land for 10 cents an acre.

For purposes of presentation , the data for 1992 1994 and for 1995 1996 were combined. The 1992 1994 median indicates that 50 of the women were still waiting for surgery 29 days after starting their initial diagnostic procedure ( day29 ) . By 1998 the entire distribution had shifted such that the median had increased to 42 days. Because of the combined increase in waiting time and in the number of women with breast cancer , the number of women-days waiting almost doubled over the study period : from 142 695 in 1992 to 272 054 in 1998 . </wait.v.6092><wait.v.6093>And she read Tempest Rising !

" We can not make ourselves wise; but God can make us so , and he is prepared to give wisdom unto all who devoutly wait upon him.

The incidence of breast cancer has been rising by about 1 annually over the past 20 years.8 This increase , combined with a growing older population , has resulted in more women requiring treatment for breast cancer. Concomitantly , there has been a reduction in available resources. In 1995 , in response to a reduction in federal transfer payments , 9 Quebec began to close hospitals and hospital beds.10 The number of beds was reduced from 21 680 in 1994 to 14 767 in 1998 , a 32 reduction overall.9 The rate of reduction was 3 between 1994 and 1995 and 15 between 1996 and 1997.

As a fellow Gran Turismo fanatic I share your passion for the series. Oh , and , don ' t waste your money on a 360 and Forza 2. I was all excited about Forza 2 until I put GT4 in my PS3 to compare and was reminded that Gran Turismo does it better. Forza 2 has those improvements you mentioned , but it also has slowdown , innacurate car models , fuzzy graphics , stiff/notched turning , an auto-brake that kicks in whenever a car is rolling very , very slowly and inadequate weight trasfer.

Jehovah the Everlasting God would show in them what His saving power is and does. The words point forward to that wonderful history of redemption which is not yet finished , and to the glorious future in eternity whither it is leading.

It teaches us to continually keep the place where the disciples tarried at the footstool of the throne. It reminds us that , as helpless as they were to meet their enemies , or to preach to Christ 's enemies until they were endued with power , we , too , can only be strong in the life of faith , or the work of love , as we are in direct communication with God and Christ. They must maintain the life of the Spirit in us. This assures us that the omnipotent God will , through the glorified Christ , work in us a power that can bring unexpected things to pass , impossible things. Oh , what the church will be able to do when her individual members learn to live their lives waiting on Godwhen together , with all of self and the world sacrificed in the fire of love , they unite in waiting with one accord for the promise of the Father , once so gloriously fulfilled , but still unexhausted ! </wait.v.6276><wait.v.6277>I 'm still waiting for Palin to show why she 's so " great " and " dynamic.

Mercy and judgment are forever together in His dealings. In the Flood , in the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt , in the overthrow of the Canaanites , we ever see mercy in the midst of judgment. I n these , the inner circle of His own people , we see it , too. The judgment punishes the sin , while mercy saves the sinner. Or , rather , mercy saves the sinner , not in spite of , but by means of , the very judgment that came upon his sin. In waiting on God , we must beware of forgetting thisas we wait we must expect Him as a God of judgment . </wait.v.6279><wait.v.6280>I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course.

We had put her in with Breeze while she was being weaned and was a much more positive influence than her mother being a very calm mare. Next came the worming. Again I was nervous. We had given it before in her grain but this time we needed to use the paste.

The first beginnings of light may be just enough to discover the darkness , and painfully to humble you on account of sin. Can you not trust the light to expel the darkness ? Do believe it will. Just bow , even now , in stillness before God , and wait on Him to shine into you. Say , in humble faith , God is light , infinitely brighter and more beautiful than that of the sun. God is light : the Father. The eternal , inaccessible , and incomprehensible light : the Son. The light concentrated , and embodied , and manifested : the Spirit , the light entering and dwelling and shining in our hearts. God is light , and is here shining on my heart.

Counting these as separate episodes might have affected the estimate of standard error , but only if the waiting times within women were more similar than those between women. Because the median time between the end of the first episode and the beginning of the subsequent episode was 712 days , this was unlikely to be the case; in fact , the correlation was 0.05. The rarity of the occurrence ( 95 of the women had only 1 episode ) and the narrowness of the confidence intervals around the regression parameters suggest that the effect was negligible. Whether an episode is for treatment of a first breast cancer or a recurrence , the time a woman waits is the focus of concern . </wait.v.6313><wait.v.6314>Naylor CD , Szalai JP , Katic M.

And consider that " the glory of young men is their strength " ( Prov. 20 : 29 ) . All that is deemed strong with man shall come to nothing.

We were waiting in another room and we did n't hear anything. I think she is very courageous because she never cried or shouted. Ten or fifteen minutes later , my brother arrived , and we helped him put on some protective clothes. Time passed very quickly , and soon he was in the delivery room. After only 2 or 3 minutes , , we could hear my niece 's first crying. At that moment we were very happy , and then the nurse showed us the baby.

( If we had a son , we would have told him the same thing. ) However , I am not stupid enough to think she never has a thought about sex , relationships , etc. I have tried very hard to NOT get involved with some of those aspects of her life because at some point they are not my business . </wait.v.6350><wait.v.6351>18 years old , male , 6'2 " , and a VIRGIN , Bless God.

If I am alone and if I have no Archie comic to entertain myself , I survey the nooks and corners of the room I am in. By the time the person arrives , the room will be as familiar to me as my own.

Beloved child of God , if you want to learn how to properly wait for His Son from heaven , live even now waiting on God in heaven. Remember how Jesus lived ever waiting on God. He could do nothing of Himself. It was God who perfected His Son through suffering and then exalted Him. It is God alone who can give you the deep spiritual life of one who is really waiting for His Son : wait on God for it. Waiting for Christ Himself is so different from waiting for things that may come to pass ! The latter any Christian can do; the former , God must work in you every day by His Holy Spirit. Therefore , all you who wait on God , look to Him for grace to wait for His Son from heaven in the Spirit which is from heaven. And , you who want to wait for His Son , wait on God continually to reveal Christ in you . </wait.v.6361><wait.v.6362>" Each family is important.

While keeping an eye on it I lie down and get my camera equipment ready and start to move slowly toward it stopping periodically. Since I already have shots of Dunlins I am waiting until I am fairly close before I start photographing. I slide along the beach while lying down so I keep the lowest profile and I watch the bird to see how nervous I am making it. As it appears more nervous I stop and wait. Since I have good light and it is behind me I do n't need to use flash.

Waiting for the tides to turn , waiting for the wind to change , enduring , submitting to fate it ' s a very humbling thing to do if you think about it. It ' s rather easy to pass judgement on why people don ' t take action and do something to change their fates , but as I grow older , I find myself to be more willing to understand. After all , life is never easy , and I would never know what it feels like to live weighed down by centuries of suffocating customs . </wait.v.6400><wait.v.6401>Not heard of that before Mr Beer.. oops Donnie.

I 've said all along , I think she belongs in the company of the likes of John Henry. In retrospect , I think she won the Breeders Cup Classic walking around the saddling area. Prancing , dancing , pawing , she was so intimidating , just like John Henry giving all the other entrants an evil eye. Zenyatta was saying , I 'm big , I 'm bad and I 'm the best.

Let us make confession. But as we confess the state of the Church and the feebleness and sinfulness of work for God among us , let us come back to ourselves.

Our government has a lack of checks-and-balances , tilted way off balance toward the executive branch by Bush/Cheney. Senator Obama has a lack of checks-and-balances; he is beholden mainly to the Chicago political machine and to his deep-pocket backers , not to the Democratic Party line ( he ' s non-partisan ) or his popular supporters ( a clear feature of his charismatic style , he is the rock star who sells his non-committal slogans gains devoted fans , not the proven public servant who gains critical mass among a skeptical hard-nosed constituency ) . In addition while he has too brief a record for us to really know how he ' ll govern , he clearly has a hawkish mentality ( e.g. unilateral invasion of Pakistan : an exponential Bay of Pigs in waiting ) and a delagating , figurehead approach to the Presidency ( meaning that opportunists around him will be given a lot of leash ) .

Women who attend at this Health Centre for a mammogram , for example , can often get needed ultrasound and biopsy procedures the same day at the same facility , rather than having to make separate appointments for each new procedure and waiting days or weeks until all the necessary diagnostic data is available. This centre has reduced the average delay from first mammogram to final diagnosis from 107 days down to 18.

Not shy , this one; he finds many imaginitive ways to drape his body on or around the nearest human , then he starts up with very energetic " happy feet " .

How often do we have to wait in faith for something that we see people all around us enjoying ? When I was younger and poorer , I got to watch my richer friends enjoying possessions that I had to wait for years to earn. It was not my time for that. When I was in the early years of fathering a young Girlzilla , I envied my single friends ' and my empty nester friends ' disposable incomes and vacations and Saturday morning sleeping in. It was not my time for that either. I have many single friends who are struggling to lead chaste lives , engaged people admirably saving themselves for their upcoming marriage. They live in the midst of a culture that definitely does not wait to enjoy those fruits. It is not their time either , but they wait in the presence of those who don ' t wait or don ' t have to.

A few days later , I succumbed and joined the 40 percent of you that said you would be buying the iPhone this year and ordered it from the nearby AT &amp;T store.

This is very frustrating. Myngle is a great idea and I would like to become part of it. But , there needs to be better communication between Myngle and prospective teachers.

This month I went for another set of fingerprints with the United States Immigration service. Once this is done , you have to wait for a form called the 171H to be mailed to you.

Suddenly I came across a 9/11 picture -- one showing people jumping to their deaths from the burning World Trade Center. Looking at it , I felt that anger all over again , as hot and fierce as ever. We should all feel it , much more often than ( I think ) we do. Never , never forget what these swine did to us. Never let up on them , never let our government let up on them , until the last rat has been hunted down to the last rat-hole and killed stone dead. And the people who finance them , and help them , and cheer them on -- they have it coming , too . </wait.v.6468><wait.v.6469>On Friday morning I took to the city alone. Kris had plans for the day and I try to give myself a walking tour of every city I go to. As for someone who never was a large walker , I have really found that it truly is the best way to discover new places. The bike works great for traveling to the cities , but is best left somewhere to patiently wait for me until I ' m ready to leave. When you walk a city , you can get an immediate read on the type of place you ' re in. And the people watching that you can do is priceless . </wait.v.6469><wait.v.6470>So , I wait , I watch and I make due until my day comes around. Obviously it will , and that keeps me going.

If you are feeling daring , or depend on your niche , you may want to NOT go through a broker like LeadPile , and go directly to the buyer. For example : you are running a legal niche site , why not collect some leads from people who are looking for a lawyer , and sell them to a lawyer in your town for a ton of more dough than what you would get through a broker.

We exchanged rings in NM in 1998.

This dear woman endured years of childlessness , wanting a son so badly that the waiting made her sick. Her prayer was " remembered " after many tears and pleadings with God , and ultimately she gave the reward of her waiting. Yet her story concludes with a song , a beautiful meditation on the paradoxes of waiting on God to fulfill his promises. As she delivered her son to a lifetime of service - away from her , no less - she proclaimed , " My heart rejoices in the Lord for I delight in your deliverance. " This was a woman whose night of sorrow lasted for years , but even she saw the beauty of the morning . </wait.v.6489><wait.v.6490>I ' ve been following you for a good 4-5 years , since I were 16.

Not far away , she had grown up in Choo Kwai 's house - never dreaming what fate awaited her; Peach thought of First and Third and Fourth Mooi-jai , promised herself to light candles to Kuan Yin for their sakes. Let the Goddess of Mercy intercede for them all. Within the temple , the Master slouched against a wall , seeming to settle himself to wait; he drew a small book out of his coat and began to write in it. Several well-dressed Chinese businessmen , entering , shot annoyed glances at him. Peach had seen this same thing a thousand times before; as she had done a thousand times before , she unfocused her eyes and fell to reviewing a recent lesson in her head. Today it was escape routes , specifically from Confucian temples - from this very temple , in fact. " When hunted , know where to find your holy ground , " he had instructed her on the walk across the city. " And the second rule is : never go onto holy ground without knowing your escape routes.

The grandfather of the family had been a Marine , so that is what young Justin wanted to be since he was three , according to family. He had played Marine as a child , and when he went to university enrolled in the Marine reserves. He came from a military family , and his younger brother was also a Marine. The love for the Corps and country was a theme in every tribute to Captain Peterson , from his father 's to that of his high school principal - who began his speech by saying , " I remember Justin quite clearly.

She wanted no further part of the day and wanted out , so we returned home , picnicked in the front room and sat around twiddling our thumbs. Except my thumbs were busy looking at what options I had to go to a game. I wasn ' t going to ask or simply say I was off to a match , but instead bid my time and waited for CMF to suggest that I could go .Of course I said don ' t be silly but she was insistent , perhaps thinking that at 2.12pm it would be too late to get to a game .Oh how wrong she was !

My performance comes from a lexicon of restored behaviors. These are the embodied practices and gestures that were given to me through the multiple systems of education both formal and social - that I have received over the course of my life.

Waiting on God with expectation that he will act is really a facet of faith. The idea of waiting in expectation implies strength of confidence in God. In other words we are not just hanging on and gutting it out , but we are really expecting our Father to act; so much so that we begin to watch intently for his working. In Psalms 130 : 6 , the psalmist describes this intensity of waiting with expectation : y soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning , more than watchmen wait for the morning.

That 's because we value His presence far more important than any of our plans or programs.

And I suppose it really takes a certain person to succeed in this , someone who doesn ' t cripple under the pressure of having so many people waiting for your posts each day.

I pray for myself , and for all of you , and for everyone who is waiting today.

I did n't bug him at all , I just left it at that. I know some people may not agree with this but I was ready for kids and ready to start my life. I could tell he was ready as well but just being lazy about the whole thing. We both have been in our careers for 4 years now and live together and he felt like we were already married and wanted to have kids out of wedlock. I told him; no ring , no kids , no me.

We are waiting watchfully for God in human form , when we are attending to God , God 's word , God 's call to us , God 's creation , God 's people. When we attend to the parts of God we find around us , then we are being attentive; we are being watchful. When we work to do God 's will , we expect to see it happen. When we seek to see God in other people , then we will discover God.

It was interesting to have a chance to think about the topic before reading the article. My biggest fears for the escalating publishing schedules are that prolific authors may produce books that are repetitive and less interesting and that some midlist authors will be dropped because they can not meet unrealistic timetables. It may just be me but I am seeing more series books which I attribute in part to a reduced timetable. The author that broke my heart is Anne Stuart and the Ice series. The premise left me cold and suddenly an autobuy author became a wait for this to pass author. Her success with the series tells me that I am in the minority and I don ' t begrudge her a minute of that success but I am waiting for her ( and other longtime favourite authors ) to release a single title again . </wait.v.6557><wait.v.6558>We 've heard stories that people are starting to receive their Smart cars here in the U.S. , but with some 42 , 000 total deposits made , those of you who were a little late to the game are probably still waiting.

Ms. Plummer 's low-level panic attack at the question seemed very unwarranted , given that the saleschick was perhaps 19 and clearly had no idea who she was. I KNEW , of course , but thought it would freak her out more if I leaned over to say it was a standard question.

Such patience is the growth and fruit of our first lessons in the school of waiting. To many a one it will appear strange how difficult it is truly to wait upon God. The great stillness of soul before God that sinks into its own helplessness and waits for Him to reveal Himself; the deep humility that is afraid to let own will or own strength work aught except as God works to will and to do; the meekness that is content to be and to know nothing except as God gives His light; the entire resignation of the will that only wants to be a vessel in which His holy will can move and mold : all these elements of perfect patience are not found at once. But they will come in measure as the soul maintains its position , and ever again says : " Truly my soul waiteth upon God; from HIM cometh my salvation : He only is my rock and my salvation.

The name " Jesus " literally means " Jehovah is salvation " . Therefore , to " wait for Jehovah 's salvation " ( v18 ) is equivalent to waiting for Jesus. This means that " waiting for Jesus from heaven " ( 1 Thessalonians 1 : 10 ) is intimately tied to the execution of judgements by the spiritual tribe of " Dan " . Thus , when God speaks of " waiting " , He is not referring to a cross-armed , passive waiting. Instead , it is an anxious waiting during which we as a people shall be releasing God 's judgements into the Earth. It is a waiting loaded with " longing " , as revealed by the phrase " I have waited for thy salvation " in Genesis 49 : 18 above. As this longing consumes us , destructive judgement will be unleashed around us , just as Jesus ' longing zeal led to the destruction of " business as usual " at the temple ( John 2 : 13-17 ) . This destruction shall pave the way for that which we long for , the " apocalypse " ( i.e.- revelation ) of Jesus Christ on Earth . </wait.v.6638><wait.v.6639>" Most kickers who are in the league and most kickers out there waiting all of them pretty much can kick a good ball , " said Suisham , who began last season as the starter for the Cowboys.

We trust the power of the divine presence , which longs to take our one little life to its divine destination. Even if we 're in deep water , we trust the flow and are not afraid.

Wait a minute , did you ask me what heaven would be like ? </wait.v.6659><wait.v.6660>This is just what we 've been waiting for - the new 24dash website provides us with the perfect solution to getting our news directly to the people who matter to us. It 's a great targeted news portal for the public sector and beyond - and we 've already used the site to post our recent vacancies. We 'll definitely be spreading the word. Brilliant . </wait.v.6660><wait.v.6661>MY REPLY : No , only Archie. I actually didn ' t come here for Cook. ( w/ raised hand ) Promise ! Oh , but wait there is still the departure ! </wait.v.6661><wait.v.6662>Life will be interesting as a multiracial family ! I 'm looking forward to it. We will have to sharpen our wits and soften our hearts to give our new siblings protection and love in uncomfortable situations. We will certainly be a conspicuous family , but I ca n't wait to show you our next Christmas picture , with our " beau'ful Nethiopia brothers ! " </wait.v.6662><wait.v.6663>I have many memorable days , but I remember one exactly. It was the day when my niece , Celeste , was born. When we arrived , my sister-in-law was waiting for my brother , but he was n't there yet. She was ready because the baby was coming . </wait.v.6663><wait.v.6664>We 've been in a time of quiet and waiting , but now work on our adoption process is beginning to pick up again. Our social worker is submitting the final draft of our home study to her office tomorrow. They plan to check it all over , sign it , and notarize it before sending it to us by Wednesday . </wait.v.6664><wait.v.6665>i had a job interview today in my career field. what a rush. the interview today was a surprise and i liked it. i am SO GLAD i wear a suit everyday to work because i had no idea i would be called down hey could you come over now ? i was thrilled that i dress for an interview everyday .. so i was already prepared and i didn ' t know that was going to be asked of me today. it was a two person panel interview to me. they had a ton of questions , but it was fun. i ' m one of those strange people haha who likes interviews and i get energized by them. it is down to three people ( me and two others ) . he picks tomorrow. we shall see. my superior told me if i was picked , i could go IMMEDIATELY and i would not have to wait two weeks notice. the interview chiefs liked hearing that , too . </wait.v.6665><wait.v.6666>Question 3 : If on this occasion , we got so angry that we could not wait until the next election and we therefore resort to street demonstrations. For every time in the future , if we think that we chose the wrong person , then should we also use mass demonstrations to force the president to quit ? Under what circumstances should we patiently wait for the next four-year election and use our votes to " delete " him ? Under what circumstances should we not wait and initiate a mass movement ? What are the criteria of judgment ? </wait.v.6666><wait.v.6667>Shego put her hands on Kim 's and Bonnie 's shoulders. " Oh , do n't worry about that now. I 'm just happy to make the team. Why do n't you wait until after homecoming to decide ? " </wait.v.6667><wait.v.6668>3 : 16PM - My chili for dinner is finished and simmering. The second postponed NASCAR Race is finished.

WOOHOO ! It 's a great day ! </wait.v.6668><wait.v.6669>RT christopherbaan : We , the young generation and entrepreneurs have to do it. Together. Fast.
