He has other ulterior motives , such as making a profit out the fishing trip , but these other motives do not outweigh his main motive of helping the other patients. This is the reason he does not make his escape during the party , because he worries Nurse Ratched will regain control if he escapes. The climax of the novel , the final battle for control between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched is the ultimate testimony to McMurphy ' s noble motive for controlling the Ratched and the others . </regain.v.3><regain.v.4>In reply to : Mr Reardon had been walking along the top of a cliff at Dohilla when he slipped on some heavy kelp and was unable to regain his footing.

At the notch " crux " moves they decided to bypass them by descending the eastern escarpment. They were unable to regain the ridge after descending too far and were eventually benighted about 150m below the ridgeline on the east face of Mt Temple. They dug a snow-trench to bivouac the night , planning to continue the traverse on the following day. They were reported missing on this Sunday evening by friends/partners when they failed to keep a pickup rendezvous at 18.00hrs. A prelimenary search commenced at 21.45hrs that evening . </regain.v.5><regain.v.6>The limb on the LHS side was slightly deflected caudally ( Fig. 8B ) as compared with control ( Fig. 8A ) , but this difference was not statistically significant , however. It is interesting to note that in some cases , during the initial period of recovery after LHS , this limb was positioned very far backward; this hampered its use for supporting the body. In these cases , the experimenter could help the rabbit to regain postural control in the hindquarters by repositioning the limb to its normal ( more rostral ) position . </regain.v.6><regain.v.7>In this model , treatment is part of self-managed care. The goal of treatment here is assisting people in gaining greater control of their lives and assisting them in regaining valued roles in society. The primary goal of treatment should not be to control the person 's behavior. The use of medication does not itself mean that a person has not recovered from mental illness. It depends upon the degree to which the person and those around them see the medication as constantly needed. Ideally , each person should learn to take medication on an as-needed basis , after having learned to self-monitor. Many people also embrace holistic health as an alternative to medication . </regain.v.7><regain.v.8>Amitrol-T will give season-long control of leafy spurge but regrowth can still be expected the subsequent year. Banvel provides moderate top growth control which can persist throughout most of the growing season under favorable conditions , while 2 , 4-D amine will give temporary top growth control , requiring at least one repeat application during the season. All these treatments need to be continued for a few years in order to get significant or complete control of the weed. Annual treatment should persist until at least 90 percent control is achieved or the leafy spurge will rapidly regain control . </regain.v.8><regain.v.9>" Everything is difficult at Camp 3.

" </regain.v.9><regain.v.10>At the time we left Camp One we just could not imagine the cold at 6400m for the next two nights. And we both spent nights there on 2007 and we both slept only in our down suits at altitudes above 6400m. The incoming bad weather on Sunday convinced us to get down to base camp instead of climbing up to 6900m , as we had planned along with spending an acclimatization night there and establish Camp Three. The forecast is not too optimistic , till next Sunday we shall expect bad weather. We will take advantage of this and rest in the Base Camp and try to recover and regain our strength and energy again for what it will be our final move on the mountain : the summit push . </regain.v.10><regain.v.11>In the upper reaches of the canyon , we had passed several pools of water and I wondered whether I had done the right thing in carrying so much water , but I did not pour any out ! We finally came to the impassable dropoff , with the " Ledge " to the left and the newly found bypass to the right. The Ledge was as intimidating in person as it had appeared in the photos. We had read that the bypass to the right was somewhat indefinite , but armed with photos of a crawl through and a " crack " down through a cliff band , we kept moving at a slow but steady rate. There was one nervous move just above the crack that was a long step down. It was necessary to be careful that your pack did not cause you to pitch forward. Below the crack in the rocks , the footing was loose but we regained the bottom of the canyon without incident . </regain.v.11><regain.v.12>Nix , Garth. MISTER MONDAY.

The single best predictor of risk of regain was how long participants had successfully maintained their weight loss ( Table 1 ) . Individuals who had kept their weight off for 2 y or more had markedly increased odds of continuing to maintain their weight over the following year. This finding is encouraging because it suggests that , if individuals can succeed at maintaining their weight loss for 2 y , they can reduce their risk of subsequent regain by nearly 50 . </regain.v.13><regain.v.14>It was impossible to move far from Camp IV : the wind and cold were too fierce.

Although he received the harshest punishment imaginable , McMurphy showed the other patients that it was possible to beat the seemingly invincible Big Nurse. McMurphy helped change the lives of most of the men on the ward , when it seemed they were in a situation were change was not possible. The story casts its central character as a Christ-like figure who is sacrificed on the cross of conformity and control. ( Isherwood , 2001 ) He gave the men back the ability to control their own lives , which Nurse Ratched had taken away from them. McMurphy is a character , which uses his control for noble purposes by rebelling against a controlling authority system , so that others can regain control over their lives . </regain.v.16><regain.v.17>How to recover or regain all deleted or lost favorite mp3 , mp4 , audio , ... user assistance. * Apple iPod data recovery tool regain or recover audio , video and music files from </regain.v.17><regain.v.18>Every stroke is different , which means that everyone 's recovery is different.

They began to colonize and set up states; the four major states which were set up consisted of : Tripoli , Antioch , Edessa , and Jerusalem. The crusaders used the strategy of isolating and cutting off supplies that could lead to strengthening to the Muslims and Egyptians. However , as the next generation came about , the children of the original crusaders were not quite as motivated and determined as the original fleet , so the Muslims escaped the isolation and regained power. The Muslims , under the leadership of the radical leader , Zangi , found victory in attacking Edessa. The Muslims destroyed churches , homes , building , and murdered many crusaders , and regained control of the city . </regain.v.20><regain.v.21>My tenant has failed to pay rent for several months and has deserted the property.

It almost does it for you. If your airspeed drops below about 120 knots , the nose of the plane will start to drop. In addition , you will see the Stall light on the right upper section of the glare screen illuminate and the stall horn will sound. This indicates that you do not have enough airspeed to maintain flight. As the nose drops , you begin to pick up speed - with more speed you regain your ability to fly. If you find yourself in a stall situation , simply drop the nose of aircraft to pick up speed. In case of a severe stall , you may want to roll fighter 180 deg.

The delinquent property owner can regain title to the property if they pay back the lien amount plus interest and miscellaneous expenses before a redemption period set by law expires. The redemption period can vary from several months to several years in some states. If the delinquent property owner exercises his right to redemption , they must pay an interest charge that can be fairly large on the amount paid at foreclosure by the purchaser. Before you place a bid at a tax foreclosure , be sure you know how long the redemption period is. When the redemption period expires , the purchaser can petition the court to foreclose and remove the delinquent parties right of redemption. When the tax foreclosure process is complete , the court issues a deed that conveys the property title to the purchaser. If the bid amount was greater than the amount owed to the government , the excess amount will go to the next property lien holder or to the previous owner if there is no lien holder . </regain.v.35><regain.v.36>Healing and recovery begins when you make a personal decision to take back your life by verbalizing the emotional , physical , spiritual , financial , and all too often , sexual abuse inflicted on you.

On removing the forces , the system tends to regain a minimum P.E. and as a result , attractive forces develop , restoring them to their original shape. The same applies when a body is subjected to a compressional force , where repulsive forces develop and restore the system to equilibrium. The property of the material of a body by virtue of which , the body regains its original length , volume and shape after the deforming forces have been removed , is called elasticity . </regain.v.95><regain.v.96>By our rough figures , if the government purchased $ 1.5 trillion in assets with an average 20 percent discount from accounting value ( $ 300 billion ) , it would end up acquiring an ownership stake of some 36 percent in the industry as a result of the conversion of preferred stock to common or the injection of new common stock to make up for the equity lost through its discounted purchases. While that is a significant stake in the banking industry , it remains considerably less than what would occur under full-blown nationalization. And if restoring the ongoing-concern value of banks helped the industry ' s valuation to regain its January 2007 level ( about 20 percent less than its high ) , we calculate that the government ' s shareholdings would be worth about $ 560 billion.

Where the government designates a good as negotiable , if A steals it from B and then sells it to C without the latter ' s knowledge of the theft , B can not take the good back from C. Despite the fact that A was a thief and had no proper title to the good , C is decreed to be the legitimate owner , and B has no way of regaining his property. The law of negotiability is evidently a clear infringement of property right. Where property rights are fully defended , theft can not be compounded in this manner. The buyer would have to purchase at his own risk and make sure that the good is not stolen; if he nonetheless does buy stolen goods , he must try to obtain restitution from the thief , and not at the expense of the rightful owner . </regain.v.102><regain.v.103>The effects of dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord were studied in five rabbits ( see Fig. 2A for the extent of lesion ) . Observations of these animals in the cage and on the floor have shown that , during some period after DHS , the rabbits were not able to maintain the dorsal-side-up orientation of their hindquarters. They moved around using their forelimbs only. When the animal was positioned on the tilting platform during this period , its hindquarters passively followed the platform movements and with larger tilts the rabbit could fall sideways. Later on , freely behaving animals managed , for short periods of time , to regain equilibrium and to maintain the dorsal-side-up position of their hindquarters. Starting from this moment , the rabbits were subjected to repeated tests that included video recording of the body configuration on the horizontal platform and recording of postural reflexes on the tilting platform. The period of inefficient postural control in the hindquarters lasted from 1 to 2 days postlesion with a mean value of 1.6 0.2 ( SE ) days . </regain.v.103><regain.v.104>" Panic sufferers hope is on the way.

In many cases , loss of work plays an important role in a person being labeled mentally ill. In addition , boring , unfulfilling work can lead to stresses which contribute towards mental illness. Without work , or another equivalent social role ( parent or student ) , a person loses membership in this society and the identity which accompanies membership. It then becomes necessary to assume a new identity as a consumer.

High-altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) occurs when the body responds to the lack of oxygen by increasing blood flow to the brain; the brain begins to swell , and coma and death may occur. High-altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) is a similar condition in which the body circulates additional blood to the lungs; this blood begins to leak into the air sacs , and death is caused essentially by drowning. The most effective treatment for both conditions is to move the affected person to a lower elevation. It has been found that the drug dexamethasone is a useful emergency first-aid treatment when injected into stricken climbers , allowing them to regain movement ( when they might otherwise be incapacitated ) and thus descend . </regain.v.126><regain.v.127>The base leg perception of ground speed and maintenance of a single indicated air speed ( IAS ) is essential for making the turn to final. If wind , illusion , or inattention positions your plane too close to the runway on downwind your base leg will be short. This most often occurs at night and at small unfamiliar fields. Students will turn too early with the headwind and too late with the tailwind. Being too late means that the student has overshot alignment with the runway. The result is that procedures become hurried and airspeed un-stabilized. Both these problems are made worse if the downwind leg is flown to give a short base leg. The dangerous part of this is that the pilot may have slowed below the proper airspeed. Normal reaction to overshooting is to make the turn steeper to regain alignment. The combination of slow and steep is the introduction of a stall spin accident. Abort the approach and GO-AROUND. Never exceed a 30 degree bank in the pattern and use sound as indicative of airspeed changes . </regain.v.127><regain.v.128>The victim , witnessing the climber 's fall and his difficulty in regaining his footing , began to move forward around the other climbers.

There were eight crusades which were spurred for many different reasons by many different people that left a lasting effect to the world. These years of bloodshed were led by men of power to bring money , greed , and fame to themselves at the expense of others. Although it brought a lasting uneasiness between the two religions , but trade with the East increased and feudalism became scarce. The crusaders failed to regain the Holy Land , but the Eastern connections opened Europe to a brighter understanding of optimistic ways of living and thinking.

Their aim is to help patients increase their strength and endurance , improve coordination , reduce spasticity and muscle wasting in paralyzed limbs , and regain greater control over bladder and bowel function through various exercises. Physiatrists and physical therapists teach paralyzed patients techniques for using assistive devices such as wheelchairs , canes , or braces as effectively as possible. Paralyzed patients also learn ways to avoid developing painful pressure sores on immobilized parts of the body , which may lead to increased pain or systemic infection. In addition , physiatrists and physical therapists are involved in pain management. A wide variety of drugs now exist that can alleviate the pain that results from spinal cord injuries such as those caused by transverse myelitis. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen; antidepressant drugs such as amitryptyline ( tricyclic ) and sertraline ( a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ); and anticonvulsant drugs such as phenytoin and gabapentine . </regain.v.143><regain.v.144>First you must wriggle through a window , under the summit to a wide ledge on the opposite side.

However , if there is no improvement within the first 3 to 6 months , significant recovery is unlikely. About one-third of people affected with transverse myelitis experience good or full recovery from their symptoms; they regain the ability to walk normally and experience minimal urinary or bowel effects and paresthesias. Another one-third show only fair recovery and are left with significant deficits such as spastic gait , sensory dysfunction , and prominent urinary urgency or incontinence. The remaining one-third show no recovery at all , remaining wheelchair-bound or bedridden with marked dependence on others for basic functions of daily living. Unfortunately , making predictions about individual cases is difficult. However , research has shown that a rapid onset of symptoms generally results in poorer recovery outcomes . </regain.v.149><regain.v.150>Japanese soldiers invaded Attu Island June 7 , 1942 , claiming it in hopes of setting up a base of operations during World War II.

This is achieved largely by designing an aircraft that is highly maneuverable , but will not deep stall ( thus allowing quick recovery by the pilot ) and will recover predictably and favorably ( ideally to level flight; more realistically to as shallow a nose-down attitude as possible ) . To that design , features are then added that allow the pilot to actively control the aircraft while in the stall , and retain or regain forward level flight in an extremely shallow band of altitude that surpasees the capabilities of pure aerodynamic maneuvering . </regain.v.155><regain.v.156>Smartgart also receives the makeover treatment showing more detail on what settings have been applied and allowing for specific retests to be actioned by the user.

Not surprisingly , those who regained weight reported significant decreases in their physical activity , increases in their percentage of calories from fat , and decreases in their dietary restraint. Thus , a large part of weight regain may be attributable to an inability to maintain healthy eating and exercise behaviors over time.

The Syrians ' desire for peace is now , in large measure , based on the premise that they can not recover the Golan by military means. And if peace brings the promise of economic prosperity and a greater sense of security , then Asad will pursue it , but never at the cost of forsaking the Golan. The Syrian people have been persuaded to accept peace , but only peace with dignity. For Syria , the most nationalistic of all Arab states , only a peace that restores the Golan can provide that dignity , especially since Egypt and Jordan have regained every inch of the territory they lost to Israelis a condition for their bilateral peace agreements with Israel . </regain.v.164><regain.v.165>It was at this point that we suffered a bit of a close call.

When you lose weight through dieting and aerobic exercise ( such as walking or bicycling ) , you lose muscle along with fat. This can be a problem : When you lose muscle , your metabolism slows down , so you ' re more likely to regain the weight.

At the first indication of a stall , the wing angle of attack must be decreased to allow the wings to regain lift. Every aircraft in upright flight may require a different amount of forward pressure to regain lift. It should be noted that too much forward pressure could hinder recovery by imposing a negative load on the wing. The next step in recovering from a stall is to smoothly apply maximum allowable power to increase the airspeed and minimize the loss of altitude. As airspeed increases and the recovery is completed , power should be adjusted to return the aeroplane to the desired flight condition. Straight and level flight should then be established with full co-ordinated use of the controls. The airspeed indicator or tachometer , if installed , should never be allowed to reach their high-speed red lines at anytime during a practice stall . </regain.v.168><regain.v.169>Worse , he almost fell off a 7 , 000- foot drop at the Hillary Step the same backdrop to his nightmare about sliding off the side.

The latest news said that they scheduled the summit of Everest for today , but the attempt has been postponed to tomorrow probably to regain energies before the final assault. It is obvious that the original program has been changed , most likely because the climb to various camps has been modified by Simone and Denis. The latest dispatch from Nima told us the two climbers were at 8200meters towards the Lhotse Summit.

There was some minor exposure , but there were several convenient ledges , and I was soon back on trail segments through scree and talus , working to regain the ridge . </regain.v.211><regain.v.212>Since the end of the Cold War , the political and military dynamics in the Middle East have changed. The Syrians ' desire for peace is now , in large measure , based on the premise that they can not recover the Golan by military means. And if peace brings the promise of economic prosperity and a greater sense of security , then Asad will pursue it , but never at the cost of forsaking the Golan. The Syrian people have been persuaded to accept peace , but only peace with dignity. For Syria , the most nationalistic of all Arab states , only a peace that restores the Golan can provide that dignity , especially since Egypt and Jordan have regained every inch of the territory they lost to Israelis - a condition for their bilateral peace agreements with Israel . </regain.v.212><regain.v.213>22 : 29 05/01/2010 The Catholic Church in Poland could regain property seized by the communist regime by the end of the current year , a national daily said Tuesday. &gt; &gt; </regain.v.213><regain.v.214>Because the altitude would kill a human being in minutes without careful acclimatization , climbers must ascend to a certain point , spend a couple of days , then descend to spend time at base camp to regain their strength.

Several other groups were also descending the route during the break in the weather. ( Deteriorating weather conditions had required climbers to stay longer at the high altitude camp than they otherwise would have. ) As they descended , winds began to increase with estimated gusts of 35 MPH or greater. The stronger winds also made it hard for the climbers to hear each other. As the first climber behind the senior guide came around a large outcropping of rock on the ridge , he was hit by a strong wind gust that caused him to loose his footing. He yelled , " falling " to warn his team members. The fallen climber slid approximately 5 feet down the slope toward another trail. Although his fall was arrested by the running belay looped around a rock , he was unable to regain his footing. The senior guide then began to shout instructions to help him regain his footing. ( It was necessary to shout the instructions due to the wind . ) </regain.v.216><regain.v.217>So now , we rest.

The Beck Weathers story shows how misguided the assessment was by those lending assistance at the South Col.

The outcome would not have been different had they moved him earlier in Beck 's case , but there is a slim possibility that had they moved the Japanese woman [ Yasuko Namba ] in early with the rest of the group that she might have survived.

It was during an effort to regain our high point that 4 Sherpas became stranded at C-4 for two nights of harrowing storms. At the first sign of clear weather , they aborted their attempt and began a descent. Although the exact cause of the avalanche is not entirely clear , it seems likely that a Sherpa higher up on an 150-ft long rope started an avalanche that ripped loose his companion lower down. The sliding Sherpa fell over a 60-ft cliff. His impact created a second avalanche of large , hard snow blocks. The pummeling of these blocks , added to by the oxygen bottle in his pack probably broke his neck , the likely cause of his death . </regain.v.223><regain.v.224>9.

During their descent , the guide witnessed one of the climbers in the team slip while descending a particularly exposed and rocky section of the ridge route. The climber was having difficulty regaining his footing. The team was on a running belay with the guide at the end; the guide unclipped from the rope and walked past the climbers between himself and the fallen climber. The victim lost his footing as he moved toward the fallen climber 's position and slid down the slope toward a glacier. He was unable to arrest his fall with his ice ax.

This distinction is critical in a person 's motivation to improve as well in the attitudes of society towards people who have been labeled. Ideally this recognition will be the first step towards finding a way to provide benefits , such as social security , for people whose functioning is compromised by emotional difficulties without needing to first reject them as members of society. We realize that the idea that people can recover from mental illness will create more work on the part of entitlement programs. Instead of a single , once-in-a-lifetime determination of disability , episodic periods of disability will need to be supported. We also realize that people will fear they will lose their social security before they are able to live without it. Hopefully Social Security can be reformed to provide the needed gradual transitions back to work.

They took nothing with them but oxygen equipment , a little food , and their walkie-talkies. The slope on the North Face was steep , about 55 degrees. Their crampons gripped poorly in the granular snow , necessitating laborious step cutting. It took four hours to do the first 400 feet. Near the top of the couloir they encountered a 60-foot-high cliff , a level of technical climbing challenge absent on the Southeast Ridge. Hornbein took the lead and came to within 8 feet of the top where , exhausted , he had to give up and drop down beside Unsoeld. Unsoeld climbed back up , using the rope that Hornbein had left in place. Reaching Hornbein ' s high mark , Unsoeld removed his mittens for a better grip on the rock , turned up the flow of oxygen , and surmounted the last 8 feet. Now they were fully committed to climbing the rest of the way to the top because they believed they could not safely descend the cliff.

Oxygen was taken but not used due to the incorrect but lingering belief that it was of little benefit to a properly acclimatised climber. After delays caused by poor weather and illness of team members , a much higher assault camp was placed. On the first summit attempt , Lawrence Wager and Percy Wyn-Harris intended to follow the North-East ridge , but were unable to regain it , having bypassed ( rather than climb over ) the First Step , which they reached at 7 am. The direct access to the Second Step from the First involves a treacherous traverse. Instead of taking it , they dropped down to follow the lower , easier traverse pioneered by Norton in 1924. Observing the Second Step from 100-ft. below it , Wyn-Harris declared it " unclimbable. " Shortly after crossing the Great Couloir , they turned back due to poor snow conditions and the lateness of the hour.
