She said social workers had somehow tracked her to the local Salvation Army shelter earlier and taken away her other children. Police had questioned her. Denisha , who had directed the social workers there , said nothing.

At the well , Eliezer had felt no need to question Rivka; his faith in God was so strong and secure that he knew beyond doubt that God had sent him Yitzchaks intended wife. Yet he also knew that Lavan and Bethuel were evil by nature , and would be suspicious of his actions. He therefore related the events out of order when he spoke with them , so that they would not be able to catch him in his own words , demanding to know , How could you have given Rivka anything when you didnt even know who she was ? !

However , their original statements to Garrison 's staff reveal considerable contradictions , so much so that the very heart of their story is invalidated . . . . It was almost six years after the alleged incident in Clinton that the witnesses first testified at the Garrison trial. Garrison 's staff , when questioning the Clinton witnesses , had only presented photos of Oswald , Ferrie and Shaw , and incorrectly said that others had already identified those as the people who had visited the town. This power of suggestion , and later coaching , developed the testimony that today has been repeated so often that the House Select Committee found it so convincing. Dave Reitzes is in general agreement with Posner 's thesis , but notes several factual errors that detract from Posner 's presentation . </question.v.6><question.v.7>Another Committee member noted the flattening of the yield curve suggested long-dated issuance made sense. However , a third Committee member observed that the chart in the Committee 's presentation on assessing the possible borrowing costs of using a duration weighted combination of 2- and 30-year bonds in place of 5-year issuance suggested that the time for Treasury to have issued 30-years was several years ago , not now. This member queried what had changed since 2001 or even two years ago to cause Treasury to reconsider long-dated issuance. The member observed that the yield curve had been extremely flat when Treasury had discontinued the bond. He also observed the recent strength in tax receipts and questioned as to whether it made sense for Treasury to contemplate reintroduction when deficits appeared to have peaked . </question.v.7><question.v.8>Most journalistic accounts of Dole 's wartime experience pass along , without questioning , the versions from several biographies , some based on interviews with him; some from interviews with the same soldiers who were interviewed for those books; some from the autobiography Dole wrote with his wife , Elizabeth , The Doles : Unlimited Partners , an updated version of which was published in time for the campaign; and some from G.O.P. campaign literature. Although these sources sometimes contradict one another , the following composite picture of Dole 's combat exploits emerges : </question.v.8><question.v.9>When someone questions the character of God based upon harsh punishments found in the Old Testament they actually point out the incredible character of our God. The harsh punishments teach us that God is not some benevolent big brother who turns His back when we choose to disobey. He is a God of righteousness and justice. But we can also see His love , mercy , and grace through His provision of salvation and forgiveness of sins . </question.v.9><question.v.10>All citizens enjoy the right to be informed of their rights when they are in police custody and are being questioned about suspected criminal acts. If a child is under the age of 14 and in custody , they must have the opportunity to consult with a parent or guardian prior to waiving Miranda rights and giving a statement. In all cases of police questioning of juveniles in custody , the court will look at their age , the presence of parents , and other factors to determine whether any statement was freely and voluntarily given . </question.v.10><question.v.11>As an ordinary citizen , it is possible that you might be stopped , questioned and even searched by the police while you are walking on the street. You may have questions as to why the police would do this to you , or under what circumstances the police can exercise such powers . </question.v.11><question.v.12>Once a witness has been questioned directly , he/she is subject to cross-examination by the opposing attorney. Cross-examination is designed to impeach the witness and expose any weaknesses in his/her testimony. It involves close-ended questions that generally require a yes or no answer; more complete , explanatory answers are usually not allowed. Leading questions ( that suggest an answer by the very form in which they are asked ) will be permitted on cross-examination. Being cross-examined will probably be the most difficult part for the witness. This does not mean , however , that witnesses should be overly anxious about cross-examination. Most attorneys will not continuously harass a witness until he/she breaks down and admits to biases and mistakes. Typically , the defense attorney tries , on cross-examination , to cast doubt upon the thoroughness of an investigation , the witness ' interpretation of the facts , and perhaps whether the witness ' judgment and actions were clouded by his/her feelings about the parents. If a caseworker has been careful and professional , he/she should be confident that the case has been handled properly . </question.v.12><question.v.13>After 9/11 and with constant recurring explosive Islamic terrorism , it has become harder for the Muslim establishment to keep the lid on Muslims questioning their system , religion and holy wars. Criticism of Islam is coming at them from every direction , putting Muslim clerics in a quagmire unable to honestly answer questions. Muslim scholars were never trained to answer questions critical of Islam or engage in hostile debate. But now , suddenly , they are challenged to the core like never before , not by Western critics , but by brave hosts of Arabic language shows from unidentified locations in the West and hosted by former Muslims and/or Egyptian Christian Copts . </question.v.13><question.v.14>Ms. Jennifer Michael Hecht : The great figures I love the most are ones who continue constantly to question. They may decide for sure that they do n't believe in God , but they do n't decide for sure that they really know what the universe is all about. They decide for sure that questioning is for them . </question.v.14><question.v.15>The Dera chief was questioned by Punjab police officials at the police lines complex here amid tight security.

Dobbs becomes more popular as a TV host than ever before. Green becomes his executive producer on his show. The CEO of Delacroy and Jeff Goldblum go to prison for fraud. The movie ends with narration that says President Kellogg was a better President in his second term - not great , but better - because of Tom Dobbs shaking up the system. The movie leaves the audience with the feeling that we are all supposed to question electronic voting and what our politicians says , because it is up to us to question and hold them accountable when they do n't want to be questioned or held accountable . </question.v.16><question.v.17>The members of the committee also tend to act as if they were lawyers questioning a witness or plaintiff , coercing them further into answering the question asked. Questions can also change radically as each member asks different questions ( sometimes designed as much to make them look good as get to the real truth ) . Whilst there is no obligation for those called to fully answer questions , not to do so can be political suicide. The press take great interest in the select committee , and report on anything of interest , which includes any MPs who appear to be squirming under the spotlight . </question.v.17><question.v.18>In usability glossary , [ Brehob , 2001 ] defines a questionnaire to be " a form that people fill out , used to obtain demographic information and views and interests of those questioned " . [ Kirakowski , 1998 ] defines a questionnaire in a more structural way as " a method for the elicitation , and recording and collecting information " . HCI researchers use questionnaires as tools ( methods ) to capture what is in users ' mind ( s ) ( elicitation ) . The data collected from a group of respondents ( users ) is recorded onto a permanent medium to be analyzed and referenced later . </question.v.18><question.v.19>( 4 ) The person questioned shall answer the question ( s ) orally or in writing within two months of the question ( s ) having been received by the President.

It should introduce the language and rules of the questionnaire. Potentially objectionable and threatening questions should be avoided as initial questions. If possible , the opening item should apply to all the respondents. Questions with such response options as " do not know " should be avoided. Respondents may feel uncomfortable about not being able to answer initial items or may question the relevance of the form to them . </question.v.25><question.v.26>If you ' ve ever questioned the kind of upbringing you had , take some down-time and read this book.

Such requirements often worked to the disadvantage of child witnesses who lack the powers of abstract thought to give satisfactory answers to questions about the meaning of truth and falsehood and what happens to liars. These questions have occupied the minds of philosophers and theologians for centuries and would stump many adults . </question.v.27><question.v.28>2.

Do not hesitate to ask for a break if you need one , or if you wish to seek legal advice from your counsel. Any comments you made during the break heard by the opposing attorney likely will result in you being questioned about the comment after the break. If he asks you after the break if your lawyer told you how to answer the question , tell him no ! Don ' t go too long without a break. Try to take a short walk during the break. Splash water in your face in the restroom . </question.v.29><question.v.30>A. If you are a suspect in a criminal investigation , under no circumstances should you submit to a polygraph. You should remain silent and consult with an attorney. Many innocent individuals who become suspects in criminal investigations eagerly agree to submit to a polygraph in the mistaken belief that the " test " is highly accurate and will clear them from suspicion. Regrettably , this is not necessarily the case. " Passing " a polygraph " test " provides no guarantee of being cleared of suspicion. " Failing , " on the other hand , is likely to be highly prejudicial. Either way , agreeing to the " test " means agreeing to sit down and be questioned by a trained interrogator without the benefit of having an attorney present. Do n't do it . </question.v.30><question.v.31>The student ( s ) will then respond to the charges , presenting evidence and has the option of questioning the accuser. At this time they may also choose to call witnesses on their behalf. Witnesses are brought in serially , appearing one at a time. The accuser remains present. The committee questions the accused student and any witnesses in turn.

He called so I asked him all of my skeptical questions. He basically said there was nothing wrong with the way the survey was done and the analysis was presented. He invited me to ask detailed questions about the data , and sent some info in answer to my follow-up e-mail. One factoid : The survey had not , in fact , asked screening questions about what network operating systems people had installed. So , I guess , the press release was wrong. Also , he said , the PowerPoint slides I had questioned were unedited , and had since been improved. He also declined to show me the raw data or tell me who the third-party surveyor was . </question.v.32><question.v.33>The police may ask your name , address , and other routine processing questions. Before questioning you about anything else , the police must tell you that you have a right to remain silent; that any statement you make may be used as evidence against you; and that you have a right to speak with a lawyer and , if you wish , to have a lawyer present when you are being questioned. The police must also tell you that a lawyer will be assigned to your case without cost if you can not afford a lawyer but want to speak to one before questioned. The questioning must stop if you state that you wish to remain silent or request a lawyer . </question.v.33><question.v.34>Why can the police get her in a room and question her for hours like thay do the other criminals.Let 's face it she is a daughter of a a former cop.She knows what has happen ...

When police lie to a citizen to obtain information , it is considered investigative technique.

My suggestion is for you to get out and find another congregation to fellowship with. A fellowship where the pastorial staff and leaders can be talked to about Scriptual interpretations if the need arises. If the leadership of a fellowship becomes unapproachable about doctrine with an " elitist " attitude , then that fellowship is on the borderline of being a cult in practice. For cults teach that they are the only way to God and manifest a leadership elitism throught their organizational structure. From personal experience , the majority of these so called ministers that love to propogate this doctrine are not under authority to anyone , so they are not accountable , nor do they want to be held accountable for what they preach. However , they love to use the 'I am accountable only to Jesus ' tactic to where they go back again to the defense of " questioning me is questioning Jesus " . </question.v.40><question.v.41>This is not to imply that a shadchan has carte blanche to deviate from the truth in any convenient way. Stretching the truth for the sake of a shidduch is permitted only under certain conditions , and the shadchan must be extremely careful , deviating from the truth only when absolutely necessary for both individuals benefit ( 4 ) . When major problems such as diseases are under discussion , it is absolutely forbidden to lie ( 5 ) .

You know , if a kid goes up to a rabbi and says , 'I 'm not sure I believe ' they say , 'Well , you know , you just keep you just keep showing up. ' It 's not the most crucial aspect of Judaism. When Christianity came to being , it 's the first of these great monotheistic religions that came to being after doubt had already a huge literature. The ancient Greeks and Romans had a huge literature of doubt that questioned , 'How can you have an anthropomorphic God ? How can you imagine God suddenly coming into being ? What sense does it make to say the world was created by God when we then have to problematize what created God ? ' All these questions were already well worked out and Christianity I had always wondered how does a culture that had already dismissed Zeus and Hera then take on this sort of anthropomorphized god ?

In addition , there should only be one investigator conducting the interview or interrogation. Having two or more investigators in the room makes it much more difficult for the suspect to tell the truth.

The Court held that the right to access to legal advice at the initial stages of police interrogation was of paramount importance . The defendant had been denied access to legal advice during the first 48 hours of detention ( in accordance with the Northern Ireland ( Emergency Provisions ) Act 1987 ( Eng ) s 15 ) . This violated his right to a fair trial : Murray v United Kingdom ( 1996 ) 22 EHRR 29 at 67. For a discussion of the likely approach of the ECHR to the English provisions see Munday. Note that there is no requirement in s 34 that a prima facie case exist before the section applies ( this requirement is expressly stated in s 35 , which allows adverse inferences to be drawn from the defendant ' s silence at trial ) . Silence in answer to police questioning may be taken into account on the question whether s prima facie case exists : s 34 ( 2 ) , 36 ( 2 ) , 37 ( 2 ) .

This interpretation in obviously incorrect. Nachiketas , having already died and arrived at the doors of the god of death , can not have a doubt whether a soul exists after death , when his own experience is available. Though there can be a doubt in this context whether Nachiketas reached Yamaloka dead or alive , it is clearly stated in the Taittiriiya BraahmaNa , where the full story is given , that he was dead and reached Yamaloka. Other circumstances such as Nachiketas father performing Visvajid yaaga to attain heaven , etc. , also show that continuity of the soul after death is not being questioned here. Even the second boon of Nachiketas leading to the renaming of Svargya Agni confirms the same belief. Therefore , the third question can not be " Is there a soul after death , " but " Are the souls regulated by God after death and Liberation ?

Because we believe in the death , burial and resurrection of Christ are we willing to put all logic aside and determine never to question God 's Word ? </question.v.156><question.v.157>The inquiry is inspired , in part , from the holding of Hall vs. Clifton 150 F.R.D. 525 ( E.D. Penn. 1993 ) in which the Court issued a blanket order prohibiting counsel from privately conferring with their client during breaks or recesses in the client 's deposition and further ordered that if such conferences did occur , the opposing counsel could question the client during the deposition regarding the content of those private discussions with counsel. The Committee also notes that a growing number of jurisdictions have adopted rules which limit or prohibit counsel from privately consulting with their client during breaks or recesses in a client 's deposition.2 These authorities , however , are not controlling in California and do not address the ethical implications of such " no-consultation " rules. Moreover , the Committee generally does not opine on questions of discovery procedure or the application of substantive , rather than ethical , law.3 The Committee , therefore , limits its analysis of the inquiry to the application of ethical duties of California attorneys during a client 's deposition . </question.v.157><question.v.158>" We must constantly question what we have come to accept as the truth , " she stressed , " to keep an open mind.

They are to be constructed as a follow-up device flowing from the response and ought to be a precise question put directly and immediately to the Minister , without any further statement . [ 99 ] In the past , Speakers used their discretion to insist that a supplementary question be on the same subject and as a general rule be asked of the same Minister. [ 100 ] However , at the beginning of the Thirty-Sixth Parliament in 1997 , Speaker Parent allowed the practice to be modified by not insisting that an additional question be , strictly speaking , supplementary to the main question.

The suspect was taken to the police station and questioned for 30-40 minutes without being advised of her Miranda rights. During this questioning , she confessed that her plan was for her son , who was afflicted with cerebral palsy , to die in his sleep in the fire. The interrogating officer then gave the suspect a 20 minute break. He proceeded at that point to advise her of her Miranda rights and obtained a signed waiver.

A TIME/CNN poll of 937 registered voters questioned by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman last Thursday -- two days after Clinton 's primary victories -- gives some startling answers. A month earlier , Clinton finished in a dead heat with Bush , 43 to 43 ; now he loses by 11 points , 44 to 33 ( a jump in the undecided column made most of the difference ) . In a three-way race , Clinton barely edges Texas billionaire Ross Perot , 25 to 21 , with Bush pulling 40 . It is rare enough for a candidate not to get a bounce in the polls after winning some major primaries; to lose ground is almost unheard of. Some reasons for the deterioration : asked if Clinton is " someone you can trust , " respondents voted 59 no to 28 yes. Questioned more specifically as to whether Clinton is " honest and trustworthy enough to be President , 53 said no and 39 yes -- vs. a 59 yes to 37 no vote for Bush on the same question . </question.v.178><question.v.179>Fair enough , the police are going to assume that any money involved came from Amy , but it would be difficult to prove that she knew that it might be used for anything illegal - and the case has n't come to trial yet so Blake has n't been found guilty of anything.

It is our firmly held belief that any contradictions stem from our misunderstanding and wrongly held biases rather than a problem with God 's Word. Just as many of the patriarchs in the Bible wrestled with and questioned God , so too is it a good thing for us.

Obviously , if the original sharpness was n't there in the image to start with , I could not have done this. That fact demonstrates that the original sharpness of the image has been degraded.

Thus , an early study of questioning done in 1912 ( Stevens 1912 ) found that two-thirds of classroom questions required nothing more than direct recitation of textbook information.

Each side tells the jurors their version of the case and what they intend to prove. The plaintiff in a civil case ( the prosecution in a criminal case ) gives its opening statement first. Following opening statements , the plaintiff or prosecution proceeds with the evidence of their case. One form of evidence is the testimony of witnesses. The plaintiff or prosecution will ask a witness to the witness stand and , after the witness is sworn in , will ask him or her some questions. This is known as direct examination. After the plaintiff or prosecution is finished , the defense is then permitted to ask the witness some questions. This is called cross-examination.

And as to the voice in question she does not remember whether she saw a light , or St. Catherine either. She says that she asked three things of her voices : one was her deliverance; the second was that God should aid the French and keep the towns which were under their control; and the third was the salvation of her soul.

This concern may call off Arzerra 's fast-track regulatory approval status as although the document acknowledges that Arzerra as a single agent displays anti-tumour activity in CLL patients , this observation on its own is insufficient to support fast-track status.

He relies instead on legalistic , artfully phrased and heavily nuanced replies that may be technically accurate but also misleading. The resulting belief that he is incurably evasive has probably damaged Clinton far more than any specific issue. It ties in with a not very specific but nonetheless widely felt discomfort about his calculated ambition ( he says he has wanted to be President since he was a teenager ) and some alleged shifts of position on policy. At least among some people , these factors create a general impression of insincerity , of a synthetic politician who will do or say anything to become President. In fact , 67 of those questioned in last week 's TIME/CNN poll said exactly that : Clinton " would say anything to get elected President.

You will also be questioned about the nature and extent of the injuries you 're claiming , and the type and duration of any medical treatment . </question.v.233><question.v.234>Leading questions on direct are usually not persuasive because they involve the lawyer testifying through close-ended questions and the witness simply parroting " yes " or " no.

My suggestion is that you should generally avoid leading questions on direct when describing the meat of your story. You may need to lead or ask closed-ended questions when suggesting topics , speeding things along , refreshing recollection , covering undisputed facts , laying a foundation , questioning a person of age or infancy , or examining an adverse witness. . </question.v.234><question.v.235>Yes. Suspects can invoke their right to silence at any time , even if they have begun talking to the police. Of course , statements made before invoking the right to silence are admissible , so deciding to remain silent after previously answering questions may be the equivalent of locking the barn door after the horse has run away. To stop police questioning , a suspect merely has to say something like , I don ' t want to say anything else , or , I want to talk to a lawyer before we go any farther. If the police continue to question a suspect who invokes Miranda , nothing the suspect says after indicating a desire to halt the interview is admissible in evidence . </question.v.235><question.v.236>Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert speaks at a ceremony in Latrun , central Israel , Thursday , May 22 , 2008.

The interrogation , including the suspect ' s refusal to answer questions , was recorded and presented as evidence at trial.1 However , examining justices were not an organised or effectively supervised body and were prone to mistreat suspects to obtain confessions. The right to silence when questioned by police evolved through the common law as a result of judicial distrust of the investigative techniques employed by examining justices.2 </question.v.250><question.v.251>e ) the right to choose a current undergraduate member of the University community to serve as a peer representative to speak on the behalf of the student in question and to question all witnesses.

Her body was discovered by her brother ' s , in front of the high altar , and she was reburied in that chapel. I don ' t believe that there is any reason to doubt that the chapel is her final resting place. There is the possibility that the remains examined by Dr Mouat was not Anne , but there is also evidence to suggest that his assessment in this respect was correct as the individual was buried in a suitable location , had been decapitated and was female. Admittedly such examinations back then were not as advanced as now so some of Dr Mouat ' s assessments can be questioned , however the location of the remains strengths the argument that it is Anne.

Arguing or resisting the police will not help you; it may increase your chances that the police will arrest you and bring criminal charges against you. It probably also will give them grounds to bring even more criminal charges against you , and it may make it harder for you to get out of jail on bail if you are charged.

Yet his re-envisioning of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is also a beautiful tribute to the original children 's story by Lewis Carroll. With a script written by Linda Woolverton ( THE LION KING , BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and MULAN ) there is just as much of Carroll in the heart of Alice as there is Burton. There is a sadness deep down that is not exactly what you d expect. Burton s Alice has grown and she questions all those around her. She is a very fitting , modern day heroine in a world that is familiar , yet strange. Once she arrives in Underland - young Alice mistakenly thought her dream world was called Wonderland - she is questioned as to whether she is truly Alice . It seems that she is not the only one asking questions. But the truth is , she can hardly believe that she has fallen deep into the earth in this fantasy world.

In the absence of the warnings , some suspects will blurt out voluntary statements that the prosecution can then offer into evidence at trial. For example , instead of immediately interrogating a suspect , a police officer may reveal the evidence that the officer has thus far gathered from other sources. Figuring that there ' s nothing to be gained from silence , the suspect may indicate a willingness to confess. The officer can then advise the suspect of his Miranda rights , making the subsequent confession admissible in evidence against the defendant at trial ( U.S. v.

Faith too often is thought of as the acceptance of beliefs which are beyond question , not subject to the test of experience and individual reason.

But questions are good , for without questions we do not begin to search for answers. But do not expect the answers to come in a matter of a few months of study. The academic study of religion serves to open us to the complexity of religion and to expand our awareness of the depth to which any one religion can go. One course in religion will not provide all the answers we may be seeking. To the contrary , it often provides us with more questions than we even imagined might exist ! </question.v.284><question.v.285>A.

Along these lines , in a 1982 study , Hall and Sandler found that , when compared to their female peers , young males are much more likely to ask questions and to have them answered in a serious way. Minority students ' participation in classroom discussion is similarly endangered. We know that sometimes there are culturally organized differences between classroom and home regarding the appropriateness of asking questions , the rules about who can be questioned , or what forms inquiries should take ( Boggs 1972 , Heath 1983 ) . Yet , when minority students fail to join in classroom inquiry , teachers may interpret their hesitation , not as uncertainty about the rules of communication , but as lack of ability , and may cease to consider them valuable , contributing members of a class ( Bremme and Erickson 1977 , Erickson 1975 , Erickson and Schultz 1981 . ) </question.v.300><question.v.301>When the Logical Positivist meets the Psychoanalyst , perhaps the only thing they will have in common is an interest in asking.

In such cases , the Hearing Officer may advise the party that the Hearing Officer has no questions to ask the witness and then give the Party an opportunity to question their own witness. The Hearing Officer should limit the testimony to relevant matters.

She was told that she was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time. Laura claims that the detectives coerced her into talking about her involvement in the incident by telling her that they were not interested in prosecuting anyone for the robbery but only for the murder. She also claims that the detectives told her that they believed Timmy was the shooter and that if she made a credible statement about the incident , she could help him stay out of trouble.

If you decide to videotape a therapy session , make sure you get written permission from the parent , guardian , or , in the case of foster children , their attorneys. Numerous problems have arisen when professionals questioned young children in ways that were considered suggestive , resulting in doubts about the validity of the child ' s allegations of sexual abuse. Be sure to get advice from someone who has successfully videotaped children being questioned about abuse before attempting to make a video to be used as evidence.

After a person has officially been taken into custody ( detained by police ) , but before any interrogation takes place , police must inform them of their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

The most common reason for taking a deposition is to learn what that witness knows or does not know about the facts involved in a particular case.

That being said , Secretary Rice recently explained that the United States and other countries have long used renditions to transport terrorist suspects from the country where they were captured to their home country or to other countries where they can be questioned , held , or brought to justice. Rendition is a vital tool in combating international terrorism , which takes terrorists out of action and saves lives. I would like to emphasize that the United States does not transport , and has not transported , detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture. The United States has not transported anyone , and will not transport anyone , to a country if the United States believes he or she will be tortured.

The Left 's invocation of " patriotism " at that point is an attempt to change the subject : rather than discussing the behavior that 's undermining US policy , they want to discuss their critics. This is typical of how the Left " debates " . The CNN question is just another instance of the same. Rather than permit a reasonable evaluation of Obama 's policies , it attempts to bury the entire topic by gathering all questions under one : " Is he 'patriotic ' or not ? " Since , in the Left 's playbook , questioning one 's patriotism constitutes a political slime attack , the question begs for a " Yes " answer , after which CNN will pronounce , " Then there 's no point in further discussion.

That is , not the result of any questioning about the matter. It is helpful , therefore , to indicate those statements which were uttered without questions or leads from you. It is often useful to have children draw their abuser and/or what happened during the abuse. These pictures can support the treatment notes regarding the allegations of the child. Not only can the picture depict what the child says took place; it can also show the victim 's rage , fear of an abuser , the details of the abuse , etc. Label any drawings created during sessions with the date and what the child states they have drawn . </question.v.421><question.v.422>Investigators arrived at Olmert 's official residence in Jerusalem at midmorning and questioned him for 90 minutes , police said.

I have always found this particular exercise somewhat unusual given the nature of this place. I fully understand Question Period in the House of Commons , where ministers are present and can be questioned directly , and where the sessions are televised. In our system of parliamentary government , the government of the day is chosen from and is accountable to the House of Commons , not the Senate. Governments rise or fall based on the confidence of the House , not the Senate. Question Period in the House is the principal mechanism by which the House holds the government to account and why one former prime minister referred to Question Period as the crucible of parliamentary democracy. Such is not the case in the Senate. By convention , we normally have but one cabinet minister in the Senate. By virtue of the fact that he or she is the Leader of the Government in the Senate , they usually hold no other portfolio . </question.v.427><question.v.428>" Honest to God was a product of its time : traditions were questioned , orthodoxy was challenged and norms of behavior disregarded. ...

This concept of LoA is purely epistemological , and it should not be confused with other forms of levellism that are more or less explicitly based on an ontological commitment concerning the intrinsic architecture , syntax or structure of the system discussed ( Dennett [ 1971 ] , Marr [ 1982 ] , Newell [ 1982 ] , Simon [ 1969 ] , see now Simon [ 1996 ]; Poli [ 2001 ] provides a reconstruction of ontological levellism; more recently , Craver [ 2004 ] has analysed ontological levellism , especially in biology and cognitive science ) . Ontological levellism has come under increasing attack. Heil [ 2003 ] and Schaffer [ 2003 ] have seriously and convincingly questioned its plausibility. However , epistemological levellism is flourishing , especially in computer science ( Roever et al.

Contrary to lay predictions , when children are questioned in a warm , supportive environment , they are more likely to resist misleading suggestions than those who are questioned in an intimidating arena. Social support in this way decreases anxiety and increases self-confidence. Intimidation tactics from opposing counsel must be quashed at every turn , not because it is unpleasant for the child witness but because it subverts the task at hand finding fact. Judges almost invariably will chastise counsel who decide on aggressive tactics with child witnesses . </question.v.450><question.v.451>Question 4 : Each Minister is questioned for 30 minutes by Members of the Assembly.

At that point , the employer must either grant the request and delay questioning until the steward arrives; deny the request and end the interview immediately; or give the employee the choice of having the interview without representation or ending it immediately. If the employer denies the request for union representation and continues the meeting , the employee has the legal right to refuse to answer questions. However , it is a good idea to phrase the refusal in such a way that it can not be interpreted as insubordination; for example , by saying that you are willing to write down their questions and respond once you 've spoken to a union representative.

But Romanian guards , or as she called them , Ceausescu ' s men , kept Lidia and her nine children under constant surveillance and Sylvestru in prison. Their crime ? Questions. Questions about communism , about the regime that silenced ideas. Still guns , middle-of-the-night raids and barbed-wire fencing couldn ' t quell the fire in her belly.

The nature of questioning in relation to evidence is also characteristic of crime detection. This may involve both question avoidance and question evasion : when ( time ) , where ( place ) , which ( instrument ) , how ( mode of operation ) , what ( nature of crime ) , who ( suspects ) , why ( motive ) . </question.v.493><question.v.494>[ 13 ] A.

True , the department said the police report was a summary of what happened at the scene and that it stands behind the report. However , our job as journalists is to probe and investigate , especially when there are discrepancies as large as this. Instead of being so preoccupied with the type of beer the President and his buds would be drinking , we should have been asking why the police were so insistent on finding out the race of the alleged suspects and why they didn ' t pay more attention to Ms. Whalen ' s statement , clearly heard on the 911 call , that the men in the house might actually live there . </question.v.495><question.v.496>By now , you 'd think Torres would be used to the rumors.

The article falsely intimates that Mr. Brivik improperly used $ 1 .3. million from investors to pay personal debt. No personal debt was paid. An existing mortgage on the property purchased by River Meadows Development , LLC was paid off , per the agreement with the investors and the organization of the company. ln the manner in which the article was written , it is clearly intimated that when questioned by the reporter regarding the transaction , Mr. Brivik , as if offering an excuse , said the money was always intended to pay corporate debt. " Mr. Brivik said the loan did pay corporate debt and it was intended to do so. Mr. Brivik personally showed the appropriate documents , including the actual closing statement , to the reporter before he wrote the article. Those documents clearly showed the funds were used for their intended purpose.

In writing Academic Preparation in the Arts ( College Board 1985 ) and working on a study of assessment in the arts funded by the Rockefeller Foundation , I have spent a number of hours in the back of classrooms. From there I have seen skilled teachers raise questions that ignited discussion , offer a question that promised to simmer over several days , or pursue a line of questioning that led to understanding. Those teachers suggest a counter-portrait of classroom questioning , one that contains detailed clues about how the language of classroom dialogue can be used to establish and sustain not just a momentary discussion but a lasting climate of inquiry. My examples happen to come from arts and humanities classrooms , but I can think of no reason why they should not apply in other subject areas as well -granting , of course , that transferring them may reveal interesting differences among subject areas . </question.v.499><question.v.500>A line of questioning that does not appear to be logical or necessary may tend to confuse or disturb respondents. Questions should proceed in the logical order set up by the instructions and clearly denoted by headings and lead questions. ( This is discussed further in chapter 11. ) The questions should go from a general topic to the specific item or from the integration of specific details to a logical summary question. Like things should be grouped together , and parts should be structured in a logical progression of function , process , and chronology. For example , a survey of training programs might naturally start with questions on training objectives and then proceed to training plans , curriculums , course programming , lesson plans , instructor selection and training , course material , student selection , student progress assessments , and evaluation. It would , for example , be unnatural to start with evaluations . </question.v.500><question.v.501>Why do we ask Edge questions that challenge the " anesthesiology " of accepted wisdom and so the traditional answers we are given as to who and what we are ?

Dr. Ed Trevathan , of the CDC , described the various immunization safety committees within the agency and stated that these were probably more appropriate forums for investigating any relationship between vaccines and autism.

She firmly believes God will not permit her to be brought so low , or be without His aid , or miracle.

The common law rule , which is retained in many state courts , regards cross-examination as the acid test of the truth and affords the parties a wide latitude in the cross-examination of an adverse witness. This rule permits counsel to question the witness on any subject relevant to the dispute and does not restrict the scope of cross-examination to matters on which the witness was questioned on direct . </question.v.514><question.v.515>Amos Kimunya ( right ) is joined by his lawyer Githu Muigai ( left ) before being questioned on the sale of the Grand Regency hotel by the Parliamentary Finance Committee.

Somehow we ca n't get away from a fixation on the link between biology and behavior. A causal relationship was long championed by the Mendelian Darwinians of the Western World , as breeding and sterilization programs to get rid of the genes for mental deficiencies became programs to get rid of the genes for all sorts of undesirable social behaviors , and then programs to get rid of the undesirable races with the imagined objectionable social behaviors. Science finally stepped back from the abyss of human tragedy that inevitably ensued , and one result was to break this link by questioning whether human races are valid biological entities. By now , generations of biological anthropologists have denied the biology of race. Arguing that human races are socially constructed categories and not biologically defined ones , biological anthropologists have been teaching that if we must make categories for people , " ethnic group " should replace " race " in describing them . </question.v.516><question.v.517>If you have been questioned by the police you should speak with a criminal defense lawyer immediately to learn more about your rights , your defenses , and the complicated legal system.

He questioned why medical service would have been denied to an inmate and later given after a family member complains. Dennis Kendall , Acting Deputy Director for Health Services , explained that most of the medical grievances filed by a family member are usually brought to their attention after a visitation and can include things such as an inmate who has requested an appointment but has not yet seen the doctor.

The reason these questions are asked is to determine what were the exertional ( physical ) requirements of the job and what were the non-exertional ( non-physical ) requirements of the job.

Next , the student in question is called before the committee. The student in question is urged to choose a peer representative who will be present throughout the hearing. Only a current undergraduate member of the University community who is not a member of the Honor Committee may serve as the peer representative. The peer representative may ask questions of all witnesses. Though investigators do not participate in deliberations , they will have an opportunity to contribute information pertaining to the investigation following each witness ' s testimony. At the conclusion of all testimony , the investigators may , in the presence of the peer representative , present a summary of the case. Before the committee begins deliberations on guilt or innocence , the peer representative and the student in question will have the option of delivering a final defense summary to the committee. The identities of the student in question , reporting witness , and any other student witnesses are kept completely confidential.

Your department has requirements that must be consistent with college and university documents , but the wording or expectations are not necessarily the same. The department members who typically review your work may be well versed in your skill sets and work record. The college committee members may not have a similar background and so depend on your skills to present your case. If a candidate does not take the college document and committee into account when preparing materials , he or she may assume understanding at the college level that is not there.

Attorneys sometimes do this because they would rather that the jury did not hear the witnesses credentials , since credentials indicating extensive training and experience might result in the jury giving additional credibility to their testimony . </question.v.556><question.v.557>Ms. Tippett : I 'm Krista Tippett.

Believing she was being persecuted for righteousness sake , Hazel turned to Internet chat rooms for support. The Christian friends she met on the Internet challenged her faith and as she began to question what she had been taught , Hazel found her Jehovah ' s Witness friends unable to answer her questions from the Bible. This is when God got a hold of her heart and she learned what salvation in the grace of Jesus Christ is all about. Read Hazel 's Story out of Jehovah 's Witnesses . </question.v.561><question.v.562>One approach is to change our questioning style. To encourage divergent thinking , I avoid questions with only one acceptable answer. Questions with only one answer are limiting and do not encourage imagination , they do not encourage divergent thinking , and they are less likely to encourage self-confidence and self-esteem. Questions with only one answer are often too easy or too hard. The average student is either bored or frustrated. Motivation declines . </question.v.562><question.v.563>At first the audit was n't very painful : After a tour through the office and a look at Atamira 's books , Brimelow says , the agent told him he could n't find any reason for the investigation. But it went on. And on. Bills were questioned; deductions were allowed and then disqualified. More than 18 months later , the issue seems almost resolved - with Brimelow being exonerated.

The older antihistamines like diphenhydramine have sedation as one of their side effects and so have been used as sleep aids. Diphenhydramine is very good for bringing about sleepiness if taken at a time when we expect to be awake ( such as during the daytime ) . Its use to promote falling asleep more quickly at night has not been well studied and it 's effectiveness for this is probably overestimated. In addition , antihistamines can cause frequent awakenings and interruptions from sleep , so its usefulness as a sleep aid has been questioned by some authorities . </question.v.564><question.v.565>It 's doubtful the FBI questioned anything. They are idiots who will do what they 're told , even lie.

This is absurd. If they filed a report , would that have been met with the same nonsense they got with the Guantanamo abuse -- Spike Bowman shows up and says , " Hay , it 's all great.

He responded that he had never even considered the thought. They continued to press Nick on his recent activities with respect to the videos he has released in rapid fire as of late. They implied that his future professional career could be effected as his mother listened in disbelief in the same room. Nick has his own place but the agents waited until they could question him at his parent 's home. An obvious attempt at embarrassing him and trying to drive a wedge between him and his family , not to mention a blatant intimidation tactic . </question.v.571><question.v.572>It is felt that Kate will be re-questioned as a witness and will accompanied by her lawyer.

One would normally think so , but what of the case where an untruth is valued more highly by someone than the truth ?

" " Do you know anyone who owns a Pontiac Transport ? " " Last Friday night did you drive a Pontiac Transport ?

Look at your data : your observations , measurements , sketches , photographs , notes , and the information you gathered from outside resources. All of this becomes your evidence. What can you infer ? Was your prediction correct ? Decide whether or not your evidence allows you to accept or reject your hypothesis. For example , suppose you questioned whether a nearby factory was polluting a lake. Based on observations you hypothesized that the factory was the polluter. If your evidence showed the factory as the polluter , your hypothesis would be supported. Suppose however that your evidence showed that the factory was not the polluter. In that case your evidence rejects your hypothesis. That would lead to new questions and hypotheses about who or what the polluter is. As you draw conclusions , it is very important to review your procedures to make sure that they are not flawed and how you might have refine your research methods.

On the other hand , a person innocent of a particular crime is inclined to tell the truth about past acts for the simple reason that they came prepared to tell the truth during the interview. Consider a rape suspect who is known to have been questioned before about a rape similar to the one being investigated. It would be improper to ask this suspect , I know you were a suspect in a previous rape allegation , what happened there ? A much more productive question to ask would be , Have you ever been questioned concerning an allegation of rape before ? This question allows the truthful subject to acknowledge the earlier investigation and places the deceptive suspect in a dilemma. He must decide whether to reveal that he was previously investigated or lie to the question. Many guilty suspects will deny being questioned about such previous accusations . </question.v.626><question.v.627>Mr. CARVIN.

( Like all on a quest , they hope their end is attainable and worth attaining. ) Because they fail to find any truth , their sincerity has been questioned by those who think it is not so very difficult to know some truth , or at least not impossible. We will examine this criticism later. But for now this should be part of the definition of a skeptic , the chief part , that she is an honest and devoted inquirer after true knowledge. Nescio 's honesty brings her to confess her own present ignorance of something , whereas a love of truth takes her the rest of the way and determines her at least to try to remedy her ignorance through inquiry . </question.v.634><question.v.635>Campaign representatives for Sen.

A being with a mind , conscious of itself and its existence , experiencing a reality , needs to organise the data that it receives from its senses. Simply observing and recording does not allow for consciousness. It is what we do with that information that allows us to think. In order to process and store the vast amount of information received , the human brain attempts to identify patterns in the data; looking for the patterns behind what is experienced. This is asking questions of the sensory information , and requires reasoning. By definition a conscious mind seeks to know. Knowing something requires more than just data , but intelligence or reasoning applied to that data. To attempt to obtain knowledge we must therefore question the data our mind receives; thus , consciousness questions. </question.v.639><question.v.640>Laurie Block Spigel is a home educator who has lectured and written articles on education , parenting , and raising a family in New York City.

It is clear from the circumstances that Amy ' s interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct. There was no emergency in progress , she told the police when they arrived that things were fine , and the officer questioning her was seeking to determine not what was happening but what had happened. Objectively viewed , the primary , if not sole , purpose of the investigation was to investigate a possible crime. While the formal features of Crawford ' s interrogation strengthened her statements ' testimonial aspect , such features were not essential to the point. In both cases , the declarants were separated from the defendants , the statements recounted how potentially criminal past events began and progressed , and the interrogation took place some time after the events were over. For the same reasons the comparison to Crawford is compelling , the comparison to Davis is unpersuasive. The statements in Davis were taken when McCottry was alone , unprotected by police , and apparently in immediate danger from Davis. She was seeking aid , not telling a story about the past.

When the doctor reported back to the defense lawyer that hired her , did she send a copy of her medical report to the patient ? When you carry this line of questioning out to its logical conclusion , it becomes obvious to the jury that the doctor is the defense lawyer 's hired gun , not a treating physician of the plaintiff , and should be rejected by the jury as a credible medical witness in the case . </question.v.673><question.v.674>2.43 Research conducted in Northern Ireland and England has produced varying statistics on the number of suspects who remain silent during police interrogation.

" It should be appreciated , however , that the suspect at this stage will probably not be willing to offer a full confession. Therefore , the first questions asked of a suspect following the acceptance of an alternative question should elicit short answers that are non-threatening. Once the suspect is committed to his admission the confession should be developed by eliciting a narrative account of the crime. It is important at this stage to allow the suspect to talk about his crime at his own pace. If the suspect offers information that is inconsistent with the victim 's account or crime scene analysis , he should nonetheless be allowed to continue to tell his whole story. The investigator can always go back and question the suspect about discrepancies but it is legally important that the suspect offer a free-flowing narrative response of his crime.

You will be questioned by a panel of three to five people. They will probably be seated on one side of a table. On the other side of the table will be your chair. If your chair is in close proximity to the table , you will be sitting at the table with the panel. In most cases , your chair will be approximately six to ten feet away from the table. In this set up , the interviewers want you to sit a short distance away from them. This allows them to see your entire body and observe your mannerism.

A formal written research proposal must be given to the student 's Ph.D. Dissertation Committee at least one week prior to the presentation. The general audience will be allowed to question the student for at least fifteen minutes. After the general audience ( i.e. students , FPE faculty , people from industry , etc. ) is dismissed , the student 's Ph.D. Dissertation Committee will question the student in private on any or all aspects of the proposed dissertation work , including the experimental procedure , experimental analysis , theoretical aspects and prior work in the area.

Thus , Officer Altie lacked probable cause to make an arrest , and did not intend to make an arrest. Officer Altie was engaged in general on-the- scene questioning , and therefore did not have to give the Miranda warning . </question.v.714><question.v.715>One impeachment , on a major point , is all that is needed to destroy the witness 's credibility in the eyes of the jury. After the witness has read the impeaching material from the deposition , you should remove the deposition , leaving the impeached witness directly facing the jury. You should pause and look further at the deposition as if reviewing the material; leave the witness for as long a pause as possible after the impeachment with the jury looking directly into the witness 's eyes. Then return slowly to counsel table and retrieve other materials for questioning , taking as long as possible before the next question , possibly inquiring of the court , " May I have a moment , your Honor ? " Judges resent witnesses who lie under oath in their courts and will generally be very cooperative at this point. This leaves the impeached witness on the hot seat under the intense scrutiny of the judge and jury with no place to hide . </question.v.715><question.v.716>Under federal and state equal employment opportunity laws , it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of an applicant 's race or ethnic group , national origin or citizenship status , religion , sex , sexual orientation , age , marital status or disability. Therefore , raising a topic or asking a question pertaining to any of these protected subjects could be considered discriminatory , if the effect of the pre-employment inquiry is to put the applicant at an employment disadvantage ( " adverse impact " ) and the employer can not show that the inquiry is related to a bona fide job requirement. Pre-employment testing has borne the brunt of attacks on discriminatory selection procedures , but employment interviews also have come under fire.

The First Amendment 's strictures against congressional interference with the right of free speech and assembly could easily be interpreted as preventing the committee from probing the politics of its witnesses. During 1946 and 1947 , most of the men and women who refused to answer HUAC 's questions assumed that they had First Amendment protection. They knew that they were taking risks. They could be cited , indicted , and tried for contempt of Congress and could well end up in prison if the Supreme Court did not overturn their convictions on constitutional grounds. But they and their lawyers expected that they would avoid that outcome . </question.v.723><question.v.724>George Bush debased the town-hall format with many stage-managed charades , and it 's politically dangerous for a Democratic candidate to get tagged with imitating him. Clinton has answered hundreds of town-hall questions with no hint of this , and so her offense falls well short of Bush 's repeated infractions. ( The audience members did n't have little windup keys in their backs. ) But the timing could n't be worse for her. The last week or so , the Iowa campaign has seen a new phase , in which Obama and Edwards , her neck-and-neck rivals , have questioned Clinton 's honesty in almost every news cycle , a job that used to be handed off to staffers. In his well-received speech Saturday to Iowa Democrats , Barack Obama talked about the poll-driven politics and triangulation that are code words for the worst noncorporal sins of the Clinton years in Democratic circles. Clinton already fueled this with her switchback answer about driver 's licenses for illegal immigrants in the last debate.

Some are rhetorical : " Are we ready to begin now ? " Others are mere information checks-a teacher knows the answer and wants to know if students do , too.

Whether taken in the context of Lisbon Treaty debate and questioning the motives behind Libertas ' position or read to be informed about the involvement and profit making of Irish Companies in the Death Trade , it is an informative and analytical article. It is also important for a campaign in defense of democracy to distinguish itself from manufactured organizations such as Libertas as a way to link with the dissent of the ordinary. Therefore , the noises to keep this information until after the referendum to prevent damage to No vote on the comments here is anything but the age old scaremongering debate on whether to have half truths with a hefty coast , as oppose to truth at any coast.

For instance , in two separate studies involving victims of crime , the factual questions about the crimes were asked before attitude questions because it was desirable to have the attitude reflect consideration of the specific crimes considered. Pretests showed that attitudes about crime did not change regardless of whether these attitude questions were asked before or after the crime-reporting incident questions. However contrary to expectations , the crime reports were more accurate if attitude questions were asked first.

Canon 2B provides that a judge should not allow " family , social , or other relationships to influence his or her judicial conduct or judgment. " While not directly governing the issue , the spirit of Rule 18b ( 2 ) , which provides that a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned , has applicability here. Consequently , it is the conclusion of the Committee that the judge should recuse himself. Procedural mechanisms which might effectively deal with the problem of a party making a practice of naming a judge and his successors as party defendants for the sole purpose of securing a recusal are beyond the scope of this Committee 's authority . </question.v.737><question.v.738>Brother Jean Toutmouill , priest of the order of Preaching brothers , about 34 years of age , witness produced , received , sworn , and examined on Thursday , said and deposed that on the morning of the day when the sentence was delivered against this Jeanne , to wit Wednesday , the Eve of the Feast of Corpus Christi , he , in the company of brother Martin Ladvenu of the same order , visited this Jeanne to exhort her to save her soul , and heard her say to Pierre Maurice who had preceded him there , that what she had said and confessed touching the crown was pure fiction , and she herself was the angel : this the said master Pierre took down in Latin. Then she was questioned about the voices which came to her , and the apparitions.

His friend Chaerephon went to the shrine of Apollo at Delphi and asked the priestess of the shrine whether there was anyone wiser than Socrates. The priestess , speaking for Apollo , answered that no one was wiser than Socrates. Upon hearing this story , Socrates set out to prove the priestess wrong and began to question those in Athens who had a reputation for wisdom -- politicians , poets and artisans. What he discovered was that although all these individuals claimed to have wisdom , they actually possessed very little.

If the committee member can make sense of the candidate 's presentation , then they can enjoy looking at exhibits of interest to them.

A being with a mind , conscious of itself and its existence , experiencing a reality , needs to organise the data that it receives from its senses. Simply observing and recording does not allow for consciousness. It is what we do with that information that allows us to think. In order to process and store the vast amount of information received , the human brain attempts to identify patterns in the data; looking for the patterns behind what is experienced. This is asking questions of the sensory information , and requires reasoning. By definition a conscious mind seeks to know. Knowing something requires more than just data , but intelligence or reasoning applied to that data. To attempt to obtain knowledge we must therefore question the data our mind receives; thus , consciousness questions . </question.v.749><question.v.750>WASHINGTON -- The government-installed head of AIG told Congress Wednesday the insurance giant is making progress toward repaying U.S. taxpayers by selling many of its foreign assets , but lawmakers questioned whether the plan makes sense and demanded details . </question.v.750><question.v.751>Then we have a subject that is very near and dear to my heart -- -- the prisoners of conscience.

During the committee investigation , Churchill responded to these claims by asserting he actually wrote the Robbins article and allowed her to put her name on it. Professor Wesson explained that the committee found this practice to be research misconduct in and of itself. Professor Wesson noted that Churchill would write dubious propositions in articles written under his name and cite other articles he had written under someone else ' s name as authority. Essentially , Churchill was citing himself. Further , Professor Wesson said this practice is damaging to other scholars who try to build off these works with the false sense that a certain proposition is correct because the information was cited by many authors. O ' Rourke drove this point home by displaying an example of an author who cited articles by Churchill , Robbins , and another author ( all three of which Churchill allegedly wrote ) as strong evidence that a certain proposition is true . </question.v.767><question.v.768>Expect to be questioned by several people.

The questions could be " closed-end " types ( for example " yes " or " no " ) or they could be " open-ended " ( " what do you think of. . . ? " ) .

The first couple of weeks were all fun and games. There were a couple of guys who admitted to being mild perverts ( sexual thoughts in church , touching female clients too much ect. ) . It was funny. It got a bit more serious with a beauty queen who was asked about plastic surgery and possible eating disorders. Finally the show began to delve into the emotions of contestants when a man was questioned about his health , his self esteem and his resentment towards his mom. But the latest installment in the sadistic series really took the cake . </question.v.775><question.v.776>Some people seem to question the authenticity of the orginals when there are so many different manuscripts with slight variations. This is a shame. The opposite is true. The agreement of the scriptures prove the existence of the original documents. The number of manuscripts for the New Testament scriptures is far greater than any other ancient text. It is through these variants ( differences on words or spellings used ) , we can trace back and discover what the original text had said . </question.v.776><question.v.777>As the report in the News was allowed to stand for four days without correction , and as Rabbi Hirsch did not even privately , by letter or by phone , disclaim responsibility for the article , to Mr. Mangasarian , the latter claims he was justified in assuming that the published report was reliable. But it is with pleasure that the Independent Religious Society gives Rabbi Hirsch this opportunity to explain his position. We hope he will also let us know whether he said to the reporter " I do not believe in Mr. Mangasarian 's argument that Christianity has inspired massacres , wars and inquisitions. It is a stock argument and not to the point. " This is extraordinary; and as the Rabbi does not question the statement , we infer that it is a correct report of what he said.

He questioned Mr. Larson about the content of the discussion with Ms. Albright. The issue of the size of the building was discussed and how the measurements were gathered. He was questioned about filling out the application to rebuild the Cabin on March 28 , 2000. Mr. Gallagher then offered Larson Exhibit 1 , the building permit. Mr. Gallagher then presented a calendar of March 2000 as exhibit 5. Mr. Larson then testified to the condition of the Building and that based on that condition he chose to tear it down and rebuild. He did indicate he replaced the original stones from the foundation around the outside of the new building foundation. He indicated he replaced the stone foundation with a foundation of 4 blocks . </question.v.778><question.v.779>The nonreturn bias ( also called non-respondent bias ) can affect both the sample survey and the complete survey. The bias stems from the fact that the returned questionnaires are not necessarily evenly distributed throughout the sample. The opinions or attitudes expressed by those who returned the survey may or may not represent the attitudes or opinions of those who did not return the survey. It is impossible to determine which is true since the non-respondents remain an unknown quantity. Say , for example , a survey shows that 60 percent of those returning questionnaires favor a certain policy. If the survey had a 70 percent response rate ( a fairly high rate as voluntary surveys go ) , then the favorable replies are actually only 42 percent of those questioned ( 60 percent of the 70 percent who replied ) , which is less than 50 percent ! A minority response in terms of the whole sample . </question.v.779><question.v.780>Footnote : We note that during oral argument , we raised the issue of whether the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applies to Lauras third statement in this case , i.e. was her third statement tainted because it arguably flowed from the first two statements which were obtained in violation of Miranda ? Wong Sun v. U.S. , 371 U.S. 471 ( 1963 ) . Our own research performed following the argument indicates that the fact that Laura had let the cat out of the bag in her prior statements is only one factor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances when determining the voluntariness , and thus the admissibility , of her third statement.

It creates a healthy atmosphere of skepticism and intelligence , and prevents people from coming to unreasonable conclusions. The way our brains work mean that we frequently misinterpret events and data , and in particular , we always think there is more rationality and evidence for our beliefs that there really is. This all matters because when beliefs become unquestioned , a community can become increasingly divorced from reality. It is how religious cults are formed. In extreme cases this leads to complete social rejection and the possibility of suicide cults , as has been seen many times in history. These groups always start out with borderline , but common , beliefs and slowly become more delusional over time. All these groups lacked an instinct to ask questions. It is religion that gains most when people cease asking deep questions about beliefs , and it is truth that suffers most. In the name of truth and common sense , do not let even trivial-seeming beliefs take hold without double-checking them , because once beliefs are trivialised , a slippery slope can take you down into madness ! </question.v.791><question.v.792>Check your arrogance at the door.

They will ask her again to describe her experience. They will ask her again to describe her experience. They will either prepare a statement from what she has told them and ask her to sign it or they will ask her to write out her own statement. If she knows the assailant , they will question her about their relationship. If the suspect is unknown to the victim , they will try to get a description from her. Some detectives who deal with a lot of assault victims are understanding and try to make the questioning as painless as possible. Others hold some of the popular beliefs discussed in the first half of this book , and as a result , treat the victim as if she were the guilty party. Women who have been assaulted can be particularly vulnerable , so it is very important to have support people around at this time . </question.v.794><question.v.795>Before the line of questioning begins , the leading question might first ask if the respondents had an opinion and then ask the extent to which an issue was considered , giving operational definitions and anchors for a well-considered issue.

A debate may serve to exercise quick wit , rhetorical skill and persuasive power , but the debaters are engaged in a contest whose winner may have defended a deleterious position. A ballot-box may serve to measure the opinion of a majority , but the voters rarely touch on the essence of the issues at stake. A hierarchical chain-of-command serves to have orders carried out , but these can not usually be questioned or discussed. And the bane of academic and political life is surely the committee , a group constituted to make decisions , yet notoriously characterized by divisiveness , acrimony , third-man scenarios , and other unsatisfactory or unwholesome compromises. Small wonder that received methods of group decision-making tend to produce discord rather than accord. They factionalize rather than universalize. Truth is sacrificed to expediency; consensus is dispatched by timekeeping. Such methodologies are flawed , and prone to engender dissatisfaction. By contrast , Socratic dialogue anticipates dissent , and transforms it into consensus . </question.v.800><question.v.801>That ' s just what Christine is doing.

And because those questions are taboo there is tremendous power in them. A strategic question is often one of these 'unaskable ' questions. And it usually is unaskable because it challenges the values and assumptions that the whole issue rests upon ... . Questioning values is a strategic task of our times. This is because it is the values behind highly politicised issues that have usually got us into the trouble in the first place. We need to look at a value , a habit , an institutional pattern and ask , 'Is this value working or not ? ' , 'Are these values working for the common good ? ' ... . " Elsewhere Peavey ( Questioning and Listening ) reinforces the point : " Questioning is a basic tool for rebellion.

So if your juvenile gets picked up by the police for loitering they can be transported to the police department and an officer could ask them questions if he/she wanted. I would often talk to kids about things once I picked them up for curfew or " loitering " . </question.v.835><question.v.836>Remember when I questioned how these Gossip Girl episodes were going to keep up with college and high school antics ?

I have had clients inform me that when they insisted that they wanted to speak with a lawyer before further questioning , the police pressed the client to waive that right. Some detectives have told suspects that a lawyer would only make matters worse and that they , the detectives , were the only ones empowered to help the suspect. Detectives have often lied to suspects about the evidence that they have gathered. In an effort to break a suspect ' s silence , detectives have been known to tell him that they have recovered his fingerprint from the crime scene. These tactics are not uncommon. The fact that you refused to speak with the police can not be used against you at trial. Do not panic and do not allow the police to bait you into breaking your silence . </question.v.838><question.v.839>Posing the right question counts as one of the elementary techniques of every interview. Poor questioning technique inevitably leads to an unsatisfactory discussion. Many doctor-patient discussions fail because the doctor poses inappropriate questions. These questions can be unsuitable either because questioning technique or the intention of the question are incorrect. An example would be a discussion which is only aimed to fulfill the objectives of the doctor , rather than those of the patient. A question is the request , put into words , for certain information. Only good questions are able to lead to the desired answer.

At the wedding in Cana , Mary was rebuked because she came to Jesus with a remark containing an improper question. Mary was too hasty; she needed to be more patient. Another example can be seen in the mother of the two sons of Zebedee in Matt. 10 : 21. She asked for a special place for her sons in the kingdom of heaven on the right and left hand of Jesus. The Lord Jesus rebuked her for this question. It would be improper for a friend to question you about signing a note with his fathers name excusing him from school when you know he has no valid reason for skipping classes.

Senator Rios questioned what percent of the applicants are denied employment on the basis of the polygraph results. Mr. Phelps indicated that he would have to provide that information later because he did not have it with him. In response to Senator Rios ' question , Mr. Phelps replied that if an AZPOST applicant refuses to take a polygraph , they would automatically be disqualified. Senator Rios asked for additional information regarding the number of applicants and the percent of those who are denied because they refuse to take a polygraph , as well as the percent who did take a polygraph and were denied because they did not pass the test. He suggested that with a shortage at ADC , he is concerned about how many applicants have done well in all the other categories , but do not pass the polygraph.

Cox had left Trevino ' s office 3 to 4 minutes after bringing V.P. to the office. Cox\did not brief Trevino in how to conduct the questioning. Trevino and Cox testified that their usual practice is to allow the school officials to conduct the investigation and only turn it over to Cox after it is clear that a violation of law exists. The court found that while V.P. may have been in some form of custody , it was not the type of police custody that requires Miranda warnings. The court noted : Appellant cites no Texas cases , and we have been unable to find any , that support his contention that the questioning performed by Trevino , a school official seeing information in furtherance of his duty to protect the safety and well-being of students and faculty at the school , amounted to custodial interrogation and required Trevino to cease his questioning when appellant asked to speak to his lawyer.

Last year , sales were down approximately 11 percent. In 2001 , sales declined approximately 10 percent. And , in 2000 , sales went down seven percent. For an industry that has seen stable growth for many years , this sudden and dramatic decline is having , and will continue to have , severe consequences for the industry. These consequences include music industry employees being laid off , a decrease in funding to find new artists and market new releases to consumers , and generally negatively impacting the U.S. economy as a whole. While in the past some people questioned why the decline was occurring , it is now undisputed that this decline is in large part a result of the unrelenting piracy occurring on P2P networks . </question.v.885><question.v.886>Embedded in this broad concern , however , there is-or ought to be-a second critique-one that points out that the situation of disadvantaged , minority , female , and handicapped students is still more dire ( National Coalition of Advocates for Students 1985 ) .

Hence , when we examine skilled questioning ( or instruction of any kind ) , it is essential to learn from those teachers who understand how to engage a wide community of learners. As one college teacher put it , " It 's not hard to teach philosophy to students who learned the rules of argument and evidence at the dinner table.

A debate may serve to exercise quick wit , rhetorical skill and persuasive power , but the debaters resolve nothing in substantive terms. A ballot-box may serve to measure the opinion of a majority , but the voters never touch on the essence of the issues at stake. A hierarchical chain-of-command serves to have orders carried out , but these can not usually be questioned or discussed. And the bane of academic and political life is surely the committee , a group constituted to make decisions , yet notoriously characterized by divisiveness , acrimony , third-man scenarios , and other unsatisfactory or unwholesome compromises. Small wonder that received methods of group decision-making tend to produce discord rather than accord. They factionalize rather than universalize. Truth is sacrificed to expediency; consensus is dispatched by timekeeping. Such methodologies are deeply flawed , and dissatisfaction with them runs just as deep. By contrast , Socratic dialogue anticipates descensus , and transforms it into consensus . </question.v.892><question.v.893>221.

Lane dissected the applicable sections of the Colorado Open Records Act with Professor Wesson on the stand , reading the applicable sections that appear to state the personal files of state employees are not subject to the Act.

With the help of Kara Kent , Clark was able to restore Lois to normal and vanquish Faora from her body. She thought she had hallucinated the entire experience while she was in The Phantom Zone.

The police can stop a person , and ask questions , without " arresting " the person. Upon seeing suspicious activity , the police may perform what is called a " Terry Stop , " and may temporarily detain people to request that they identify themselves and to question them about the suspicious activity. The scope of a " Terry Stop " is limited to investigation of the specific suspicious activity , and if the police detain people to question them about additional matters , the stop can turn into an " arrest. " For their own safety , the police can perform a " weapons frisk " on the outside of a person 's clothes ( sometimes called " patting down the suspect " ) during a " Terry Stop.

Recognizing that the police had begun to " . . . postpone the right of access to the telephone by delay in booking , " the Legislature amended the statute to require notification upon arrival to prevent the police from frustrating the statute 's goal of prompt notice. By adopting the present version , the Legislature demonstrated its resolve to end the police practice of detaining and questioning a suspect at length , and possibly securing his confession , before advising him of his right to contact the world outside.

If , however , the questioning involves events that may result in criminal charges against the person being questioned , the almost universal advice of Maryland defense attorneys is to keep the old mouth tightly shut. Suspects all too frequently unwittingly reveal information that can later be used as evidence of their guilt.

The approval of the illegal stipends cost you , the taxpayer , $ 50 , 745.31 ( $ 42 , 745.31 in stipends and an $ 8 , 000 grievance settlement ) and most likely will cost another $ 42 , 745.31 ( another pending grievance ) totaling $ 93 , 490.62 . </question.v.972><question.v.973>The Classic Socratic Method uses creative questioning to dismantle and discard preexisting ideas and thereby allows the respondent to rethink the primary question under discussion ( such as 'What is virtue ? ' ) . This deconstructive style of the Socratic Method is Socratic precisely to the extent that the weight of the actual deconstruction of a definition rests in the respondents own answers to more questions , which refute the respondent 's previously stated answer to the primary question. The result of the Classic Socratic Method is , by definition , a failure to find a satisfactory answer to the primary question in a conversation. This failure produces a realization of ignorance in the respondent ( Socratic Effect ) which can , it is hoped , inspire the respondent to dig deep and think about the question with a new freedom that is obtained from discarding a previously held belief. If a satisfactory answer is found , this represents a transition to the Modern Socratic Method. </question.v.973><question.v.974>Captain Moran listened patiently and said the police department was not in the business of breaking up marriages.

I personally think a lot of teens could use a good rousting from an LEO every once in awhile. What I 'm arguing about is the principle of detaining youths in a station ( not free to go , as above ) and questioning them before their parents are even contaced.

Ten days after the rape took place , the victim picked Miranda out of a lineup and identified him as her attacker. The police took Miranda into an interrogation room and questioned him for two hours. Eventually , Miranda broke down and confessed in writing to committing the rape. The police did not physically abuse Miranda or trick him into confessing. At trial , the prosecution offered Miranda ' s confession into evidence , and he was convicted. On appeal , the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction and granted Miranda a new trial. The Supreme Court decided that the confession should not have been admitted into evidence at Miranda ' s trial because the police had not advised Miranda of his right to remain silent and to consult with counsel. Miranda was convicted again after a second trial , even though the prosecution was not able to offer Miranda ' s confession into evidence . </question.v.995><question.v.996>But it ' s not that simple.

Use transitions and signposts to alert the jurors when you are moving from one unit of direct examination to another or simply to signal the subject of your upcoming questioning. A transition occurs when your questioning moves from one subject to the next . It 's easier for the jurors to follow the direct examination if you periodically let them know where you are going with it. Use transitional phrases to herald a change from one topic to another , e.g. , " Let 's move from ( indicate the unit/subject you are leaving ) to ( indicate the unit/subject you are entering ) .

The rest of the board often relies on the audit committee to notice and question any unusual business practices , aggressive accounting methods or violations of the company 's code of business conduct. But at many companies audit committee members may not have the expertise in matters of internal control that CPAs do , and some people serving on audit committees have very little accounting or financial background at all. Accordingly , audit committee members need a reference guide to their responsibilities. That is the function of an audit committee charter . </question.v.1046><question.v.1047>A.

It relates to the frequency of oral questions to the First Minister and deputy First Minister. It is , of course , regrettable that the Executives proposal was made public before we had an opportunity to discuss the matter in detail. It would seem that there is willingness on the part of some people to generate controversy and to question the commitment of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to the principle and exercise of accountability to the Assembly. Let us be very clear this afternoon : the Executives proposal , as with all other proposals , was put forward by the Executive collectively and is intended to promote an open discussion with the Committee , informed by our respective experiences , and with the common aim of ensuring that Question Time is a meaningful and valuable experience for Ministers and Members alike . </question.v.1050><question.v.1051>Ryan challenged the charge against Buckingham because of the way police questioned him.

Several submissions argued that an innocent suspect would deny police accusations and offer an explanation for the circumstances or conduct which created the suspicion.

When someone finally asked the obvious question -- what about while he was abroad ? -- Clinton confessed that he had smoked marijuana as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford in the late '60s but felt compelled to add that not only had he not liked it , he had not even inhaled -- an assertion that many others who had smoked marijuana , then and later , found hilariously unbelievable.

One of the most important things to recognize in direct-examination is the difference between open-ended and closed-ended questions. Open-ended questions encourage your witnesses to testify in their own words. If they are credible folks , this technique will make them seem more believable than if you questioned them with leading ( close-ended ) questions. Sometimes you need to use a closed-ended question , as when the witness has forgotten to talk about a very specific and important matter or when you are skirting around sensitive matters and trying to avoid opening the door to certain subjects. In short , you should know the difference between open-ended and close-ended questions , know how to use open questions where appropriate in direct , and always try to use open questions to balance any necessary closed questions . </question.v.1073><question.v.1074>Sen.

The claim that " the Bible is never to be questioned " is made by those who do not know it in detail , or who want to quote it out of context to support their viewpoint , or who want to relieve themselves of the responsibility for thinking and for wrestling with difficult issues by passing the burden to others who will tell them " this is what the Bible teaches " . </question.v.1079><question.v.1080>Proctor presents his case and a deposition by Mary Warren saying that she never saw the devil or any spirits.

Elizabeth is brought in to be questioned about whether this is true. Elizabeth tells the court that John Proctor never had an affair with Abigail in order to save his name , however , this destroys Proctors testimony. Mary crumbles under the peer pressure and returns to Abigails side , accusing Proctor of being a witch. The girls pretend to be bewitched by Proctor.

It 's important to question the questions. It keeps the question alive , as it refines the question. Question the questions , and then reverse the process - question the questioning of questions.

If you spin your wheels long enough you 'll blow a bearing or snap a spring , and the question is re-invented , re-asked , and re-known , but in a way not previously understood.

The relationship between this offence and the right to silence is not clear. There is authority that the right to silence when questioned by police prevailed over the common law offence of misprision of felony42 which s 316 replaced.43 In December 1999 , the Commission published a review of s 316 which recommended that s 316 ( 1 ) be repealed.44 </question.v.1143><question.v.1144>On Sunday , a Limerick Township police officer questioned Supervisor Kara Shuler about a political law sign in her garage on King Way.

He was repeatedly questioned , repeatedly shown pictures of Clay Shaw , and then given " truth serum " and put under hypnosis at least twice. Russo was , according to Dave Reitzes , the " Way Too Willing Witness , " who proved extremely pliable in the hands of Garrison and his staff . </question.v.1149><question.v.1150>In a number of languages , the position of question particles is variable. In such languages , the position of the question particle often depends on what is the focus of the question. In most if not all such languages , however , there is one position which is associated with a more neutral question , where the truth of the entire sentence is being questioned without one constituent being the focus of the question. In such cases the language is coded for this map on the basis of the position of the question particle in such neutral questions. In Imbabura Quechua ( Ecuador ) , for example , there is an interrogative clitic that is attached after the constituent which is the focus of the question , as in ( 11a ) , where the focus of the question is wasi-man ' to the house '; if the sentence is a neutral question , with no specific constituent as the focus , the interrogative clitic occurs on the verb , as in ( 11b ) . </question.v.1150><question.v.1151>Despite what I 've just said here , I do see this questioning as part of the personal spiritual journey.

Half the students were questioned immediately after being exposed to the stimulus material , and the other half engaged in a filler activity ( reading a Reader 's Digest story ) for 20 min prior to questioning. The students were asked to estimate the speed at which each of the cars was travelling at impact on a 5-point scale ( from very fast to very slow ) and to provide an estimate in miles per hour. The phrasing of the questions varied with the experimental condition; half were questioned using a marked adverb ( slow ) and half with an unmarked adverb ( fast ) .

It is widest at the top and bottom , and narrowest at the waist. One begins at the top , with the universal question under consideration ( e.g. " What is integrity " ) . Each member of the group is then asked to summarize an example from his or her own experience , which purports to embody or otherwise to illustrate the universal in question. The group may freely question each person 's example , to further its understanding of that particular experience. Examples should be first-person accounts , closed in time , not too emotional , and as simple as possible. Even the simplest examples can lead to considerable complexity under dialogical analysis . </question.v.1188><question.v.1189>ViMad wrote 7 months ago : A rainy evening , sitting in bed and sharing God ' s Word .we questioned ourselves why many Christians more </question.v.1189><question.v.1190>After opening statements , the parties call witnesses and present their evidence. Usually the plaintiff , or prosecutor in a criminal case , begins. When the plaintiff or prosecutor has finished they rest their case and the defense begins its case. Witnesses are called to the stand and are asked questions to prove the facts in support of each point of view. Questions asked by the party calling the witness is called direct examination. The process of questioning by the opposing party is called cross-examination. The judge may permit the plaintiff , or prosecution , to present additional evidence after the defense presents its case , in rebuttal , which is an attempt to disprove information presented by the defendant . </question.v.1190><question.v.1191>Frequently there are many strong points in the plaintiff 's case that can not be denied by the opposing side. When preparing for cross-examination of each adverse witness , include each line of questioning that clearly bolsters the plaintiff 's case and that can not be denied by the defendant 's witnesses. For example , if the plaintiff is catastrophically injured , such as a paraplegic , the witnesses for the defendant ( the defendant doctor in a medical negligence case ) can not deny the nature , extent , and permanence of the injury; the plaintiff 's physical pain and suffering , mental anguish , physical disability , loss of consortium , loss of society and companionship; or the extensive future lifetime disability the plaintiff will suffer . </question.v.1191><question.v.1192>Legal ?

The Commission ' s analysis of the case against modifying the right to silence when questioned by police therefore begins with a critical examination of this system. The Commission ' s view is that the system operating in these jurisdictions is open to criticism on several grounds. As discussed at paragraphs 2.74 to 2.80 above , this system is likely to reduce the efficiency of the criminal justice system. Moreover , the English experience suggests that provisions such as those which operate in England and Wales are likely to result in very strong unfavourable but unjustified inferences being drawn from a defendant ' s silence . </question.v.1198><question.v.1199>You will find that Florida asks a lot in the application.

However , the English legislation does not create a positive duty on police to disclose the whole case against the suspect prior to interview.145 Some police officers reasonably consider that full disclosure might give a suspect an opportunity to tailor answers and perhaps interfere with witnesses. As investigations are often not complete at the time of arrest , satisfactory judgments about what to disclose are very difficult to make. Even where suspects do answer questions , there is widespread scepticism amongst police about the utility of what they say for the purpose of the police investigation , unless a confession is obtained. Often the answers are unverifiable.

At 10 a.m. , the team was on the spot alongside the police; it filmed from a peak overlooking the village and then through the streets in the wake of an armored vehicle. The OSCE was also warned of the action. At least two teams of international observers watched the fighting from a hill where they could see part of the village. They entered Racak shortly after the police left. They then questioned a few Albanians about the situation , trying to find out whether there were wounded civilians. Around 6 p.m. , they took four personstwo women and two old menwho were very slightly wounded toward the dispensary of the neighboring town of Stimje.

I especially question that which often goes without question and I question the questions regarding that which is often questioned.

It is possible an officer could find him/herself in a situation where even a reasonable person would accept some form of justifiable physical response on the part of an officer ( i.e. , slap in the face resulting from tremendous provocation; a slight shove , or even a foolish or intemperate utterance ) . Any and all of these situations would result in departmental charges of unnecessary force or conduct unbecoming an officer. Over the years I have questioned why society has moved psychologically light years in advancing the notion that people under stress have a need or a right to vent. This type of stress and release apparently is confined to everyone except law enforcement personnel. Police officers , when faced with conflict accompanied by danger and similarly vent are often charged with brutality. The net result is that the public is conditioned to expect and anticipate a pattern of response behavior that is n't found within other professions including those requiring a Ph.D . </question.v.1302><question.v.1303>3.

Lane honed in on the issue of privacy with respect to the files of faculty members during investigations as required by University Policy and by the rules assigned to the investigation committee. In the investigation committee ' s set of rules that Lane read to the court , the privacy of all information gathered as a part of the investigation is emphasized -- it requires all members of the committee to agree to them. After she is asked what that statement means , Wesson claims that this is a self explanatory statement. Then she was shown a statement of her deposition in which she said that all information is ambiguous. Pounding away at this discrepancy , Lane tries to rationalize with Wesson as to how all information means anything other than all information. Wesson eventually states that there is certain insignificant information that can be released , but that interviews of witnesses and similar evidence can not be released , and there is some gray area between the two . </question.v.1337><question.v.1338>This is a joke.

In ruling that Parliamentary Secretaries possessed the right to ask oral questions , Speaker Lamoureux nonetheless questioned the propriety of this procedure given that Parliamentary Secretaries might be placed in the position of both answering and asking questions , to the extent where we might have a Parliamentary Secretary asking a question of another Parliamentary Secretary ( Debates , March 6 , 1973 , pp. 1932-3 ) .

" Is this what Christians do when they question teachings from ( most of the time self-proclained ) " God 's Anointed " evangelists and preachers.

The ecclesiastical courts in thirteenth-century England adopted the method of adjudication by requiring witnesses and defendants to take an inquisitorial oath administered by the judge , who then questioned the witnesses. In an inquisitorial oath , the witness swore to truthfully answer all questions asked of him or her. The system flourished in England into the sixteenth century , when it became infamous for its use in the Court of the STAR CHAMBER , a court reserved for complex , contested cases. Under the reign of King Henry VIII , the power of the Star Chamber was expanded , and the court used torture to compel the taking of the inquisitorial oath. The Star Chamber was eventually eliminated as repugnant to basic liberty , and England gradually moved toward an adversarial system . </question.v.1356><question.v.1357>The questioning between Coughlin and Morrison was somewhat tense , though each remained calm and never raised his voice.

Mr. Shanley stated he would check with engineering to be sure that section is going to be done . </question.v.1360><question.v.1361>A primary reason for considering the second question to be the more important is the fact that it does not really matter if an individual " believes " in God or not. The question has a definitive answer , and that answer is unaffected by any personal opinion on the matter. If God does exist , He does so if people believe in Him , and He does so if people do not. If God does not exist , no amount of faith or wishful thinking will make Him come to be. The correct answer to this first question is independent of any answer an individual may give , but , in contrast , the question of government has no such set answer. The way that the majority answers that question at any given time is the way it is answered , and that is an important difference . </question.v.1361><question.v.1362>A front page story in the USA Today details I.C.E.

At one raid , the CFO of a company that employs 700 people was illegally detained as a potential alien simply because of his Indian accent. A pregnant receptionist was accosted by officials and separated from her children , who were visiting the factory , while white employees were neither questioned nor suspected. An anti-immigration activist quoted in the article simply responded " too bad.

If , however , the term is meant to refer to a practice of rendering a person to a place where he or she will be tortured , I can not be more emphatic : we do not engage in that practice.

This bringing to birth of new ideas is the constructive second phase of the two-phase freestyle of the Classic Socratic Method. Here the respondent , stripped of previous ideas and convictions , brings to birth new ones. It is this bringing to birth of new ideas and understandings that Socrates related to his mothers profession as a midwife. Socrates assists in this birth by clearing away ideas that can not stand up to questioning. This allows the respondent to do their own work in the second phase through her creation of new ideas . </question.v.1366><question.v.1367>So I ' m wondering why they ' re calling her ideas dangerous , irresponsible why some call her a heretic.

Assembly processes allow questions to be tabled on behalf of MLAs by their staff. The Executive does not wish to question the integrity of the questions asked , but believes that controls should be introduced to ensure that questions tabled on behalf of an MLA have been approved by the MLA and have not been tabled without his/her knowledge. This could help to ensure that questions are directly relevant to the Members needs; assist officials on those occasions where clarification needs to be sought from an MLA in respect of any question; and would also provide a level of quality assurance for questions being tabled.

The police often encourage a suspect to unburden himself by holding out the possibility that by cooperating , the suspect can untangle himself from the potential criminal charges. This is a common technique used by the police. The police have no intention of helping suspects. Often times , the police lacking evidence with which to secure a conviction , can only obtain a conviction by compelling a suspect to incriminate himself. Many individuals , desperate to improve their situation , talk to the police , thereby drastically reducing their chances of an acquittal at trial.

Good lines of questioning , particularly in the context of a Congressional hearing , are ones that are capable of boxing the witness into a corner and forcing him to make an important concession no matter which way he chooses to answer the question. To do that , you have to anticipate the witness 's possible answers and be prepared to proceed in different directions depending on how the witness responds. Too often Senators get flustered and lose their train of thought when the witness does n't answer their initial , deeply penetrating question in quite the way they had expected , and they end up just moving on to the next question . </question.v.1384><question.v.1385>She was now the suspect.

There is the social pressure to ' fit in ' , which is immensely strong in most cultures. Questioning the status quo carries the danger of ostracism , possibly persecution. This aspect has a strong link with politics. People doing well under the current system are not inclined to look favourably on those who question the system.

That problem has to do with the focus on speaker assumption as a basis for neutrality. It is impossible to know what presumptions the speaker holds when asking a question unless the speaker explicitly expresses those presumptions. Such explicit expression , while not unseen , is the exception rather than the rule. Therefore , barring a psycholinguistic probe ( or at the least , a lie detector test ) into the speaker 's mind , how can one objectively prove a lack of presumptions concerning the proposition being questioned ? That is to say , how can one empirically ascertain the presence of what would be called a " neutral context ? " If the presence of presumptions can not be absolutely ascertained , how can the quality of such an assumption ( either positive or negative ) be determined ? Such issues make the presupposition-based definition of neutrality subject to reconsideration . </question.v.1411><question.v.1412>To us , more important than anything presented on this subject , is this evidence of the existence of a very early dispute among the first disciples of Jesus on the question of whether he was real or merely an apparition.

Dr. Trevathan brought up potential problems with study design and selection bias when putting together such a study and questioned whether the sample size from the National Children 's Study would be adequate for prospective observational research.

This matter arose in question time in the House , and that is a time when a Minister is being questioned by the Opposition and is asked to be accountable for the way in which he or she is conducting his or her role as a member of the executive. It would seem that if a Minister can give answers in the House that are quite clearly wrong , and then at a later time , under the cover of a dinner break , make a personal explanation , and have that as the end of the matter , that is not appropriate. We think it should be subject to a ministerial statement. That is our first point.

Most judges who participated in the Commission ' s survey expressed the view that the defendant ' s silence when questioned by police did not generally affect trial outcomes. Most defence lawyers surveyed who conducted jury trials thought that silence sometimes contributed to acquittals and sometimes to convictions. On the other hand , most prosecutors who conducted jury trials thought that silence at the police station did generally contribute to the acquittal of defendants.119 </question.v.1424><question.v.1425>The Town of Ossining Police Department strives to provide service to everyone in the community fairly.

Many investigators begin with a series of staccato questions designed to elicit biographical responses which will be used for grouping respondents in analytical studies. This practice may lead respondents who are interested in the study and ready to begin the task of answering ( the result of a skillful introductory letter ) to question whether the information being sought is relevant to the purposes described. Worse , they may be sensitized to the very group differences you hope to identify , and alter their responses accordingly. It is probably a better idea to leave such items for the end of the questionnaire ( after obtaining the responses ) where they can serve a kind of " cooling down " function from the experience of responding . </question.v.1431><question.v.1432>The Confidential Committee will make a general report , which wo n't name you or any specific person or institution.

Getting involved in programs like Family Pathways or Habitat for Humanity can help us contribute to our world as we wrestle with these questions. Another type of doubt that most people have is self-doubt. Many people constantly question whether they are good enough. People wonder about a variety of things like whether they are a good parent or if they have enough abilities to be good at their job. These are natural questions for people to ask. My advice would be to compliment people when you see them doing something well.

A stop involves brief questioning in the place where you were detained. If the officer wishes to hold you for a longer period of time , or decides to take you elsewhere , such as to the police station , he or she is no longer just stopping you , but is arresting you. Because an arrest deprives you of your freedom of movement for an even longer period of time than a stop , the law limits the instances when arrests can be made . </question.v.1436><question.v.1437>Mr. BALLEN.

The President of the Senate then propounded to him various questions concerning his past activities dating as far back as when witness was seven years of age and ending as recently as the post liberation period , all of which questions the witness answered satisfactorily.

If you are questioned as a suspect , the law enforcement officer is seeking information and/or leads with which he can find sufficient evidence to convict you. Often , in this search for evidence , rules are bent and statements are taken out of context in order to enhance the probability of a conviction.. Law enforcement officers are , among other things , professional witnesses. This places anyone questioned at a great disadvantage since any discrepancies between an officer 's testimony and an ordinary citizen will largely be construed to favor the officer . </question.v.1440><question.v.1441>3.

The person being questioned sits at the open end of the U , facing about a dozen members. Behind the person are benches for the public. To the side is seating for the press.

This means that ministers , as long as they remain broadly relevant to the question are free to answer as they see fit.

People , who question the existence of God , are considered by many as being morally corrupt and even treated like criminals in many parts of the world. Religious persons have the experience of questioning the morality of something from a religion based perspective and have felt the pressure from the non-religious to stop. The institutional self-interests of school and the workplace pressure people to conform. Parents can make their children feel as if they have done something wrong if the parent is overreacting to thinking the child is asking too many questions or to the child questioning something the parent does not wish to address. Far from being taught to cherish every opportunity to question and far from being led to embrace the experience of questioning with joyful insight into its inherent good , many of us are taught to be very careful and even suspicious about our own desire to question.

Once fixed , a belief will use itself to interpret the evidence , color her judgment , and structure ( or filter ) the rest of her experience , even if the belief is false or incomplete.

Thus many philosophers have become concerned with understanding the sense of " know " which leads people to question whether we can know anything. This concern is an essential part of what is commonly called " Theory of Knowledge " or " Epistemology. " Questioning whether there are any universal moral standards is usually done by people who have no doubt that , except in very unusual circumstances , it is morally wrong to cheat. Thus , here too , philosophers have come to realize that a philosophical question can not be taken in a simple straightforward fashion. Thus they have begun to investigate what is meant by " universal moral standard " and related phrases. This investigation is part of what is called " Ethical Theory " or " Moral Philosophy.

If a Doctor claims that someone is Psychotic , and you accept this , this simply means that you were incapable of reaching the level of maturity required to question the word of others , and have chosen to bow to their words instead. To take the power of an adult mind , and to still make decisions based solely on beliefs or floating ideas that have no attachment to a foundation of truth , is highly dangerous. And so , if those in the Governing position that I speak of , also keep the lessers still Believing and not questioning , then lessers will be kept from reaching proper maturity , they will be permanently detached from a foundation of truth , and they will basically be puppets.

And that is a doctrine which is very difficult to uphold when things start to go very wrong , especially when they go wrong for a lot of people at the same time , when some disaster strikes. And Job is well seated and then suddenly , because God makes a bet with the devil about his honor , he 's suddenly beset with the absolute worse things you can imagine. People he would n't have hired to clean out the stables before , their children spit on him. His own children are killed. He 's covered in sores all over his body. He 's really at the very bottom. And he still does n't really question God until his friends come and try to console him with notions of how this must be according to some justice , because God is just.

This has the effect of flying under the defensive radar , particularly on controversial issues , and provides a measure of comfort that can move the conversation to a more productive level.

Suspects all too frequently unwittingly reveal information that can later be used as evidence of their guilt. The right to not incriminate oneself guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is especially powerful in this situation.

Why ? Because the more we questioned , the more evidence there was that the Harper government has been covering up the truth , and the more the government blocked access to information. What were they hiding ? To get at the truth , a majority of the House of Commons passed a motion demanding the production of documents , which the government kept denying access to , relating to the alleged torture of Afghan detainees ( a very serious issue , a breach of international law ) .

Anyway , it is totally outdated and simply not true. Uranus , Neptune and Pluto play the larger role in astrology today. They do refer to states beyond ego though. Uranus is the archetype in astrology for learning to think for yourself and questioning everything that others tell you , not necessarily to rebel , but to go for truth. ( Such a process can only occur by turning within , which is the function of Saturn , the planet just before Uranus in the solar system ) . If the process , called individuation , succeeds , you might eventually find yourself pretty alienated from your surroundings. Neptune is the planet of compassion. It is the next stage on the transcendental path and compassion ( and thus the realization of unity between all beings ) will solve the problem of alienation. Neptune also is a " higher octave " of Venus. Venus is about love. If compassion and individualization are there , your love will be giving , not expecting any favours in return anymore , it will no longer be greedy and for the self only , it will be unconditional . </question.v.1771><question.v.1772>But some family members and friends maintain that Marty could not possibly have been responsible.

When a need arises to question the ability of an employee to do the essential functions of his/her job or to question whether the employee can do the job without posing a direct threat due to a medical condition , it may be job-related and consistent with business necessity for an employer to make disability-related inquiries or require a medical examination . </question.v.1825><question.v.1826>always wondering about life , family , love , the questioning nature of humans is one that is not always easy to live with.

And the only way I would think she would be taken to detox without the breathalyzer test done was if she was deemed drunk by the Field Sobriety Test , or if she was being belligerent . </question.v.1830><question.v.1831>The newspaper and McCormick were n't questioning the credibility of the police - who the jury found guilty - it was Rachael , the victim of a violent sexual assault , who was hoisted up for examination. Lieutenant Neil O'Leary testified that anyone listening to the tape of Rachael 's 911 call would know she was credible. " All you have to do is listen to the 911 tape and I do n't think you could have any doubts after that , unless she 's some kind of miraculous actress that we do n't know about. " But the tone of the Republican-American coverage never let the reader consider Rachael a viable - or credible - human being. Rachael was always cast under a cloud of suspicion. McCormick wrote in the paper that the case revolved around the question of whether Rachael was ever raped. McCormick missed the point. The case revolved around police misconduct and the readers of the Republican-American were not provided a balanced account of that information . </question.v.1831><question.v.1832> After 11 and a half months on the bench and only at election time has Judge Meares found it to his benefit to question the adoption of our local rules.

You do not legally have to answer any other questions. A police officer must tell you about this before questioning you further , if the officer thinks you ' ve done anything wrong. Anything that you tell a police officer will be written down and could be used as evidence in any offences that you may be charged with. It is important to be aware of this. When questioning people , the police may use the phrase helping us with our enquiries which often really means I think you have done something wrong and I want to talk to you about it. </question.v.1833><question.v.1834>I would look into it further.

For you , this is an Assistant U.S. Attorney. The questions asked are for the purpose of " direct examination. " When you are questioned by the opposing attorney , it is called " cross examination. " This process is sometimes repeated several times in order to clearly address all aspects of the questions and answers. The basic purpose of direct examination is for you to tell the judge and jury what you know about the case. The basic purpose of cross examination is to raise doubts about the accuracy of your testimony. Do n't get mad if you feel you are being doubted during the cross examination. The defense counsel is just doing their job . </question.v.1837><question.v.1838>There will be no revolution in Russia , nor even any radical improvement of existing conditions , so long as the Greek Church has the education of the masses in charge. To become politically free , men must first be intellectually emancipated. If a Russian is not permitted to choose his own religion , will he be permitted to choose his own form of government ? If he will allow a priest to impose his religion upon him , why may he not permit the Czar to impose despotism upon him ? If it is wrong for him to question the tenets of his religion , is it not equally wrong for him to discuss the laws of his government ? If a slave of the church , why may he not be a slave of the state ? If there is room upon his neck for the yoke of the church , there will be room , also , for the yoke of the autocracy. If he is in the habit of bending his knees , what difference does it make to how many or to whom he bends them ? </question.v.1838><question.v.1839>It is important to conduct the interview in a quiet setting with minimal disruptions. It is also important to keep in mind that a child rarely feels free to disclose sensitive information when a parent or relative is present. However , if the child is extremely distressed or unwilling to be questioned alone , a nonoffending parent or other supportive adult may sit quietly in during the interview. Although multiple interviews may be necessary , the original interviewer should either conduct them or be present to introduce the child to the new interviewer. This preserves the rapport between the interviewer and the child and protects the child from unnecessary anxiety. However , it is extremely important to minimize the number of interviews and professionals the child experiences. The greater the number of interviews , the more trauma the child suffers. Whenever possible , the same individual , either the interviewer or a volunteer , should accompany the child to all appointments and proceedings relative to the case. The child is thus provided with a familiar and supportive person throughout the legal process . </question.v.1839><question.v.1840>If the preparatory provider posts a pass rate for its products , how is that pass rate calculated ? Prep Provider Guidelines Program participants agree not to publish their pass rates. Pass rates published by nonparticipating providers should be questioned : Do they survey each of the candidates that purchased their study materials ? Do they conduct a sample survey ? Do they only count as fails those candidates who ask for refunds and assume that all others passed ? </question.v.1840><question.v.1841>Some Members favour open questions to departmental ministers. This is apparent from some of the comments made in evidence to the Committee. There are dangers if open questions are employed in Question Time , since they introduce the tendency , so evident in Prime Minister 's Question Time , for disparate , point-scoring and supportive questioning. These tendencies are exacerbated by the presence of the television cameras. However , one possibility would be to explore the possibility of some form of " open " questioning in sessions in Westminster Hall. These might take the form of 30-minute sessions on one particular departmental responsibility : the Minister for Higher Education , for example , answering questions on her portfolio , the Minister for Sport answering questions on his. Holding such sessions in Westminster Hall , where proceedings receive little or no media coverage , may serve to deflate the tendency to partisanship to be found in the chamber. There is little point in playing to the cameras if no one is watching . </question.v.1841><question.v.1842>The rules of evidence have been developed over many years to control all courtroom proceedings. The rules ensure that credible evidence is presented and unnecessary or unreliable evidence is kept out of the courtroom. For example , the " hearsay rule " prevents a witness from relating second-hand information. Second-hand or " hearsay " evidence is not accepted because it is not thought to be reliable and because it would be unfair if an opposing attorney could not directly question the person alleged to have made the statement . </question.v.1842><question.v.1843>Reader : I found in this new friend a woman emancipated from all faith in man-made creeds. Nothing was too sacred for her to question. It seemed to me like meeting a being from some larger planet , to find a woman who dared to question the opinions of popes , kings , synods , parliaments recognizing no higher authority than the judgment of a pure-minded , educated woman. When I first heard from the lips of Lucretia Mott that I had the same right to think for myself that Luther , Calvin , and John Knox had , and the same right to be guided by my own convictions and would no doubt live a higher , happier life than if guided by theirs , I felt at once a newborn sense of dignity and freedom; it was like suddenly coming into the rays of the noonday sun after wandering with a rushlight in the caves of the earth . </question.v.1843><question.v.1844>The applicant ' s agent Mr. James Obenour addressed the Board. The Board questioned the agent and after further discussion Mr. Reese moved to approve the application with the three recommendations set forth by staff adding a fourth condition that in the event this tile begins to run or experience color problems the applicant will replace it within six months from notification from building official. Mr. Ulmer seconded the motion and the vote was in favor of the motion 3-2. Mr. Sastre and Mr. Fernandez both voted no . </question.v.1844><question.v.1845>The primary advantage is lower cost , in time as well as money. Not having to train interviewers eliminates a lengthy and expensive requirement of interviewing. The questionnaire can be administered simultaneously to large groups whereas an interview requires each individual to be questioned separately. This allows the questions to reach a given number of respondents more efficiently than is possible with the interview. Finally , the cost of postage should be less than that of travel or telephone expenses . </question.v.1845><question.v.1846>that it not be permissible to draw inferences from the silence of the suspect/accused in response to questioning by law enforcement agencies ... however , ... this approach would not prevent the court drawing negative inferences from the failure of the accused to tell the police of an alibi or defence , later advanced at trial.89 2.49 In 1986 the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers published its report on police powers of investigation and detention , which considered the right to silence as part of its examination of the framework of police powers , and recommended against allowing adverse inferences to be drawn at trial where the defendant remains silent.90 </question.v.1846><question.v.1847>As concerns the powers of conservation and the Town passing some type of ordinance , Councilman Tallarita questioned what type of controls and powers does the State have over this.

The English experience does not give them any support. The empirical evidence that few suspects actually remain silent indicates that it is unlikely that modifying the law would significantly increase the number of confessions or the amount of information given to police. The Commission ' s view is that , rather than enhancing efficiency , modifying the right to silence when questioned by police would be likely to reduce the efficiency of police investigations , trials and the criminal justice system in general . </question.v.1852><question.v.1853>Among other things , this doubt about her identity is nourished by her physical appearance.

" The law enforcement agents and police officers who use polygraph machines are not scientists - they are merely told the machine can be used to detect lies , given a few weeks of training , and set on their merry way , with little reason to question what they are told. Unfortunately , negative results on scientifically invalid lie detector tests can brand someone for life and ruin their career.

Bardsley is promising to reach out personally , as mayor , to encourage businesses to locate in Northampton. It 's a good idea , but not one that comes with any guarantees , given our financial climate. We question whether , given his dismay over the downtown hotel project , Bardsley fully understands the compromises that must be made to woo new business to the city. Higgins created a stabilization fund that will help buffer Northampton to some degree from local aid cuts.

For him , this sort of move necessarily diminished humanity and human life , and thus he found this apotheoisis of truth to be unbearable. He also seems to have become annoyed at the circularity of the entire project after all , by placing truth at the apex of all that was good and making it the standard against which all must be measured , this quite naturally ensured that the value of truth itself would always be assured and never be questioned . </question.v.1857><question.v.1858>If you encounter the police while you are away from your home and the police attempt to question you , ask the officer if you are free to leave.

They examined the 1978 , 1980 , and 1982 American National Election Studies , which are national sample surveys of Americans that political scientists have used extensively to study the effects of incumbency on citizens ' vote choices in U.S. House elections. Political scientists have found that incumbency is a very strong factor in voting , but Eubank and Gow argue that this finding is somewhat artificial because of the placement of questions in the American National Election Studies. They pointed out that before respondents were questioned about their vote for Congress , they were asked a series of questions about their incumbent U.S. representative. This sequence of questions made it more likely that respondents would claim to have voted for the incumbent when in fact they had not , a tendency especially pronounced among less knowledgeable citizens , who are generally more susceptible to the effects of question order </question.v.1859><question.v.1860>Note We are proud to inform you that a prior version of this article was cited in a decision of the Supreme Court of New York , Appellate Division.

As Mr Dunne has told the House this afternoon , New Zealand Post was under sustained questioning over many meetings. It had gone through a process that it felt aggrieved about and uncomfortable with. There was substantial media interest in the matters that were before the select committee and that were bedevilling New Zealand Post. It had been asked to give a series of explanations. New Zealand Post knew that Mr Hide and I were in receipt of material from persons within that organisation who believed that we were entitled to facts that were not being given to the committee or to the public.

O ' Rourke was responding to Lane ' s questioning of Professor Wesson yesterday , where he implied that she joined the committee with biases against Churchill. Professor Wesson explained she did not join the committee with an agenda or any bias against Churchill or Critical Race Theory. In fact , she asserted that the committee worked to find evidence to exonerate Churchill. For example , when the committee came across a questionable statement in Churchill ' s work , if no footnote was cited the committee would look for evidence supporting his claim and if a footnote was cited but it did not support the claim the committee would look for other sources supporting his claim. O ' Rourke also questioned Professor Wesson about any pressure brought to bear on her to get Churchill out of CU. She said people made certain efforts but nothing that constituted inordinate pressure . </question.v.1869><question.v.1870>In my opinion , one of the most important aspects of critical thinking is asking questions which is due , in part , to my preference for questions rather than answers written in stone. This is the paramount reason for my enthusiastic support for the 9/11 truth movement. As long as a community of thinkers , and indeed , the citizenry at large , continue to question the events of September 11 , there is at least a spark of hope that at some point , with the proper conditions and at the right time , that spark might be fanned into a flame of revolution.

However , do n't bring any documents to the deposition unless you have discussed them with your attorney and he has specifically instructed you to bring them. If the opposing attorney wants to ask you questions about documents that were produced during discovery , it is his job to bring those documents to the deposition.

This young prelate with a significant , promised future , this cleric " very solemn and excellent , " enjoyed the full confidence of Pierre Cauchon , who later put him in charge of translating the minutes of the Trial into Latin. Questioned in 1456 at the Rehabilitation proceedings , this remarkable doctor , whose eloquence was boasted about by his contemporaries and remarked on his tombstone , lost his memory ! Thomas de Courcelles was doubtless embarrassed by the Trial , and afterwards , during the definitive editing of that document , he suppressed his name wherever it had figured in the French minutes. He tried to give the impression that he had taken little part in the Trial , which was false. But he was considerably less of a fanatic than Pierre Cauchon and Guillaume Erart . </question.v.1914><question.v.1915>Gifts can put you in the ceiling; character can put you in the basement. Character , or the lack of it , is the greatest significant challenge to position and gift. The truth is , he would never have his person questioned as much as if he did not excel in his gift.

Routine traffic violations are infractions , not crimes. A motorist ' s statement to a police officer relating to events leading up to a ticket is therefore admissible even if the officer did not give the motorist the Miranda warning. However , a Miranda warning would be required if an officer detains a motorist in order to question the motorist about crimes unrelated to the traffic stop . </question.v.1918><question.v.1919>Similarly , a member of the British Parliament questioned the lack of reported complications associated with assisted suicide in Oregon.

Attorneys are routinely surprised by how many people actually fail to do this when they are being charged or questioned about a crime - sometimes even after being advised not to talk to the police by an attorney. Please keep in mind that if the police have enough evidence to charge you with a crime , they are going to do that regardless of what you say. If they do not have enough evidence to charge you , speaking to them may provide them with the missing pieces of evidence they need. The point is that speaking ca n't help you , but can do a lot of harm to your defense case . </question.v.1926><question.v.1927>The Bush campaign became part of the general SBVT controversy when McCain condemned the first SBVT ad , and said , " I hope that the president will also condemn it.

" [ 91 ] Kerry was dismissive of this statement , saying , " Of course , the President keeps telling people he would never question my service to our country. Instead , he watches as a Republican-funded attack group does just that. " [ 92 ] Kerry also alleged that SBVT was " a front for the Bush campaign. And the fact that the President won ' t denounce what they ' re up to tells you everything you need to know he wants them to do his dirty work " .

Most people do not know what this means as interpreted by recent court rulings and the Federal Government 's " Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. " Discrimination exists when the acceptance ( hiring ) rate for members of a protected group ( women and minorities ) is significantly lower than the acceptance rate for members of non-protected groups , and the selection procedure is not job-related. The government has outlined specific methods for proving the " job-relatedness " of selection procedures. The fact that you did not intend to discriminate is no defense against a charge of discrimination. Most discrimination is unintentional. The following section , Types of Questions , provides information on the appropriate methods and topics of questioning . </question.v.1930><question.v.1931>Particularly in view of the initial use of handcuffs , we find that a reasonable person in the defendants circumstances would not have believed himself to be free to leave but would instead have considered his freedom of movement to have been restrained to the degree associated with a formal arrest.

Whether there is a separate earnings event should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Some have questioned whether revenue may be recognized in these transactions to the extent of the incremental direct costs incurred in the activation. Because there is no separable deliverable or earnings event , the staff would generally object to that approach , except where it is provided for in the authoritative literature ( e.g. , Statement 51 ) . </question.v.1932><question.v.1933>They love their freedom.

They like to complain and criticize all the problems they see in Kuwaiti society and government but do not have the motivation to move the masses to mobilize change. Many are family oriented despite being disengaged from the family and fully immersed in social lives and work. Many Kuwaiti men are like lions , they will take good care of a woman in return for a good meal and tender loving care. Definitely , a good home cooked meal does assuage the most difficult of tempermaments. I could go on and on but will keep it brief . </question.v.1933><question.v.1934>Loaded questions : contain incriminating assumptions that the questioned persons seem to admit to if they answer the questions instead of challenging them. For example , " Are you still beating your wife ? " A loaded question may be asked to trick the respondent into admitting something that the questioner believes to be true , and which may in fact be true. So the previous question is " loaded , " whether or not the respondent has actually beaten his wife . </question.v.1934><question.v.1935>John originally told police Milgaard was never out of her sight long enough to have committed the crime.

The police are often judged by the misbehavior of a notorious few. Yet , unlike other minority groups , they fail to get a supportive defense from the media , the community and an increasing number of political representatives. The police have a right to question why so many accept police criticism as gospel . </question.v.1936><question.v.1937>2.69 Legal advice. Most English studies have concluded that suspects with access to legal advice are more likely to say nothing during police questioning than those without legal advice.131 There is also a considerable body of research on the nature of legal advice given to suspects at police stations which indicates that suspects are not advised to remain silent as a matter of course , that advice to remain silent is often a temporary strategy , that the quality of legal advice to suspects varies considerably and that silence is not always based on legal advice.132 </question.v.1937><question.v.1938>2.122 These characteristics also affect suspects ' ability to understand or exercise other rights when questioned by police , including the right to a support person , to legal advice and , where required , to an interpreter.

The scissors had been used to stab Krystal 81 times , leaving her dead on the kitchen floor. Police questioned neighbors and learned a white pick-up truck was parked outside the trailer around the time of the murder. Under interrogation , Curtis singled out Stuart Heaton as the truck s owner.

Evangelista said they are working on putting his car into rotation and replacing the chief s car with a seized vehicle from a police auction . </question.v.1940><question.v.1941>A victim should be carefully questioned about her activities surrounding the time of the assault. For example , it is not uncommon for a legitimate rape victim to withhold the fact that she engaged in friendly conversation with the suspect in a bar and consensually kissed him prior to the assault. The reason a victim may not initially acknowledge these facts is a fear that people will not believe that she was raped. Yet , withholding this information from the investigator may decrease the chances of eliciting the truth during an interrogation of the suspect . </question.v.1941><question.v.1942>Todd Schultz stated that at the last Council meeting , the Preliminary Plat for the Garden Villa ' s Plat 2 of Autumn Ridge was approved on the conditions that : 1 ) all necessary drainage and utility easements be granted after final design , and 2 ) the execution of an amended Planned Unit Developer 's Agreement. Staff is recommending approval of the Final Plat with the same conditions as above. Councilperson Patterson questioned why the Resolution noted in the 2nd whereas that the developer has complied with all of the conditions imposed on the Preliminary Plat and then continues to list the conditions proposed; it seems contradictory. Tim Sime advised that the developer has complied with everything to get to this point. The noted whereas could be changed to read has complied or will comply . </question.v.1942><question.v.1943>The Government simply rejected my assertions as " unfounded " in purely general terms and , indeed , on the sole ground that it had had no part in the episode w hich I described.

Above all. the Government of Uruguay does not deny that it ii holding my daughter. In shortapart from the very general assertion referred to above , the Government has not denied , or even questioned the truth of a single one of the serious events described by me in my communication to the Committee.

In 1912 , in order to clarify uncertainty arising from the varying judicial attitudes to the reliability and admissibility of police interrogation evidence , 5 the judges of the Kings Bench issued the Judges ' Rules.6 The Judges ' Rules provided that , when a police officer decided to charge a suspect with an offence and intended to interview the person , the police officer should first caution the person that he or she was entitled to remain silent . </question.v.1947><question.v.1948>When a player is taking a penalty is he allowed to stop during his run up and restart his run before kicking the ball ?

It was argued that if remaining silent carried a risk of having adverse consequences for the suspect at trial , suspects would feel pressured or compelled to co-operate with the police investigation.226 This argument was submitted to the European Court of Human Rights by Amnesty International in Murray v United Kingdom and was accepted by the minority of the Court.

Such aversion may even amount to why-phobia. This might be understood as favouring a questioning process that would amount to what could be described as a cognitive form of the current lifestyle trend of cocooning -- enabling only those questions that sustain what has now been recognized as a " psychological cocoon " ( cf Dynamically Gated Conceptual Communities : emergent patterns of isolation within knowledge society , 2004 ) .

These are : ( 1 ) consciousness and reflection most often come into being in such conditions that they seem to have been called into existence by the very necessity of practice. When balance is disturbed in a living organism , consciousness awakes : it begins to question itself , the subject becomes aware of problems. Consequently , it can be said that the appearance of consciousness is a response to practical ends , for it comes into being to re-establish the disturbed equilibrium. ( 2 ) The same applies to habits of all kinds : consciousness disappears when it no longer serves a purpose. It only awakes when habit is disrupted , when a process on non-adaptation occurs. ( 3 ) This is also true of human society. When a political or social regime is functioning smoothly , it is accepted passively and men do not reflect on it.

In the Committee of Finance , Ministers are questioned closely on the details of their department ' s expenditures. They often have their deputies and top officials standing by to supply the requested information. The detail of the Votes is found in the subvotes , which are called in the sequence presented in the estimate book. Each subvote forms a distinct question , and debate must be strictly relevant to the subvote under consideration. However , like the debate on clause 1 of a Bill , practice allows a wide-ranging debate on the first subvote , which is usually called administration. After conclusion of the general debate , amendments may be moved on a subvote when it is called. An amendment may only reduce an amount; amounts can not be added. Only a Minister may increase a Vote by bringing forward a further estimate in the Assembly. Upon conclusion of the various Votes , the amounts are reported to the Assembly for inclusion in an Appropriation Bill.

The classic understanding or rather , misunderstanding of the relationship between questions and answers in religious life is perhaps best expressed in the old adage , For the believer , no proof is necessary; for the non-believer , no proof will suffice. ... To have unwavering answers , on the other hand , is viewed as the epitome of the religious position. Yet on consideration , it becomes apparent that this understanding of the relationship between questions and answers is a caricature of religious truth , and a distortion of the Jewish sources ... .

However , in some countries , the tribunal of fact is permitted to draw adverse inferences where the defendant remains silent in the face of police questioning , and the judge and the prosecution can comment to the jury on the fact that the defendant remained silent. This chapter examines the right to silence when questioned by police in New South Wales and the position in other jurisdictions. It considers the arguments for and against modifying the prohibition on adverse inferences and judicial and prosecution comment where a defendant does not answer police questions . </question.v.2039><question.v.2040>Specter , one of the few Senate Republicans who supports abortion rights , said he intended to question Miers about her views on the issue during confirmation hearings.

The tlamatinime , as they were called , recognized no difference between " the formal objectives of philosophy , " ( xxiii ) religion , scientific knowledge , or art.

For example , certain cultures discourage discussion of domestic abuse and sexual assault.205 It was submitted that silence may be a normal and positive communication in some cultures , in a way which is not generally understood in New South Wales.206 The Commission accepts that some cultural factors may well affect whether a suspect remains silent when questioned by police . </question.v.2047><question.v.2048>" . . . we have questioned him about the allegations and have sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished.

Simply because you are approached and questioned by the police does not mean you are suspected of having committed a crime. All citizens are encouraged to cooperate with the police to see that those who break the law are brought to justice , and the police rely on law-abiding citizens to do so. But you are not required to incriminate yourself. YOU MAY REFUSE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION IF THE ANSWER WOULD TEND TO INCRIMINATE YOU. You should never lie to a law enforcement officer.

You may accomplish this by eliciting testimony to bolster your case from the list of points with which the witness must agree , as discussed above. Beginning cross-examination of the witness on the last matter covered in direct is generally weak and inefficient. This subject matter is clearest in the witness 's mind , most logically related to the body of the witness 's testimony , and , if mishandled , will merely appear as a continuation of the direct examination rather than as the dramatic change the cross-examiner should seek to achieve. If there is a line of questioning with which you can obtain several agreements from the witness to bolster your case , pursue this line before discrediting or impeaching the witness. It is a quantum leap to ask the jurors to reject the witness 's testimony that is favorable to the defendant because the witness has been discredited and then to ask them to accept the witness 's testimony that bolsters the plaintiff 's case . </question.v.2054><question.v.2055>Yet no doctor at Parkland Hospital who worked on Kennedy initially described the hole in the front of his neck as a wound of exit. Some said it would more resemble a wound of entry. Later , under questioning by Specter who asked them to consider it hypothetically in view of the back wound , most decided it could have been either an entrance or exit wound. However , one doctor Ronald Cox Jones maintained that if it were an exit wound it would have had to be inflicted by a bullet of very low velocity , to the point that you might think that this bullet barely made it though the soft tissues and just enough to drop out of the skin on the opposite side.

If the applicant is questioned about personal matters , such as sexual history and religious affiliation , and the information received becomes a factor in the employment decision , then the department would be in violation of the law. Responses which reveal a criminal record or drug abuse would clearly provide information upon which an applicant may be denied employment , as such facts render an applicant unfit for duty. If the area of inquiry does not concern public safety , truthfulness or the potential criminal activities of an applicant , however , the information received can not form the basis for denying employment. Police departments may use polygraph testing of applicants to determine truthfulness and fitness for duty , not to expose personal information upon which an employment decision will be made . </question.v.2059><question.v.2060>Obama also has been accused of distortions , but McCain is under fire for two headline-grabbing attacks.

Professor Wesson said the committee did not contact these people. Lane then asked how the committee would know that these authors did not do independent research and come to the exact same conclusions as Churchill before agreeing to sign their names to the article. Again , Professor Wesson compared this to a student who said that they agreed with all the words of a purchased essay. Lane asserted in the form of a question that the difference is that the student would be guilty of plagiarism not the actual author. Professor Wesson disagreed with this exact characterization and said Churchill is at the very least guilty as an accomplice to plagiarism. After the lunch recess , however , and perhaps in an attempt to correct the record , Professor Wesson responded that the committee contacted two other co-authors or authors of Churchill articles. She said they refused to talk with the committee , but also did not rush to Churchill ' s defense . </question.v.2061><question.v.2062>If the test-taker receives this " scores are delayed " letter , he/she should call ETS and ask specifically where they are in the review process , and what will happen next.

This rarely works , though. Most of the time the witness is prepared for this tactic and spends the entire time deconstructing the questions instead of answering them. Asking these kind of loaded questions may produce a few good soundbites , but it rarely advances the ball in any significant way. It 's far more productive to ask fair , pointed questions , questions the witness ca n't really object to.

Hatch said people at those times often question how God could allow that to happen. But he said that can lead people back to God through the belief that he will one day come and restore justice . </question.v.2095><question.v.2096>After the attempted bombing , Fluckiger said that Bishop told her she had been questioned by police.

Yesterday during the exchanges that occurred when the Prime Minister was giving her answers , I was one of a number of members who were required to stand , withdraw , and apologise for questioning the veracity of the Prime Minister and her answer. She has since come down to the House and given a corrected answer , which places me in a position of wondering whether there is any way the Hansard record can be changed to expunge the withdrawal and apology that I had to make , because what I was saying was proved to be correct . </question.v.2097><question.v.2098>One of my older students questioned me about an interview question he was asked at a job fair : " Why do you want to work for a small firm ? " At the time he was interviewing with the Big Five accounting firms and smaller firms. He visited about 15-16 booths during the day. He asked me if his response were appropriate. He had stated in answering the question about small firms : " A small firm gives you a range of departments , such as tax , auditing , and so forth. You are able to experience numerous kinds of accounting transactions as opposed to specializing in one branch for a large corporation. " I thought his answer was excellent . </question.v.2098><question.v.2099>Various Committee members used CESR 's fact sheet on Cambodia to question the State Party. Questions included issues related to the right to adequate housing and the rising inequality that accompanies the steady GDP per capita growth . </question.v.2099><question.v.2100>In the inquisitorial system , the presiding judge is not a passive recipient of information. Rather , the presiding judge is primarily responsible for supervising the gathering of the evidence necessary to resolve the case. He or she actively steers the search for evidence and questions the witnesses , including the respondent or defendant. Attorneys play a more passive role , suggesting routes of inquiry for the presiding judge and following the judge 's questioning with questioning of their own. Attorney questioning is often brief because the judge tries to ask all relevant questions . </question.v.2100><question.v.2101>Faith never questioned Vera 's paycheck. It always looked correct; the net was more or less the same amount. Faith dutifully signed the payroll checks , after all , was her solemn responsibility; so she signed those tax checks without question . </question.v.2101><question.v.2102>Simpson 's accuser , whom police have not yet publicly identified , alleged that sports memorabilia had been stolen. So far neither Simpson nor several others who were questioned have been arrested or charged in connection with the incident. However , police intend to turn their findings over to the Clark County District Attorneys Office , which will decide whether criminal charges are merited . </question.v.2102><question.v.2103>His progression shows us that we must question beliefs at the starting point - at the level of the individual believer. All beliefs should be questioned - all beliefs should be made subject to a demand that they are backed up with rational argumentation and evidence. Where these are not available or unsuitable , then , we should all fall back by default onto the premise that we 're not sure. The surer we are , the more risk there is of ourselves descending unknowingly into a fundamentalist mindset , from which it can be hard to return because we come to defend our position with rigor , and invest in our position elements of our self-esteem. We should learn that our beliefs are not the defining feature of our personality , and that other 's beliefs are not the basis of theirs. Our actions are what count . </question.v.2103><question.v.2104>ETS 's TSO cites four bases for questioning -- -- - 's November SAT scores : large score difference , unusual agreement of answers , inconsistent performance and substantial erasures. With regard to -- -- - 's math score , where a large score difference exists , there is no inconsistent performance and absolutely no erasures; furthermore , the careful analysis of answer sheets detailed above generates substantial and convincing evidence that -- -- - did her own math work , contradicted primarily by ETS 's finding of a trivial number ( 3 ) of matched wrong answers. On math , the TSO asserts a large score difference alone , and virtually nothing more. Accordingly , -- -- - 's evidence as set forth in this Response gives the Board of Review a clear and compelling basis for releasing her November SAT math score . </question.v.2104><question.v.2105>Like the defendant in Loving , Laura was handcuffed , put in a police car , and transported to the police station , where her handcuffs were removed and she was questioned. The State argues that Loving is distinguishable because no one communicated to the defendant that he was free to leave , whereas Detectives Hayes and Duke told Laura that she was free to leave and not under arrest prior to questioning her. However , our review of the uncontested evidence regarding the circumstances of the first interrogation and Lauras treatment during that time leads us to conclude that a reasonable person in her situation would not feel free to resist the entreaties of the police. See Ackerman v. State , 774 N.E.2d 970 ( Ind. Ct. App. 2002 ) , trans. denied ( holding that while no one factor was dispositive , a reasonable person transported from home with no obvious means of returning who had admitted possible illegal activity to police and then was advised of her Miranda rights would not feel free to leave ) . </question.v.2105><question.v.2106>Normally , I would have ignored this rant but a lot of people on my list are asking why anyone would question the holocaust. First , let 's deal with some of your allegations. Your comparison of the Lipstadt v. Irving litigation to a debate is just wrong. In her book " Denying the Holocaust " Lipstadt called Irving just about everything but a child molester. Specifically , she accused him of being a nazi , consorting with known terrorists , and someone who loved Adolph Hitler. Irving sued ipstadt for libel in the British courts. This case had little to do with the holocaust , but it had a lot to do with Irving 's softball treatment of Adolph Hitler. Thus Mr. Irving now carries the derisive title of " revisionist. " Nevertheless , Lipstadt made the holocaust an issue in the trial . </question.v.2106><question.v.2107>Parents sometimes complain that their children come to them with questions that are critical in nature. Some have said , " It seems as if today everything is being questioned or challenged. Often I dont know how to give a good , clear answer and I need to say ask that in school or ask the minister in catechism class. " Sometimes , parents are at their wits end trying to handle all of the often critical questions that arise. At such times it is possible that some questions are ignored. However when this occurs , young people may get the impression that their parents are not trying to understand them or be helpful. This is unfortunate because often when this happens in families , the young people take their questions elsewhere. And where will they go then ? </question.v.2107><question.v.2108>Avoid deciding to cross-examine to please your client , to attack a witness , or to maintain your aggressive posture in the eyes of the jury. Examination without a proper motive will justifiably rebound against you and will often alienate the judge and jury , all to the detriment of your client 's case. Make your decisions on cross-examination tactically , based on a positive decision that testimony can be elicited from this witness that will either bolster your client 's case , diminish the opponent 's case , or predicate summation. If these goals are not well served , you should seriously consider silent cross-examination , that is , " It is not necessary to question this witness , your Honor. " </question.v.2108><question.v.2109>In recent times , some of those who have objected to televising the court has been on television quite a bit themselves.

N Surendren , the lawyer representing Sivarasa and Salahuddin said The police are investigating the duo over statements made during a Feb 7 ceramah in Seberang Jaya , Penang. Sivarasah said " I exercised my right under Section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Code to remain silent to the questions. For me , this ( investigation ) is an attempt to threaten me , Salahuddin and my comrades from raising important issues , such as the Anwar trial and and the Altantuya ( Shaariibuu murder ) . The police should focus on criminal cases like snatch thefts and robbery cases. There is no need to waste time and send a high- ranking police personnel to record our statements , " </question.v.2110><question.v.2111>Unlike a deposition , fishing expeditions aren ' t allowed.

Absolutely. But , the biggest problem right now in our economy is consumer confidence. That is agreed , by all. So why in God 's name would the Repubs come forward and declare the stimulus plan a failure before it has even had a chance ? Because they need it to fail. Think about it. What if the stimulus , recovery , mortgage bailout AND Obama are a success ? He will easily win reelection in 4 years ... and they are desperate to get back in control. When I watch them on TV and see right past their motives ... as do most. They are acting like a bunch of babies. I support my President. And , I am confident that in 4 years we will look brighter than we did after the preceding 4 years . </question.v.2116><question.v.2117>2.65 Serious offences. There is no Australian research on the relationship between serious offences and the right to silence when questioned by police. While some English and Northern Ireland studies indicate that suspects subsequently charged with serious offences are more likely to remain silent than suspects generally , 122 others have found that there is no strong relationship between silence when questioned by police and serious offences.123 There is no uniform definition of what constitutes a serious offence for research purposes . </question.v.2117><question.v.2118>The Committee questioned Toyota electronic control system design flaws , the reasons for the sudden slowdown may not be the accelerator pedal or pad such as mechanical failure.

Flowers stated that there were several discussions this past spring resulting in obvious levels of dissatisfaction for some faculty members or units. He noted that the Committee recognizes that there can be substantial differences in how procedures are carried out but the concerns that were raised have caused the Committee to question how effective faculty governance is. He pointed out that it was the Chancellor ' s idea for the Committee to assess how faculty members feel about various issues. Peterson noted that the Chancellor has indicated on several occasions that he is not hearing the same concerns that the Committee is hearing . </question.v.2119><question.v.2120>2 ) Scientific truth is not determined by consensus. In science the majority can be , and often have been , wrong. There is a great deal of peer pressure in the science community , which can stifle objections to a popular theory. New advances in science often begin with just a few scientists who are prepared to risk questioning the reigning paradigm.

Bilson saw immediately that Kim was not only a first-rate pianist and musician , but that he also had a keen mind which questioned everything and desired real understanding. This quest for meaning catapulted Kim into serious academic studies in music with Cornell 's musicology and music theory professors , studies at which he also excelled. In this way , he is a model of what the study of music at Cornell has long been-a mixture of the applied and theoretical. David received an Masters of Musicology degree from Yale University in 2006 . </question.v.2122><question.v.2123>Enough about interviews.

Polygraphers routinely accuse subjects of employing countermeasures when they have absolutely no evidence whatsoever. As more people learn about the trickery behind polygraph testing , " post-test " questioning about countermeasures may eventually follow every " passing " chart. If you correctly employ the countermeasures described in The Lie Behind the Lie Detector and the polygrapher informs you that he knows you are trying to beat the device , he is bluffing. Do n't fall for it ! If you plan to use countermeasures , never , under any circumstances , admit to the polygrapher that you know about/have employed countermeasures . </question.v.2125><question.v.2126>* The mother of a 14-year-old boy has complained to the complaints authority that her son was beaten , strip-searched and hit in the face with a baton when being questioned about an alleged burglary.
