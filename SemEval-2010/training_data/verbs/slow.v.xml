<slow.v.train><slow.v.1>Another aspect that I do n't see explored is the effect of external constraints on a highway jam. For example , a traffic light at the begining of an on ramp or end of an off ramp. Or , an off ramp that then merges with a street that has heavy uniform traffic with close spaced cars that the cars on the off ramp ca n't merge with. For example , on my current commute home a traffic light controls the entrance of traffic to an on ramp that then merges onto a small highway. So the on ramp releases a big clump of cars , that have insufficient gaps to merge onto the traffic already on the highway. This slows down the cars travelling up the on-ramp ( which is already an uphill climb ) as well as creating a jam right at the onramp ( which is also uphill , which does n't help ) . </slow.v.1><slow.v.2>In northwest Yellowstone , drivers along U.S. 191 north of West Yellowstone , Mont. , were also being told to slow down and watch out for firefighters in the area of the 3 , 010-acre Rathbone fire . </slow.v.2><slow.v.3>On June 29 , 1995 , Galileo was travelling at roughly 25 , 900 kilometers per hour relative to the Sun , but this speed is n't constant -- the spacecraft is actually slowing down. Since the spacecraft is essentially in an elliptical orbit about the Sun , its speed naturally drops as it moves away from the Sun ( if not for Jupiter 's influence , it would speed up as it started moving back towards the Sun ) . You notice the same behavior when throwing a long , high fly ball -- the ball slows down and " hangs " at the top of its path . </slow.v.3><slow.v.4>He did not regret being hatless. He did not regret that when three or four cars had slowed down alongside him he had waved them by; he thought of them without any feeling at all. He found himself staring at the ground , at his dusty feet , as though he had not the strength to look up. Yet he kept on , the close , paled image of the town before him : the town with its giant elms and its narrow main street , its tight little hills , the string of stores that curled and blinked gaudily in the heat. If he followed this road along he would go through the town and finally come to a bridge , a bridge streaked with rust; and after that the houses and the stores would vanish and he would be in the country again , on this same road and with orchards on each side of him quiet and lonely in the summer heat . </slow.v.4><slow.v.5>Im quite surprised at myself. Im 15 years old and Im pretty sure I understood this article. This is intense , honestly , and extremely interesting. Yet I have a question. Lets say that from a certain star to earth an area managed to reach this temperature. Then light would be kept in this area , but when is it released ? Is the light release when the temperature rises or does it simply release at a random time period ? The idea of slowing down the speed of light , well if it was slowed down wouldnt it last longer ? So if we wanted to use a certain light source for a very long period of time could we make the " light " last longer by having it reach these temperatures ? </slow.v.5><slow.v.6>Notes : Recorded in a mysterious garage somewhere , sound quality is very poor.

Ref speed would be 111 knots. The 7X seemed to find a landing power slot easily , and I made small changes with the throttles until the flare . </slow.v.7><slow.v.8>There is a lot of work to be done to help protect deer and other wildlife. And drivers should slow down and watch the road carefully during hunting seasons. Be aware that most of the time when a car hits a deer , the driver slowed down for one deer , and then sped up and hit another. In other words , if you see one deer , slow down and watch for the rest of the deer family . </slow.v.8><slow.v.9>Of course , a superhero would n't be anything without special powers. And without Viewtiful Joe 's special powers , the game would be a pretty plain 2D beat-'em-up. Joe 's powers are all thematically similar , giving him command over the movie-based world he 's fighting his way through. Joe earns his powers gradually. The first power is the ability to drop everything into slow motion , and it 's probably the most useful power in the game. Holding L1 activates the power , and its most important feature is that Joe 's punches and kicks do more damage when he 's in slow motion. But it also has a lot of puzzle-oriented uses , too. The propellers that hold up the game 's hovering platforms will fall to the ground when slow is activated , since the props wo n't spin fast enough to keep the moving platforms in the air. This also comes in handy pretty early on , when the game puts you up against a giant attack helicopter , whose machine-gun fire can be deflected back at the thing when time is slowed down. You 'll also use this ability to slow the reels of a slot machine and to avoid incoming numerous projectile attacks . </slow.v.9><slow.v.10>One other note : I learned once that when you are in familiar territory , your eyes take a fraction of the number of " pictures " as it would in a new environment.

" You see pictures of the gills covered with mucus and it sure looks like that 's what killed them it 's such an obvious symptom , I 'm sure that 's why the myth still persists. But if you look closely at the physiology , you see that the mucus is just a symptom of underlying gill damage that leads to a massive loss of sodium salt through the gills. One of the duties of gills is to control the sodium level in the blood : They take sodium out of the water and they slow the loss of sodium from the blood to the water. High acidity in the water damages the membranes of the gill cells and allows the sodium to leak out.

The cold front brought snow to most of the area , with accumulations ranging from a trace to nearly 8 inches. The snow will help wheat conditions , but it would have been much more beneficial had it not been accompanied with high winds. Much of the snow ended up in fence rows , road sides and into some fields , slowing harvest. Soil moisture was rated very short to adequate with most areas reporting short. The cotton harvest is about 85 percent complete. Sorghum harvest is about 95 percent complete. Wheat was rated mostly fair to good. Range conditions were rated mostly fair. Fire danger was high. Cattle were in fair to good condition. Bitter cold , snow and high winds caused considerable stress on area cattle.

The second name comes from Admiral Farragut 's order at the battle of Mobile Bay : " Damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead !

Yet the Allied forces were exhausted from months of heavy fighting in bitter weather. The terrain also favored the defenders , who used the Apennine Mountains , with their deep valleys , foggy hollows , and rain-swollen streams and rivers , to slow the Allied advance to a crawl. Allied soldiers endured icy winds and torrential rains , lived in improvised shelters , ate cold rations , suffered from exposure and trench foot , and hauled their own munitions and supplies up and down steep mountainsides where vehicles and even mule trains were often unable to negotiate the few crude tracks or rocky crags . </slow.v.24><slow.v.25>Now , though , it appears sales of Sony 's new console have slowed across the Pacific.

The pitstops brought few interessting moments as well. The only thing to mention is that Frentzten and Irvine were on a one stop strategy and with this were able to pass Villeneuve and his followers. The sole surprise was when Hakkinen came into the pits , but did not stop at the McLarens box , but went right on through. After the race , the chief of Mercedes told us that the team caused this hoax by calling Hakkinen in by mistake. As Hakkinen was so much in front of thirdplaceman Frentzen , he came back on the track in second position. The McLaren forced Coulthard to slow down and let Hakkinen pass to establish the original ranking. Hakkinen finally passed the checkered flag first , followed by Coulthard within a second. Frentzen was able to hold off the clear faster Irvine and received the final podium place. Villeneuve was able to hold off Herbert , who scored the final point.

He wonders what the temperature of -455 out in space does to the speed of light , if these scientist can slow light to a crawl at -459. First , the difference between -455 and -459 is huge when you are talking about slowing down light. More importantly , These scientists slow light to a crawl by sending it through ultra-cold very dense matter ( Bose-Einstein Condensates ) . In space there is very little matter , so the light is moving through a vacuum ( or a very close to a vaccuum ) . It is the cold matter ( BEC ) that slows down light , not just the cold.

Wind is also driven directly by the sun 's photonic energy. Right now , we are at the lowest solar minimum on record. The solar minimum and maximum cycles last about 11 years. The intensity of the sun 's radiation correlates with sunspot activity , and there have been virtually no sunspots for a while. This solar minimum also lowers average temperatures. I believe that if winds are slightly slowing , it is more likely due to the current amazingly low solar minimum. That also will lower the earth 's worldwide temperatures. I believe that winds will pick up over the next 10 years. I also believe that global climate change , currently masked by solar minimum , will sadly unmask itself over the next 10 years , and we will see terrible heat waves. Speculation , of course , but based on sound science. It surprises me that climate scientists would not consider the current solar minimum in their reasoning about wind speeds . </slow.v.37><slow.v.38>The story of the day was the 45-year-old Quinn , who canned seven birdies in his first 10 holes and raced to the lead.

On a wet road you should reduce your speed about 10 mph. On packed snow you should cut your speed in half. Use snow tires or chains when the road has snow on it. On ice , you must slow to a crawl. It is very dangerous to drive on ice . </slow.v.67><slow.v.68>When i said Greed. this is in reference that Loan Officers make more money by charging higher rates.

Einstein showed that if an object is moving away from us at a significant fraction of the speed of light , we would see events on that object slowing down noticeably. It would not be an illusion as is the case for the creationist scenario with its absolute , Newtonian time frame. Thus , we would see a dramatic slowing down at cosmological distances , where galaxies are moving away from us at a significant fraction of the speed of light. However , this legitimate cosmological effect is important only for really great distances , and it plays no significant role in our calculations. At 170 , 000 light-years , for instance , the effect would be virtually nil . </slow.v.72><slow.v.73>The next lap , saw Thomas slow down , considerably , as he now had problems with both turning right , driving straight , and no breaks , but he still managed to do a time of 1 min 28 seconds on that lap.

However , physicists began to find other behavior , that could be explained only in terms of quantities having discrete , or quantized values , rather than continuously variable ones. For example , it was found that elementary particles behaved rather like little tops , spinning about an axis. But the amount of spin could n't have just any value. It had to be some multiple of a basic unit. Because this unit is very small , one does not notice that a normal top really slows down in a rapid sequence of discrete steps , rather than as a continuous process. But for tops as small as atoms , the discrete nature of spin is very important . </slow.v.80><slow.v.81>Housing markets have remained mixed since the last report.

There was a great interest in doing so : though all measurements of the speed of light up to that point had returned the same value ( within experimental error ) , it was assumed that variations in that speed had to exist***. Light escaping from very massive stars would have to escape a greater gravitational field , and would presumably be slowed by that field. Arago , and others of the time , assumed that light from larger stars would be traveling slower when it reached the Earth , though we know now by general relativity that this is not the case****.

The vast majority of the top 20 are still running 14- to 16-dog strings. Schnuelle and the others , such as four-time champion Jeff King , know why. Dogs naturally slow down on soft trail and in warm temperatures , and when they run slower , they stay healthier.

He grows seasonal crops , rice in summer , and barley and rye in winter. He uses just the scattered straw of the preceding crop , a cover of clover and an occasional sprinkling of poultry manure for fertilizer. Instead of planting seeds and transplanting seedlings as in traditional rice cultivation , Fukuoka simply broadcasts earth and clay pellets containing seeds onto the ground. Then he floods his paddies , but for a much shorter duration than the usual rice farmer. The flooding is timed to after the barley harvest while the clover is still very thick and the rice is just getting started. This weakens the clover and other weeds but does not slow the rice down. Each rice stalk yields 200 to 300 grains , which compares very favorably with the yield of other forms of cultivation . </slow.v.125><slow.v.126>Try to avoid panic stops by seeing events well in advance.

This gap is still significant for many farmers and regions. Acquiring knowledge about the techniques is one obstacle , infrastructure and institutions represent another. The importance of rural roads and functioning markets for agricultural progress are a reflection of the latter such policy measures which are essential for yield gap closing. In many developing countries , and especially in remote and/or low rainfall and poor soil areas , so-called marginal areas and farmers , the yield gap is still appears to be relatively large. This offers another opportunity for boosting farm yield progress , but the investment requirements are large and lagging commitment on behalf of governments and the private sector to this may be another reason why yield progress is slowing . </slow.v.130><slow.v.131>The Creationist response to these figures is to propose that an excessive amount of carbon dioxide remained in the early post-flood atmosphere and that this produced phenomenal growth rates.

Third was Johnny Herbert , who is not a common podium finisher as well. He proved that the Sauber is a reliable car that is not much off the pace of the top teams. Because of his tyre problems in the beginning and in the latter part of the race , Michael Schumacher was lucky to leave Hungary with three more points. His brother Ralf , scoring two points , could have gone a lot quicker , but as always on the Hungaroring , it is very , very difficult to overtake other cars.

This direction requires the vehicle to travel in a straight line. All other directions require the vehicle to slow down to change direction. The approach speed for each vehicle was calculated from the time taken for the vehicle to travel a distance of 126 ft along Savage Road to the first edge of Crosswalk 1. These approach speeds were measured only for a single approaching vehicle , or for the vehicle at the front of a series of vehicles , i.e. , only for vehicles whose speed was not influenced by that of vehicles immediately ahead. Approach speeds were measured without any pedestrian on or near the crosswalk , and when a pedestrian was obviously waiting to cross or was actually on the crosswalk. The mean approach speeds for direction 1 , with and without a pedestrian present , between the hours of 12.00 to 18.00 , for each evaluation are given in Table 3. The mean approach speeds for the hours that measurements were made at each evaluation are recorded in Appendix B in Tables 16 to 20 . </slow.v.143><slow.v.144>A cold , wet spring put crop planting weeks behind schedule across much of the U.S. Corn Belt and has drastically slowed growth where corn is already in the ground . </slow.v.144><slow.v.145>Sugar beets are generally looking very good.

The tire went down so abruptly that Rudd had little time to do react to the situation. " That 's about all the warning I got [ when the tire blew ] , just enough to hold on to the steering wheel , " said Rudd after being released from the infield medical center.

The warm-blooded animal becomes almost cold-blooded as its body temperature drops close to that of the surrounding air. Its breathing may slow to one breath every five minutes; its heartbeats may occur as infrequently as four or five times a minute; and it may lie completely motionless for days on end. Researchers have found that a hibernator will scarcely bleed when cut , does not react to being stuck with needles , and can be shaken or rolled across a table without awakening. However , when it is the proper time , the animal awakens in a short period. If exposed to moderate warmth , the animal will be completely alert in little more than an hour . </slow.v.150><slow.v.151>Good things , however , often happen when you least expect them. Towards the end of the last day I must have been lost in thought , or simply tired of hiking , and did not immediately notice that the weather had shifted favourably , for once. It did not exactly change , but something in the atmosphere was no longer the same the light had a different quality to it , the sky had clearly changed its mood , and I heard Pharaoh 's Dance starting playing at the back of my mind. All of a sudden my camera bag became light as a feather and I rushed to where I envisioned would be a great spot for photography at that time of the day. As expected , there came the moment when you tell yourself to slow down and not waste film shooting the same scene over and over again yet consistently fail to listen to your own experienced advice.

A circulation driven by evaporation and high-latitude cooling would be very stable. But Stommel 's self-maintaining conveyor depends on precariously balanced forces : cooling pulls in one direction , while the input of freshwater from rain , snow , melting ice and rivers pulls in the other. This freshwater threatens to reduce the salinity , and therefore the density , of the surface waters; only by a constant flushing away of the freshwater and replenishing with salty water from the south does the conveyor survive. If the flow slows down too much , there comes a point where it can no longer keep up and the conveyor breaks down . </slow.v.154><slow.v.155>Police warned motorists to slow down and take more care as torrential rain overwhelmed storm drains.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas. It is transparent to the largest spectra of sunlight , while it absorbs significant portions of the IR spectrum as the solar input is re-radiated by the ground. It slows the rate of energy exchange between the earth and space , increasing the earth ' s net temperature. From observation we know that it produces a net increase of ~4.0 watts per meter squared to the earth ' s energy budget. Though water vapor is theoretically a greater absorber if IR it is not as persistent nor as homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere as CO2. It regularly precipitates out as rain and snow . </slow.v.157><slow.v.158>The course received a good soaking overnight , but the rain slowed by sunrise.

B drilled at Camp Taylor which was at the corner of Kinsman Ave. and Hudson St. ( now E. 105 St. ) . In June of 1861 the entire regiment was assembled at Camp Dennison , Cincinnati. On the 24th of July 1861 the 3 month men were reorganized and sworn in for 3 years service. Co. 's B and D were assigned to the right and left of the regiment respectively. These two companies were trained as the skirmishers for the regiment and were issued Enfield rifles. The other companies were originally issued smoothbore Austrian muskets but these were replaced as quickly as the ingenuity of the men would allow.

I had been keeping an eye on the weather in The Yellow Mountain from early December and , as it had been snowing a lot there this winter , I immediately thought of visiting the place again. Knowing how capricious the mountain is , however , I had no photographic expectations just give me a chance to slow down and think calmly and I am a happy camper; if I also happen to bring back one or two worthy images , it would be icing on the cake.

For example , glaciers start to melt ( which is happening now at an alarming rate ) and the cold water not only raises water levels but affects warm currents that are vital to preserving elements of global climate ( a big factor is reducing the salinity -- and thus the density -- of the water , others are that the increased temperatures affect wind patterns which a; sp play a role in determining ocean currents ) . This could for example slow down or shutdown key oceanic streams such as the Gulf Stream. The imbalance created by the higher temperatures and changes in ocean currents would create extreme weather patterns all over the globe : superstorms on some parts , droughts on others , floods , and so on . </slow.v.164><slow.v.165>The recession a couple years after the PS3 launched slowed down the sales of HDTVs , . has solid online and downloadable games on the Playstation Network , . </slow.v.165><slow.v.166>Keep speaking up !

That electric comes at a price : it is taken away from the motion energy ( " kinetic energy " ) of the shuttle , since the magnetic force on the tether opposes the motion and slows it down. In principle , it should also be possible to reverse this process : a future space station could use solar cells to produce an electric current , which would be pumped into the tether in the opposite direction , so that the magnetic force would boost the orbital motion and would raise the orbit to a higher altitude . </slow.v.173><slow.v.174>The weight of the great continental ice sheets lying on northern Canada was sufficient to push the existing land below sea level by perhaps as much as 1 , 000 meters ( 3 , 281 feet ) around Hudson 's Bay. Now that the ice has gone , the land is recovering isostatically , so the highest of the areas below sea level a few thousand years ago are now just emerging. The rate of uplift immediately after the Ice Age was about 12 centimeters ( 4.7 inches ) per year; it has now slowed to 1 centimeter per year and this will continue for some time into the future.

Although several factors have affected this decline - including commercial fish harvests , habitat degradation , and artificial fish hatcheries - hydropower dams have contributed significantly.

Here the surface water ( ice ) is much less dense than the other water and thus floats on top. Ice cuts down on O2 exchange , but this is not as critical in the winter when the cold temperature has slowed down the metabolic rates ( and thus O2 demands ) of most of the organisms in the water. Still , long ice covers may cause fish kills. Snow cover on the ice may drastically reduce light levels also , but , most importantly , the ice and snow cover reduce heat loss from the lake and thus reduce the likelihood of the lake freezing completely. Underwater springs and flowing water coming into the lake also contribute some crucial warmth at this time . </slow.v.181><slow.v.182>I ' ve found that blogging has slowed down my reading in a good way , making me think more about what I ' m reading.

Plankton do not do well in lotic systems , however , since they may be swept into areas unfavorable for growth. Attached algae may also suffer since moving water can carry soil particles in suspension , blocking out light and raising the LCP above the bottom. The ability of the water to carry and move particles varies with its speed , and the deposition of those particles , which occurs as the water slows down , affects the distribution of different size particles on the bottom of the stream. Because of the chaotic nature of the currents , soil particles on the bottoms of streams tend to be more patchy and mixed than those in lakes , and will often shift position . </slow.v.189><slow.v.190>RUNNING OFF THE PAVEMENT - If your wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder of the road , do not yank the steering wheel back.

Initiate your turns a bit more gradually. Downshift smoothly , engaging the clutch a bit slower than usual , and avoid abrupt throttle changes. Get on the throttle progressively. Use a taller gear to reduce the forces reaching the rear tyre. Apply the brakes in such a way that the tyres are not loaded abruptly. Allow more space to stop or slow down so that you need less. And also make sure that drivers around you have time to react to your moves . </slow.v.196><slow.v.197>A cooling of the North Atlantic region would slow the melting process , curtail the influx of fresh water to the North Atlantic.

They didn ' t notice me and I ended up on the hood of the car , not too much fun but luckily he was going slow enough. The second time John and I were walking across the street while a car was making a left turn , he didn ' t stop , he just slowed down ( about 2 feet away from us ) .

Assuming you could condition all drivers to drive as you suggested , there would still be a lag time as drivers reacted to the change in speed of the drivers in front of them. In the ideal situation , where you can see far in front of you , you only have to worry about people being distracted or tuned-out from their monotonous commutes or long trips. In hilly situations , curving roads , or where some people drive huge SUVs , while other drivers drive smaller cars , not everyone can see what 's going on in front of them. In those cases ( and others like it ) , the distance between cars will change in proportion to the driving speed since you will be dealing with reaction speeds and driver distractions.

There , tulip poplars are a potentially dominant tree species under moist conditions. But in the past eight years , based on measurements of tree growth rings , their rate of growth has slowed dramatically. The probable reason is the series of unusually dry years , particularly 1988 , 1993 , and 1995. In contrast , the white oaks in the watershed are growing at nearly the same rate as before the droughts , because they are more drought tolerant than tulip poplars.

Just as a thrown ball slows down if encountering cold syrup due to friction , the same thing happens with light in the molasses-like environment it finds amoung bose-einstein condensates. talking about outer space being effectively just as cold is misleading.

One of the most important processes in topsoil formation is the accumulation of humus ( organic matter ) that occurs as plants grow , die , and are decomposed , and as earthworms , termites , ants , and other organisms rework the material. A by-product of this process is that individual particles are joined together to form aggregates. Aggregates are groups of individual soil particles held together by organic matter or other forces , and are the foundation of soil structure. At first , these changes may be rapid , but they tend to slow as time progresses.

" A 2005 comparison of eleven climate models showed that the MOC will likely be slowed by 10-50 , however , because the levels of carbon dioxide are so elevated , any cooling produced by the MOC slowing would be modest because the greenhouse gases would more than compensate. As a result , a net warming is still shown by these models for the UK and surrounding countries. Improving our measurements to monitor the MOC will allow for better predictions and reduce uncertainty of the amount of warming or cooling these areas of northern Europe will encounter.

Restoring degraded land in South China is surely an area where Chinese interests and global environmental interests intersect - especially in the area of slowing greenhouse gas production. The Chinese scientific and technical capabilities in this area are impressive , and a partnership with the United States could be enormously profitable.

Surely this is one place where this impasse might be broken . </slow.v.294><slow.v.295>Another process that can change the rotation of a planet is tidal braking. Tides create friction , and this friction can slow the rotation of a planet. Lest anyone think this is a possible way to accomplish some of Velikovsky 's catastrophes , it is not. A close brush with Venus or Mars would not last long enough nor generate enough friction to stop the Earth and re-start it as Velikovsky claims happened. Nevertheless , the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth , and Mercury 's rotation is locked to its revolution around the Sun because of tidal braking. Perhaps most spectacular , tidal stresses in Jupiter 's innermost moon , Io , probably generate enough heat through friction to keep Io 's interior hot and cause it to be volcanically active. Tidal braking of the Earth by the Moon has slowed the Earth 's rotation from 400 revolutions per year to the present 365 over the last half-billion years. Neither tidal braking nor precession , however , can be used to explain the sorts of catastrophes that pseudoscientists insist happened . </slow.v.295><slow.v.296>Looking through the wine list a veritable tome was a treat in itself.

Water may flow for several reasons , but gravity is at the root of all of them. We are familiar with the simple flow of water downhill that occurs in streams. Remember , though , that water is limited in how fast it can flow. One meter per second is a very fast flow indeed in a stream; even a waterfall usually does not exceed 3 m/s. Over this speed , water separates into smaller droplets , and as the droplets decrease in size they are more easily slowed by the air. Think - rain falls from great heights , yet the speed does reach a maximum. Most freshwater currents are caused by simple gravity pulling water down a slope . </slow.v.300><slow.v.301>After about 20 lengths I ' d had enough and was just getting out when I noticed them all huddle at one end together , have a bit of a conflab and then move en masse to the whirlpool thingy.

Demand was down for most construction-related materials , such as concrete , lumber and brick. Demand slowed sharply for petrochemical products , led by a drop in demand for ethylene , a fundamental building block. The slowdown has occurred partly because of import competition but mostly because a long period of inventory restocking has ended. Still , the level of petrochemical demand remains quite high , according to contacts . </slow.v.302><slow.v.303>The " moral " of this story is that the same instantaneous events appear to observers located at different places at different times , thus confirming Einstein 's deduction that there is no measuring system that can register an event as happening at the same time everywhere - the same motions seem relative with respect to " when " at different locales , each with its own observation conditions , for multiple , separate , and moving observers , and thus time is not an absolute as once affirmed by Newton and others. For a person onboard a spaceship traveling at high relativistic speeds , on contacting Earth he/she would learn that the clocks back there appear as though they would be running faster , i.e. , have speeded up. Conversely , the passage of time on the spaceship relative to those on Earth would seem to have slowed down. Likewise dimensionality in space is not absolute . </slow.v.303><slow.v.304>Collection. Capture and storage of runoff for more timely release is a vital component of most stormwater management systems. Retention basins are areas designed to hold the stormwater permanently until it infiltrates into the ground. Detention basins are meant to slow and hold stormwater before releasing it. When runoff is collected in vegetated storage areas such as retention and detention basins , adverse impacts on water resources can be greatly reduced. For sites where total capture is infeasible , studies suggest that collecting the " first flush , " the ( first 0.5 to 1.2 inches of rainfall ) can capture a high percentage of contaminants . </slow.v.304><slow.v.305>We took a moment to pause in an empty field.

Scientists are fairly certain that the last two abrupt coolings seen the Greenland ice core , the " Younger Dryas " event and the " 8200 years before present " event ( Figure 1 ) , both occurred when huge North American glacial melt-water lakes flooded down the St. Lawrence River into the North Atlantic when the ice dams restraining the lakes broke. The sudden addition of low-density fresh water presumably partially or totally stopped the sinking of ocean waters in the North Atlantic , slowing or completely stopping the Meridional Overturning Circulation. Once the fresh water got into the North Atlantic , it stayed , puddling on top of the ocean and freezing in winter. The Meridional Overturning Circulation stayed shut off for about 1100 years during the Younger Dryas event , then suddenly restarted , for reasons scientists do n't understand. Current computer models of the climate can not reproduce the observed sudden shut-down or start-up of the Meridional Overturning Circulation at the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas period . </slow.v.318><slow.v.319>That is ridiculous !

Nobody can predict with confidence what they will do in the coming decades. " At the moment models do n't represent the dynamics of Greenland glaciers , which may or may not start moving faster , " says Richard Wood of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter , UK.

For example , if you want to send a spacecraft from Earth to Jupiter , you first have to get it away from the Earth. If you just shoot it into space , the farther it gets from Earth , the slower it will go. If you do n't start it out fast enough , it will eventually slow down to zero velocity , and then fall back toward the Earth , just like if you throw a ball into the air -- you ca n't throw it high enough to escape the Earth , so it falls back toward you. But if it has *escape velocity* it will never fall back . </slow.v.323><slow.v.324>LIPTON : One day my wife and I were washing the dishes , and I picked up this new soap , dishwashing soap that she had purchased and I was looking at the label. It was a really nice label , and it was from Belgium. And as I read it , down at the bottom it said that this Belgian factory had the largest grass roof in the world. And it had an 800 number on it , and I thought well why do n't I call it ? And then something clicked in my mind and I thought : roof gardens and storm water. So I made a phone call to the company representative who was in California , and they sent me some information , and that 's where I first started seeing information that said yes , these roof tops actually hold a lot of water , and the water that does flow off them is dramatically slowed down. Its runoff rate is much slower than just a regular roof . </slow.v.324><slow.v.325>The eggplant production has begun to slow down and while the plants continue to flower they have dropped much of their leaf.

This single engined aircraft with its screaming sirens designed to terrify anyone it was attacking on the ground , dive bombed very precisely. The pilot had a window in the floor so he could spot his target and lines were inscribed on the canopy from which he could gauge the angle of his dive. An experienced pilot could dive his Stuka vertically by using air-brakes which would slow down the dive so he could accurately aim his 1 , 100 pound bomb load. Unfortunately for the Germans , the bomb load was restricted to this maximum because of the Stuka 's poor aerodynamic shape and its 232 miles per hour maximum air speed and it was this slow speed that helped 3 Squadron bring down 8 of the 12 Stukas they surprised on the 18th of February 1941 near Agedabia . </slow.v.327><slow.v.328>Says Wadhams , " Until recently , we would find giant 'chimneys ' in the sea where columns of cold , dense water were sinking from the surface to the seabed [ 1.8 miles ] below , but now they have almost disappeared.

" </slow.v.328><slow.v.329>And so on any still-intact slope of Eastern Kentucky , we have two intricately living and interdependent natural communities : that of the forest and that of the topsoil beneath the forest. Between them , moreover , the forest and the soil are carrying on a transaction with water that , in its way , also is intricate and wonderful. The two communities , of course , can not live without rain , but the rain does not fall upon the forest as upon a pavement; it does not just splatter down. Its fall is slowed and gentled by the canopy of the forest , which thus protects the soil. The soil , in turn , acts as a sponge that absorbs the water , stores it , releases it slowly , and in the process filters and purifies it. The streams of the watershed - if the human dwellers downstream meet their responsibility - thus receive a flow of water that is continuous and clean . </slow.v.329><slow.v.330>Rain slowed the first day of testing , which Goodyear is using to test different tire compounds and structures.

However , that effort required cooling the material to 5 K. Now Matthew Bigelow , Nick N.

I totally agree with your analysis. Here is a thought about why maintaining a constant gap ahead when you slow to enter a congested area works. I suspect drivers instinctively maintain a gap that keeps the time to traverse it ( " headway " ) constant , so as you slow down it gets shorter. The size of the gap another car needs to change into your lane also gets smaller as you go slower , but it prevents lane change well before it reaches the limit of the following car. This is probably because of the physical size of a car not going to 0 ( a fixed size ) , but also that an entering car needs space to brake ( a variable size ) as traffic slows. ie , the curves cross at a point that determines just how close a following car can get and still permit another car to chenge lanes and enter at that speed. Once traffic reaches the point where the distance between cars is less than the fixed and variable requirement of the entering car , the pattern quickly goes from synchronized to jammed. Does that make sense ? </slow.v.344><slow.v.345>Meanwhile , General Greene had arrived at the Catawba and with Colonel Washington had visited Morgan and Davidson at Beatties Ford and planned his strategy.

The Galileo orbiter is currently in an orbit around the Sun and is just past aphelion ( the furthest point from the Sun ) where the orbiter 's speed is the slowest in its orbit. However , if we look at a Sun-centered coordinate system , the orbiter is actually ahead of Jupiter ( i.e. Jupiter is coming up from behind the orbiter ) . As Jupiter " catches up " to the orbiter , its gravitational attraction is actually slowing the orbiter down with respect to the Sun. Between one and two days prior to arrival the orbiter 's " forward " motion around the Sun will actually stop. Then , moving in the opposite direction ( backwards ) , the orbiter speeds up again as it moves around the back side of Jupiter. While all of this is happening , the orbiter speed with respect to Jupiter is continuously increasing due to Jupiter 's gravitational attraction. The JOI maneuver ( which involved firing the main engine for 45 minutes ) slowed it from interplanetary cruise speed enough for Jupiter 's gravity to capture it . </slow.v.367><slow.v.368>The tow truck did not have a flag , and certainly not a blinking one.

As a trucker we drive with a large empty space ahead of us because it takes us almost that entire space just to slow down , let alone stop. The average car can go from sixty to zero in almost no time , a loaded semi ( even if he does n't lock the tires up ) can rarely go from 55 to zero in less than 300 feet. Truckers use an " eight second rule " whereby we watch the car ahead of us pass a sign , mile-marker , or other roadside object and if we reach the same object in less than eight seconds we 're too close. In the event of an emergency stopping situation it takes roughly eight seconds for the brain to react , hit the brakes , and stop a loaded truck. If we did n't leave that massive space we 'd kill you : ) But you 're right , it does help in a heavy traffic situation as well , allowing other traffic to merge , distort , and swap positions around us like a boulder in a stream . </slow.v.387><slow.v.388>Lazier also got past the faltering Cheever and Buhl , who averaged 102.292 mph in the race slowed by eight caution flags.

However , this can be largely eliminated by installing the proper species or cultivar and by not over fertilizing. Many compact and dwarf shrubs are now available at retail garden centers. Selective pruning can shape plants or produce either a thin or thick canopy. A thinner canopy edge will allow more light penetration and help keep interior leaves on the plant. Root pruning can be used to slow plant growth , producing a more compact plant. Prune one half the root system , wait 4-6 weeks , then prune the other half. Root pruning should be scheduled so roots will be watered thoroughly to keep the soil moist for 4-6 weeks following root pruning . </slow.v.451><slow.v.452>Due to cool weather , some growers began digging late planted peanuts. The cool temperatures also slowed maturing of some late cotton. Some growers welcomed rain late in the week , which improved soil moisture conditions. The moisture was needed to plant winter grazing and other grains. Harvest continued for cotton and peanuts. Some growers reported good yields for cotton and peanuts . </slow.v.452><slow.v.453>At the start of his 1864 drive toward Atlanta , Sherman rejected Thomas ' plan to take his command through Snake Creek Gap to cut off and smash Joseph Johnston 's Confederate army. More than a month into Georgia , an impatient Sherman complained to Grant that Thomas ' Army of the Cumberland was slowing his advance " a fresh furrow in a plowed field will stop the whole column. " He was still in this mood a few days later when he ignored Thomas ' advice against attacking the strongly entrenched Rebels head-on at Kennesaw Mountain. The Federals lost more than 2 , 000 troops in trying to take what Thomas had warned was an impregnable position . </slow.v.453><slow.v.454>Whittaker paused as if thinking about it for a moment before agreeing.

In 1781 , General Cornwallis proclaimed Charlotte to be " a damned hornet 's nest of rebellion " . At the battle site at Cowans Ford , General William Lee Davidson , along with a band of Catawba Valley farmers were able to slow the advance of General Cornwallis. Early in the battle , General Davidson was shot and killed at the riverbank. A monument honoring Davidson is located near the present site of Cowans Ford Dam , but the exact location of his demise is under the waters of Lake Norman . </slow.v.455><slow.v.456>SOUTH : The entire region had adequate to surplus soil moisture. Temperatures were still cooler and damper than average throughout most of the region , which put a halt to most fieldwork. The northern parts of the region received from 1 inch to 5 inches of rain. Some low-lying areas had flooding. Wheat producers in the eastern part of the region were able to plant some spring wheat , but drizzling rain slowed them down. Rain late in the week provided much needed moisture for dryland wheat and oat producers. The rain also helped cabbage , carrot , onion and spinach producers save on irrigation costs. No damage to cabbage and spinach was reported after the extremely cold weather from two weeks ago , but an estimated 45 acres of tomatoes were lost in the southern part of the region. Forage quality and quantity declined , and livestock were in marginal condition. Many beef producers were supplying large amounts of supplemental feed to offset the stress caused by cold and wet weather. Hay supplies were minimal , and stock water tank levels were increasing but still low . </slow.v.456><slow.v.457>That could slow economic or residential growth in some areas , if new businesses or sewage treatment plant expansions are held up.

However , this destruction can be slowed , stopped , and in some cases even reversed. Most people agree that the problem must be remedied , but the means are not as simple as fortifying fences around the remaining rainforests or banning the timber trade. Economic , political , and social pressures will not allow rainforests to persist if they are completely closed off from use and development </slow.v.460><slow.v.461>A soil amendment that may make a major difference in Southern China is zeolites. Zeolites are a group of naturally occurring fine-grained minerals with pronounced ion exchange properties. Some deposits exist in South China. Research at the South China Agricultural University shows that additions of small amounts of zeolites to highly weathered , low-fertility soils significantly slows the leaching of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer and helps release tightly bound soil phosphorus to the plants. Recent tests in China show that small amounts of zeolites added to the soil increased the biomass production of corn by as much as a 29.5 percent. The Chinese work shows that zeolites can also help prevent agricultural pollutants from entering the groundwater and surface waters , help make clean-water resources last longer where fish and turtles are raised in ponds , reduce chicken feed requirements , and increase the survival rate for turtles while decreasing disease . </slow.v.461><slow.v.462>Used properly , fungicides can slow the rate of disease spread. Remember , the object is not to eradicate disease from your crop. Successful disease management reduces the amount of disease so that the season is rewarding , financially and otherwise.

Fungicides are not the answer to all disease problems , and they certainly aren ' t a magic slipper ! </slow.v.462><slow.v.463>Because saltwater is denser and heavier than freshwater , this " freshening " of the North Atlantic would make the surface layers more buoyant. That 's a problem because the surface water needs to sink to drive a primary ocean circulation pattern known as the " Great Ocean Conveyor. " Sunken water flows south along the ocean floor toward the equator , while warm surface waters from tropical latitudes flow north to replace the water that sank , thus keeping the Conveyor slowly chugging along. An increase in freshwater could prevent this sinking of North Atlantic surface waters , slowing or stopping this circulation . </slow.v.463><slow.v.464>The race was not over as there were eight hours from the end.

But tops change their motion because they are balanced on a firm surface and because gravity is pulling them downward. Under zero gravity conditions , like in a spacecraft , both types of tops would spin until they slowed due to air resistance. In space , with no air , they would spin forever , and not flip or fall over. The Earth is spinning like a top , but like one spinning in space . </slow.v.468><slow.v.469>7. ) When I am at a red light going one way , and you are at the same red light , but going in the other direction and you need to turn in front of me ( did that make sense ?

Supply exceeded demand , driving down real prices of crop products such as grains , and boosting average per capita food production and rural wealth , particularly in Asia ( Asian Development Bank 2000 ) . While demand factors , like population and per capita income increase , and distributional ones , like trade , are very important in all of this , they will be discussed in other papers in the Congress , and this paper will focus on the supply side of cropping. This is done by disaggregating the global crop area and yield changes for the 40 year period from 1961-3 to 2001-03 into the key component crops and by developing and developed country categories ( Tables 1 , 2 , 3; which use FAO statistics and the FAO definition of developed countries which has always included USSR and/or exUSSR countries ) . </slow.v.474><slow.v.475>I started on the front row and I am glad I did.

We could bring manufacturing back to our country with lots of cheap power. It may be expensive to set up now but if we really jumped into it we could figure out how to make it much cheaper. Solar power could be made much cheaper if the research was done. Someone once said it would take the entire state of New mexico covered with solar panels to power our country.

Points on the outer layers of the rotating globe ( especially near the equator ) move at a higher linear velocity than points on the inner layers , but at the same angular velocity. Consequently , if the earth were suddenly stopped ( or slowed down ) in its rotation , the inner layers might come to rest ( or their rotational velocity might be slowed ) while the outer layers would still tend to go on rotating. This would cause friction between the various liquid or semifluid layers , creating heat; on the outermost periphery the solid layers would be torn apart , causing mountains and even continents to fall or rise . </slow.v.495><slow.v.496>The boom-and-bust era is over now in the Pacific Northwest.

With little organic matter in the soil , clay particles are moved by raindrops and plug soil pores , thus inhibiting water infiltration and increasing runoff and erosion. Residual boulders of fresh granite ( core stones ) as large as automobiles sometime slide and tumble down hillsides when the surrounding soft weathered material is eroded during heavy rains. The finer-grained eroded sediments damage aquatic productivity and bury what were once freshwater and near-shore marine aquatic breeding grounds. The remaining coarser , sandy material of the weathered granite yields soils of low fertility. Stripped of vegetation that would otherwise have absorbed or slowed the flow of water , the water pours rapidly into streams and rivers , cutting deep ravines in the soft , deeply weathered granite . </slow.v.502><slow.v.503>With ABS - One aspect of having ABS , is that you can turn your vehicle while braking without skidding.

Manhattan 's office rental market remains particularly tight : vacancy rates were steady near cyclical lows at the end of July , and asking rents were up 30 to 40 percent from a year earlier -- about the same as in recent months. Leasing activity has slowed somewhat , but this is attributed , in part , to a dearth of available space. Office markets in the rest of the New York City area are also characterized as stable in July , though a good deal more slack than Manhattan 's -- particularly in northern New Jersey ( except for Jersey City , where the market is fairly tight ) . Asking rents in these suburban markets are generally little changed from a year earlier . </slow.v.511><slow.v.512>Because the idea of better growth during the dry season seemed counterintuitive , the leading explanation for the dry-season carbon surplus was not increased photosynthesis.

On a year-over-year basis , sales were largely unchanged in most places. Among merchandise categories , home furnishings and apparel were strongest , while sporting goods continued to show some weakness. Store managers generally reported that inventory levels were in line with expectations. Nearly all managers remained optimistic about sales in coming months and were preparing to increase stock levels for the fall season. Motor vehicle sales held steady in August after picking up following the reintroduction of financing incentives in July. However , most dealers reported that sales were slightly below year-ago levels. Looking ahead , dealers expect sales to increase modestly with the start of the new model year and will build inventories accordingly.

The debate over biotechnology seems to get ever more intractable , its costs higher , the disputants angrier. Europe is on the verge of requiring the tracking of all genetically modified ( GM ) food from farm to grocery store , despite strenuous opposition from the United States. Zimbabwe has rejected emergency food relief that contained unmilled GM corn. Germplasm used in agricultural R &amp;D used to move freely among countries , but the flow has slowed to a trickle as developing countries rich in biodiversity restrict exports of wild plants , hoping to share in the profits from their hidden genes. With so much at stake , one would expect every issue in this arena to be exhaustively examined , argued , rebutted , and negotiated. But what is striking is how little actual debate there really is. There is conflict , but no engagement. Why ? What keeps the debate a take-no-prisoners war rather than a spirited rational discussion ? </slow.v.526><slow.v.527>There was one piece of action which perfectly caught the spirit of the contest between the two : Yousuf came down the track but Vettori cleverly slowed up the pace and shortened the length. However , Yousuf waited to adjust to the lack of pace and though he could n't reach the pitch of the ball , he did n't panic or lunge out; instead he almost nonchalantly wafted through the line and found enough power and timing to lift it over long-on. Vettori used the crease well , varied his pace and utilized the arm-ball intelligently but Yousuf handled him with aplomb. He moved forward or back as the length demanded of him and picked the arm ball on most occasions . </slow.v.527><slow.v.528>What happened to your race car ?

That 's really what separates the good cars from the not-so-good cars. Everybody starts off pretty good , runs pretty even with one another and then when the brake systems get abused and heat up some brake systems stay cooler than others. Then all of sudden you might have to start braking at the 400-yard marker instead of the 3 to get slowed down. So a lot of work goes into getting the brakes working good and staying good. A lot of times that is the difference in winning and being at the back of the pack . </slow.v.530><slow.v.531>When Hamlin slowed , Jeff Burton flashed by to take the lead.

In racing , since the jockeys no longer know how to use their hands , they primarily use the whip to aid the horse forward. However , riding the horse out with the whip is not just smacking the horse 's ass in the yahoo-like way of going; the whip must land at a precise moment within a fraction of a second in order to work to " motivate " the horse to tuck back under his hind legs. The whip should land during the phase of " tucking under " while the horse is in the air and the pain of the whip causes the horse to tucks his hind legs under some more. Hitting the horse during full run out of timing is brutal and often will cause the horse to slow down or sulk , or even buck or kick out if he ' s going slow enough . </slow.v.549><slow.v.550>This is when things went really bad.

" The most successful method was to anchor and chunk with either butterfish or sardine. Schools of large bluefish arrived and bluefin catches have since dropped. Just prior to the rough weather , anglers retreated to the Parking Lot and caught bluefin tuna but very few bluefish. Results from the shop 's tuna tournament show Tom Valek winning the event with a 149-pound bluefin and Ken Goeller placing second with a 145-pound bluefin.

And with a sizable investment , Brazil could build on this trend and halt forest clearing by 2020 , which would cut global carbon dioxide emissions by 2 to 5 percent , according to a study in Science. Market forces and Brazil ' s political will are converging in an unprecedented opportunity to end deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon with 80 percent of the forest still standing , said Daniel Nepstad , a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center and lead author of the study. Since 2005 , Brazil has reduced the rate of deforestation by 64 percent. According to the study , an investment of $ 6.5 to $ 18 billion in several areas from 2010 to 2020 can help Brazil end deforestation. Key steps include supporting jobs in forest communities that do not result in forest clearing; rewarding responsible cattle ranchers and farmers; stricter environmental enforcement; and better management of protected areas . </slow.v.556><slow.v.557>EARLIER CYCLES OF CUTTING AND FILLING The most recent period of arroyo formation in the southwest , which occurred from about 1865 to 1915 , was not unique. Previous cycles of arroyo cutting ( erosion ) have occurred at about 2000 years Before Present ( B.P. ) and 700 years B.P. ( Emmett , 1974 ) . These cycles of arroyo cutting were both followed by slower periods of filling ( alluviation ) . Since about 1915 , arroyo development , with a few notable exceptions , has slowed with many arroyos showing aggradation ( Cooke and Reeves , 1976 ) . The primary modifications since this time have been widening of trenches , grading of walls , aggradation , and slow changes in bed levels . </slow.v.557><slow.v.558>As I shall show later , mountains fell and others rose from level ground; the earth with its oceans and continents became heated; the sea boiled in many places , and rock liquefied; volcanoes ignited and forests burned. Would not a sudden stop by the earth , rotating at a little over one thousand miles an hour at its equator , mean a complete destruction of the world ? Since the world survived , there must have been a mechanism to cushion the slowing down of terrestrial rotation , if it really occurred , or another escape for the energy of motion besides transformation into heat , or both. Or if rotation persisted undisturbed , the terrestrial axis may have tilted in the presence of a strong magnetic field , so that the sun appeared to lose for hours its diurnal movement.

But there was nothing substantial that slowed us down other than the terrain. ... There was still this gnawing thought that maybe someplace out there there was a battalion or a brigade of the Medina division that we would encounter , but it never materialized. So the advance through the Karbala Gap , once we actually got through the rough terrain , went very rapidly , all the way up to Objective Peach , which is the next bridge crossing site over the Euphrates river.

Many fish species , such as salmon , depend on steady flows to flush them down river early in their life and guide them upstream years later to spawn. Slow reservoir pools disorient migrating fish and significantly increase the duration of their migration. These impacts can , at times , be mitigated by technological and operational enhancements to the hydro project - e.g. , minimum flow turbines , re-regulating weirs , and pulsed operation at peak efficiency. Impoundments can be managed to create new upstream and downstream habitat for fish species and to provide minimum discharges and improved habitat during seasonal or annual drought conditions . </slow.v.595><slow.v.596>Karyn was beside Shinta 's bed now , her heart and adrenaline having slowed down now that Shinta had regained consciousness.

How then does it seem to speed up with nothing pushing on it ? And about using light for energy and other purposes : I 've always been told that light has infinite energy , which is why nothing can go as fast as it.

Corn emerged and looked good as the planting neared completion. Soybeans and sorghum planting were also in progress. Pastures greened up; Bermuda grass was growing , though slowly due to cool days.

Above the line you can attach Aberdeen hooks with a minnow , crappie jig , or even small flies and hair jigs about 24 inches from the weight and 24 inches apart and still get to where the fish are and the sensitivity is far greater due to the fact that the weight is at the bottom of the line and when a fish touches your hook , there is nothing between you and him. This is IMPERTIVE due to the fact that when the water is cold , fish metabolism slows down and they just don ' t move that fast. I guarantee you that if you master what I have said in this report and previous reports over the last 8 years reference the winter pattern , you will have some of the best crappie , walleye and white bass fishing of the year . </slow.v.603><slow.v.604>Folsom lake has started up finaly with the North Fork.

After 38.5Km Gobena moved took the lead at 38.5 kilometres , and the gap between her and Barros gradually widened. With an eight-second lead at 40 kilometres , the Ethiopian slowed considerably in the waning stages but still took a convincing victory . </slow.v.645><slow.v.646>The basis of soil is decaying plant and animal matter bound together with rock particles. As plant life colonised the earth it crept up slopes holding soil particles in place where there had once been bare rock. As the soil became richer and deeper and plants and animals became larger and more diverse , increasing amounts of organic matter were added to the soils. Vegetation holds the soil in place , slowing down the natural process of erosion caused by wind and rain. Fertile soils are rich because for millennia they supported plant communities and accumulated organic matter . </slow.v.646><slow.v.647>TALLADEGA , Ala. - NASCAR slowed speeds Tuesday on the Car of Tomorrow at Talladega Superspeedway , where only half the field topped 190 mph on the second day of the test session . </slow.v.647><slow.v.648>Galileo passed about 100 km closer to Io than planned. This meant that the gravity assist from Io slowed Galileo 's speed more than was planned , putting the spacecraft into a shorter orbit around Jupiter than expected. Rather than use up over 10 kilograms of propellant to " fix " this , Galileo 's navigators realized that they could just let the spacecraft continue on its way ... where it would arrive at its first encounter with the moon Ganymede a week early ! Amazingly , going slower means we 're getting where we 're going sooner ! ( The Ganymede flyby was originally scheduled to occur on July 4 , 1996. Since it takes a little over one week for Ganymede to go around its orbit , it would be in about the same location one week earlier on June 27. Since Galileo 's orbit was one week shorter than originally planned , the first satellite encounter could simply be moved earlier by one week ) </slow.v.648><slow.v.649>Spanish are still the staple for inshore trollers , with keeper fish taking small spoons from Sandbridge to False Cape. Spanish mackerel are also blitzing the tide rips around all four artificial islands of the Bridge Tunnel , along with lots of bluefish up to3 pounds. King action has slowed to a halt with the dirty water , but is expected to pick up again soon. Before the blow , scattered king mackerel were caught slow trolling live bait off False Cape and over inshore wrecks and structures . </slow.v.649><slow.v.650>WEST CENTRAL : Cold , wet conditions continued. From 2 inches to 6 inches of snow added to the already very wet conditions in many parts of the region. Soil moisture was very good. Producers still could not do field work because of the wet conditions. Winter wheat was in good shape , but growth was slowed due to cold , damp conditions. However , the outlook remained very good. Rangeland and pasture conditions continued to impove. Stock tanks and ponds were catching runoff. Livestock were in fair to very good condition. Livestock producers continued supplemental feeding due to cold , wet weather conditions . </slow.v.650><slow.v.651>Against that backdrop , the economy 's growth is probably slowing in the current January-to-March quarter. Forecasters at the National Association for Business Economics predict the economy will expand at a 3 percent pace in the first quarter of this year. The next two quarters should log similar growth , they predict . </slow.v.651><slow.v.652>There 's a lot of debate going on about global warming. Some scientists say it 's nature 's way -- something that has happened in the past and will likely occur again. Other say global warming is occuring faster because of human beings and that human beings can stop it , or slow it , if they so choose . </slow.v.652><slow.v.653>PATRICK NEVE : Original was 04 : 07. This starts off with a bad edit. The You Are What You Is version was segued , and this sounds like it was taken from those reels. Perhaps there was no source tape. In any event , it 's an abrupt start. Overall low end is enhanced , but mainly from being slowed down. Last note fades to a long reverb ( " scales all over their bodeee-ee-e " ) . </slow.v.653><slow.v.654>So if we see familiar things as if for the first time , this should slow down time for us. The years we have left to live will seem like they take longer to pass . </slow.v.654><slow.v.655>Most drivers hit their brakes as soon as they see any brake lights go on in front of them. While most respondents infer that the lead car is braking as a result of the traffic light change , a few look to see if there is any other reason the lead car is stopping suddenly ( such as the presence of pedestrians or a hazard on the road ) . Many drivers try to anticipate the situation using a variety of methods ( see next section ) and some leave more stopping distance in front of them. Drivers often do this as a result of critical situations they have experienced when they did not leave enough room to stop. Finally , some drivers slow down as they approach an intersection. These are the more cautious drivers and a large number are older drivers who have learned from experience not to rush . </slow.v.655><slow.v.656>Makes sense. As did the best writing I found on this subject , Steve Taylor 's " The Speed of Life : Why Time Seems to Speed Up and How to Slow it Down. " </slow.v.656><slow.v.657>Many people who were familiar with rumble strips at the end of freeways , at tollbooths , and on the side of highways thought that they were better for those purposes than for intersections because they are infrequently encountered there. Some were concerned because they make people slow down which they should not always do in intersections , especially when the light is green. A few mentioned that this approach might slow down traffic or make it more congested. A couple thought it was implicitly telling drivers that it is acceptable to be distracted . </slow.v.657><slow.v.658>Chiclayo - Pascamayo. The ride out of Chiclayo was cloudy and the wind was not too strong , in the morning. As the day went on the wind had picked up. We rode through dunes and rock and then through an oasis created by irrigation. Numerous fields of corn , sugar cane and peppers fill the desert in the irrigated areas. By the time we arrived at Pascamayo we were very tired , the head wind slowed us to a mere 12 km per hour ( 7 mph ) . We stayed at the Hostel Pan Americano , l large bed , shower with cold water and cable TV all for 20 soles/ night. One of our best values yet. As we were carrying the bags up the stair and older women said she wanted to help so she grabbed Tim 's two rear bags and carried them effortlessly up to the room. I have never seen a local man do this ( Tim can ) never less an older women who was stronger than an ox. I think I know who does all the work around here . </slow.v.658><slow.v.659>Then , at 4 : 50pm , happened one of the most tragic accidents in Le Mans history. At Maison Blanche Ren Kippeurt lost control of his Bugatti Type 44 and was ejected from his car. His body was lying in the middle of the road. Then came seven cars who had to avoid both Kippeurt 's body and the wreck of the Bug ' , which was situated 100 metres from the driver. Roth ( BMW ) was the first to brake. As a result he went off of the road and somersaulted. Then , Fairfield ( Frazer Nash ) wanted to avoid Roth 's car and crashed his car against Kippeurt 's car. Then it was the turn of Tr moulet to crash his Delahaye against Fairfield 's car. He was followed by Raph who did the same. The tragedy went on with Forestier 's Riley. The latter jumped out of his car and ran back to signal to other drivers who were coming that they had to slow down. The consequences of this multiple accident were horrific : Kippeurt was dead , Raph was seriously injured and Fairfield was severely injured and died two days later . </slow.v.659><slow.v.660>The most important natural obstacles in the path of the attack were the Seille and the Nied Fran aise Rivers. Normally , neither of these rivers would have presented much of a bridging problem , but in November both were swollen considerably by the fall rains. The underlying clay common to this country had caused the 7th Armored Division much trouble in September and might be expected to slow down the infantry and their supply vehicles. The numerous wooded areas scattered through the zone of advance were generally small in size. A few of the outer-ring Metz forts were located on and near the division objective , but the main works would not be encountered until the 5th Division turned inward to advance on the city itself . </slow.v.660><slow.v.661>EAST : Thunderstorms brought wind and as much as 4 inches of rain. Some producers had to move cattle to higher ground because of flooding. Winter forages and clovers were really growing well , thanks to the rain and warmer temperatures. Perennial grasses were greening up. Supplemental feeding of cattle slowed but continued. Planting of pasture grasses is under way , but producers are concerned about rising costs of fertilizer . </slow.v.661><slow.v.662>The power reactor at Chernobyl , near Kiev , capital of the Ukraine , had a different design -- like Fermi 's original reactor , it used a pile of carbon ( graphite ) to slow down neutrons , with pipes inside it carrying the fuel rods , control rods and cooling water. It was a big reactor , and was not enclosed in a containment building . </slow.v.662><slow.v.663>3.Take a look at your to-do list. Cross 2 things off. Go on , do it. Then , see if anyone notices that you didn ' t do them this year. It ' s a hard lesson to swallow for those of us who pay attention to detail , or have a perfectionist streak. But if you ' re serious about slowing down your Christmas , you have to prioritize. Frankly , some errands are just more important than others. ( Having planned a wedding not too long ago , there are a million details that couples can exhaust themselves getting right. But when we decided not to send save-the-date postcards , or make a seating chart , no one even noticed . ) </slow.v.663><slow.v.664>There are various road conditions where to be safe , you must slow down. For example , you must slow down before a sharp curve , when the roadway is slippery and when there is standing water on the road . </slow.v.664><slow.v.665>Heavy , blowing snow slowed down the course and made the top two jumps , with their stair-step ledges , particularly difficult for the skiers. They had trouble gaining speed toward the bottom of the mountain , as well.

He was pretty sharp for this race. Down the backside , when he ( Garrett Gomez ) finally let him run a little bit , I thought , ' Well , I ' m glad he ' s letting him do that , ' because this horse , his stride is so long , that ' s nothing for him. You can put him on the lead , and he would have kept going , but I think he did a great job of changing his tactics halfway down ( the backstretch ) . But good horses can adapt to any situation. That ' s why he ' s a good horse. That ' s why he ' s won four in a row now. He ' s learning how to run , but the thing is , he ' s very competitive , and I felt really good today about him. I knew he was going to win the Santa Anita Derby , and once he came out of the gate clean , I felt real good about him. I ' ll just keep him happy and healthy ( en route to the Kentucky Derby on May 2 ) . He ' s ready to go. </slow.v.666><slow.v.667> Do n't speed up when a truck is passing you.

I wanted to high five the guy for making it through without hitting anything . </slow.v.669><slow.v.670>A cooling of the North Atlantic region would slow the melting process , curtail the influx of fresh water to the North Atlantic. The Conveyor would again begin to circulate ocean waters. But global warming and an accelerated water cycle would continue to bring fresh water to high latitudes possibly enough to maintain a cap on the Conveyor even if the Arctic melting ceased. Monitoring Earth ' s hydrological cycle is critical , the scientists said , because of its potential near-term impacts on Earth ' s climate . </slow.v.670><slow.v.671>The neat thing about this game is it has a unique learning curve , you really do need to be a hard core racing fan or it will take practice to learn how to race these cars. Don ' t let that scare you off though the game helps you out in lots of ways. First off you can choose to have racing lines on. Doing this you will notice a solid green line on the track. As you are racing this line will show you where your car should be on the track to enter and exit corners better and put you in a better position to execute the race flawlessly. What is also great about the race line , is it will turn yellow in spots you need to slow down or be cautious and turn red when you need to be on the brake hard , but don ' t think it means tap your brake or drop a gear or two , when it ' s red it means BRAKE. This feature can be turned off as well. Not only that but you can select to have auto braking on. This feature helps you learn to time brakes better by doing it for you . </slow.v.671><slow.v.672>Bristol , TN -- ( Sports Network ) - Jeff Burton was sitting in second place when Denny Hamlin suddenly slowed and Burton took advantage to capture Sunday 's Food City 500 at the famed Bristol Motor Speedway.

In retrospect , however , we see that the rise of N fertilizer has been slowing since the 1960s , first in developed nations that adopted fertilizers earlier , and later over the whole world. Instead of an exponential curve , the world rise now seems a logistic one that leveled a decade ago , to be followed perhaps by another adumbrated by the recent 1 2 annual rise in the U.S . </slow.v.674><slow.v.675>At a few points in the demo , time will slow down and you 'll be sent into a kind of face-off mode. You use the right analog stick to aim at the enemy and the left analog stick to dodge his slowed-down bullets. This allows you to masterfully kill a bunch of enemies who have the drop on you , and it 's another way the developers keep the cinematic Hong Kong feel of John Woo without giving up interactivity. Since you control where to shoot and how to dodge , you can try many different things in each showdown . </slow.v.675><slow.v.676>The majority of the race saw the 43-car field racing single file , as NASCAR announced an hour before the race that bump drafting in the turns would not be tolerated. Teams also received smaller restrictor plates for the weekend to help slow down the cars and prevent them from going airborne after contact the way they did at Talladega earlier this season . </slow.v.676><slow.v.677> When possible , take potential hazards one at a time. For example , if you are overtaking a bicycle and an oncoming vehicle is approaching , slow down and let the vehicle pass first so that you can give extra room to the bicycle . </slow.v.677><slow.v.678>The radio signals from the GPS satellites pass through Earth 's atmosphere on their way to the GPS receiver. The radio waves are slowed slightly depending on the amount of air that they pass through , and the most variable part of the delay is due to water vapour in the atmosphere. This slowing of the radio signal can be measured as part of the analysis of the GPS data. In turn this lets us estimate the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere above the GPS receiver . </slow.v.678><slow.v.679>Behnken is recharging the oxygen supply in his spacesuit.

Fertilizing of winter pastures continued , but was slow due to wet field conditions. Preparations for pasture planting slowed , but winter pasture made fair progress. Calving season continued. Livestock feed was supplemented with protein. Calf prices were still good in spite of higher feed costs. Livestock market prices remained steady to lower than usual. Warmer weather helped pastures and winter forages. Some fertilizer trucks are starting to put out spring application on ryegrass , but it is not producing well at this point . </slow.v.684><slow.v.685>After the gelato , I found a Salumeria still open.

When water is slowed , pollutants and sediments drop out of suspension. Wetland organisms intercept nutrients and pollutants , trapping them in wetland plants or substrates. Although too many pollutants can damage them , wetland plants also help to circulate and reuse nitrogen , phosphorus , and other essential nutrients. Many local governments have used this phenomenon to their advantage , constructing wetlands to filter treated wastewater and reducing the overall cost of treatment operations . </slow.v.704><slow.v.705>Although there were soon dozens of helpers , ambulances and recovery vehicles on the track the race was not stopped , at least not by the race organizers.

Gorbachev came to power in 1985 , well before the decline in oil production , with a clear program of reform , and there was a high level of support within the soviet elite for such reforms ( evidenced by the fact that no resistance came until the 1991 coup ) . They felt that things were stuck and had to change; the Soviet economy was very dynamic from WWII but by the 1970s growth slowed down , there was a strong feeling of dis-satisfaction among the elite and intelligentsia . </slow.v.714><slow.v.715> NOAA " Parts of the Gulf Stream current are diverted southeast , forming the Canary Currents , which carry cooler waters to the Iberian peninsula and northwestern Africa. An ensuing current , known as the North Atlantic Drift , flows northwest and provides temperate , relatively warm waters to Western Europe. The Gulf Stream has an average speed of four miles per hour but slows down as it widens to the north. At the beginning of the Gulf Stream , the water temperature is 80 Fahrenheit; the temperature decreases as the current moves north.

In the last lap , he showed real sportsmanship and pulled over to let Hakkinen and Coulthard through. If he had seen that Gerhard Berger was coming as well , he possibly would have handed over the final podium position to the Austrian in his final race in Formula One. These four passed the checkered flag within two seconds , followed by Frentzen and Irvine who was not even 5 seconds behind. If Frentzen had not slowed down twice during the race , he could have fairly easily won . </slow.v.716><slow.v.717>In each case movements of people , ideas , and influences , while they may be slowed down by adverse events , are not easily undone or reversed.

Yes , down. One of the safety features is a governor. When this kicks in , the handlebar forces itself back , which slows me almost to a stop , after which it allows me to continue in another little burst downhill. I ca n't increase my speed even by leaning precariously forward against both common sense and the explicit warnings in the manual. Quite annoying , especially when rushing to an appointment . </slow.v.718><slow.v.719>However , each step closer to the still-empty bar seemed to deepen the disapproving look the bartender was directing my way. Clearly puzzled why I was rewarded with such an increasing scowl , I slowed down , coming to a grinding halt some feet away from the bar. Satisfied that he had got my full attention , he pointed with his left-hand thumb behind his 290 kilogram ( 640 pound ) body to a sign at the back of the bar , prominently positioned between several fancy bottles of various liquors , next to one of the large mirrors : </slow.v.719><slow.v.720>Middle-aged drivers were more likely to go through or slow down based on a quick decision characterized by taking in all of the factors.

This " hydroplaning " can cause complete loss of traction and steering control. Hydroplaning usually occurs at higher speeds , but it also can occur if your vehicle 's tires are tread worn or improperly inflated. When there is heavy rain , it is almost always wise to drive more slowly. If your vehicle begins losing traction , slow down even more. Good tires with deep tread help prevent hydroplaning . </slow.v.721><slow.v.722>" Both my wife and I wee slowed down in our voting because the layout of the presidential race confused us I could n't get over the feeling that I was looking at a botched ballot..

At the end of last year , business borrowing was growing at an annualised rate of 25 . Six months later it grew at a pace of just 4 .

Unlike " thermal fission " used in most nuclear reactors , where neutrons are first slowed down by multiple collisions , this process will produce a chain reaction only in relatively pure uranium-235 or plutonium. Fast fission makes atomic bombs possible; their fuel must be assembled very rapidly , to let the chain reaction produce many fission events before the explosive release of energy blows everything apart. " Fast " nuclear reactors using fast fission have also been built; they have some important advantages , but pose a technical challenge of rapid removal of great amounts of heat from a small volume . </slow.v.725><slow.v.726>Turn 11 is the last turn ( right-hander ) before coming back down the front straightaway to the start/finish line. Not to beat a dead horse , but Turn 11 is yet another example of " you got ta slow down to go fast " . Lots of passes will be made in Turn 11 as drivers enter the corner too hot. Get slowed down quickly , and get back to the gas hard , digging off the corner and building big speed headed to the line . </slow.v.726><slow.v.727>6 for rain tires , but as I went into Turn 1 , they were waving the debris flag. I slowed down quite a bit but when I came around the corner there were cars stopped on the track , cars spinning , it was a mess. I tried to miss everyone but hit a slick part of the track , slid and ended up clipping one of the stopped cars. This damaged the radiator , so we had to pit and the Doran crew did a tremendous job to get the job done in just five laps and get us back on track. " </slow.v.727><slow.v.728>With the gun going off I had plenty of people in front of me , most of who , I found out later , were running the half marathon. In the first few miles I was asking runners around me what pace they were shooting for. 2 : 45 , 2 : 50 were the kinds of numbers I was hearing. I tried to go slow , really , but my 1st mile split of 6 : 07 confirmed I was going way too fast. I slowed down and tried to get into some rhythm. I wanted to run strong , and I would have been happy just to break 3 hours ( my standard ' goal ' of any marathon nowadays ) so I tried to slow down. I hummed along for a while and at about mile 8 , I looked ahead and saw a big sign for the entrance to Churchill Downs , you know , where the Kentucky Derby is run the first Saturday of May. In we went , under the tunnel and onto the infield. That was pretty darn cool. Audio from previous horse races was piped in to motivate us ( I guess ) and we ran around for about a mile and then back under the track and out back onto the road . </slow.v.728><slow.v.729>The interstates slowed to a crawl as cars spun out. Off-ramps were blocked and some drivers unwisely stopped in the middle lanes of I-405 to chain up , officials said . </slow.v.729><slow.v.730>5. Slow down in rain and snow. Roads are most slippery when the wet stuff first starts to fall. Why ? There is an invisible film of oil that accumulates on dry roadways. When it gets wet , that slick substance rises to the surface and can turn the pavement into an asphalt slip and slide. It takes about 30 minutes of steady rain to wash the road clean. Too much water can also be a problem. When the tire ' s tread channels can not conduct all the water from between the rubber and the road , your car will tend to surf on top of the water instead of plow through it. This is called hydroplaning. Control rests where the rubber meets the road. If rainwater builds up between the tire and the asphalt , breaking that connection , slow down . </slow.v.730><slow.v.731>I will stop being a " Denier " when some one can tell me what the temperature is " supposed to be " .

They will be complemented by two planted grass belt , ten man-made oases and 4 , 000 grass farms. The restoration of degraded grasslands is critical to the creation of a healthy ecosystem in the region. This will slow down ecological degradation and will guide the area into sustainable development. The project will play a significant role in social and economic development in the surrounding area , northern China and eastern China.

As the aircraft neared 102 knots , the system again yelled at me. Noticeable back pressure was required to hold the 7X in an attitude nose-high enough to slow it to this speed , something I also believe would be difficult to ignore. We tried it again at full flaps and with the gear down. The airplane was still controllable down to 83 knots , at which I put it into a succession of 30-degree banks . </slow.v.736><slow.v.737>3 ) So what is a good location. Low turbulence - low drag site. Turbulence is caused by solid object , basically the wind begins to roll over and over along the ground where there are many houses ( simplified ) .

However , this effect wo n't be significant until a few days before arrival at Jupiter ( on December 7 , 1995 , and subsequently as the spacecraft draws near each encounter ) . Since Jupiter lies " behind " Galileo prior to Galileo " meeting up " with the giant planet ( if Galileo and Jupiter were on a racetrack , Galileo would have significant head start , though it 's doomed to lose the race ) , Jupiter 's gravitational influence will act to slow down the spacecraft relative to the Sun . </slow.v.740><slow.v.741>I think what we see is a combination from grass-roots golfers of perhaps not being pace of play aware. We all know about the people who put the trolley on the wrong side of the green and go over and back and mark their scorecard before the leave the green and so on. But also I think there ' s an element of copying this pre-shot routine and pacing around the greens to line up putts and so on that spreads downwards into the game. And it ' s certainly true that what used to be a morning occupation now feeds into lunchtime quite a bit. So it has slowed up . </slow.v.741><slow.v.742>Your weaknesses will slow you down , but your strengths can kill you. You know your weaknesses , and you tend to compensate. But your strengths cast shadows -- blind spots that create real vulnerability . </slow.v.742><slow.v.743>A more quantitative argument can also be advanced for those who need the details. Suppose that light is slowing down according to some exponential decay curve. An exponential decay curve is one of Mother Nature 's favorites. It describes radioactive decay and a host of other observations. If the speed of light were really slowing down , then an exponential decay curve would be a very reasonable curve to start our investigation with. Later , we will be able to draw some general conclusions which apply to almost any curve , including those favored by creationist Barry Setterfield . </slow.v.743><slow.v.744>So I slowed down. This really is the simplest key to enjoying life and its string of moments. Slow down and notice. Even just slowing my car down , I could feel my whole body relax. What was the hurry ?

Then I have gained the world in that moment . </slow.v.744><slow.v.745>As I suspected , the weather was appalling for photography it was changing between flat sunlight , wet snow , drizzling rain and dull fog in a mockery fashion , and the magic seemed to have left the mountain. To make things worse , I made the mistake of bringing too much gear with me , which slowed me down both physically and aesthetically. Generally , I am an advocate of the minimalist approach and do not take anything unless I am positive it is going to be crucial. This time around , however , I wanted to try out a new camera backpack and it turned out to be too big for my own good , as the extra space made me give in to the temptation of bringing a few extra items that I did not really need. The Yellow Mountain is anything but flat if you are not hiking downhill you are certainly climbing and carrying too much equipment is the last thing you want to do. So there I was , lugging too much stuff in uninspiring light , almost ready to accept that the photographic part of the trip was going to be a failure . </slow.v.745><slow.v.746>One of the most important facts to understand in helping the horse during gallop is that he loses the positive energy first when he is tiring. It is not any different than when people run , as you may have noticed in your life experience. If the horse becomes tired while running , his lack of positive energy shows first in his weakness while " folding up " , or better said , when putting his hind legs back under after the pushing function and full extension. In humans it shows in shorter strides; when tiring , we find it difficult to pick up our feet and set them sufficiently in front of us. For horses , it ' s failing to sufficiently pull the hind legs up and under hence loosing collection and lowering impulsion - energy output and the horse slows down . </slow.v.746><slow.v.747>Keep trying to control the airplane until it completely stops. If you are rolling and going to hit something , do everything you can to slow down as much as you can prior to impact. Impact energy is a square , not linear , function. You get a great deal of benefit for every knot you can slow the airplane down. That means when you blow a takeoff and run off the runway , stand on the brakes and pull the throttle to idle. I do n't know how many pilots I 've watched try to slow down an airplane while still carrying power. If you think of it , either pull the mixture control out or switch off the mags to get rid of any residual thrust . </slow.v.747><slow.v.748>I do n't think he is claiming evolution is stopping , merely slowing down. Evolution ca n't come to a halt unless there is a constant environment , in which case there is no need to adapt. I do believe it is possible that human evolution has slowed down , though. Many factors can cause this , but at the same time there are factors that can speed up evolution , such as our large brains ... </slow.v.748><slow.v.749>WEST CENTRAL : A warming trend followed very cold temperatures early in the reporting period. Scattered showers came to many areas. The cotton harvest was completed in most areas with average yields reported. Other field activity was slowed by the wet , cold weather. Winter wheat growth was off to a slow start but was expected pick up with warmer temperatures. Producers were making fertilizer and weed control decisions. The extreme cold took its toll on livestock and pastures , which forced beef producers to increase supplemental feeding of livestock. Some producers culled herds to save on feed. Stock water tank levels continued to drop . </slow.v.749><slow.v.750>Apart from a couple of short delays for red flag incident the team progressed well throughout the 4th and 5th hours with every driver completing their allotted laps in time and setting out for our final hour , Johannes and I were looking forward to putting in our 20 laps in good time. As we came round The Devil ' s Elbow and accelerated down the pit straight on lap 3 another red flag appeared for a Westfield that had put a rod through the side of the block further down the straight; a touch of the brakes caused an instant lock up on the oily track , as soon as I was off them and had straightened it was back on the brakes and another lock up to try and slow enough for Gerrard ' s.

There was also a sense of being totally , mind and body , engaged , of observing , making fine judgments and responding immediately with nuanced movements. There were certain actions , such as taking a wide bend , that seemed so graceful that , leaning into the curve , sensing the centrifugal shift of mass , aware of the quickening of the moment the world receded , time slowed right down so that I seemed to be moving in weightless slow-motion ' the still point of the turning world ' referred to in my first posting.

High-speed roadways generally have ramps to give you time to build-up your speed. Use the ramp to reach the speed of the other vehicles before you pull onto the road. Do not drive to the end of the ramp and stop or you will not have enough room to get up to the speed of traffic. Also , drivers behind you will not expect you to stop. If they are watching the traffic on the main road , you may be hit from the rear.

Pyongyang wanted to start the campaign in June but was not sure that preparations could be completed by that time. By the end of May , the armaments that had been promised by Stalin arrived and the plan of a full-scale civil war was ready.

Johnson was 4th fastest , followed by Mark Gibbs in the GIO GT-R. The Winfield team were struggling. Skaife was 1.2 seconds slower than pole which was good enough only for 8th of the grid.

He conceded his lap of 57.34s was about as good as a Nissan will do around here. </slow.v.781><slow.v.782>The continued melting of the ice where it was poorly insulated improved insulation. The negative feedback process that allowed melting ice to slow its own melting worked as follows : the ice was " dirty , " with embedded rocks ( how dirty is not known ) , and as the surface gradually sank lower at the thin spots because of melting , the rocks were released from their icy matrix and acuumulated. Thus , in time , the thin spots in the original insulation automatically repaired themselves , and the melting slowed considerably. The insulation was also augmented everywhere by wind-borne dust from the zone of newly exposed land next to the ice sheet margin ( which was not far away to begin with ) and by accumulating forest floor litter , humus , and soil . </slow.v.782><slow.v.783>Past success , however , does not guarantee a food-abundant world in the coming decades. Growth rates of yields have slowed during the period between 1987 and 2001 ( Fig. 1 ) . Moreover , the demographic pressures in the twenty-first century will be unprecedented. The world 's population will reach 8 billion by 2025. By 2020 , increasingly wealthy and urbanized consumers and the 2 billion new mouths will demand 40 more food5. Rosegrant et al. estimate that food and feed production must continue to rise annually by 1.2 to satisfy the demand of the world 's population by 2020 ( ref. 6 ) . </slow.v.783><slow.v.784>But the extra quantities of fresh water involved today and in the far future are of another magnitude. If we take the largest decline ( 1 , 500 km3/year ) in Arctic ice cover of the last decades together with the increase in precipitation over the Arctic ( 500 km3/year ) , then this is completely dwarfed by the 115 , 000-230 , 000 km3 in one year which is supposed to have slowed down ( not even stopped ) the THC. The quantity involved was larger than the amount of water that is refreezing every year in the Arctic , thus probably preventing ( to a certain extent ) the formation of cold saline water . </slow.v.784><slow.v.785>Look behind - Besides watching traffic ahead of you , you must check traffic behind you. You need to check more often when traffic is heavy. This is the only way you will know if someone is following too closely or coming up too fast and will give you time to do something about it.

Analyses of ice cores , deep-sea sediment cores , and other geologic evidence have clearly demonstrated the Conveyor has abruptly slowed down or halted many times in Earth 's history. That has caused the North Atlantic region to cool significantly and brought long-term drought conditions to other areas of the Northern Hemisphere over time spans as short as years to decades . </slow.v.787><slow.v.788>And so on any still-intact slope of Eastern Kentucky , we have two intricately living and interdependent natural communities : that of the forest and that of the topsoil beneath the forest. Between them , moreover , the forest and the soil are carrying on a transaction with water that , in its way , also is intricate and wonderful. The two communities , of course , can not live without rain , but the rain does not fall upon the forest as upon a pavement; it does not just splatter down. Its fall is slowed and gentled by the canopy of the forest , which thus protects the soil. The soil , in turn , acts as a sponge that absorbs the water , stores it , releases it slowly , and in the process filters and purifies it. The streams of the watershed if the human dwellers downstream meet their responsibility thus receive a flow of water that is continuous and clean . </slow.v.788><slow.v.789>The pipe ( shift + the backward slash ) will return the game to its regular speed if you 've slowed it down with the " \ " key . </slow.v.789><slow.v.790>I finished the first lap and headed out for the second lap with lots of time and in fact , was probably running a little faster on the second lap.

Slowdown effect : No bidders for 40 percent of road projects </slow.v.791><slow.v.792>Luca Baldisserri : Our race was conditioned in a very obvious way by the performance of the tyres. At the start , when it was still raining , we could not get them to the right operating temperature and we were too slow compared to our rivals. Then , all it took was for the track to dry a bit for the car to be pretty much transformed , as can be seen from Kimi 's lap times in the final stages of the race. We must put some more effort into understanding how to improve our performance in these conditions , which could reoccur in the final stage of the championship. Felipe drove a good race and was slowed by traffic at a few key moments , otherwise he could have finished further up the order. Kimi suffered even more than his team-mate with the deficiency in tyre performance , especially in the early stages and then , when he did have the possibility , he showed the potential at his disposal . </slow.v.792><slow.v.793>But it may also be that Romania has picked all the " low hanging fruit " in terms of economic reforms , and that growth will slow unless deeper changes are made.

The Greenhouse Effect can slow the loss of the infra-red radiation , thereby warming the atmosphere but not the oceans. However , evaporation accounts for more than half the heat loss. Evaporation produces clouds , and hence there is a feedback loop warming the oceans results in more evaporation , producing more clouds , which increases albedo , which cools the oceans. This is exactly what was observed during The Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment ( TOGA COARE ) that was set up to investigate the Pacific Warm Pool the warmest ocean water in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean. COARE also found that rainfall would cool the ocean surface , so increased evaporation producing rain is another feedback loop . </slow.v.794><slow.v.795>If your brake stops working before entering a curve , you should control the direction first try to apply the hand brake if the speed is below 30 km/h and then shift to lower gear quickly.

He was fastest in the first sector of the lap , but lost time in the last two sectors and qualified third , splitting the Ferraris with Schumacher just behind him.

Identification of genes that can combat abiotic stresses , such as short-term drought , should enable scientists to create varieties that can greatly improve yields in the favourable rain-fed areas. Agronomists foresee new types of plastics that can be used in a profitable and sustainable way for capturing soil moisture and irrigating crops more efficiently. Genetic and agronomic approaches to saving water may also be able to slow or halt the long-term trend of China 's falling sown area. Because many of the new marginal areas are in relatively poor regions of the country , the new technologies will have positive , indirect effects on efforts to alleviate poverty . </slow.v.811><slow.v.812>Green roofs are easily recognizable examples of an increasingly common tool used to slow stormwater runoff. Falling rainwater is captured within the vegetation , reducing the volume of stormwater runoff from the roof. The captured water can then be discharged or reused on site. Other types of designs , such as a blue roof design , can be used to achieve the same goal when a green roof is not a viable option. Blue roofs also help designers and engineers find a solution to a sustainable stormwater drainage design that does not drastically increase capital construction costs and maintenance requirements . </slow.v.812><slow.v.813>All of those fast times are a tribute to the crew members who worked so hard on the track all spring and between races this weekend.

In Nature magazine , the journal of scientific record , Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory geochemist Jean Lynch-Stieglitz presented evidence that the Gulf Stream " operated at about two-thirds its current rate during the height of the last ice age.

Making due allowances for the continual slowing down of the light , we can calculate that light beam Y has a lead in distance over light beam Z of 1.318767 light-years. Once again , when light beam Y reached Earth , when the velocity of light had become frozen at its present value , that distance translates into years.

The first round of pitstops was the chance for Schumacher to overtake without risking too much. Schumacher made quite a good pitstop and came out with no problems. After his stop he had a clear road in font of him so that he could put in a couple of fast laps. Then Villeneuve came in , needed a little more time and rejoined the track right in front of Schumacher. He crossed the track quite harsh , but he was not yet at full speed so that Schumacher could squeeze through. Irvine still was leading the race , but now in front of his team mate. He slowed down to enable Schumacher to get passed and started racing right in front of Villeneuve. Some might say he held up Villeneuve , but I do not think so : Villeneuve was not able to cope with Irvine 's speed in the following laps . </slow.v.844><slow.v.845>Friday practice showed Skaife was fastest , followed by Bowe , and Longhurst.

It ' s here that many wild varieties of today ' s crops were first cultivated; wheat , barley and rye all grow wild in the region. But it ' s still not clear why people suddenly started domesticating plants and animals at this time. We know that some groups had been living in the region from at least 23 , 000 years ago. These people used some wild varieties but it doesn ' t look like there was any earlier attempt to farm them. Something changed around 12 , 900 years ago. Perhaps the population had started to grow ? Perhaps cool conditions were an extra stimulus to cultivate wild plants and get better yields ? Perhaps it was a combination of these and other things ? Regardless , the result was that by 11 , 500 years ago , groups in the Near East were practising early farming. Slowly the newfangled technique started to get a foothold in other regions. Hunter-gathering became less popular.

Certainly , we can see pulsars at that distance easily enough. In our creationist model , due to the initial high velocity of light , the light now arriving from our pulsar ( light beam A ) took about 2149.7 years to reach Earth. At the time light beam A left the pulsar it was going 487.4686 times the speed of light. The next day ( 24 hours after light beam A left the pulsar ) light beam B leaves; it leaves at 487.4648 times the speed of light. As you can see , the velocity of light has already decayed a small amount. ( I shall reserve the expression " speed of light " for the true speed of light which is about 186 , 000 miles per second. ) Allowing for the continuing decay in velocity , we can calculate that light beam A is 1.336957 light-years ahead of light beam B. That lead distance is not going to change since both light beams will slow down together as the velocity of light decays . </slow.v.851><slow.v.852>The Beatles recorded Rain over two sessions.

A torrent of freshwater and icebergs flooded into the North Atlantic. It was the largest single pulse of freshwater over the past 100 , 000 years. The impact was virtually instantaneous. In the North Atlantic , ocean circulation slowed down , stopping warm tropical waters from getting north. Temperatures plummeted and stayed low for nearly 200 years. The most detailed records come from the Greenland ice cores and suggest that it became 6 C cooler over the ice sheet. Downwind , Europe also felt the crunch , with the main rain belt shifting south and temperatures dropping by nearly 2 C.

He even calculated that a star of the same density as the Sun , but two hundred and fifty times the size , would have this property. But although Laplace may not have realized it , the same idea had been put forward 16 years earlier by a Cambridge man , John Mitchell , in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Both Mitchell and Laplace thought of light as consisting of particles , rather like cannon balls , that could be slowed down by gravity , and made to fall back on the star. But a famous experiment , carried out by two Americans , Michelson and Morley in 1887 , showed that light always traveled at a speed of one hundred and eighty six thousand miles a second , no matter where it came from.

Another name for this layer is the ultra-low velocity zone ( ULVZ ) because seismic waves are strongly slowed within it.

Despite the clear countermeasure description that the camera would only take a picture of those entering the intersection while the light was red , this statement was not often believed. The concern was that it was possible to get a ticket when going through while the light was yellow. Another disadvantage was that many drivers from all groups believed that lights were timed to generate revenue rather than to improve safety or traffic flow. Even though the respondents were told that speed would also be clocked , many thought that they could get tickets when they were waiting to make left turns at unprotected intersections and the light changed to red , or when they were slowing down to make right turns on a red . </slow.v.887><slow.v.888> Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong has denied that the recent backtracks made by the PAP to slow the intake of foreigners was politically motivated. </slow.v.888><slow.v.889>The moment humans removed natural vegetation for agriculture soil erosion was accelerated , particularly on slopes.

Labyrinth is a variation on the theme of the opening track Last Smile Sunshine , though the tempo is slowed down considerably with singing replaced by narration. The track also has a lengthy instrumental section with the bass guitar taking over the brunt of the melody lines as the guitar is relegated to the creation of sound effects. Tower Of Information is the reflective track of the album with Lark accompanied by both female vocalists who create a series of beautiful vocal harmonies. The live version of this track is augmented by some delicate violin playing . </slow.v.909><slow.v.910>Some young male and middle-aged respondents noted how missing one light might make you miss the timing for several others.

The bumpy circuit is lined with trees and lamp-posts , and although measures are taken to protect drivers in the event of an accident this is still a unique event and unlike anything else the drivers have ever raced on. This year a chicane had been added between Dunlop and Furry Glen in an attempt to slow cars down.

Companies with Boston locations note a marked increase in local revenues , often citing it as their strongest location. Demand for temporary labor is outpacing permanent , which has flattened for all but two firms. Demand for high-end labor has increased the most , causing bill rates to rise. Indeed , both bill rates and pay rates are slightly higher for most companies , with one respondent reporting a 9 percent increase in bill rates from a year ago. On the supply side , firms cite a shortage of skilled labor , especially in legal , accounting , consultant , engineering , secretarial , and executive administrative positions. Respondents report stabilizing costs; while healthcare costs are still rising , the rate of increase has slowed . </slow.v.915><slow.v.916>A few moments later , Harry disappeared into the forest ahead of Snape and Lupin.

He could hear Snape and Lupin trudging along behind him. Snape was catching up with Harry , gaining a few feet every now and then. Lupin continued to drag along , the pain of his delayed transformation made him feel that if he stopped for a moment he 'd give up the ghost. He forced himself onward , keeping an eye on Snape 's back and being careful not to trip on the sharp rocks or protruding tree roots . </slow.v.916><slow.v.917>The keeper of the key turned up ten minutes later.

Sure enough , that signal arrives on Earth at 12 : 20 PM. At just this time , the rocket passes by the Earth , but some distance away , at 80 light speed. Using calculations , the Earthling determines that the rocket sees the Mars signal at 12 : 11 PM - earlier than Earth because the spaceship is moving so fast. But , because time slows down from the Earthling 's perspective , he records the arrival of the space ship just past the zeneth point above Mars to be at 12 : 25 PM . </slow.v.918><slow.v.919>The article focuses on the weather conditions in Georgia and its effects on crops and gardens , during the year 1946.

Evaluation 3 took place one week after the commissioning of the in-pavement flashing warning lights so many of the drivers observed were probably encountering the lights for the first time. When the lights flashed virtually all the drivers slowed down as they approached the crosswalk. Some then drove slowly over the crosswalk , even if a pedestrian was waiting to cross. Others stopped at the crosswalk and waited until the lights ceased flashing , even though there was no pedestrian present. Yet others stopped at the crosswalk , until the pedestrian had crossed. Some then continued to wait until the flashing stopped , while others drove over the crosswalk once the pedestrian had passed. Even a member of the Denville police department stopped and asked the evaluation team what the driver ' s correct response should be when the lights flashed . </slow.v.922><slow.v.923>There is no problem with global warming , Plimer says repeatedly.

So instantly Schumacher has 20-30 seconds lead. Williams made a mistake , so Renault called on the FOCA to see what could be done. The result : the Pace Car. Why else did the Pace car come out ? The track was not blocked ( Katayama spun off after the pace car , and was n't in a terribly dangerous position anyway ) . If the track was so trecherous due to the rain , how could both Schumacher and Hill be happy on slicks ? The pace car let everyone except Schumacher past , so it was n't out there to protect the rest of the field. It slowed Schumacher long enough for Hill to catch up , then the track was suddenly safe again. The only effect of the pace car in the end was to slow Schumacher down . </slow.v.931><slow.v.932>The policy in the handbooks should be this : When approaching a cyclist in a car from behind , unless you have an entire clear , empty lane in which to pass , slow down as you approach. If there is no room to pass , slow to the speed of the bicycle until there is room. If the lane is wide enough , you can pass the bicycle while traffic is coming the other way. Hug the yellow line and pass the cyclist at a speed not greater that 15 mph greater than his speed. If no one is coming from the other way , you can pass the cyclist somewhat faster by moving halfway into that lane. However , in all cases ( except when you are already moving slowly ) , reduce your speed to reduce the danger to the cyclist . </slow.v.932><slow.v.933>Although Hanna and the recent cold front stirred the waters into a muddy mess , the tremendous early fall fishing action should resume as the waters clear.

Look for cobia in schools on the surface in open water near the mouth of the bay and along the ocean front , where fish over 70-pounds were boated lately. Big fish are also cruising bridge pilings and circling inshore buoys. Flounder are still lining lower bay structures , drop-offs , and inlets.

Second , the slowing rate of change and even decline in the U.S. confirm that use can stagnate without the crises in the old Soviet Union. In the U.S. , the federal program that shrank harvested cropland about one-sixth in 1983 caused a notable dip. Another feature , a peak in 1994 , followed Midwestern floods. After the U.S. capacity to manufacture N fertilizers more than doubled from 1964 to 1981 , plant closures and little construction lowered capacity 15 by 1995.

More significantly , the change could be as large as that experienced during the deglaciation at the end of the last ice age , but more than 10 times as fast - an experiment on the climate system with risky consequences. Furthermore , because of the long delay in the response of the climate system to changes in radiative forcing , by the time all the evidence is in it may be too late to avoid significant danger. Given that there is considerable inertia in both society and the global climate system - the former to changes in cultural behaviour and in technological restructuring , the latter to changes in radiative forcing - early action is prudent. The scientific community has recommended precautionary action that will reduce the risks by slowing down the potential rate of climate change . </slow.v.966><slow.v.967>WEST CENTRAL : Soil moisture is adequate.

One meter per second is a very fast flow indeed in a stream; even a waterfall usually does not exceed 3 m/s. Over this speed , water separates into smaller droplets , and as the droplets decrease in size they are more easily slowed by the air.

These controls are cost-effective if implemented in the site-planning phase of new development projects. Examples of these controls at the municipal planning level include zoning ordinances , subdivision regulations , buffers , and setback requirements. Runoff control measures also include techniques for slowing down runoff. These measures include limiting impervious surfaces , directing flow over grass swales or other vegetated areas , storing runoff in ponds , and installing infiltration systems. An important consideration with these systems is to determine if they will function and who will manage them when installed.

The bird ' s body temperature was more than forty degrees below normal , no heartbeat could be detected , no moisture appeared on a cold mirror placed in front if its nostrils , and there was no response to light shined in its eyes. The results of these tests left little doubt that the bird actually was hibernating. An identifying band was placed on its leg , and each year for the next four years the same poor-will was found hibernating in its rocky niche. Since that discovery , several other reports of hibernating poor-wills have been confirmed. An interesting sidelight to this is that the name given to the poor-will by the Hopi Indians is Holchko , which means the sleeping one.

Livestock growers , although fully conscious of the erosion menace , are generally not convinced that their herds are responsible for erosion or that their removal will effect a cure ( Peterson , 1950 , p. 425 ) . In one study , isolated tracts of land near arroyo banks were fenced to keep livestock out to promote revegetation. The results varied widely. In some locations , the increase in vegetation stabilized the arroyo walls , whereas in others recovery was insignificant ( Peterson , 1950 , p. 426 ) . Other methods of erosion control involve tree planting along banks , the introduction of debris into the channel to slow the flow , and the construction of spreader dikes to catch silt.

Rather than undertake major reconstruction to install larger stormwater collection pipes at the lower end of the system where the flooding occurred , engineers relied on making efficient use of existing space. They discovered that if they slowed down the roof runoff entering the drainage system and temporarily stored the excess water on the roof itself , the existing collection pipes were able to run to capacity without overloading and flooding. Developers installed 71 Reg-U-Flo Vortex Valves from Hydro International in 3- to 4-foot wide channels along the perimeter of the roof to store the rainwater. By storing the rainwater at source ( on the roof ) , the mall was spared extensive reconstruction costs and , with the valves operating exactly as designed , saved further considerable costs in flood damage . </slow.v.1034><slow.v.1035>The Twelfth District economy expanded during the survey period of late July through late August , but the reports suggest that the momentum has slowed a bit.

Sales by retailers and service providers were uneven , with the reports suggesting modest growth on balance. Manufacturing activity expanded further , and agricultural producers saw solid sales gains and generally stable supply conditions. Housing market activity slowed further in most areas , and most contacts from this sector expect further sales declines in coming months due in part to more restrictive credit standards and higher interest rates for residential mortgages.

Below-normal temperatures , cloudy days , and wet conditions slowed small grain growth. Many pastures were extremely soggy. Fields began to dry somewhat but were still too wet for land preparation for spring planting. Soil moisture ranged from adequate to surplus. Cattle producers were trying to rebound from below-average conditions by providing extra energy supplements and additional hay. Winter grazing on small grains and winter pastures was very short with the recent cold weather and rain. Hay supplies were becoming short and prices were rising. Water supply problems arose with the freezing of ponds and water tanks. The pecan and cotton harvests were complete.

The comments here follow a bipartisan Senate committee vote Tuesday to end support for the 59-hundred troop U-S presence in Kosovo beyond July first of next year unless President Clinton or his successor gets congressional approval for an extension. Supporters of the Senate move say there should be no open-ended U-S commitment. But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said important work still needs to be done to win the peace in Kosovo and the Senate action is counterproductive.

Fast water can carry lots of sediment , but slow water has less energy so sediment tends to settle out. Wetlands slow water down , so sediments ( and nutrients that travel with sediment and water like nitrogen and phosphorus ) tend to be trapped in wetlands. The trapped sediment , and the plants that may grow on it , cause water to further slow down and spread out on the landscape so that wetlands may increase in size over time. Of course , addition of too much sediment at one time can be bad for wetlands because it may clog the system. This is a very important issue to the management and conservation of wetlands around the world . </slow.v.1064><slow.v.1065>After running for almost an hour they slowed to a steady walk.

As it so happened , by studying changes in the light levels , astronomers were able to calculate the half-lives of the cobalt-56 and cobalt-57 created in the aftermath of that supernova explosion. Far from exhibiting a slower decay rate , their decay rates matched the cobalt-56 and cobalt-57 decay rates measured in our laboratories.

In particular , they mentioned that getting a ticket made them more careful for a while , but that it did not take long before they returned to their old habits. Similarly , getting a ticket might simply encourage them to avoid intersections where they knew the police would be while they continued to go through lights at other intersections.

Instead he slowed down in one corner and Hakkinen behind him was surprised and braked. Not so Eddie Irvine. He knew that Schumacher will slow down the Finn at that special spot and was prepared to go round Hakkinen on the outside. He passed Schumacher as well and now was second behind Villeneuve. Not much later Irvine outbraked Villeneuve at the chicane and passed the Williams driver on the outside. This second overtaking manoeuver was much more risky , as Schumacher could not help Irvine and as Villeneuve normally would be able to keep Irvine behind him.

Dean is of course right about this , but he fails to mention that the quintessential democratic land distribution system adopted in so many sections of the Norte-American frontier also induced many episodes of unwise use and agricultural itinerancy. Williams ' Americans and their Forests and John Opie 's Nature 's Nation are just two of the more general accounts of US frontier or environmental history that record numerous and recurrent wasteful uses of the democratically distributed small holdings , and related human rootlessness. There seem to be , therefore , other factors besides land tenure polices that affect the potential for environmental destruction. One of them , already mentioned here , would be the perception of abundance of forested lands , prevalent for a long time in both Brazil and the US.

The researchers compared their results with similar measurements made at irregular intervals since 1957. According to their analysis , the deep , cold return leg of the circulation has weakened by 30 per cent ( New Scientist , 3 December 2005 , p 6 ) . If that has slowed , they reasoned , then the northward branch of warm water must have slowed too . </slow.v.1157><slow.v.1158>This is EXACTLY what I was thinking aobut when I saw the Gulf Stream story that has been at the top of Current today.

It is not explictly due to the cold , but rather the raw density of these states that enable them to slow light in such as fashion. The cold is merely the facilitator. Regions of deep space are 'cold ' because of the lack of radiant energy , and the lack of matter , as far as I understand. Neither of these would impact the speed of light , in any serious way. The constant , C , is only the speed of light in a vaccum , but space is 'close enough ' . </slow.v.1159><slow.v.1160>Freezing in place , Faith glanced up.

Even though the usage of pesticides and other chemical inputs has markedly increased , world grain production levels are down from their peak in the 1980's. The reasons behind this decrease are manifold , mostly having to do with decreasing productivity of conventional farming techniques. This decrease in productivity is due , in part , to the huge numbers of pests and weeds that have developed resistances to chemicals. In the nineties , grain yields increases have slowed down to barely .5 per year , which is less than one third of the rate of global population growth ( p.84 , State of the World 1996 ) . </slow.v.1161><slow.v.1162>Some drivers from all groups have been in rear-end collisions because they did not slow down soon enough while the lead vehicle slowed down abruptly at the intersection.

Some will go through the light rather than stopping too abruptly . </slow.v.1162><slow.v.1163>The backstretch at Watkins Glen is by far the fastest portion of the track. A lot of people think " hey , it 's a road course , so it 's slow speeds " . Well , going down the backstretch at The Glen you get up to around 180 MPH. Certainly not slow. Toward the end of the backstretch , in order to get the cars slowed down for the next turn , the track has a chicane , otherwise known as " the bus stop " . Like Turn 1 , drivers are under very heavy braking headed into the bus stop. Missing the bus stop will cost you many positions. The penalty for going straight through it ? You must come to a complete stop before continuing on.

Well it shouldn ' t. Just position yourself so you can hear yourself but not disturb the jammers. The jam can also be frustrating for the beginner. Some beginners will learn to play a tune at home and then can ' t play it in a jam. The reason is the beginner is listening to the jammers plus their own instrument. That is more data going into the brain than the single dulcimer at home. Also the beginner may have learned the tune a little slower than the jammers. Another thing , the person playing at home has the freedom to stop and start or even slow down during harder areas of the tune. Then they get in the jam and the jammers don ' t slow down . </slow.v.1171><slow.v.1172>1. Don ' t get boxed in. It ' s essential to actively create space around your vehicle. We ' ve all heard of the 2-second rule : The car in front of you passes an object , and it should take 2 seconds before you pass the same object. If not , you ' re following too close. I like 3 seconds , " says McGovern , who has 25 years experience teaching people how to be better drivers. The more distance between you and the driver in front of you , the more time you have to get your vehicle slowed down or to look for a way out if something goes horribly wrong. That extra second could mean the difference between getting to your destination alive , or not at all. " Also , adjust your position in traffic as necessary to avoid driving in another motorist ' s blind spot. In other words , try not to drive in the left or right rear corner of the vehicle to the side of you. If the guy to your left or right can ' t see you , he could hit you , " McGovern says.

[ 2 ] [ 8 ] At that time , The Beatles were enthused about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects. [ 9 ] These experiments were showcased in their influential seventh album , Revolver. Geoff Emerick , who was the engineer for both sessions , described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the track by recording the backing track " faster than normal. " After playing the tape normally , " the music had a radically different tonal quality. [ 10 ] A similar technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon 's lead vocal. It was recorded with the tape machine being slowed down , so making Lennon 's voice sound higher when played back at normal speed. [ 11 ] The last verse of " Rain " includes backwards vocals , which was one of the first uses of this technique on a record. [ 7 ] [ 12 ] The backwards vocals are Lennon singing the lyrics of the song : " When the sun shines , " " Rain , " and " If the rain comes , they run and hide their heads.

Flood waters and their sediment are rich in nutrients necessary for the survival of many organisms. Without the flux of these nutrients to the floodplain , many wetland plants and animals will not be able to survive. Because levees ( and dams ) tend to prevent sediment transport to river deltas , delta building can be slowed down and in a wetland area such as the Mississippi Delta , where the land is sinking ( subsiding ) , if no new sediment is building up the delta , then the delta wetlands will eventually be drowned and buried under deep water.

Alabama race fans got a treat in 1971 when Bobby Allison and Davey Allison , the father-and-son heroes of racing ' s Alabama gang won the track ' s 1971 events. David Pearson won the Winston 500 in three straight years beginning in 1972 , then Buddy Baker won three straight races in 1975 and 1976. Over the next decade , speeds continued to rise. Baker had been the first driver to ever top the 200 mph mark in March 1970 , but by the mid-1980s speeds were topping 210 mph. On April 30 , 1987 , Bill Elliott roared to the pole for the Winston 500 with a speed of 212.809 mph. In the race that weekend , however , Bobby Allison lost control of his car in the trioval and flew into the fence along the grandstands , tearing a huge swath away.

The ether was not really dragged in Lorentz 's account. His was a fixed , immobile ether. Rather the charges that made up the medium were excited by the light wave as it passed through. They absorbed energy from the light and re-emitted it. When the incident and re-emitted light were combined , the net effect was a slowing of the propagation of light that matched exactly the effect of Fresnel 's hypothesis. The ether was not dragged; it just looked like it was. The amount that light slowed in media in Fresnel 's hypothesis was no longer a supposition but a demonstrated result in electrodynamics.

On the following morning it passed through the 3d Battalion at Venafro and climbed along the steep slopes of Mount Santa Croce to Pozzilli. Enemy minefields and booby-trapped areas , small-arms and automatic fire slowed the battalion 's advance to the town. Then the 1st Battalion , 180th Infantry , followed by the 3d Battalion , moved across the river and into the olive groves above Venafro to attack over the high saddle toward Concacasale between Mount Corno and Mount Santa Croce. The 2d Battalion held its positions on the ridge northwest of Rocca Pipirozzi and maintained a road block with antitank guns and bazookas between Vallecupa and Ceppagna on the road through the mountains from Venafro to San Pietro. On this road to the east , the enemy was holding , with tanks , a counterblock , and the 2d Battalion was attempting to keep these tanks from escaping toward Ceppagna . </slow.v.1292><slow.v.1293>It was more than two years ago when Comcast subscribers began finding evidence that the broadband provider was blocking packets particularly those being sent through BitTorrent.

The tides of Jupiter acting on Io heat up the interior and keep it molten , much like the tide of the Earth on the Moon has slowed down its rotation through friction. This is thought to be the origin of Io 's intense volcanic activity. As the distance from Jupiter gets larger , the tidal force gets weaker. Hence the volcanic activity of the more distant moons gets progressively less intense . </slow.v.1295><slow.v.1296>Still , the victory stood , and the best that could be said for it was that he should 've won.

In Canada , where I lived for 12 years , courtesy toward pedestrians is so deeply ingrained in the public psyche that most drivers automatically slow down as soon as they spot someone who looks as though he might consider crossing the street at some point. As a pedestrian , I 've at times felt compelled to cross the street simply because a driver slowed down for my sake. As a driver , I 've been reprimanded on a driving test for not checking my rearview mirror to make sure a pedestrian I 'd just passed made it across the street safely . </slow.v.1297><slow.v.1298>As the enemy 's second offensive slowed , the harassment of his seaward flanks was stepped up , and the Cho Do raid was followed by activity in the east. At Wonsan , following vigorous efforts by enemy artillerists which had damaged a destroyer and bounced a shell off one of the turrets of the recently arrived New Jersey , the rocket ships were sent in for two night bombardments of known gun emplacements. Plunging fire of 7 , 700 rockets delivered by LSMR 409 and ISMR 412 on 23 and 25 May had impressive results : intelligence agents reported that the enemy was clearing the harbor area of personnel; for three weeks the batteries remained silent.

Little carbon exists in the soils of highly eroded land , but new plant growth stores carbon in roots , stems , and leaves. Complex soil ecologies involving bacteria and other organisms in the soil also accumulate carbon. The rate of carbon sequestration starts out slowly when the plants are young , accelerates as they grow larger , and then slows after the ecosystem matures. During land restoration , the rate could be extremely high , because current carbon levels in the soils are low and because a long growing season means that large volumes of biomass are produced annually . </slow.v.1301><slow.v.1302>The Chinese government has become increasingly active in land restoration during the past few years. This is because of the devastating effects of agricultural land loss with the possible loss of its ability to feed its own people , as well as the disastrous effects of floods and landslides. Last year , the national government established strict land-use controls in an effort to slow the loss of arable land to nonagricultural uses. The government also established ten ecological protection zones along a number of damaged rivers , including South China 's Pearl River. Activity in these zones is strictly regulated , and all actions destructive to the environment are prohibited. Population limits have been established for each area and the government simply resettles residents where allowed limits are exceeded . </slow.v.1302><slow.v.1303>I certainly do n't park myself in the right lane and force people to slow down.

After getting permission , he breaks the pump handle. The spread of cholera is slowed dramatically as a result. What had happened , according to Hunter ( 1976 ) is that shortly before the cholera epidemic the Lambeth Water Co. had moved above the tidal reaches of the Thames , making its water uncontaminated by London sewage , while the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. continued to supply unfiltered water to eastern areas of London , including Broad Street. By investigating all cholera deaths in one region of London , Snow documented the relationship between the disease and the source of drinking water and provided an early model of effective epidemiology . </slow.v.1320><slow.v.1321>Monday has been one of the coldest days of the winter so far. Temperatures started out in the mid teens around the City and single numbers in the normally colder spots to the north and west with wind chills near zero. Our cold air is due to a short-lived visit from the polar jet stream. After thunderstorms and highs near 60 Saturday the temperature dropped 30-35 degrees in 24 hours as a strong storm system intensified east of Long Island. The over 1 " of rain quickly turned to ice on the roads and power lines. The storm slowed down and that gave it time to wrap moisture around the backside into the cold air waiting. On top of the ice , snow developed Saturday night. In some cases the snow was heavy with gusty north winds and blizzard conditions into Sunday morning. As is the case with developing systems the heavy snow was banded. So the result is that some areas had a half a foot of snow , while others who escaped the bands picked up just an inch. The combination of thick ice , underneath snow made for dangerous driving conditions and power outages . </slow.v.1321><slow.v.1322>By using a clever design , one can actually build a reactor fueled by natural uranium. The trick is to form the fuel into rods , and put between them some material ( " moderator " ) which slows down neutrons but does not absorb them , e.g. pure carbon or " heavy water " containing the heavy isotope of hydrogen. Neutrons produced in a rod generally escape into the moderator , and by the time they hit another rod , they are moving very slowly : such slow neutrons are gobbled up much more avidly by U-235 than by U-238 , so that even in a rod containing only 0.7 U-235 , the U-235 atoms make most of the " catches.

As the water grew more shallow , the ship slowed down and streamed mine-cutting paravanes from her bows. Tennessee approached the island from the east , closing to a range from which she could open fire with her 5-inch secondary battery. Her two OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes were catapulted to observe fire; and , at 1610 , the battleship commenced firing from 7 , 000 yards. Though the island 's shoreline could be seen , the target area , antiaircraft gun sites on high ground , were shrouded in low-hanging clouds and were invisible from the ship.

" </slow.v.1357><slow.v.1358>To summarize the essence of Special Relativity , simply remember that to a slow moving or fixed observer , on a fast moving object ( think of some futuristic spacecraft ) time will appear ( to the slower observer ) to slow down ( clocks tick slower ) , three-dimensional objects will appear to shorten , and mass will increase whereas these metrics remain unchanged for anyone on or in the object. Various experiments have repeatedly proved the validity of Special Relativity. Relativistic effects are noted in objects moving at as slowly as 40 of the speed of light , and are dramatic above 70 as they rise exponentially. To quote from Ronald Clark 's book on Einstein ( op. cit. above ) , " Einstein had showed that time and space were not the inelastic things which they were thought to be , but were relative to the sum total of circumstances in which they were considered. Thus he changed the meaning attached to the word " reality " .

However , as you go faster , your tires will start to ride up on the water , like water skis. This is called " hydroplaning. " In a heavy rain , your tires can lose all traction with the road at about 50-mph. Bald or badly worn tires will lose traction at much lower speeds. The best way to keep from hydroplaning is to slow down in the rain or when the road is wet . </slow.v.1367><slow.v.1368>That was perhaps as significant an engagement as any during the early phases of the war.

It is important to remember that streams are dynamic , constantly changing. Periods of high and low water may be seasonal or daily depending on such factors as climate , nature of the watershed , and the need for electricity in Las Vegas.

Thus , we can slow down the decomposition rate of collected wood at least to the timescale of 1000 years ( most likely longer ) so that the release of this buried carbon pool is negligible compared to forest regrowth uptake in response to collection/cutting that occur on the timescales of decades.

I am not the sort of person to give in to this bullying , and I stay put and will let them run into me if I have to ( luckily , in the past , drivers trying to bully me out of the way have slowed down in the end and have moved in behind me ) . </slow.v.1424><slow.v.1425>Grassed swales are shallow , open channels constructed along roads or parking lots and planted with flood-tolerant and erosion-resistant plants. Grassed swales are designed to slow runoff and sometimes incorporate small check-dams , which are low enough to permit stormwater to continue to flow at its peak but encourage temporary ponding when volumes decrease. Ponding filters out pollutants before groundwater is absorbed . </slow.v.1425><slow.v.1426>Across the board , older drivers were inclined to approach intersections more slowly and operated under the assumption that the white car in front of them would stop. They continued to think this way , even when they were reminded that the white car was most definitely going to go through the light.

Fish in shallow lakes and concentrate on dense , shallow cover with slow-moving lures like jigs. Look for deep suspended bass on river channel drop-offs and submerged stumps. Focus on the base of deep drops and green weedlines. Fish slowly using a vertical presentation with jigs and spoons.

Expansion should be slowed by mutual gravitational attraction of the galaxies. You can define a " critical density , " which is just enough to slow the cosmic expansion to a halt at infinity. If the density of matter equaled the critical density , then the curvature of space would be just sufficient to make the geometry of the universe flat. If the density of matter is less than critical density , the universe expands forever open parabolic curvature no gravity. At a density greater than critical , the universe collapses back under the influence of gravity circular geometry closed universe. There are problems with the classical decelerating universe , but 21st century cosmology has found solutions to these by postulating the theory of inflation , or expanding faster than the speed of light. New calculations show that far from decelerating , the universe is actually ACCELERATING and things become more complicated by an order of magnitude . </slow.v.1445><slow.v.1446>About 2RE ahead of the magnetopause is a standing shock front , like the one formed ahead of a supersonic bullet or airplane.

Even if you enjoy a more restricted draw on your pipe a non-constricted flow in a small diameter airway will help in keeping the smoke a dry one. Expansion in the airway means the smoke slows , cools and the moisture in the smoke condenses and compression means the exact opposite. A good illustration of this principle is the Peterson system pipe. Petersons open up the airway purposely in the sump where the pressure lowers , smoke cools , condenses and the moisture collects. There is no need to have an unrestricted airway when a good deal of the moisture in the smoke has already been condensed out of it. A smooth , unrestricted airway also has the secondary affect that a pipe cleaner will pass easily from stem to tobacco chamber . </slow.v.1454><slow.v.1455>Roger , of Jetts Hardware , reports that the Spanish mackerel bite has slowed down some , possibly due to stirred up water from Tropical Storm Hanna.

And conversely , if Willie Parker can have some of the same kind of consistent success that he had in the first two games , our offense should be in fine position to mix in some play-action and other tough to defend wrinkles in the passing game. It should be noted that the Eagles have only surrendered 104 total rushing yards through the first two games , but of course , in their opener , the Rams were behind by so many so quickly , that the running game all but disappeared as an option. And against Dallas , why run if you 're Jason Garret , when your offense is n't being slowed down one iota in the passing game ? SInce this is not a fantasy draft , I 'm going with Parker here.

There were a number of steep rock faces that took a while to maneuver. Several times today ( going down Slide , up and down Cornell , and down Wittenberg ) I had to take my pack off and throw it up or down the rock face , so I could manage the climb/descent more safely.

Effective stormwater management will strive to maintain the natural patterns of runoff within the watershed and minimize the extent to which storm drains and constructed ditches replace natural drainage ways. For example , runoff from the lower portions of the watershed should be allowed to pass downstream without delay ( as long as the downstream floodway is capable of handling these flows ) , while runoff from the central and headwater sections of the watershed should be slowed or held back using natural features such as wetlands and floodplains to minimize peak flow rates . </slow.v.1495><slow.v.1496>Luca Baldisserri : " Our race was conditioned in a very obvious way by the performance of the tyres. At the start , when it was still raining , we could not get them to the right operating temperature and we were too slow compared to our rivals. Then , all it took was for the track to dry a bit for the car to be pretty much transformed , as can be seen from Kimi 's lap times in the final stages of the race. We must put some more effort into understanding how to improve our performance in these conditions , which could reoccur in the final stage of the championship. Felipe drove a good race and was slowed by traffic at a few key moments , otherwise he could have finished further up the order. Kimi suffered even more than his team-mate with the deficiency in tyre performance , especially in the early stages and then , when he did have the possibility , he showed the potential at his disposal.

The gap is fourteen seconds on lap 30 and the Finn is being shown an 'easy ' sign now. Apparently the first message was meant for both drivers , not just H kkinen and Coulthard slowed where H kkinen didn't. At lap 35 only the first three drivers are on the lead lap.

Molten lava that made up the Moon 's interior flowed with the tide , which generated a lot of friction between the solid interior and the solid crus of the moon ( much like the friction generated between the Earth and its oceans from the lunar tides ) . As a result the rotation of the Moon gradually slowed down until it came to a halt. So the Moon is now tidally locked to the Earth ( a.k.a. synchronously rotating; showing the same face to the Earth all the time ) . </slow.v.1505><slow.v.1506>The reason why light slows down passing through BEC is because the particles are superimposed , remember that a BEC occurs when a number of atoms/particles are at the same quantum state , i.e. indistinguishable from one another ( sort of ) even in the extreme cold of the inter galactic space ( -455 F ) matter is so low in density that light does not slow down measurably and even if the space had a temp of absolute zero , without a BEC mass light would just pass through unhindered. Even the thickest dust clouds that allow passage to photons do not even begin to compare with BEC in its ability to " hinder " photons. So , do not be worried , universe is neither trillions of years old nor stars are much closer. Also when light stops all you 'd see is a black void. If photons can not reach ( since they are not moving ) our measurement tools we can not see the light trapped. So it is impossible to stop light and use it indefinitely. Light needs to move , fast , to be of any use as light : ) </slow.v.1506><slow.v.1507>The Greens conducted many studies on the relationship among the mind , creativity , health , and healing. They found that as participants ' brain waves slowed down in alpha and theta states , they experience healing of physical disorders ( i.e. , high blood pressure ) and the expression of creativity. These results happened naturally as soon as the body and mind calmed down and were free of stress and active or worried thinking. The students participating in their studies were taught how to slow down their own brain waves to bring about body/mind relaxation. Once relaxed in alpha or theta consciousness , participants reported having more images , increased energy , improved concentration , and creative thinking , all of which helped them in writing papers and taking tests. They even noted an increase in positive thoughts , a sense of empowerment , and openness to the possibility for change and growth . </slow.v.1507><slow.v.1508>All boat crews have returned safely to both the Esperanza and Arctic Sunrise - frankly , no thanks to the whalers.

At the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve it 's how hard it is on the cars ' braking system. In just one lap in the Daytona Prototypes we slow down more than 160 km/h ( 100mph ) four times. Because those four brake zones also happen to lie on four consecutive corners we wear through the brakes even quicker by creating such a large heat cycle in such rapid succession . </slow.v.1509><slow.v.1510>I 'm not sure how many people made it , but it was super tough !

Along the way , river flow has increased from a trickle at Hartsfield airport to an average daily discharge at Bainbridge that ranges from 3 to 11 billion gallons per day. Although average discharge from the Flint River Basin is about 25 percent less than that from the Chattahoochee , its flow is an essential component of reservoir storage for Lake Seminole-the terminal point of the Flint River. The Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam was constructed in the 1950s to harness the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers for hydroelectric power and to facilitate barge traffic between the Gulf of Mexico and Bainbridge. Outflow from Lake Seminole forms the Apalachicola River that flows southerly and discharges into Apalachicola Bay. A dependable flow of high-quality water from this river-lake system is essential because it carries nutrients to Apalachicola Bay and supports a very productive estuary and lucrative seafood industry . </slow.v.1522><slow.v.1523>Had lots of traffic on narrow roads with no shoulder all day.

However , my own research and published literature shows that sea level fluctuates at decadal time scales. Therefore , although there was an increase in the rate of sea level rise around 1998 , I expected sea level rise to slow and reverse early in the 21st Century. The underlying long-term trend , however , was likely to decrease , and there were some tide gauge data to indicate that it had started to do so. In the 1980s , the New Zealand rate was 1.8 mm per year. By 1990 , it was 1.7 mm per year , and by 2001 it was 1.6 mm per year. These changes are small , and were not enough to prove that sea level rise was slowing. However , they clearly did not show that sea level rise was accelerating . </slow.v.1543><slow.v.1544>Without ABS - If you do not have ABS , you must use a different procedure to turn quickly.

It had no rocket engines for course corrections. The Probe needed to enter Jupiter 's atmosphere at an angle of 8.3 degrees to the horizontal.
