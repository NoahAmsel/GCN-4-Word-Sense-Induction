It allows them to transform a small portion of their CDBG funds into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects that can renew entire neighborhoods. Such public investment is often needed to inspire private economic activity , providing the initial resources or simply the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas.

In some jurisdictions police dogs are considered to be police officers in law so that any penalty that can be applied to the assault of a human police officer can also apply to an assault on a police dog.

In some instances , nations have pursued social goals rather than economic development.

Furthermore , law enforcement officers in many agencies may retire with a pension after 25 or 30 years of service , allowing them to pursue a second career while still in their 40s or 50s. Because of relatively attractive salaries and benefits , the number of qualified candidates exceeds the number of job openings in Federal law enforcement agencies and in most State police departments resulting in increased hiring standards and selectivity by employers. Competition should remain keen for higher paying jobs with State and Federal agencies and police departments in more affluent areas.

The path to victory for Republicans is paved with offering more compelling and innovative ideas that adhere to conservative philosophical thinking. Our ideas must always be rooted in the belief that individuals , not the government , make more rational and better decisions for themselves. Since our founding , Americans are instinctively distrustful of big government solutions that portend to solve all of society 's ills. Americans still believe in their own ability to address these matters. For Republicans to be successful we must , however , recognize that the days of anti-government and anti-regulation rhetoric are gone. Indeed , these sentiments should have never been guiding principles for the party. Conservative thinkers do believe that government serves an important role in guarantying economic and civil liberties. Individuals need a government that treats them equally , allows for access to unfettered information , and ensures a level playing field.

Second , China is extremely sensitive to international policies that " interfere " in sovereign decisions , because of sensitivities to perceived international interference in Taiwan , Tibet , and Xinjiang.

Some dogs with bacterial skin infections also develop excessive shedding , patchy hair loss and scaling. If the infection is left untreated , involvement of deeper parts of the skin is possible.

Nevertheless , these speeds are still likely to constitute dangerous or reckless driving as they are speeds that are excessive for the road conditions. On many occasions when police enter into a situation that might be characterised as a pursuit it is merely a chase at speed to catch up with and alert the suspect motorist that a traffic stop is required. It is only when the suspect motorist seeks to evade the traffic stop that a chase becomes a pursuit.

Some people have different portfolios that represent different goals , styles and strategies.

For instance , you may pursue an aggressive ( high-risk ) strategy for trading with a small portion of your portfolio and a relatively conservative ( capital preservation ) strategy for investing with the bulk of your portfolio. If a small percentage ( ~5-10 ) is earmarked for trading and the bulk ( ~90-95 ) for investing , the equity swings should be lower and the emotional strains less.

Because of relatively attractive salaries and benefits , the number of qualified candidates exceeds the number of job openings in Federal law enforcement agencies and in most State , local , and special police departmentsresulting in increased hiring standards and selectivity by employers. Competition is expected to remain keen for the higher paying jobs with State and Federal agencies and police departments in more affluent areas.

In formulating a strategy the ends , ways , and means are part of an integral whole and if one is discussing a strategy at the national ( grand ) level with a national level end , the ways and means would similarly refer to national level concepts and resources. That is ends , ways , and means must be consistent. Thus a National Security Strategy end could be supported by concepts based on all the instruments of power and the associated resources. For the military element of power , the National Military Strategy would identify appropriate ends for the military to be accomplished through national military concepts with national military resources. In a similar manner a Theater or Regional Commander in Chief ( CINC ) would have specific theater level objectives for which he would develop theater concepts and use resources allocated to his theater. In some cases these might include other than military instruments of power if those resources are available.

As the republican party is trying to regain the people 's faith in them , it seems their own followers are tarnishing their image more than their members have. The blow came in the words " I hope Obama fails. " We should all know this is just one opinion out of many , but the problem lies in the fact that most of the republican party did not vote for the stimulus bill. I do not agree that the party is trying to tear down their president , however , they are sticking to what their party stands for , even if the people and/or mainstream media does not agree with it. I think the party needs to stick to the one point they made when President Obama was elected , which is , to work with him . </pursue.v.435><pursue.v.436>Sometimes in the beginning of a squirrel-chasing dog ' s career , we notice its hackles raise and it might growl and then bark at the sight of a squirrel.

The early settlers to Australia brought out the Tenterfield Terrier as a working dog for vermin. The breed was widely used throughout England and Australia for ratting , rabbiting as well as fox hunting. Over the next hundred or so years , the breed became quite established in Australia as a working terrier and family companion. There was hardly a farm in Australia that didnt have at least one of these terriers.

In many cases , the city conducts research to determine ownership and contacts the owner of record with an offer to purchase the property at appraised value. The city uses a portion of its Block Grant funds to purchase these properties. The city does not use condemnation to take over ownership. The city then generally offers the property to non-profits or its housing authority to construct new housing or rehabilitate existing substandard housing. The city may move housing to a different site or trade properties to assemble land for key housing projects.

Police routinely perform urgent duty runs to attend scenes of crime and suspected crime , and conduct police chases to stop drivers who have breached traffic laws or who are suspected of having committed a criminal or traffic offence. Occasionally , however , drivers seek to evade police and refuse police directions to stop. In those circumstances police officers are faced with the decision to pursue the offender 's motor vehicle or to discontinue the chase. The police are in a dicey position. Members of the public expect them to chase and apprehend those people , but if they do that and an accident occurs , the community calls for a review of police directions relating to motor vehicle pursuits . </pursue.v.486><pursue.v.487>The Staysafe committee also found that New South Wales is lagging behind in the adoption of microprocessor technology for general policing and , in particular , the use of such technology for traffic policing. In other areas of modern policing the use of video recording technology has been shown to have great utility - for example , video recording interviews with persons suspected of committing crimes - while the use of microcomputers has led to enormous changes in the manner in which police intelligence and other operational information is assembled and analysed. The committee also recognised that an important issue to be addressed is the police ethos , or culture , in relation to police pursuits of motor vehicles. That is important because police officers who are confronted with the question of whether to pursue a vehicle must make a decision on the spot; they must take into account the attitude of the public , their peers and everyone connected with road safety. If , during a pursuit , an accident occurs and someone is hurt or killed the police officers are placed in an invidious position , so the ethos or culture of police pursuits is an important matter . </pursue.v.487><pursue.v.488>The Gestapo was allowed to pursue all of its tasks even disregarding the legal order and without being controlled by the courts , in order to observe and fight any " subversive endeavours " .

A prey driven dog will chase with a great deal of focus on the object it is pursuing and a definite goal of attaining access to its target. A chase driven dog will also chase but usually not with the same intensity or absolute drive to reach its target as the end goal. Many of you have done chase games with both types of dogs. The prey driven dog will drive as hard as it can until it reaches you and when it does you or your toy usually gets hit like a ton of bricks. The chase driven dog can be somewhat frustrating as it will chase you , but not with the drive or intense targeting behavior of the prey driven dog. This dog will often pursue the handler in chase games , but will run on by and not follow through to actually catch the handler. The chase driven dog usually does not exhibit the sudden increased burst of speed that a prey driven dog will when the handler increases their speed. Unfortunately , either tendency can lead to dog chasing and/or aggression ( more so in the prey driven dog ) . </pursue.v.494><pursue.v.495>The decision by a police officer about whether to pursue a motor vehicle that fails to heed signals to stop is made in the context of a perception by that officer that in most situations the community at large , the New South Wales Police Service and the police officer 's peers expect him or her to pursue the vehicle.

" Political purpose is stated in policy. Policy is the expression of the desired end state sought by the government. In its finest form it is clear articulation of guidance for the employment of the instruments of power towards the attainment of one or more end states. In practice it tends to be much vaguer. Nonetheless policy dominates strategy by its articulation of the end state and its guidance. The analysis of the end state and guidance yields objectives leading to the desired end state. Objectives provide purpose , focus , and justification for the actions embodied in a strategy. National strategy is concerned with a hierarchy of objectives that is determined by the political purpose of the state. Policy insures that strategy pursues appropriate aims . </pursue.v.539><pursue.v.540>Regarding dog bite liability legal needs , Hizer &amp;Schimmel has the experience and resources to effectively guide you through the legal process.

Such neighborhood resistance , and the potential for costly delays , makes many developers reluctant to pursue infill development opportunities. Neighborhood residents may be concerned about new development and increased density for a variety of reasons. Concerns about overloaded/overcrowded public facilities such as schools and parks , and increased traffic on residential streets are often raised at public hearings. Many residents are motivated by past bad experiences with new development , which failed to fit existing neighborhood patterns and character. New buildings which are out of scale with existing single family structures can cause particular alarm. Most of the strategies described in the last section which aim to make infill locations more attractive to potential residents , will also serve to make new infill development more acceptable to existing residents.

But , mothers , you must not be easily quieted , and cease your investigations. 14 You should not let the matter rest until you are fully satisfied. The health and souls of those you love are in peril , which makes this matter of the greatest importance. Determined watchfulness , and close inquiry , notwithstanding the attempts to evade and conceal , will generally reveal the true state of the case. Then should the mother faithfully present this subject to them in its true light , showing its degrading , downward tendency. Try to convince them that indulgence in this sin will destroy self-respect , and nobleness of character; will ruin health and morals , and its foul stain will blot from the soul true love for God , and the beauty of holiness.

Officers may work alone , but in large agencies they often patrol with a partner. While on patrol , officers attempt to become thoroughly familiar with their patrol area and remain alert for anything unusual. Suspicious circumstances and hazards to public safety are investigated or noted , and officers are dispatched to individual calls for assistance within their district. During their shift , they may identify , pursue , and arrest suspected criminals , resolve problems within the community , and enforce traffic laws . </pursue.v.724><pursue.v.725>So I am still seeking representation -- and I want to pursue a police misconduct case.

In the past , many of the students entering the IDE program were early career professionals in the public or private sectors in developing countries. In the past five years , however , approximately three-quarters of each class come directly to Yale from undergraduate schools and have little or no work experience. The remaining one-quarter of students have some graduate training and/or early career experience. While the majority of IDE students are from non-developed countries , students from the U.S. and other developed countries who have a strong interest in international and development economics have contributed to and benefited from the program. We encourage applications from all countries and from all post-baccalaureate backgrounds. Graduates of the program go in many directions; some opt to pursue further graduate education such as a Ph.D. or professional degree. Others return to jobs in their funding agencies , such as government ministries , planning agencies , and central banks.

If you pursue the things you believe in and have a passion for , I think everything else pretty much takes care of itself. Otherwise , you find yourself wishing your life away , advancing to the next thing , never quite appreciating the circumstances where you are and the enrichment you 're getting out of the experience . </pursue.v.732><pursue.v.733>Police and sheriff ' s patrol officers had median annual earnings of $ 45 , 210 in May 2004.

Median annual earnings were $ 44 , 750 in Federal Government , $ 48 , 980 in State government , and $ 45 , 010 in local government. The opportunity for public service through law enforcement work is attractive to many because the job is challenging and involves much personal responsibility. Furthermore , law enforcement officers in many agencies may retire with a pension after 25 or 30 years of service , allowing them to pursue a second career while still in their 40s or 50s. Because of relatively attractive salaries and benefits , the number of qualified candidates exceeds the number of job openings in federal , state and city police departments resulting in increased hiring standards and selectivity by employers . </pursue.v.733><pursue.v.734>I am currently engaged in two overlapping research projects.

The higher the paying jobs and the more jobs he can solicit the better he looks. How does he solicit ? He offers temporary tax breaks , perhaps reduced regulations and incentives like a new sewer system , water supply and/or any public utility amenity that will make the offer attractive.

Developers must expect a reasonable return on their investment if they are to pursue infill development. They must feel confident that sufficient market demand exists for their intended product. Because time is money , developers also must believe that they can complete a project on a reasonable schedule. A number of studies indicate that many infill sites can be developed without public assistance , especially with the opportunities presented by emerging trends. Even so , the smaller-scale projects , lower profit margins and greater uncertainty typical of infill situations may tend to be more attractive to smaller developers than larger well-established developers. Also , infill development in some locations and some types of infill housing will likely require government action or incentives. Although local governments can not , on their own , accomplish wide-spread infill development , they can often set the stage to enable infill development by the private sector.

If you can ' t maintain customer benefit parity , then your low cost strategy is doomed. I would argue that maintaining customer benefit parity with competitors and keeping a significantly lower costs than competitors is extremely difficult due to the difficult trade-offs between features and costs that will inevitably arise. A product manager is in the perfect position to make these important trade-offs and must clearly understand customer ' s needs in order to do so . </pursue.v.790><pursue.v.791>Police said two masked men burst into the Bank of America branch on Moody Street in Waltham around noontime yesterday.

Officers may work alone , but , in large agencies , they often patrol with a partner. While on patrol , officers attempt to become thoroughly familiar with their patrol area and remain alert for anything unusual. Suspicious circumstances and hazards to public safety are investigated or noted , and officers are dispatched to individual calls for assistance within their district. During their shift , they may identify , pursue , and arrest suspected criminals; resolve problems within the community; and enforce traffic laws . </pursue.v.792><pursue.v.793>The opportunity for public service through law enforcement work is attractive to many because the job is challenging and involves much personal responsibility. Furthermore , law enforcement officers in many agencies may retire with a pension after 25 or 30 years of service , allowing them to pursue a second career while still in their 40s or 50s. Because of relatively attractive salaries and benefits , the number of qualified candidates exceeds the number of job openings in Federal law enforcement agencies and in most State police departmentsresulting in increased hiring standards and selectivity by employers. Competition should remain keen for higher paying jobs with State and Federal agencies and police departments in more affluent areas. Opportunities will be better in local and special police departments , especially in departments that offer relatively low salaries , or in urban communities where the crime rate is relatively high.

When customer preferences moved to wide-legged jeans and cargo pants , Nike 's market share slipped. Competitors such as Adidas offered less expensive shoes and undercut Nike 's price. Nike 's stock price dropped in 1998 to half its 1997 high. However , Nike reported a 70 percent increase in earnings for the first quarter of 1999 and saw a significant rebound in its stock price. Nike achieved the turn-around by cutting costs and developing new , distinctive products. Nike reduced costs by cutting some of its endorsements. Company research suggested the endorsement by the Italian soccer team , for example , was not achieving the desired results. Michael Jordan and a few other " big name " endorsers were retained while others , such as the Italian soccer team , were eliminated , resulting in savings estimated at over $ 100 million. Firing 7 percent of its 22 , 000 employees allowed the company to lower costs by another $ 200 million , and inventory was reduced to save additional money. While cutting costs , the firm also introduced new products designed to differentiate Nike 's products from those of the competition . </pursue.v.798><pursue.v.799>Despite several military setbacks , the Dog Soldiers continued to clash openly with Cheyenne peace advocates. By 1869 , the most influential proponent of compromise , a Southern Cheyenne chief named Little Robe , felt that the militant Dog Soldiers were detrimental to the welfare of the Cheyenne people. He banished them from his camp. Little Robe was not a coward , but as a civil leader he felt it was his duty to pursue peace and preserve lives. He , like most peace chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne , was a realist and saw the futility in resisting the westward movement of settlers. He believed that the future of the Cheyenne rested in their ability to coexist peacefully in the same country with citizens of the United States. In 1874 , during the Red River War , the Dog Soldiers quarreled with Little Robe once again. When the chief wanted to move his camp to the safe confines of the Darlington ( Cheyenne-Arapaho ) Indian Agency in [ Oklahoma ] Indian Territory , the Dog Soldiers voiced their opposition to this decision and shot Little Robe 's horses . </pursue.v.799><pursue.v.800>In the past , strategic analysis had to wait for actual results and would often take years : A new administration might pursue a strategy without appreciating its consequences , making corrections later sometimes too late.

Negligence or lack of due care may take the form of harboring a dog with known violent tendencies , or mistreating the dog or failing to comply with leash laws and allowing the animal to run loose , for example. Most Counties have enacted Ordinances against allowing dogs to run loose , and these rules are " evidence " of negligence ( which the jury is also free to disregard ) .

With the collapse of Communism and an end to the counter force once represented by the Soviet Union , even the limited options once available to underdeveloped nations have been constricted. The leverage which growing international debt has given to the World Bank and the IMF has effectively shut down the possibility for any creative approaches to development.
