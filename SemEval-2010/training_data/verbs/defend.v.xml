Virginia Tech used a strong second half performance to claim an 81-67 win over St. John ' s to successfully defend their title in the 2008 Aeropostale Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden on Sunday evening . </defend.v.1><defend.v.2>Shortly thereafter , Justice Kennedy expressed skepticism about Dellinger ' s ultra-narrow reading of the right to arms : It had nothing to do with the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws , wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that ? Justice Kennedy then followed his question with the following statement : In my view , the Second Amendment supplemented the congressional militia powers in Article I by saying there ' s a general right to bear arms quite without reference to the militia either way. </defend.v.2><defend.v.3>For the right of defence to be meaningful , the accused must have the right to be present at trial ( see Chapter 21 , The right to be present at trial and appeal ) and to defend him or herself in person. An accused also has the right to be assisted in his or her defence by counsel. The right to be assisted by counsel includes the right to choose counsel or , in cases where the interests of justice require , to be assigned counsel , free of charge if necessary . </defend.v.3><defend.v.4>" The justice system must not only work on the side of people who do the right thing as good citizens , but also be seen to work on their side. The Government strongly supports the right of law abiding people to defend themselves , their families and their property with reasonable force. This law will help to make sure that that right is upheld and that the criminal justice system is firmly weighted in favour of the victim . </defend.v.4><defend.v.5>Both Jackson and Tatum imagine that the Supreme Court decision will , for better or worse , fundamentally alter the condition of black people in this country. This is also the view of the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action &amp;Integration , and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary ( BAMN ) , which is sponsoring a National Civil Rights March at the University of Michigan 's Ann Arbor campus on November 7. On April 1 , some 50 , 000 people turned out for a BAMN-organized rally in defense of affirmative action outside the Supreme Court in Washington , D.C. , determined to preserve what little access they have in this profoundly racist society to a decent education and a decent job. The turnout demonstrated the depth of opposition to the racist rollback of affirmative action and other programs even minimally redressing discrimination against black people and other minorities. But far from offering a perspective of independent social struggle , BAMN and other liberals seek to channel the youthful fighters for black rights who are turning out for these protests into the dead end of reliance on the Democratic Party , the Supreme Court and other institutions of racist capitalist rule . </defend.v.5><defend.v.6>Mr Chia resents comparisons to Nelson Mandela. He points out that Mr Mandela , who became South Africa ' s president , had belonged to a banned party , had mass following , was charged in court and given a life sentence. He got out of prison and became a free man straight away , he says. I should have been set free long , long ago. From the very beginning if they had found I had done anything wrong they should have charged me in court and offered me a chance to defend myself. </defend.v.6><defend.v.7>6. Use the if it can ' t defend itself , sue it tactic : Anyone that may create a forum of opinion and free-thought on the subject or make a thrust at objective assessment of the company ' s business model/pricing/ethics/etc must be squelched/bought off/discredited or altogether destroyed to prevent any dilution of the corporate dogma. ( NOTE : this is especially effective against those who no longer make financial gain from the company during a time-driven inactivity clause as they may easily fold under legal duress . ) </defend.v.7><defend.v.8>It would be naive to depend on the Supreme Court to defend the rights of poor people , women , people of color , dissenters of all kinds. Those rights only come alive when citizens organize , protest , demonstrate , strike , boycott , rebel , and violate the law in order to uphold justice . </defend.v.8><defend.v.9>Do you think that Memphis ' Joey Dorsey would be a good fit with the Warriors ? I think he can help defend and block some shots for them , but he is limited offensively. Do you think he will he be around when the Warriors pick in the 2nd round ? </defend.v.9><defend.v.10>According to Nazanin , the girls tried to escape , but the men overtook them , and at this point Nazanin stabbed one of the other men in the chest , which eventually killed him. According to the accounting of the court in the Etemaad newspaper , when the judge asked her why her father had not attended the hearing , she sobbed uncontrollably and yelled at the judge : " I did not want to kill him ! I am not at all a bad-doer. Mr. Judge , what do you want to do with me ? I am a girl child ! How many times do I have to say that I did this to defend myself and my niece ?

The traditional view is that the Attorney-General , as Chief Law Officer of the Crown , has a duty to defend the judiciary and to protect judicial independence. Williams appears to be the first advocate of the view that Australian Attorneys-General have a limited role in defending the judiciary. The question of whether it is the Attorney-General 's role to defend the High Court from criticism has sparked debate as to the appropriate role and functions of the modern day Attorney-General. Specifically , this debate has illuminated the inherent tension between the political and the legal duties of the office of Attorney-General . </defend.v.12><defend.v.13>Cunningham , 36 , finished third at the worlds twice and is looking to move up on the podium. So far this year , in addition to his second-place finish at Eagleman , Cunningham was runnerup at Ironman 70.3 events in Rhode Island and Muskoka , Canada. Last month in Texas , Cunningham successfully defended his Ironman 70.3 Longhorn title , winning in 3 : 48 : 55 . </defend.v.13><defend.v.14>These are words King Hezekiah of Judah spoke to the captains of war he had chosen to defend the nation against Sennacherib the King of Assyria.

Even though they were facing an army that vastly outnumbered themthe preceding verse ( 32 : 7 ) tells us the basis for Hezekiah 's bravery : </defend.v.14><defend.v.15>The world abounds with " little caesars , " civil potentates who act with arrogance and hubris as their misdeeds are uncovered and reported. Such is the case with the accidental governor of the State of New York , the pro-abortion , pro-perversity Catholic named David Paterson , who has just moments ago announced that he is not seeking this year 's Democratic Party gubernatorial nomination after a series of articles in The New York Times detailing how several members of the New York State Police have been accused of harassing and intimidating a woman who had been assaulted by one of Paterson 's most trusted aides , David Johnson , " a close confidant who rose from being a young intern to being Mr. Paterson ' s driver and scheduler and , later , to a wider role in Mr. Paterson ' s operation. " Fallen human nature is what it is. Each of us is inclined to sin. The more that one sins unrepentantly , however , including an unrepentant support for baby-killing and perversity under cover of the civil law , will be the more that one will seek to use arrogance and hubris to defend himself when trying to defend the indefensible. Our Lady of Fatima , pray for us . </defend.v.15><defend.v.16>Ibragimov 's victory gave the fighters from the former Soviet Union a full control of the heavyweight division , with Ukraine 's Vladimir Klitschko also holding the International Boxing Federation ( IBF ) belt. Klitschko will defend his title against American Lamon Brewster on July 7 in Cologne , Germany , Reuters reports . </defend.v.16><defend.v.17> Some people consider that our right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty must mean they do not need to defend themselves against criminal charges. The need to submit a defence of your actions in the face of criminal charges does not contradict your presumed innocence. Rather it is essential to a proper outcome of the case . </defend.v.17><defend.v.18>The Russian Giant Nikolai Valuev will defend his WBA Heavyweight Title against David Haye on November 7. It is a done deal , Kalle Sauerland confirmed. The contracts have been signed. The fight will fascinate boxing fans all over the world. Up-and-coming Haye has left his mark with a staggering record of 22-1 ( 21 KOs ) and confident statements. It is about time that someone teaches him a lesson , Sauerland added. I am sure Niko will be more than happy to do that. </defend.v.18><defend.v.19>" My goal every summer is to win the U.S. Open , " Roddick said in a statement.

The transfer factor molecules , in creating memory in the body defense cells of the past pathogens it has been exposed to , is integral to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the immune system . </defend.v.20><defend.v.21>These two paths of jurisprudence represent , as it were , the two lobes of the modern judicial brain. It is well known , of course , that they do not always communicate effectively , or even coherently , with one another. On the one hand , the Court wants to articulate and to defend certain individual rights against the pressure of political majorities; on the other hand , the Court wants to treat the right as something instrumentally necessary to social order. The former approach looks upon the right as something that transcends the political sphere , while the latter regards the right in the light of what would seem to be the very essence of the political : viz. , in terms of policy issues related to the common good . </defend.v.21><defend.v.22>The 20th century ended with a single surviving model of human progress , based on non-negotiable demands of human dignity , the rule of law , limits on the power of the state , respect for women and private property and free speech and equal justice and religious tolerance. America can not impose this vision -- yet we can support and reward governments that make the right choices for their own people. In our development aid , in our diplomatic efforts , in our international broadcasting , and in our educational assistance , the United States will promote moderation and tolerance and human rights. And we will defend the peace that makes all progress possible . </defend.v.22><defend.v.23>When asked about her fitness , Radcliffe told reporters on a conference call that she was Hopefully , good shape , and good enough shape to commit to running the race.

They were quite successful and were generally lauded for doing so. I do n't know of anyone that was actually shot during this. Some googling can problably sort that out . </defend.v.24><defend.v.25>" I am so proud of this team , " Maryland Coach Missy Meharg said. " We stayed away from the concept of defending a national championship all season. We established a way of working and we were fortunate to be here and get a win. " </defend.v.25><defend.v.26>I conclude that the policy by its wording confines the duty to defend to claims which potentially fall within the indemnity coverage of the policy. This conclusion is supported , in my view , by the decisions in which the question has been considered as well as by practical considerations arising from the relationship of the insurer to the insured and their respective obligations and interests . </defend.v.26><defend.v.27>My husband loves strangers. He can meet someone and two weeks later he believes he knows them well , they are the coolest person in the world , and he trusts them emphatically. It 's so bizarre. He will defend any stranger or recently acquainted person against me. If I say to my husband , " You do n't even know this person " , he calls me " negative " or " stuck up " . It is so pronounced in him - it has to be a Personality Disorder , but I just do n't know what type. Also , if someone he barely knows does something REALLY BAD and unforgivable to him ... .he will either forget it completely , or make excuses for the person 's actions. It is hard for him to trust those close to him and he is constantly suspicious of those close , and he cuts them no slack ! I think he could have " Histionic Personality disorder " , but I 'm not sure. Can someone help ? PLEASE HELP - TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ? ? ? ? ? </defend.v.27><defend.v.28>It is duty of the community and national authorities to create the procedural preconditions for legal assistance for suspects and accused. Providing substance to legal assistance , on the other hand , is the responsibility of the European Bars and the organisations of criminal defence lawyers themselves. [ 1 ] In view of European ( as well as global ) [ 2 ] developments , it is imperative that the profession , whose duty it is to defend the fundamental rights of suspects , accused and convicted persons , shows where it stands , how it sees its role and what facilities and guarantees it requires to practice their profession. Such considerations could be expressed in a Charter to contribute both at European and domestic level towards taking a stand against the erosion of legal protection . </defend.v.28><defend.v.29>" Aww , that 's ridiculous , " Howie says.

No vicious little vermin was going to get a break from my adherent defenses , especially a hungry mosquito.

" In other words , as I approach this subject , I want you to know that I do not have any reason to exalt or diminish the rapture doctrine. I do not represent a religious organization nor do I belong to one , so I do not have a position to defend or assert. The Bible says that we are to test " all things " ( 1 Thessalonians 5 : 21 ) to determine whether they are fact or fiction and this is a summary report of my investigation . </defend.v.40><defend.v.41>Last year Cilic won early-season tournaments in Zagreb and Chennai and then reached the fourth round of the Australian Open.

Two such mock scholars are Edwin Black , author of " The Transfer Agreement , " which deals with the 1933 Ha'avara ( Hebrew for transfer ) Nazi-Zionist trade agreement , and Gaylen Ross , director of " Killing Kasztner : The Jew Who Dealt With The Nazis. " As republished books do n't get reviews , Black had to announce , in the 9/23/09 Jerusalem Post , that he put out a new edition , while Ross is more fortunate , with the 10/24 New York Times giving her new documentary a favorable review. Now , Black hopes , a new generation of gullible Zionists will rush out and buy it , unaware of the across-the-political-spectrum critical disdain for his 1983 original , while Ross relies on the ignorance of present reviewers as to how serious critics dealt with previous attempts to defend Rezso Kasztner 's collaboration with Adolf Eichmann . </defend.v.78><defend.v.79>Title insurance is an exclusively American invention.

And since I am examining the viability of a standard argument for the right to bear arms , I can not assume that arms in fact decrease the risk of unjustifiable harm. For that is to argue that the right to bear arms is instrumental.

The crucial question is resolved when the first soldier is sent officially. I am not speaking of soldiers who wish to volunteer for service with the army of their choice; they are on their own , and I would allow them their full rights of participation as private individuals on that basis. What I am speaking of is the matter of our government forcing some of our citizens to participate in armed trespass. Once the first one has been sent , the second becomes all the more " necessary " to defend the first , the third to defend the second on without end and without any place to call a halt with any logic whatsoever . </defend.v.144><defend.v.145>We note , however , that in the circuit court Ehlco prevailed in its motion for judgment on the pleadings with regard to the Mena site because the court was persuaded that Wausau 's duty to defend had been triggered by events that preceded the filing of the 1988 Arkansas suit , particularly the EPA 's 1982 PRP letter. This result is not surprising given that , when the circuit court ruled upon the pleadings in 1994 , notice of a PRP letter had been held sufficient to trigger the duty to defend. See United States Fidelity &amp;Guaranty Co. v. Specialty Coatings Co. , 180 Ill. App. 3d 378 ( 1989 ) , overruled , Lapham-Hickey , 166 Ill. 2d 520. Consequently , there was no need in the circuit court for Ehlco to raise arguments pertaining to tender or actual notice of the Arkansas complaint , and the parties did not design their pleadings to address such issues. Under these circumstances , we hold that the parties should be given the opportunity to amend their pleadings to address the actual notice issue in the circuit court . </defend.v.145><defend.v.146>Now to an article that I hope will raise a modicum of discussion , as well as a few eyebrows.

As we have seen , the Sixth Commandment requires the means necessary for defending the innocent , including lethal force. And since we must obey God rather than men , it necessarily follows that we must use the means necessary for defending the innocent , including lethal force , even though the government unjustly forbids it. For instance , if it had been necessary for Obadiah to have used lethal force to save the lives of the prophets he was protecting , he would have been justified in using this forceeven though it would have been illegal. From God 's perspective , the principle of justifiable homicide is not dependent on men 's laws . </defend.v.147><defend.v.148>Against the linear attacks of other rapiers a fighter would typically try to simultaneously defend and counter-attack by a carefully timed movement which parried by deflecting the adversary 's point away as he made his own thrust in reaction. This was achieved as one single action by maintaining contact or " opposition " with the opponent 's thrusting blade and , if necessary , using his second hand or weapon to assist. A long , thin sword was ideal for this , but at some lengths could also become a disadvantage as an opponent with a shorter and faster blade could close in past its point or use his dagger . </defend.v.148><defend.v.149>Utah 's so called Castle Doctrine allows the home owner to assume the worst when the home is illegally entered.

In U.S. ex rel Acoustical Concepts , Inc. v. Travelers Cas. &amp;Sur. Co. of America , 2009 WL 2156909 ( E.D. Va. July 17 , 2009 ) , a carpentry subcontractor who successfully completed separate subcontracts on two federal projects for the general contractor sued the general contractor 's sureties to collect the contract balance on those two subcontracts. The sureties filed for summary judgment , asserting no payment was due on either federal subcontract because of a large set-off asserted by the general contractor on a separate , unrelated non-federal project subcontract. The court granted the plaintiff subcontractor summary judgment , finding that the sureties were not entitled to rely upon the broad set-off provisions in the federal subcontracts because the provision operated to frustrate the intent and purpose of the Miller Act of ensuring prompt payment to subcontractors for their work on federal projects . </defend.v.155><defend.v.156>Now you are ready to fill out your complaint.

The pro se plaintiff had been charged by the state with animal cruelty for not providing proper food , water , or shelter to approximately 60 animals on her farm.

No attempt is made to defend the Bible or to reconcile Christianity and science. It is solely an attempt to examine the evidence relating to the theory to see whether it has been established beyond question or whether it can be seriously challenged by both facts and reason. Any references to a creator are not from an appeal to Biblical teaching but arise from what is felt to be a logical necessity to postulate an intelligent creator to account for the origin and complexity of living organisms. There is no need for me to present the case for evolution. It is taught in our schools and is well known by all who read. There is need , however , to define what is meant by the term " evolution " .

When IgA is depleted or absent , there will be more antigen penetration in this area as well as increased sensitivity reactions to foods and chemicals There may be inflammation of the GI tract , a condition called " leaky gut , " in which certain foods and chemicals are not absorbed but pass out into the bloodstream. When the body tries to defend itself against these unexpected intruders , autoimmune disease may arise.

Edward R. Murrow </defend.v.170><defend.v.171>3. I suppose that a right to keep and bear arms in self-defense could coexist with a regime that allowed people only a right to self-defense using arms , and that banned unarmed self-defense , or self-defense with weapons that might not qualify as " arms " for Second Amendment purposes. But that would n't make a lot of sense : Why would you have a right to defend yourself lethally , if necessary using the most lethal weapons , and not using less lethal means ? Sometimes the legal answer to some questions is " because that 's the way we 've always done things , even if you think that 's illogical , " but that answer ca n't work here , because tradition is on the side of a right to self-defense using whatever means come to hand . </defend.v.171><defend.v.172>Next , the trial court noted various conflict of interest possibilities. More specifically , the court concluded that counsel retained by Lee 's insurer must hold in confidence Lee 's strategies relating to his third-party claims against his insurer. How would such a disclosure of confidences happen ? Attorney Hursh was retained to defend Lee against the claims of the Ramseys. If Lee wished to pursue independent claims against Farm Bureau , he was not entitled to do so through the use of counsel retained by Farm Bureau solely to defend him. He could , and did , rely on the services of private counsel Graybill for this purpose. There was never a time in this litigation when counsel retained by any insurer to defend Lee was also representing Lee in his third-party indemnity claims. Lee had no occasion to communicate in confidence about his indemnity claims with counsel retained by his insurers to defend him , nor can he point to any instance in which he did so . </defend.v.172><defend.v.173>There are obstinate and unknown braves who defend themselves inch by inch in the shadows against the fatal invasion of want and turpitude.

But when the government requires sin , by omission or commission , true teachers must uphold the duty to obey God rather than men. Thus , an important aspect of preaching the gospel to our culture is a proclamation of the defensive duties of the Moral Law , since they have been forbidden by the government. Therefore , the question is not whether preaching and practicing all the beliefs and duties of the Bible is the best way to transform the world; the question is whether we believe the unborn are human beings who should be defended with the means necessaryas are all other human beings. If so , they key to ending abortion , and transforming the world , is both preaching and practicing these principles . </defend.v.176><defend.v.177>The majority of the shore was lined with breeding horseshoe crabs.

These harmless creatures were helpless for they could not defend themselves against the problematic children. Not long after , the lifeguard on duty came to the horseshoe crab ' s rescue and put an end to the children ' s uncaring behavior. I sat and chatted with the lifeguard and learned that horseshoe crabs are endangered species and the beach is doing all they can to prevent any harm to the creatures . </defend.v.177><defend.v.178>Many state courts have affirmed the importance of the right of self-defense.323 The Wisconsin Supreme Court has made the practical observation that citizens who do not take steps to defend themselves are leaving their security to chance.324 The logical extension of this right , as held by the Oregon Supreme Court in State v. Kessler , is that citizens also must have the means available to defend themselves.325 It seems clear that the right to defend oneself , which has existed in the common law for centuries , is not worth much if individual citizens are not permitted to keep and bear arms.326 </defend.v.178><defend.v.179>Mr. Gregory is an experienced trial lawyer providing superior legal advocacy.

Third , worms that are compiled statically ( as opposed to dynamically linked against a library ) suffer from size issues.

The government can not say to the Catholic forbidden by law to practice his religion that she may resist the tanks that enforce these laws with a rifle , but not with a bazooka , because the social costs of bazookas are too great. The government lost its [ *pg 177 ] authority to prohibit her from carrying a bazooka when it violated her reserved right against religious discrimination. Nor can the government say to blacks it abandons to the Ku Klux Klan that they can use a pistol , but not a machine gun , to defend themselves against a lynch mob , because machine guns , if misused , are too dangerous.

The pernicious influence of the scientology movement has been well documented , and public concern about its opaque tactics would appear to be well founded and justified. For the police to take such a partisan step as to restrict the demonstration in this fashion would render the notion of peaceful protest not only a farcical fiction , but would signal the first descent into a police state where only ' approved ' demonstration is permitted.

For the state to have such authority is for citizens to be required to accept even erroneous punishment. If citizens were bound to accept only correct punishment , they would escape the state 's authority simply whenever they were innocent of any wrongdoing.

In Lapham-Hickey , the insured ' s policy specified that the insurer would defend any suit against the insured seeking covered damages.

But a criminal lawyer or criminal attorney might be able to make things a little better for you.

LEXIS 1655 , the state Supreme Court ruled that business insurers have a duty to defend junk fax class action lawsuits . </defend.v.286><defend.v.287>The courts present a threefold rationale for restricting the government 's ability to sue. First , criticism of the government is vital to the success of a democracy , and defamation suits only serve to chill free debate. Derbyshire emphasized this point when distinguishing the county council , a governmental and democratically elected body , from other types of corporations , which can sue if defamation damages their business. [ 27 ] Second , defamation laws are designed to protect reputation , which some courts argue a government body can not have. Because elected bodies regularly change membership , Lord Keith explained , " it is difficult to say the local authority as such has any reputation of its own. Reputation in the eyes of the public is more likely to attach itself to the controlling political party , and with a change in that party the reputation itself will change. " [ 28 ] Finally , political action offers a better means for the government to defend itself from harsh criticism. Allowing the state to sue some critics opens the door to unlimited suits against others. Such suits also represent an inappropriate use of a state 's wealth; the government should not use taxpayers ' money to stifle their right to freedom of expression.

The United States impleaded the employer as a third party defendant , and the employer and employee settled. The employer commenced a declaratory judgment action against its workers compensation and liability carrier for their failure to defend and indemnify the employer. The trial court concluded that the carrier had breached its duty to defend and directed that the carrier pay the employer any damages flowing from the breach including the settlement reached in the underlying case. The appellate division affirmed the trial court 's decision. The appellate court did not consider whether the settlement fell within coverage. Instead , it concluded that the settlement constituted damages the employer necessarily suffered by reason of the carrier 's failure to meet its contractual burden of " protecting [ the employer ] from attack.

In addition to the direct costs of the litigation , class action litigation can bring extensive adverse publicity to the target company or to individual products or procedures. For these reasons , companies should respond quickly when faced with complaints that could give rise to class action litigation. Prompt response to and resolution of individual complaints may foreclose the possibility of class action litigation completely. If faced with a class action lawsuit , a business should act quickly to review the issues with counsel and determine how to proceed. Early response and preparedness are critical when faced with a potentially damaging and costly public trial.

The court held that this theory , which applied to indemnification of defense costs , had no place in a dispute over settlement of covered and non-covered claims : applying the reasonably related rule to indemnification would often leave insurers footing the bill for an entire judgment or settlement , even for those claims the policy did not reach. This , of course , would expand the duty to indemnify to near if not complete parity with the duty to defend . Maryland law provides no support for this approach , and we again decline Perdue ' s invitation to dismantle the longstanding distinction between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify.

He often uses weak human means to produce great and glorious results ( so He will get the honor ) , but He virtually never accomplishes anything on earth without the use of means. The ordinary means for restoring the right of an oppressed minority is for people to assert the right that is being denied : in this case , the right of the unborn to be protected with the means necessary. We can no more expect to restore protection to the unborn , while denying their inalienable right to this protection , than we could have expected David to defeat Goliath if he had been in denial about the duty to defend Israel , and kill Goliath , with the means necessary . </defend.v.339><defend.v.340>Sometime later , the Bank moved to discontinue its action against the law firm.

Without question , the damages for the constructive discharge claim arise out of the literal and definite end , brought about by the acts of the employer , of plaintiff 's employment with the insured.

[ 3 ] We prefer to use another phrase , because all rights granted to the alleged offender , with the inclusion of the right to legal assistance , are founded on the principle that the alleged offender must be given a fair opportunity to defend himself. The right to defend oneself is one of the essential principles underlying the concept of a fair trial'. This is underscored by the fact that Article 6 ECHR , which contains the right to defend oneself in criminal cases ( in contradistinction to such other treaty provisions as Articles 5 , 8 and 10 ECHR ) , does not provide for exceptions , such as measures necessary in a democratic society or in the interest of public security. The concept of a fair trial ' which includes the right to an effective defence , serves the interests of a democratic society. Although certain defence rights can be restricted , the right to defend oneself is absolute.

That court also found prejudice had to be shown to establish a coverage defense based on late notice and the insurer ' s actual awareness of the suit against the employee precluded it ' s ability to establish the required prejudice. On appeal , the Fifth Circuit certified the above questions to the Texas Supreme Court. In addressing the notice requirement in last Friday ' s decision , the Texas Court observed that a more basic purpose of requiring an insured to forward suit papers to the insurer is to advise them that the insured has been served and the insurer is expected to file an answer on their behalf. An insurer ' s knowledge that suit has been filed does not satisfy this ' more basic purpose ' or require the insurer to gratuitously subject itself to liability.

But , as Williams has acknowledged , one of the reasons there is little evidence of a tradition of Australian Attorneys-General defending the judiciary is because of the marked absence in our history of criticism of the judiciary.

Churchill understood the profound significance of each of these events as they arose. In preparation for the Battle of Britain , Churchill said , " Hitler knows he must break us on this island or lose the war. " Churchill also well understood that the air Battle of Britain was the prelude to a cross-channel invasion by the German army. He hoped to defeat the German Luftwaffe over Britain and thereby prevent a land invasion , but , he told the public , " should the invader come to Britain ... we shall defend every village , every town , and every city. The vast mass of London itself , fought street by street , could easily devour an entire hostile army.

Implicit in the needs-based language of discretionary statutes is the notion that the privilege of carrying arms is a function of the risk of criminal victimization : that people who , because of their circumstance , face an unusually high risk of criminal victimization and are in some sense " natural " targets of criminal assault or special targets of opportunity have a justifiable " need " to carry arms; the rest of the populace , who face only an " ordinary " risk , is not justified in wanting to carry arms to defend itself. Not only is there no reason to believe that those who face an unusual risk of criminal victimization are inherently more trustworthy or competent with a firearm than those who do not , but the implicit suggestion that some lives -- because of wealth , fame , unique job requirements , or the preferences of criminals -- are somehow more worth protecting than others is morally repugnant and indefensible . </defend.v.438><defend.v.439>Since there is no provision in a title insurance policy for the allocation of costs on mixed claims , the Court of Appeal in the Hanis case will govern and a title insurer will pay the cost of defending almost any claim affecting the property.

Anyone who underestimates the power that fear of the police has over men 's minds fails to appreciate what may be the government 's most powerful tool.

Just as there is a moral obligation to promote the duty to clothe the naked , and feed the starving , there is a similar imperative to maintain the duty to defend those who are being attacked.

Neglecting any aspect of the Moral Law is sinful , but neglecting the duty to defend helpless children , as millions are being slaughtered , is an especially heinous sin. Bowing to an injustice of this magnitude encourages submission to an untold number of lesser atrocities. Tolerating this form and number of murders also sets a precedent for submitting to more heinous types , and even larger numbers of murders. If your right to defend your own child may be removed by the government , there is no right that may not be similarly removed by the state.

The court cited a Florida statute which provides that the purposes of FWCIGA were to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under Chapter 440 ( which exclusively regulates workers ' compensation claims ) and for the prompt payment of workers ' compensation claims incurred by insolvent insurers. Thus , FWCIGA had no duty to defend or indemnify the policyholder in a personal injury action filed against the policyholder . </defend.v.538><defend.v.539>Positive evidence ? I don ' t know , I prefer the protective theory because of the fact of the background mutation rates of cells due to endogenous damage for which sophisticated processes have evolved to defend against. These processes are not 100 reliable and maybe they don ' t need to be because of the presence of non-coding DNA , i.e. there is not a purpose or a function for non-coding DNA , but it just happens to be there which meant that repair mechanisms did not have to evolve to perfection without compromising life-span. This is speculating of course , but what is a fact is the level of endogenous damage and the rates of mutation caused by this damage ( important to note that we are discussing here endogenous damage , not external artificially applied ionising radiation for UV I need to come back to that ) . If these levels were concentrated to coding regions in the nuclear genome they would be too high for generational life spans ( in humans at least ) .

Once the obligation to defend existed , the fact that there was no express language in the policy that qualified that obligation or suggested it did not apply to mixed claims mean that the insurer was responsible for all costs , except for those entirely unrelated to the claim it was obliged to defend.

It still is , but along the way I discovered myself dropping pounds ( over 25 so far ) , getting into better shape , and achieving goals that I never thought possible. To become a Tien Lung black belt is one of my goals - this is one goal that I have no intentions of giving up on ! The environment at Tien Lung is that of family and friends. It 's not impersonal; I 've never felt like I 'm just a number. Attending classes at Tien Lung is not an effort; it 's something that I look forward to doing ! Other " work outs " that I 've done in the past have been so boring that they were a grind to finish. That 's probably the reason that I never continued with them for any length of time. The classes at Tien Lung are interesting , challenging , and extremely informative ! Helping myself , and others along the way is a superb group of instructors !

This would be much easier if a high percentage of the community were like minded folks who were committed to sharing and cooperating. Because any community with food is likely going to have to somehow survive while facing even larger polities , like nearby cities , counties or even state governments. Do n't expect to face a walking hoard of lightly armed , starving individuals. Expect to face a professional , determined army formed by a government of some kind. Liberty Villages will be a local source for food and manpower.

Usually a lawyer may not communicate directly , either verbally or in writing , with another party who is also represented by a lawyer. However , the parties themselves may speak with one another.

The duty to defend imposed by the defence clause is unambiguously restricted to claims for damages which fall within the scope of the policy. Since the only damages sought against the insured in this case were on account of fraudulent acts or omissions , and such damages are not payable under the policy , the defence clause did not apply.

He rejected the doctrines of the trinity and the immortal soul; in his book The New Creation ( 1904 ) , he even compromised with the theory of evolution. So far , he was a typical 19th-century rationalist.

Under the eight-corner rule , an insurer ' s duty to pay defense costs is determined by examining only the policy provisions and the claims in the underlying complaint without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations. While the district court noted that the Supreme Court of Texas has not specifically ruled upon this exact issue , it still concluded that the Texas court would not create an exception to the eight-corner rule as suggested by the insurer.

Generally , a family member or friend expects little or no pay for settling the estate and is anxious to get things settled quickly and smoothly. Being an executor can be a lot of work. You have to follow up on many details and may be called upon to help defend the terms of the will against squabbling heirs or unwarranted claims by outside parties.

On the day of the altercation , the accused possessed his weapon for the purpose of defending himself against an imminent attack by specific individuals. His purpose was not , in all the circumstances , dangerous to the public peace , since the attack was clearly unavoidable. The accused was subject to specific credible threats of an imminent assault , in an environment from which there was simply no possibility of escape and in which it was futile to seek protection. It is also particularly relevant that the trial judge specifically found that the accused 's actual use of the weapon constituted justifiable self-defence . </defend.v.669><defend.v.670>Tell me about it , DJ.

The idea is for the offense to bait a defensive lineman to run into a spot or a hole where he expects the running back or quarterback to be , and just as he is about to prepare to make the tackle , he is hit or blocked by another player he does not expect to be there at that moment. As a result , a big hole opens up because the would-be tackler is on the ground -- and the running back gains big yardage. Defending the trap play requires strength , experience , and a keen sense of anticipation . </defend.v.672><defend.v.673>Defend Your Castle can get tiring when played alone , but with friends , things can get very crazy.

The Sixth Commandment requires the means necessary for defending the innocent , including lethal force ( Exodus 20 : 13 , Exodus 22 : 2 , Genesis 14 : 13-20 , Esther 9 : 1-10 ) . If someone uses lethal force to protect children from a known murderer , he should be presumed to have acted honorably , unless it can be proven otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt. ( When mass murder has been legalized , and thousands are being slain each day , there is an overwhelming obligation to use the means necessary to stop these murderers. ) Unsubstantiated objections do not prove guilt under any circumstances , much less under these compelling conditions . </defend.v.674><defend.v.675>I 've seen proof , black on white , that Herr Dr. Frster has not yet severed his connection with the anti-Semitic movement. ...

One possibility is that criminal defendants would generally use the right of self-defense only when their reserved rights were actually violated. But even if one assumes , implausibly , that criminal defendants use the privilege only when they think their reserved rights are violated , there remains the Lockean principle that they would tend to interpret the scope of their own rights too broadly. Criminal defendants will simply read their reserved rights in a way that justified self-defense. The result will not be a coherent alternative to the government 's protections for reserved rights that could correct its mistakes , but only the chaos of the state of nature. Most of the time the privilege would simply frustrate legitimate laws , such as those prohibiting murder and rape , that do not violate reserved moral rights.88 </defend.v.677><defend.v.678>The very first scene in the opera between Wozzeck and the Captain is similarly cast in ways which alienate , rather than relate , the characters.

This situation would most likely arise if the request to pay and withdraw is so close to the trial date that the withdrawal of representation would prevent the insured from effectively preparing for trial. To avoid these results , an insurer may wish to obtain a stay of the trial court proceedings to first litigate the validity of " pay and walk " provision. In this event , it is critical that an insurance company who seeks the right to tender its policy limits and withdraw from further involvement in defending the insured proceed with litigating that issue at the earliest stage possible to prevent any prejudice to the insured . </defend.v.682><defend.v.683>In any DUI case , time is of the essence.

It is undisputed that Ehlco first sent notice of the Wyoming suit to Wausau in January of 1992 and requested a prompt response regarding defense. Wausau failed to provide Ehlco with a defense. Rather , Wausau asserted only that it was searching for its policies. Ehlco continually implored Wausau to reconsider its refusal to defend , to no avail.

Ultimately , Wausau waited until February of 1993 , over one year after it first received notice and nearly four months after the Wyoming suit was concluded , before filing its own complaint seeking a declaratory judgment of noncoverage. These undisputed facts compel the legal conclusion that Wausau 's refusal to defend the Wyoming suit was vexatious and unreasonable as a matter of law.

In so doing , the Appeals Chamber implicitly overruled the reasoning of the Trial Chamber in the case of Prosecutor v. eelj.14 In ordering that the defendant Vojislav Seselj be represented by " stand-by counsel " in order to rein in his disruptive behavior , the eelj Trial Chamber had taken the position that ICCPR Article 14 ( 3 ) ( d ) , and similar provisions in regional conventions and its own Statute do not declare that the right to work through legal counsel is derivative of the primary right to represent oneself. As the eelj Trial Chamber observed : " It would be a misunderstanding of the word 'or ' in the phrase 'to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing ' to conclude that self-representation excludes the appointment of counsel to assist the Accused or vice versa.

When a worm is active , the time remaining to defend the network is dramatically shorter than it would be with a lone attacker. The second reason for the bias of the book 's contents is the fact that the strategies for defending against any worm are similar to those for defending against any attacker. However , the defenses must be raised more quickly and can sometimes be automated. Third , detection techniques hold substantially more interest for the author , and are the focus of much of my research and work.

The decision transcends the legal realm , in that it extends broadly across a variety of business and governmental entities affecting each of their interests in a fundamental manner. The decision may cause businesses to re-examine past , present , and future dealings with governmental agencies. The False Claims Acts , essentially whistle-blower statutes , may cause companies to come forward voluntarily to resolve any past misdeeds before they become subject to a liability suit. Also , since government contractors abound in the Maryland-D.C.-Virginia area , businesses with relationships to federal government agencies may benefit from the rule of law established in this case. Companies which defraud the government will be required to remedy such wrongful conduct themselves , and will not be able to shift that consequence to a third party , such as their liability insurance carrier.

As courts resolve disputes , a body of judicial decisions develops. Court cases are decided either by a judge or a jury. When a particular court makes a ruling on a legal issue , all courts in the same jurisdiction must follow that ruling in the future. This concept is known as precedent and its rationale is that once an issue has been decided , the law should treat that issue consistently in the future. For example , suppose that a court ruling made it legal to shoot someone in order to defend your life. Suppose further that you were attacked and in order to prevent your attacker from killing you , you shot him. If your attacker lives and sues you for shooting him , you would rely on the precedent that it is legal to shoot someone in order to defend your life. It is important to note , however , that precedents may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Each state is considered a jurisdiction as well as the federal court system so it is possible that laws on the same subject will not be identical in different locations . </defend.v.772><defend.v.773>Unfortunately , the department ' s position will create new obligations for D &amp;O insurers that decide to write D &amp;O policies placing the duty to defend on the insurer.

POWELL 'S crucial Bakke opinion had defended racial preferences in university admissions as producing diversity in the classroom and Justice JOHN PAUL STEVENS had persistently advocated similar diversity-based justifications for affirmative action , for example , in his Wygant dissent. Such justifications implicitly adopt the antisubordination rather than the color-blindness approach : using racial distinctions to increase diversity is not a constitutional evil because it does not use race to impose disadvantage.

Should it issue and within two weeks no defence be filed , the court will , on further application , issue an Order for Judgement ( Vollstreckungsbescheid ) . This is the equivalent to a provisionally enforceable Judgement in Default of Appearance ( Vers umnisurteil ) . The debtor can within two weeks of the service upon him of the Order file a Notice of Intention to Defend. Should he not do this , the Order becomes enforceable. As the filing of a Notice of Intention to Defend will result in the judicial examination of the claim , Summary Judgement proceedings are only to be recommended if one can expect from the outset that the debtor will not defend. Should the debtor have indicated from the start an intention and readiness to defend , the taking of proceedings by way of an application for Summary Judgement will only lengthen the judicial decision making procedure . </defend.v.803><defend.v.804>The Ninth Circuit in this case granted review of Wal-Mart 's challenge of the certification of a nationwide class of 1.5 million women in a gender discrimination case under Title VII , the largest class action in history.

In the early stages , for example , experts are often required to defend their expertise to the opposing counsel.

The right to defend can not be functional until a criminal defendant receives concrete and effective protection by exercising the right to counsel assistance. Consequently , the essence for counsel to assist the criminal defendant in exercising the right to defend lies in their free and unrestricted communications , and is subject to constitutional protection. While exercising the aforementioned right of free and unrestricted communications may , under certain circumstances , be limited by law , such limitations must comply with the principle of proportionality under Article 23 of the Constitution and must be concrete and precise in accordance with the meaning and purpose of the Constitution so that it is not contradictory to Article 16 of the Constitution . </defend.v.933><defend.v.934>But it has become clear to me that something as simple as the truth will be perverted and manipulated by dishonest individuals who will stop at nothing and will proceed without any regard for medical ethics or the previously private medical history of Dr. Atkins in an attempt not only to discredit my husband 's work but to profit from his death.

Shortly before a scheduled trial date , plaintiffs then moved for permission to file a claim against their attorney for malpractice on the grounds that he failed to protect their claim in the compensation proceedings. Their motion was denied because of the impending trial date. During the argument on the motions for summary judgment , plaintiffs asked for permission to dismiss their complaint against the attorney without prejudice. The attorney opposed. The trial court agreed with plaintiffs , and the attorney now seeks to reverse the without prejudice aspect of the order.

I have looked at the Notice of Intention to defend at page 33 of the printed record and the affidavit in support of the Notice of Intention to defend at pages 34 and 35 of the printed record , it is clear beyond dispute that the Notice of Intention to defend and its supporting affidavit has not been marked either as Exhibit I ' or Exhibit " AMI ' or any other exhibit.

All of these objections appear absurd when applied to born people , and when they are viewed in the light of the Golden Rule. No other response actually needs to be given.

[ Citations. ] ' ( County of San Diego v. Ace Property &amp;Casualty Ins. Co. ( 2005 ) 37 Cal.4th 406 , 414. ) Moreover , in considering a summary judgment concerning the duty of an insurer to defend the insured in an action , we conduct a de novo review. ( Cunningham v. Universal Underwriters ( 2002 ) 98 Cal.App.4th 1141 , 1148 . ) </defend.v.1057><defend.v.1058>It is well established that an insurer 's duty to defend an insured party is much broader than its duty to indemnify that party. This applies to homeowner 's policies , car insurance , property insurance , and business policies , such as workers ' compensation coverage and comprehensive general liability ( CGL ) policies. This means that an insurance company may have to shoulder the court costs and attorney fees associated with defending an insured person , even if the insurance company may not have to pay for all the damages under the claims alleged or established during the course of an action. An insured party has a right to a defense provided by the insurance company for all claims under which the insured would incur liability if the claims were proven true. This even includes alleged claims that may be groundless , fanciful or fraudulent. Knowing that the duty to defend is a broad one , claimants may even structure their allegations in order to recover under insurance policies they may be aware of or that they suspect may exist. In doing so , they will trigger the duty of an insurance company to defend the insured party against whom claims are being brought . </defend.v.1058><defend.v.1059>No one , particularly law-abiding , taxpaying citizens , likes the idea of spending government revenues defending criminals.

Since the 1980 's state and local governments have discovered that DUI arrests are an excellent way to generate revenue. Pushed by special interest groups and a desire of local governments to increase " revenue , " the national " legal limit " has crept steadily lower. Accordingly , police look for any excuse to pull over drivers during hours when people are likely to be driving after having consumed alcohol. In addition police agencies in most districts have adopted policies of stopping as many people as possible as a general crime fighting measure. These policies mean that many people are stopped without the minimum " reasonable suspicion " - the police simply make up a reason to stop them !

A skilled fighter could always close in with his opponent to disarm or throw him or otherwise trap him in some way. He also had to be able to defend against his opponent doing the same. A weapon certainly helps you to fight , to protect yourself from blows , and to deliver lethal ones of your own.

It ' s just that simple - and you have proven that yourselves. This defense - to be found on all the apologetic boards and discussions - of the prophet is in fact an admission that the claim that feelings/the Holy Ghost are a reliable indicator of historicity is totally unsustainable. The logic used to defend the church , in fact undermines it at the same time. But the psychological state we exist in as members won ' t permit us to see that , will it ?

The radical firebrand at the Department of Justice who successfully argued against defending those laws ? A young DOJ attorney named John Roberts , who is now the Chief Justice of the United States. Clearly , Obama could have refused to defend DOMA if he had really wanted to. Georgetown 's Hunter cites other cases in which the Justice Department has declined to defend laws , including one involving a minor cable-TV dispute.

For all its highly touted surgical weaponry and massive arsenal of chemical drugs , conventional medicine has failed to defend humanity against this malignant attack.

Taking a credible stand on defending the unborn with force ( rather than denying this duty ) can serve as a point of contact for presenting the truths of the gospel to these unbelievers. This position can open the door to asserting the demands of God 's law , the substitutionary death of Christ , and the necessity of submitting to Him in every aspect of life. This position also demonstrates the proper relation between faith and works , the high cost of discipleship , and can serve as a stepping stone to all the other principles of Christianity. Thus , a consistent stand on defending the unborn is essential for exposing the evil of abortion , and transforming men 's hearts and lives.

Upholding the initial class certification , the court subsequently denied Wal-Mart 's petition for panel rehearing as moot , but allowed the company to file another rehearing en banc petition. Filing in support of the company 's appeal of class certification , NCLC argued that the trial court made serious errors in certifying the case as a class action by permitting the use of statistical evidence of discrimination , ignoring the requirements of proof of individual discrimination , and allowing the plaintiffs to bring their class claim based on a " common " allegation that Wal-Mart decentralized its hiring and promotion practices.

The confusion is due , in part , to the complexity of the issue itself , and in part to the variety of state laws within the American legal system. The requirement that the force defended against be unlawful simply excludes the right of self defense when an assailant ' , such as a police officer , is legally authorized to use force. It must be noted however , that a majority of jurisdictions allow the use of force , including deadly force , in resisting an attack by a person not known to be a police officer , and the use of non-deadly force against a known police-officer attempting to make a wrongful arrest. Pennsylvania does not allow the use of force in resisting wrongful arrest , but it does allow the use of force if an arresting officer unlawfully threatens to use deadly force , or does not identify himself . </defend.v.1135><defend.v.1136>Interestingly , as this issue played out in June , I found that many of those gay legal minds who argued that Obama had to defend the suit were either looking for jobs in the Obama administration or were lobbyists with clients who needed something from the White House.

They said that if you are a true believer , once you have a genuine faith , it is impossible for you to loose that faith , therefore the branches referred by Jesus that do not bear fruit can only refer to the professed Christians who have never had a genuine faith in the first place; they just pretended to believe. But such interpretation does not make any sense. How can Jesus tell someone to remain in Him unless he is already in Him ? And how can a person be in Christ unless he has true faith. To a person who did not have a genuine faith , Jesus should have told him : " Repent , and get the real faith. Do not continue in such pretended faith. " " Remain " means " continue " . If their professed faith was never genuine in the first place , was Jesus saying that the professed Christians should continue in their professed faith ? Evidently , it ca n't be that way. The branches can only refer to the true believers , since the branches are born from the true vine , Jesus Christ . </defend.v.1137><defend.v.1138>In Pennsylvania , and a majority of jurisdictions , a victim has the right to use non-deadly force in defense of his dwelling when , and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or terminate another 's unlawful entry or attack upon his dwelling. Deadly force is authorized when violent entry is made or attempted and the victim reasonably believes that it is necessary to prevent an attack on his person. It is also authorized when the victim reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent entry into the dwelling by one who intends to commit a felony therein. The rationale for allowing self-defense in these scenarios is based upon the right of inhabitants to be secure in their homes , rather than the right to defend property , as can be demonstrated by the law regarding defense of uninhabited property . </defend.v.1138><defend.v.1139>This will only apply if there is a duty to defend on the part of the excess insurer.

And we never took a backwards step with respect to that. That ' s why we have today the ability to defend against limited missile attacks against the continental US.

Given the controversy that swirled around the exhibit , it was virtually impossible to seek any kind of objective meaning in the installation , especially since it could pose headaches and demand a reckoning with political , ethical and philosophical questions than are fairly rare in the art world. So an unfortunate , uneasy atmosphere gathered around the piece : was it political or not , was it an intentional provocation , was it a coup - and was it even art in the first place ?

Like lots of armies , the neutrophils are not all on the front lines at the same time. There is a considerable reserve of neutrophils in the body which are not actively in the circulation. When the need arises for neutrophils to be activated , neutrophil counts in the circulation can rise very quickly to meet the need. Neutrophil numbers rise when there is an infection or inflammatory process. If the illness is chronic and the demand for neutrophils is high , they can be used up and a decrease in neutrophil numbers results. Neutrophils do not have a long life span in the circulation. The average neutrophil lives in the blood stream for 10 hours or so and all of the neutrophils in the body are replaced about twice a day.

A duty to defend will be found where the undisputed facts surrounding a claim typically the language of the policy and the allegations of the complaint permit proof of a claim potentially covered by the duty to indemnify.

The scope of the duty to indemnify , in turn , triggers the application of the defence clause , which limits the duty to defend to claims for damages which are or may be payable under the policy.

The prosecution case was that the victim had been unarmed and thus presented no threat to the defendant. The trial judge directed the jury that the defendant 's belief in the need to shoot in self-defence had to be both honest and reasonable. In rejecting this direction , the Privy Council approved the approach in Williams. Lord Griffiths commented that juries should be given the following guidance : " Whether the plea is self-defence or defence of another , if the defendant may have been labouring under a mistake as to facts , he must be judged according to his mistaken belief of the facts : that is so whether the mistake was , on an objective view , a reasonable mistake or not.

I also rest easier knowing that my fiance could stop a rapist or murderer , rather than becoming a victim. The simple fact is that gun control laws do n't stop criminals from getting guns , and instead only disarm the law abiding citizens , making them easier targets for the criminals.

Even if one 's act of self-defense would not create an unreasonable risk of harm , one is bound to accept governmental decisions that say otherwise. If one alienated only one 's natural right to defend oneself unreasonably , not only might much of criminal and tort law [ *pg 164 ] become constitutionalized , 161 one would escape the authority of the state whenever its laws failed to capture the correct standard of reasonableness. Since people tend to read the scope of their rights and the rights of their kin too broadly , this possibility would mean reintroducing the chaos and feuding that it was the purpose of the social contract to avoid. Accordingly , one must alienate even one 's right to defend oneself reasonably. It is for this reason that Locke himself insists that rights to self-defense are not retained upon entering civil society. Someone entering civil society " gives up to be regulated by laws made by the society " the power " of doing whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself.

The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries , but it is in ours. From the very beginning , our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal can not be realized if [ a person ] charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him. Gideon v.

In its earliest years , the ACLU defended activists like Margaret Sanger and Mary Ware Dennett when officials tried to prevent them from speaking and publishing about human sexuality , reproduction , and contraception. In the succeeding decades , we were pioneering legal advocates for the right to contraception , the right to abortion , and the right to bear a child. When we go to court to defend these principles , we litigate in association with our affiliates around the nation and often with other allies as well. In 1974 , the ACLU created its Reproductive Freedom Project to defend and expand the right to choose.

After settling a portion of the case and claiming that its $ 500 , 000 policy limits were exhausted , Great American sought to extricate itself from any further obligation to defend the insureds by bringing a declaratory relief action. The insureds moved to stay the declaratory relief action , claiming that there were factual issues that overlapped between the underlying action and the declaratory relief coverage action , such that trying the declaratory relief action would prejudice the insured ' s rights in the underlying action. The trial court found the potential for some overlap and therefore issued a stay . </defend.v.1275><defend.v.1276>The estoppel doctrine has deep roots in Illinois jurisprudence.

So the team on offense does n't need to defend , and the team on defense only has to defend; if they successfully defend until time runs out , then they automatically gain control of the locked contol point.

At this point , one would expect them to reassess the wisdom of the defense and possibly talk settlement. Not so. They went right on bringing unsuccessful motions.

The 1586 trial of Mary Stuart , Queen of Scots , illustrates the harshness of denying the assistance of counsel in a criminal case. Queen Mary was charged with TREASON for allegedly conspiring to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I. Mary asked for the assistance of counsel , PLEADING that " the laws and statutes of England are to me most unknown; I am destitute of counsellors and no man dareth step forth to be my advocate " ( Winick 1989 , 787 ) .

Under such circumstances , the focus should not be on the slain murderer , but on the deliverance of his intended victims.

( Although , at that time , Mr. Hirsh was employed by the American Center for Law and Justice to represent me in another abortion-related case , his work on my homicide case was pro bono. ) The brief Mr. Hirsh submitted was based on his 1993 Regent University thesis. This thesis had been modified into an argument defending Michael Griffin 's killing of Dr. Gunn , and printed in the Regent University Law Review ( it was withdrawn prior to circulation after I killed Dr. Britton ) . Mr. Hirsh then reworked the brief , using the particulars of my case , and submitted it in my name. The brief argued that my killing Dr. Britton was consistent with the Bible , and justifiable under Florida law. With the help of Vincent Heiser ( another pro-life attorney who came to my aid ) , we reminded the judge that he might , one day , stand trial for upholding the abortion holocaust if he would not allow us to present the truth . </defend.v.1322><defend.v.1323>In the construction and energy business sectors it is common for general contractors and operators to require their subcontractors to name them as an additional insured under the sub ' s CGL policy. Often these clauses require the subcontractor ' s coverage be primary and non-contributory. In doing so , the general contractor or operator can shift much of its insurance costs onto the subcontractor. However , a recent opinion by the Houston Fourteenth Court of Appeals may have a major impact on general contractors and other parties that are frequently named as additional insureds. In D.R. Horton v. Markel International Insurance Company , the Houston Court of Appeals adopted a construction of the typical additional insurance clause that greatly limits an insurer ' s obligation to defend these additional insured.

Either the claim succeeds , in which case no damages are payable under the terms of this policy because of the exclusion clause , or the claim fails , in which case no damages are payable anyway. Therefore , it is argued , in no conceivable circumstance can the second of the two conditions be met.

For this reason , I saw no reason why the government would have a duty to give individuals powers to defend themselves when such disagreements occur. As a result , auxiliary rights did not follow from Lockean principles. The only purpose that a Lockean could find for the privilege , I argued , was the much less plausible one of giving symbolic expression to the fact that the government has no authority over the defendant and that the two are simply in the state of nature . </defend.v.1373><defend.v.1374>On Friday nights at the Amity Chess Club , the chess wizard sharpens his skills in preparation to defend his title at the Pennsylvania State Chess Championships Oct. 31-Nov. 1 at the University of Pittsburgh . </defend.v.1374><defend.v.1375>The limits on the right of a government , state-owned corporation , or political party to sue for defamation stop an action at the beginning.

We ( the U.S. combat ground forces ) were handed a steaming pile of crap and were asked to fix it with minimal support and guidance from our government. With policies , such as the aforementioned , in place , we are put in difficult situations , all of which we made to act in appropriately and decisively.

Transamerica must be classified as one of the best decisions for the insurance industry in many years. It is the last piece in the jigsaw puzzle , restoring equity and balance in the relationship between insurer and insured. The claim now secured to the insurer has its pitfalls and its strategic dilemmas; however , most importantly , it should promote reasonable businesslike settlements between insured and insurer over the ever-increasing defense expenditures , thereby reducing the degree of future litigation over coverage and duty to defend issues. The decision opens many creative avenues for the insurer , corporate counsel , and private defense counsel to negotiate such arrangements between the insured and the insurer . </defend.v.1384><defend.v.1385>It is left up to the states to determine how they will provide legal counsel for indigent defendants , however.

For example , a person who unknowingly chances upon two actors practicing a fight would be able to defend ( in court ) his restraint of the one that appeared to be the aggressor. Most courts have ruled that such a defense can not be used to protect friends or family members who have engaged in an illegal fight ( see " limits of self-defense " , below ) .

" The policies issued by Travelers and USFIC both covered claims against the insured for " advertising injury. " The case involved allegations that the insured had stolen various ideas from the competitor and then advertised the results of that theft. The question before the court was whether the advertising had converted the theft into " advertising injury.

Although Locke himself is not that explicit about the extent of these reserved rights , he makes it clear that they follow from the fact that the alienation of natural rights is a voluntary decision made according to the self-interest of those leaving the state of nature.106 No one would consent to be a slave , because " no rational creature can be supposed [ *pg 148 ] to change his condition with an intention to be worse.

The offender could easily be arrested and restrained to ensure that he did not continue to murder in the future. It is , however , easy to unwittingly assume that the same non-lethal means the police would use to arrest an abortionist , if abortion were illegal , are also sufficient to restrain abortionists when police gunmen are defending them.

It is also notable that Justice Harlan felt no need to defend or elaborate his position that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual right.

That may come as a surprise to many people , but the principle holds even in cases where the police have been grossly negligent in failing to protect a crime victim. [ 41 ] The function and responsibility of the police is to serve solely as a general deterrent , for the benefit of the community as a whole; they are not personal bodyguards. Those who would prohibit the carrying of arms for self-defense thus bear a burden of establishing on what basis and on what moral authority the government , having no obligation to protect any particular individual , deprives particular individuals of the ability -- and means -- to protect themselves.

In framing the question as " diversity " rather than affirmative action , universities like U-M have made it more difficult to defend affirmative action programs as what they really are - attempts to reduce the inequalities in American society. These " defenders " of affirmative action are afraid to make clear that the real issue is the fundamental and growing social inequality in American society because they fear the renewal of the social movements that forced the creation of affirmative action programs in the first place. Struggle around the historically decisive question of racism would lead quickly to criticism of the foundation of class inequality on which this society is built . </defend.v.1516><defend.v.1517>it is clear both cheney and bush are only out to defend themselves; torture works is the wrong argument even if it too has now been debunked as untrue , untrustworthy and inefficient. it is against the laws of our country 's history and founding father , regardless of what some political appointees told them , and our international agreements , </defend.v.1517><defend.v.1518>WBO featherweight champion Scott Harrison , jailed in Spain on an assault charge , will be unable to defend his title Dec. 9 against Nicky Cook.

While your professional liability insurance company will not usually pay for your own private counsel , nevertheless , you should consider retaining an attorney to act as your personal counsel who has experience dealing with health law issues to oversee the entire case and to protect your personal interests. A health care attorney will usually have experience dealing with investigators , the Department of Health , and the Board of Medicine , and will most likely understand the potential ramifications of settling a medical malpractice claim. In addition , a health care attorney will know the proper procedures for challenging a report to the NPDB if an incorrect or improper report is filed . </defend.v.1524><defend.v.1525>Attorneys like Gary G. Becker '83 are often asked how they can defend guilty people. To Becker , the question is n't relevant. To him , the job of the defense attorney is to ensure that the defendant is treated fairly in an arena where the odds are stacked against him or her. " I stand up for principles , " he says. Becker , 46 , learned how to structure a legal argument in Cardozo 's Criminal Law Clinic. He also discovered that " I identified more with the individual than with the state. " Today , he works with Gerald Lefcourt , a prominent Manhattan defense attorney. A self-described " true believer , " he says he could never be a prosecutor . </defend.v.1525><defend.v.1526>Strategy 2 : ( how I did it ) Everyone has to have [ First Strike ] on their weapons or you 'll die.

For the police to say you should leave it to us to attend and apprehend a criminal , it is weasel speak. I believe that this farmer should be released on appeal. He may have been paranoiac about being burgled but he had good reason and the police had failed him in the past. It is a disgrace that he is jailed for defending his property. If you go out with intention of breaking into a property then you must accept the consequences. The police are quite useless to stop you . </defend.v.1527><defend.v.1528>We declare our intention to defend affirmative action , integration and all the gains of the previous Civil Rights Movement.

Nickerson , the Montana Supreme Court explicitly ruled that arms may be used lawfully to defend property as well.240 In Nickerson , the court had to decide whether the defendant had committed assault when he pointed a pistol at a man who had come onto his property uninvited.241 The intruder had entered the defendant 's property in defense of a squatter who had taken over the defendant 's dwelling in his absence.242 To decide whether the defendant had committed assault in confronting the intruder , the court examined the state constitution , which provided that a person could bear arms in " defense of his own home , person and property.

WMB sued Cen-Fed for breach of the lease and declaratory relief alleging that Cen-Fed had failed to maintain and repair the leased premises in accordance with the terms of the lease. Golden Eagle insured Cen-Fed with general liability and commercial general liability coverage policies. Cen-Fed tendered the claim to Golden Eagle , who undertook the defense of Cen-Fed under a complete reservation of rights. During the underlying action , Golden Eagle filed suit against Cen-Fed seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to indemnify Cen-Fed for damages in connection with the underlying lawsuit , that it had no duty to defend the underlying action and that it had no obligation to indemnify Cen-Fed for contractual attorney 's fees that might be awarded to WMB in the underlying action. In the underlying suit , the jury found in favor of WMB finding a diminution in the value of its leasehold , but awarded zero damages for the claims of damages. However , as part of the judgment , WMB , as the prevailing party , was awarded costs of suit including attorney 's fees pursuant to the lease . </defend.v.1535><defend.v.1536>The human party most directly injured by this neglect is the unborn.

He did not have enough money for a lawyer and asked that one be appointed to defend him. The judge denied the request , saying that under Florida state law , counsel can be appointed only in a capital offense. Gideon was sentenced to five years in prison. He then filed a writ of certiorari ( petition of appeal ) to the Supreme Court of the United States , asking for a case review. The Court granted Gideon 's request and appointed Abe Fortas to represent him . </defend.v.1538><defend.v.1539>A mother will defend her child whether right or wrong in front of others when seeing her child attacked but behind closed doors the mother disciplines and warns her child of the wrong and the consequences. As a husband you must do the same defend whether she is right or wrong as long as you do not become an enabler. I am sure you are trying to make sense of it all from what you wrote. Willingly or unwilling you became a victim too for that I am sorry. Many wives/husbands of drug abusers and alcoholics are NOT users themselves. They are pulled into the mess by the ones they care about most and try to make sense of it. I worked in a PIC unit ( civilian ) trying to rehab and its not any easy job.

It is designed to defend against millions of bacteria , microbes , viruses , toxins and parasites that try to invade the body. The white blood cells are probably the most important part of your immune system. And it turns out that " white blood cells " are actually a whole collection of different cells that work together to destroy bacteria and viruses. One type of white blood cell attacks virus-infected cells , foreign cells , and cancer cells. T cells also produce a number of substances that regulate the immune response. The thymus lives in your chest , between your breast bone and your heart. It is responsible for producing T-cells. The thymus is more important in children especially to T-cell maturation , but the thymus is not as important in adults. T-cells are the main target of HIV in the blood , and they act as the host that the virus needs to replicate . </defend.v.1546><defend.v.1547>How can any Court really assume that if default has been enetered and even assuming arguendo that a default judgment had been entered , which I think is another leap that the Court would have to take in order to accept plaintiff ' s damage argument in this case , that the outcome would have been any different. I just can ' t believe that the Chilean defendants who ultimately did defend the case vigorously would have just rolled over and accepted a default judgment against them . </defend.v.1547><defend.v.1548>Comments While we encourage you to express your opinions , FiveOuncesofPain.com does not support and will not tolerate fighter bashing. 2 Responses to Report : Vladimir Matyushenko to defend title vs. Alexandre Ferreira during August IFL show </defend.v.1548><defend.v.1549>At first glance , this sounds like an anarchistic denial that anyone entered into the social contract at all. After all , the point of the social contract is to give up natural rights to defend oneself , because the unbridled exercise of these rights leads to feuding. Without such alienation of rights to self-defense , the government would lack any authority to regulate self-defense by law . </defend.v.1549><defend.v.1550>On assuming office , Attorney General Ashcroft took an oath to support and defend the Constitution , which includes the Second Amendment. From the standpoint of legal ethics , it is admirable when prosecuting authorities candidly concede that they or their predecessors took an erroneous position regarding the law , for their duty is to see that justice is done , not to win cases at any price. Yet VPC has filed an ethics complaint against Ashcroft for expressing in good faith ( and with persuasive documentation ) an opinion about a provision of the Bill of Rights . </defend.v.1550><defend.v.1551>Among the natural rights of the colonists are these : first , the right to life; secondly , to liberty; thirdly , to property; together with the right to support and defend them in the best manner they can.

See the definitions above for this word. If the party being sued wishes to defend the action , they must serve a Statement of Defence on the opposing party and file a copy at court within the time limits. An action will typically only go to trial if the other side is defending. If the person being sued does not defend within the required time , there is usually no need to go to a trial. The court can grant judgment without a trial . </defend.v.1552><defend.v.1553>Given the insurer 's initial position of denying coverage , the insured submitted that any counsel appointed by the insurer to represent the insured would be in a conflict of interest since such counsel might tend to steer the defence in a direction that would favour the insurer over the insured. In view of the insurer 's initial refusal to defend the action , and in view of the parties ' ongoing dispute over the scope of the insurance coverage , the Appeal Court concluded that there was no reason not to uphold the trial judge 's finding that the insured was entitled to choose its own defence counsel . </defend.v.1553><defend.v.1554>" We 're looking to get him back pretty soon.

Oh yeah , did I mention increased confidence ? In my time at the school I 've enjoyed watching new students progress and gain confidence. The transformations are an amazing thing to see. I personally feel a lot better equipped with the training I 've received should I be forced to defend myself or my family.

Excuses Nobody likes it when their profession is being belittled , but rest assured that is not what is happening here. A criminal defense lawyer can be a respectable profession , as long as morality stays intact. An attorney at law that truly believes that they are not being unethical and makes excuses for their actions can not be defended . </defend.v.1558><defend.v.1559>" Those who hold the reins of government should not forget that it is the duty of public authority by appropriate laws and sanctions to defend the lives of the innocent , and this all the more so since those whose lives are endangered and assailed can not defend themselves. Among whom we must mention in the first place infants hidden in the mother 's womb. And if the public magistrates not only do not defend them , but by their laws and ordinances betray them to death at the hands of doctors or of others , let them remember that God is the Judge and Avenger of innocent blood which cried from earth to Heaven.

It 's in the same category as Rand 's other famous psychological statement of " No woman should aspire to be President of the United States. " It 's interesting that Peikoff and his followers are quite willing to declare Rand 's statement about a woman President to be separate and distinct from the philosophy of Objectivism , but apparently are willing to fight to the death to defend the equally-shaky psychological notion of inherently dishonest ideas. It is also interesting to note that Rand herself never wrote on the subject of inherently dishonest ideas. Her writings and public behavior would certainly lead one to conclude that she did support the concept of inherently dishonest ideas. How else could she instantly conclude , on the basis of a single question , that a questioner was evasive and dishonest ? Nevertheless , the actual concept of inherently dishonest ideas is not to be found in Rand 's writings , although it 's implied in many ways. For example , writing in her essay , " The Psychology of Psychologizing , " Rand states : </defend.v.1562><defend.v.1563>If you qualify for a court-appointed attorney , the judge may assign a lawyer known as a public defender to take your case. The Public Defender 's Office is paid for by public funds. The duty of a public defender is to defend people who can not afford to hire a lawyer. Sometimes a public defender may not be available. In such a case , the court will appoint a private attorney to represent you. The private attorney is then paid with public funds like the public defender . </defend.v.1563><defend.v.1564>Nor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of its members; but that they might live well : for otherwise a state might be composed of slaves , or the animal creation ... nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from injuries , or for a commercial intercourse.

The Special Rapporteur concluded that the harassment and intimidation of defence lawyers by Royal Ulster Constabulary officers were consistent and systematic. He considered that the murder of a lawyer who had defended people charged with offences related to terrorism , who had been threatened during interrogations of clients by members of the security forces , had a " chilling effect " on the legal profession and further undermined public confidence in the legal system.

In the book of Esther , for instance , Ahasuerus , the king of Persia , passed a law in 473 B.C. allowing the Persians to kill their Jewish neighbors. But the Jews did n't passively submit; their use of defensive force prevented a calamity of immense proportions. ( In this case , the government also permitted the Jews to defend themselves , but the morality of their defense was not dependent on men 's approval. ) In much the same way , when abortion was first legalized in our nation , if the people had resisted this atrocity with the means necessary , it would have saved millions of children from a bloody death. It is not unwise or unspiritual , thus , to use the means that God has appointed for keeping His commandments; rather , it is presumptuous to neglect these means and expect Him to work apart from them . </defend.v.1571><defend.v.1572>I have said all along , that I am on a greater mission than just clearing my name.

The accused possessed the " shanks " for a purpose dangerous to the public peace , since he intended to use them to harm another person or persons. Self-defence does not negate the mens rea of s. 88 ( 1 ); Rather it is a justification for conduct that would otherwise attract criminal liability. An accused can be excused from criminal liability under s. 88 ( 1 ) where possession of a weapon is necessary for defending himself. On the facts of this case , the defence of necessity is made out. The accused possessed the weapons to defend himself against an imminent attack and had a reasonable belief that the circumstances afforded him no legal way out; also , the harm he sought to avoid outweighed the breach of s. 88 ( 1 ) . </defend.v.1582><defend.v.1583>Blakey gave an uplifting team talk to his dispirited team at half-time , and was to give a dis-heartened Rai a further 5 minutes before doing a tactical switch to bring on another striker , Ian Thomlinson. Vets 1 were now playing with 3 at the back and with 3 forwards in a frantic search for an equaliser. Martin came off his line in decisive fashion more than once to contain things at the back , as Nato restricted themselves to counter-attacks. But we continued to be second to the ball , and failed to retain sufficient possession. Thomlinson , Francey and Glover all went close , but we were being held back just outside their 18-yard box and were not getting any real penetration. McGrath , still not fully recovered from his hamstring injury , then came on for an exhausted Donnelly. Vets 1 were now stringing 4 players across the front line , as McGrath pushed forward into the space as Nato were content to sit back and defend their lead.

" 102 As I have demonstrated , this fails as a standard-right justification , since one has a natural right to defend oneself against punishment only if one is innocent -- and even the innocent 's right to self-defense would be alienated upon entering civil society.103 To enter civil society is to accept the state 's authority to adjudicate and punish , which means accepting the state 's decisions even if they are wrong . </defend.v.1589><defend.v.1590>Ironically , the issue has gained momentum in recent years because of the success of ( amongst others ) the media in reshaping defamation laws in Australia. Most importantly , public interest is no longer part of the defence of truth in a defamation claim. One can now defend a defamation action by showing that the published material was " substantially true " . No longer is it necessary to show that the material is also a matter of public interest. The requirement of an element of public interest provided a constraint on what the media could report.

However , it does not follow that a " paid " lawyer is always better than an appointed lawyer. If a lawyer agrees to handle a serious criminal case , such as an armed robbery , for a fee that is significantly less than what other lawyers have quoted , you should be very suspicious of that lawyer 's ability to handle the case properly. There is a reason why his fee is so low.

The popular view is more like -- shooting burglars is a public good , and if someone advances on you , unarmed , but with violent intent , despite warning that you are armed , well , he 's going down and you 're in the right.

Occurrence was defined as an accident , including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions. The policy excluded coverage for bodily injury expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. In her sexual assault complaint , Cain had alleged that , as a result of Dial ' s inappropriate behavior , she had suffered an upset stomach , headaches , and a loss of normal life. On appeal , Pekin argued that the allegations in Cain ' s sexual assault complaint were excluded from coverage because Dial ( the insured ) could have anticipated his behavior could cause the injury Cain suffered. The Appellate Court of Illinois , Fifth District , agreed. Even though Cain ' s complaint was couched in terms of negligence , the complaint alleged a course of conduct that was clearly intentional and not merely negligent or accidental. If Dial behaved as the complaint alleged , Cain ' s injuries were a probable result that could have been anticipated by Dial. Thus , Cain ' s bodily injuries were excluded from coverage because they were expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured , and Pekin had no duty to defend Dial . </defend.v.1642><defend.v.1643>The problem was that the initial route was modified.

Invariably , such proceedings are decided by reading the claim or claims asserted in the statement of claim in the underlying action with the coverage provided by the insurance policy. If one or more of the claims in the underlying action fall within coverage , the insurer has a duty to defend the action on behalf of the insured.

The department , in quoting Regulation 107 , asserts that the duty to defend consists of more than simply paying defence costs and entails providing a proper defence . Notably , however , Regulation 107 regulates only whether a policy may place defence costs inside the limits of liability ( ie , provide that defence costs reduce or exhaust the policy ' s limits of liability ) , and does not regulate whether a policy must contain a duty to defend.

The insurer ' s duty to defend , as well as the covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in any insurance policy , requires the insurer to provide defense counsel whose representation will comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct and common law fiduciary duties. Likewise , the insurer-proposed defense counsel has an independent duty to the policyholder to comply with these obligations. As a practical matter , these obligations substantially limit the insurer ' s ability and right to select defense counsel for its policyholder.

First , based on certain coverage exclusions in its policy with the insured , defendant argued that it had no duty to defend or to indemnify its insured against plaintiff 's claims in the underlying action. Second , it argued that plaintiff had acquired no rights against it as a result of the assignment from the insured. In a letter opinion , the trial court agreed with defendant that the coverage exclusions applied and , therefore , granted defendant 's motion and denied plaintiff's. The trial court did not address defendant 's argument that plaintiff had acquired no enforceable rights as a result of the assignment . </defend.v.1696><defend.v.1697>I want American Jews to be viewed by non-Jews as being strong and able to defend ourselves.

If there is only one exposure the pathogen will be suppressed or it will mutate and become a different manifestation. This is important because the intestinal yeast infection can cause autoimmune disease that has similar symptoms continuously , indicating that it is probably the primary cause of fibromyalgia.

Where the evidence is flimsy , a prudent police officer will generally elect not to file charges unless and until he or she can acquire more solid evidence. Felony drug cases are generally the most difficult cases to defend , as they often involve a sale of drugs either directly to an undercover police officer or to a confidential informant , while the police are observing , recording or filming the transaction.

Nevertheless , it is the wrong strategy for defending real world affirmative action. The programs legitimated under the Civil Rights Act , in both their nonpreferential and preferential forms , had and have a clear aim : to change institutions so that they can meet the nondiscrimination mandate of the Act. Selection by race or gender was and is a means to such change. To the extent that such selection also compensates individuals for past wrongs or puts people in places they really deserve , these are incidental by-products of a process aimed at something else . </defend.v.1790><defend.v.1791>Thus the court concluded that without express language in the insurance contract agreeing to defend and indemnify its insured in a qui tam action , the insurer was not obligated to defend or indemnify absent actual property damage. The Port had argued that the loss of the use of the security system and the need to replace it constituted a loss of the use of property , which would amount to property damage. The court flatly rejected these contentions. Judge Bloom found no error in the circuit court 's conclusion that a claim of contractual nonperformance did not equate to property damage , as that term is defined in the policies. The court nevertheless was compelled to vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand , for in an action seeking a declaratory judgment , summary judgment is improper. Although the rationale behind both the trial and appellate orders are very similar , the terms of the declaratory judgment must be set forth separately. That is , when entering a declaratory judgment , the court must state its declaration of the rights of the parties. This serves to give the parties and the public fair notice of what the court has determined . </defend.v.1791><defend.v.1792>When these white blood cells are destroyed or weakened , they will no longer be able to defend the body effectively against other infections.

Nickerson , however , the use of arms in defending property must be limited to where it is appropriate.336 This concern about the appropriateness of such use of firearms is not a reason for denying an individual right to bear arms; it is instead an example of how the right can be reasonably regulated , which is within the government 's power.337 </defend.v.1793><defend.v.1794>The department first seeks to support its conclusion by referencing Section 1113 ( a ) ( 13 ) of the New York Insurance Code , which defines ' personal injury liability insurance ' ( of which D &amp;O liability is a type ) as insurance against legal liability of the insured and against loss , damage or expense incident to a claim of such liability . The department states that pursuant to this statutory language , D &amp;O insurance must include coverage for legal defence costs associated with a covered claim . Of course , this basic statement provides little or no support for the department ' s position , because both non-duty-to-defend and duty-to-defend D &amp;O policies provide coverage for legal defence costs associated with a covered claim . There appears to be no reason to conclude that Section 1113 ( a ) ( 13 ) mandates that D &amp;O policies place the duty to defend on insurers . </defend.v.1794><defend.v.1795>Construing the duty to defend broadly , the Washington Supreme Court held that Fireman ' s Fund owed a duty to defend Dr. Woo under its professional liability coverage because inserting fake boar tusks in a patient ' s mouth during a dental procedure conceivably fell within both the state dental statute ' s and policy ' s broad definition of the practice of dentistry . </defend.v.1795><defend.v.1796>" Fantastic self defence course !

Moreover , under Court Rule 4 : 42-9 ( a ) ( 6 ) , the law firm was awarded a significant portion of the legal fees it incurred in defending the declaratory judgment action . </defend.v.1797><defend.v.1798>Player intelligence. As is common for defenders , full backs need to decide during the flow of play whether to stick close to a winger or maintain a suitable distance. Full backs that stay too close to attacking players are vulnerable to being pulled out of position and leaving a gap in the defence. A quick passing movement like a pair of one-two passes will leave the channel behind the defending full-back open. This vulnerability is a reason why wingers considered to be dangerous are double-marked by both the full-back and the winger. This allows the full back to focus on holding his defensive line.

New York decision in 1905 , the Supreme Court struck down regulations that infringed on economic liberties. The " due process " clause of the Fifth Amendment states : " No person shallbe deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law " The Supreme Court doctrine of " substantive due process " developed to protect substantive rights &amp;emdash; private property and contracts &amp;emdash; from new economic regulations. In addition , the " contracts clause " in Article 1 , Section 10 ( " No state shallpass anyLaw impairing the Obligation of Contracts " ) was viewed by the court to mean exactly what it says. ( Minimum wage laws , for example , were viewed as an infringement of the right of people to make voluntary contracts. ) Other sections of the Constitution were also cited to defend the rights of contract and property from " social " legislation passed by state and federal governments in the first decades of this century . </defend.v.1799><defend.v.1800>What you need to consider is that from the moment a physician peer review inquiry , medical license investigation or similar effort is initiated , you are involved in a legal process , and you need a legal defense.

As written , those laws suggest that only certain people , in " special " circumstances , are entitled to defend themselves from deadly violence with lethal force , and that those who face only the " ordinary " risk of criminal violence do not deserve the right to carry the means with which to defend themselves. The implicit suggestion that some people 's lives are more worth protecting than are the lives of others is morally repugnant and insupportable. The frustration of the common , law-abiding citizen 's desire to protect himself ( and increasingly , herself ) from violent crime has led to vociferous demands for the replacement of those laws with licensing regimes based on satisfaction of nondiscretionary , objectively verifiable and enumerated criteria . </defend.v.1837><defend.v.1838>More will sometimes be demanded of you than is reasonable. Bear it meekly , and exhaust your time and strength in performing your duties , rather than in vindicating your rights. Be silent , even when you are misrepresented.

Yet , in counselling you thus , I would not be understood to be a total non-resistant; a perfectly passive , non-elastic sand-bag , in society; but I would not have you resist until the blow be aimed , not so much at you , as , through you , at the sacred cause of human improvement , in which you are engaged , a point at which forbearance would be allied to crime . </defend.v.1838><defend.v.1839>In a lengthy opinion , the Appellate Court of Illinois , First District , Fourth Division , found in favor of Coregis. In reaching its decision , it emphasized the difference between a contract that is void ab initio ( since inception ) and one that is voidable. A contract that is void ab initio is one that legally never existed. A voidable contract is one that can be ratified and enforced by the obligor. The court disagreed with the lower court ' s finding that the Coregis policy was void ab initio; however , it found that the contract was voidable. Under Illinois law , a material misrepresentation grants an insurer the right to rescind the policy , if that right is invoked promptly. The issue , then , was whether Coregis waived its right to rescind the policy by waiting approximately one year after learning of the misrepresentation to file its declaratory judgment action. The court found it did not. In fact , according to the court , Coregis did exactly what insurers must do if they want to preserve their right to deny coverage , refuse to defend , or decline to indemnify . </defend.v.1839><defend.v.1840>" [ A ] valuable public purpose is served in protecting the effective operation and maintenance of the administration of a public office.

Co. of Omaha v. Jewish Children ' s Bureau of Chicago , No. 1-02-2165 ( Ill. Ct.

The court held that since a potential for coverage was acknowledged by the insurer , it could not sit idly by and do nothing and was obligated to provide a defense. Once it assumed a potential for liability , and agreed to provide a defense , non-action was no longer an option. </defend.v.1842><defend.v.1843>The first instinct of people who are being accused is to defend themselves by explaining the innocence of their conduct to the agent. This is also the approach often advocated by the civil lawyers used by the accused for other matters , and this is to be expected. After all , the proper response to a civil lawsuit is a pleading called the " Answer " , a document which responds to a plaintiff 's complaint with denials , explanations , facts , and even counterclaims.

The court rejoined that it disagreed with the premise upon which Centennial ' s argument rests that there was ' no potential ' that the allegations against Patterson involved a claim not barred under the Exclusion. Id. at 54. Though acknowledging that the underlying complaint alleged that Patterson had committed various crimes , such as racketeering and perjury , which if proven would fall within the exclusion , it is not essential under Maine law that all claims against the insured in the underlying complaint raise the possibility of coverage for the insurer ' s duty to defend to be triggered , at least where the claims arise from common issues of fact.

" Furthermore , the complaint alleges that those actions " created a hostile , sexually harassing environment which disrupted plaintiff 's emotional tranquility in her workplace and interfered with and undermined plaintiff 's personal sense of well being. " We conclude that the claim for damages for sexual harassment arises from events fitting the ordinary meaning of the term " harassment " discussed above.

They defend the religion , while ignoring or perhaps never experiencing the relationship.

The usual limits on the common law defence of necessity apply. First , the defence of necessity is limited to situations of clear and imminent peril. Thus , necessity would not excuse the possession of a weapon simply because the accused lived in a high-crime neighbourhood or finds himself among a dangerous prison population. Second , the act must be unavoidable in that the circumstances afford the accused no reasonable opportunity for a legal way out , such as escaping or seeking police protection. Finally , the harm inflicted must be less than the harm sought to be avoided : Perka v.

The lower courts have traditionally found that possessing a weapon for the purpose of self-defence negates the mens rea of s. 88 ( 1 ) . In my view , however , the possession of a weapon for the purpose of defending oneself does not make that possession lawful. Self-defence does not vitiate the mens rea of an offence , rather it is a justification for conduct that would otherwise attract criminal liability : R. v. Hibbert , [ 1995 ] 2 S.C.R. 973 , at para. 47.

Ironically , the simplistic official justification for selective service comes closer to the mark , once the nonmilitary functions of military institutions are understood. As a control device over the hostile , nihilistic , and potentially unsettling elements of a society in transition , the draft can again be defended , and quite convincingly , as a " military " necessity . </defend.v.1961><defend.v.1962>In the days ahead , we must be clear on the difference between loyalty and patriotism.

For example , in the early history of Rome , the city would see 70 of its young men killed or maimed in a single battle.

Historically , foreign observers have perceived U.S. administrative and regulatory agencies to be imbued with some of the same informality and " can do " spirit which otherwise characterize American society. To a certain degree this perception may , even in the past , have reflected an idealized and overly idyllic view of U.S. reality. However that may be , it is a perception that has become markedly less realistic in recent decades. U.S. administrative agencies on all levels have become noticeably more rigid and bureaucratized over the last twenty to thirty years , a development that may in part be the result of the relaxation of standing requirements for bringing lawsuits against administrative agencies to block or challenge their decisions. The increased risk of having to defend against lawsuits has made administrative agencies less flexible and more formalistic and rule governed.

App. 3d 70 ( 1992 ) , Wausau insists that an insured must tender its defense to an insurer in order to trigger the insurer 's duty to defend. A tender pursuant to Institute of London Underwriters required the insured to notify the insurer that a suit , which potentially falls within the policy coverage , was filed and that the insured desires the insurer 's assistance in defending the suit.

Some appellate decisions clouded the waters on the insurer ' s right to reimbursement , indicating that before such a claim could be filed , the insured must agree with the insurance company ' s reservation ( which will almost never occur ) .

As a result , an insurer that fails to timely defend its insured is liable for the costs incurred in the defense , 18 interest per year and attorneys fees.

It should remain an argument among friends; each of us struggling to hear our conscience , and heed its demands; each of us , despite our differences , united in our great cause , and respectful of the goodness in each other.

At no time , EVER , is deadly force to be used in defense of property. That can be replaced . </defend.v.2094><defend.v.2095>Defense counsel complied with defendant 's instructions. For example , when defense counsel sought to take positions as to whether certain evidence should be admissible or regarding proposed jury charges , he told the trial court that defendant did not permit him to take positions and no positions were taken. Additionally , the trial court felt bound to enforce defendant 's instructions and , on numerous occasions , did enforce the instructions. At one point , the trial court stated , " Mr. Henriquez , I am respecting your right to restrict your attorney in the way he defends you. " Moreover , the trial court repeatedly acknowledged during the trial that defendant was represented by counsel . </defend.v.2095><defend.v.2096>Plaintiff argues that , under Jaloff v. United Auto Indemnity Exch. , 121 Or 187 , 253 P 883 ( 1927 ) , defendant waived those policy provisions by refusing to defend the insured in the underlying action. Plaintiff is correct with respect to the second and third provisions , which concern the duties of the insured. In Jaloff -- which , contrary to defendant 's position , has not been " effectively * * * overruled " -- the Supreme Court held that , when an insurer refuses to defend an action , it waives policy provisions requiring the amount of the loss to be determined after a trial and prohibiting the insured from settling claims without the insurer 's consent. 121 Or at 196-200. The second and third provisions identified above are of the same sort as those at issue in Jaloff , and we conclude that defendant waived those provisions by refusing to defend its insured in the underlying action . </defend.v.2096><defend.v.2097>1.

If you use an " arm " to tenderize your burgers or if you use it to defend yourself against an aggressor , what difference does it make what the Constitution says about an alleged " right " to self-defense ( or a " right " to pound that t-bone until ready for the grill ) ? What difference does it matter about what it says regarding a " right " to due process ? These are restrictions on the state , not a list of things that tell someone what they can or ca n't do. Courts are there to determine ( after the fact ) if an action was illegal and deserves punishment . </defend.v.2101><defend.v.2102>If citizens do have a natural right to use arms in self-defense , it can not be the right to use arms whenever it is necessary to protect themselves from harm , but only when it is necessary to protect their other natural rights. For example , if someone enters my house with the manifest intent to kill me , I have a natural right to protect myself , but the intruder has no such natural right to defend herself against me.149 I have a right to self-defense because my right to life has been violated.150 The intruder has no right to self-defense , because I am not violating her right to life.151 But such limitation on the natural right to [ *pg 161 ] self-defense is unlikely to be objected to by Second Amendment advocates , who recognize that an individual right to bear arms would protect only the use of arms in legitimate defense of one 's rights.152 </defend.v.2102><defend.v.2103>In the State of New York , a primary insurer has the primary duty to defend a lawsuit on behalf of its insured without any entitlement to contribution from an excess insurer.

Many defense counsels may defend one person held in custody , accused or defendant . </defend.v.2105><defend.v.2106>One final point to keep in mind is that most lawsuits do not result in a trial. Often , the parties reach an agreement or settlement between themselves before the case is tried or decided. For example , if you know that you infringed a copyrighted work and the copyright owner sues you , you might try to negotiate a settlement such as paying the copyright owner a sum of money and promising to stop infringing. However , just because a case is settled does not mean that either party is admitting that they did anything wrong. In reality , you might agree to settle a case even if you believe you are not guilty of anything in order to avoid the expense of defending yourself in a lawsuit. For example , if you are sued for $ 100 for copyright infringement and believe you are 110 not guilty , you might consider settling for $ 100 rather than spending thousands of dollars to prove yourself innocent. This may not seem right , but practical consideration sometimes outweigh right and wrong . </defend.v.2106><defend.v.2107> I really wasn ' t going to do it again , he said.

The court also found that the " liability assumed in a contract " exclusion applied to the " personal injury " coverage to eliminate any indemnity obligation. The court also held that even though Golden Eagle had no duty to defend Cen-Fed in the underlying action , it was nonetheless liable for paying the costs of suit , including attorney 's fees , awarded to WMB because Golden Eagle in fact defended the underlying action and the policies obligate it to pay any cost award against its insured , regardless of the court 's determination that no duty to defend the underlying action was ever owed . </defend.v.2108><defend.v.2109>In Record-A-Hit , Inc. v.

After Burlington and Faragher were decided , employers had the ability to defend harassment actions through the use of a well-written policy against harassment and by promptly conducting an investigation and remedying , if necessary , any complaints of harassment. Under the Burlington/Faragher scheme , employees had to inform their employers and give them a chance to investigate and remedy alleged supervisor harassment ( provided it did not take the form of a termination , demotion or other tangible job loss ) before having the ability to effectively pursue a legal remedy. This afforded employers the opportunity to fix problems or , at a minimum , make an informed decision as to the nature of the harassment and the potential liability imposed thereby . </defend.v.2110><defend.v.2111>There are ways defending against this.

Darwin adhered to a blood-mixing account of inheritance , in which " gemmules " in the blood transmitted characteristics , possibly even some acquired ones. Galton put this to the test by performing blood transfusions on rabbits , in experiments that Darwin enthusiastically followed. But the rabbits paid no attention to " pangenesis " and Galton was forced to conclude that Darwin was wrong. Darwin took this painfully , and fought a rear-guard action against the experiments , despite his close involvement in them from the beginning , and fudged the concepts to defend the theory. Galton did his best to assuage Darwin , whom he held in great esteem , and may have been diverted by Darwin from grasping fully the Mendelian account of genetic inheritance , something he came very close to in his own experiments on sweet peas . </defend.v.2116><defend.v.2117>The worm was relatively quickly contained -- within a week for most networks.

Continental and Kaplan filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The circuit court issued a written Memorandum Opinion and Order wherein it found that all of the claims asserted by Chubko against Kaplan in the underlying action sought recovery for injuries incurred as a consequence of legal fees charged by Kaplan and were , as a result , excluded from coverage under the terms of the Policy. The circuit court granted Continental 's motion for summary judgment and denied Kaplan 's cross-motion.

The record reveals that the circuit court was presented with argument on the issue of whether the Arkansas complaint was a suit within the meaning of the policies ' language. Ehlco presented a memorandum of law in support of its pleadings in which Ehlco maintained that Wausau 's duty to defend had been triggered. Wausau argued that no triggering event had occurred because there was no suit within the meaning of its policies. Ehlco responded : " Wausau 's claim that the underlying environmental matters were not suits *** is plainly wrong. Those matters involved actions filed in federal courts *** and a *** [ PRP ] letter from the [ EPA ] . " In support of this assertion , Ehlco directed the circuit court to the copies of the complaints filed in both the Wyoming and Arkansas actions. Given that Ehlco argued to the circuit court that the Arkansas complaint was a suit requiring a defense , this claim was preserved. That Ehlco also argued in the circuit court that Wausau 's duty to defend was triggered by the PRP letter is of no consequence with regard to waiver. Therefore , Wausau 's waiver argument is without merit . </defend.v.2226><defend.v.2227>Other Canadian authority overwhelmingly supports the view that normally the duty to defend arises only with respect to claims which , if proven , would fall within the scope of coverage provided by the policy : see Dobish v.

While acknowledging payment of defense costs up until August 27 , 2009 , the insurer retroactively declined to extend coverage for costs and charges incurred in defending the SEC and criminal action after that date. The plaintiffs , in turn , filed the instant action. The plaintiffs then filed a motion seeking an order from the court directing defendant to pay plaintiffs ' defense costs in the underlying criminal action and the SEC action pending adjudication in those cases.

They commonly compare killing abortion providers to killing a household intruder , rather than to killing those who are slaughtering people in state-protected killing centers ( like those that existed in Nazi Germany ) . It is wrong , therefore , to assume that the force that may be excessive in defending one 's own household from an intruder is necessarily excessive under circumstances where people are being brought to secure locations and murdered under police protection. For instance , it would have likely been wrong for Abraham to have pursued and killed a thief if he had only invaded his tent and stolen some of his property. But , under the very different circumstance described in Genesis 14 , Abraham was blessed by God for pursuing Lot 's abductors , attacking and killing them by night , and pursuing them as they fled . </defend.v.2289><defend.v.2290>The Thomas More Society had quite a productive decade.

This would be tantamount to saying that " the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty , which form the basis whereupon these republics , their laws and constitutions , are erected " mean nothing. Why then not also conclude that these republics , their laws and constitutions can be thereby declared to mean nothing either ? And ipso facto , the power of the governors , legislatures and courts of " these republics " can be thereby declared to mean nothing either. To nullify these foundational principles by interpretation , construction or dislike destroys the law itself and must invariably destroy the governments and branches of governments based thereupon.

Underwriters was obliged to defend and indemnify Shelby in the Szpakowski action. The complaint against City Club and the named officers was dismissed because those parties were not seeking coverage under the policy. Finally , because there was a conflict in the law regarding attorneys ' fees , two questions were certified to the Court of Appeals of New York. The first question was whether , in a case in which an insurance company brings a declaratory judgment action to determine that it does not have obligations under the policy but has defended in the underlying suit , a prevailing defendant in the action should be awarded attorneys ' fees.

When this solution moves in the blood to the lungs it shifts towards the oxidized form and when it then moves to the cells ( mitochondria ) it delivers that oxidation potential , shifting towards the reduced state. In this way megadoses of vitamin C serve as an oxygen transport system supplementing hemoglobin. Increased oxygen transport allows increased aerobic metabolism resulting in increased cellular energy. The cells with more energy can do more to defend themselves and a person 's health. Since oxygen transport is so fundamentally required for aerobic metabolism , one might expect megadoses of vitamin C , enhancing oxygen transport and thus cellular energy in all cells , to have the truly broad ranging benefits that are observed . </defend.v.2300><defend.v.2301>This research paper discusses whether juvenile defendants in criminal or civil proceedings in California have the right to defend themselves ( in propria persona or pro per , sometimes referred to as pro se ) and , if so , on what conditions. Since the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Faretta v. California , 422 U.S. 866 ( 1975 ) , defendants in state criminal actions have been held under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to have a right to defend themselves without the benefit of counsel , provided that the court involved has satisfied itself after inquiry that the defendant has made an intelligent and knowing waiver of his or her right to be represented by counsel. This right of self-representation has been acknowledged by California statutes and the case law to apply to criminal proceedings involving juveniles , however , that right is hedged about by restrictions on the freedom of action of the juvenile which may under certain circumstances render it nugatory. More limited statutory rights for juveniles to represent themselves apply as well in some types of civil proceedings , especially where their interests and those of their parents or legal guardians conflict . </defend.v.2301><defend.v.2302>delivers powerful antivirus and antispyware protection using layered technologies to defend your PC.

The first consideration is to see whether the said decision of the trial Judge comes within the provision of section 220 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the 1979 Constitution. It seems to me that the framers of the Constitution having set out the situations where an intending appellant can appeal as of right to the Court of Appeal in section 220 ( 1 ) and had made other provisions in section 221 ( 1 ) where appeals lie with leave , it intentionally excluded any right of appeal in the three cases set out in section 220 ( 2 ) ( a ) ( b ) and ( c ) .

Unless the government gives [ *pg 147 ] the defendant a weapon to defend what she thinks are her reserved rights , the government 's authority over the defendant is absolute. Of course , the government may give the defendant many legal entitlements -- to due process , privacy , free speech , and so on.

Monocytes contain many lysosome granules and cytoplasmic granules , which aid in killing the foreign matter. These cells usually leave the bloodstream and can become macrophages , which go into the tissue. Their main function is to help remove debris from infections that have passed. Monocytes also help to defend against fungi and diseases like Tuberculosis. Although monocytes are quite small , they can quickly transform into larger , more powerful cells called macrophages. Macrophages contain lysosomes full of special enzymes and chemicals , which allow them to ingest and digest dangerous microbes. These cells do not circulate in the blood stream. Macrophages inhabit the more susceptible areas of the body , to protect the body 's vital organs. ( i.e. Macrophages are found where lungs receive outside air and where liver cells connect with blood vessels. ) The number of macrophages in one 's body can increase drastically in a short period of time. These cells are capable of reproducing on their own , and are very long lived . </defend.v.2356><defend.v.2357>Brett Golledge , UK , Tony Martin did not state in his evidence given to the Police or in court that he fired his gun as a reactionary measure. What he did say was that he intended to kill , ( not simply to defend himself ) . He stated to Police and in court repeatedly that he intended to kill anyone that entered his property ( whether armed or not themselves ) . The law allows anyone to use reasonable force to defend oneself and whilst I have great sympathy with a lot of the views which have been expressed so far , the plain fact is that Tony Martin had the opportunity to say that he fired the gun because he was defending his own life , but he did not. It seems to me that he killed quite coldly by shooting someone in the back , striking out his own anger at societies inept ability to protect his property. Either way he is Guilty of murder . </defend.v.2357><defend.v.2358>Thus it is after considerable prayer and reflection that I am re-posting yesterday 's article , in which I tried to make a distinction between the obligation and desire that we have as Catholics to be duly submissive to our shepherds and the need at the same time to defend those who are suffering from the abuse of clerical authority. Can it be the first impulse of a shepherd to strike the sheep and ban them forever ? Perhaps others who are far , far more learned than I am can answer that question in the affirmative.

The clause in question limited the general contractor ' s status as an additional insured to claims arising out of the subcontractor ' s work. This is a fairly typical additional insured clause in Texas. In this instance , the petition filed by the Plaintiff did not contain language alleging that the cause of action arose in some respect out of the subcontractor ' s work. As a result , under the eight corners rule , the insurer was under no duty to defend the general contractor because the additional insured endorsement limited the general contractor ' s status as an additional insured. The Court would not consider extrinsic evidence that indicated the cause of action did , in fact , arise out of that portion of the work performed by the subcontractor. In this instance , the general contractor was completely at the mercy of the pleadings filed by the Plaintiff. Because the petition did not contain the magic language indicating the cause of action arose out of the subcontractor ' s work , the additional insured endorsement did not apply and there was no duty to defend . </defend.v.2360><defend.v.2361>'Being the defending champions will not put any additional pressure on us.

This is especially important in the conditions of the increased role of and demand for a court as a universal institute for legal settlement of any conflict , which ensures a real direct effect of the Constitution guaranteeing ( Art. 46 ) everyone ' s right to a judicial protection of his rights and freedoms and the right to defend his rights by any means not prohibited by law ( para 2 , Art.45 ) . </defend.v.2383><defend.v.2384>Wausau contends that its late-notice defenses act to excuse its failure to take either of these actions. We disagree. The estoppel doctrine has long provided insurers in Wausau 's circumstances with the proper recourse. If an insurer believes that it received notice too late to trigger its obligations , it should defend its insured under a reservation of rights or litigate the matter in a declaratory judgment action. La Rotunda , 87 Ill. App. 3d at 453; Maneikis , 655 F.2d at 824. The insurer can not simply abandon its insured. We therefore hold that there is no exception to the estoppel doctrine for late-notice defenses of the types asserted here. To hold otherwise would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the estoppel doctrine and its intended enforcement of the duty to defend. See generally S. Nardoni &amp;J. Vishneski , " The Illinois Estoppel Doctrine : Illinois Courts Make it Costly for Insurers to Breach Their Duty to Defend , " 8 Envtl. Cl. J. 45 ( Autumn 1995 ) ( reviewing the history of the estoppel doctrine and arguing against the recognition of an exception for condition precedent defenses ) . </defend.v.2384><defend.v.2385>Consequently , we conclude that the complaint , without amendment , stated a claim for battery that was covered by the policy and defendant , therefore , had a duty to defend its insured in the underlying action.

Although a cynic might say that the most effective way for an individual to preserve the privacy of his thoughts and feelings would be never to disclose them , that course would sacrifice the sort of sharing that constitutes a central value of intimate association which , in turn , is crucial to the development of individuality. It is here that we can see clearly the overlap between privacy as selective nondisclosure and " privacy " as autonomy in intimate personal decisions. Justice Douglas 's Griswold opinion spoke to both concerns : he sought to defend the privacy of the marital bedroom against hypothetical government snooping and to defend a married couple 's autonomy over the intimacies of their relationship. The special constitutional status of the home , recognized in decisions ranging from search and seizure doctrines to the " private " possession of OBSCENITY protected in STANLEY V. ILLINOIS ( 1969 ) , draws not only on the notion of the home as a sanctuary and place of repose but also on the home 's status as the main locus of intimate associations . </defend.v.2387><defend.v.2388>Finally , if the right to bear arms is auxiliary , it would exist to allow individuals to exercise their natural right to use arms to defend their other rights , not because they reserved this right upon entering civil society , but only because they will be freed from the restraints of civil society if the government violates their reserved rights. Unlike an instrumental right to bear arms , the fact that the aggregate effect of this use of arms for self-defense is an increase in the level of violations of natural rights is not a reason to reject this auxiliary right. Freed of any duty to the government , individuals return to the state of nature , and may once again do what they need to do to protect their rights , without concern for whether the aggregate effect of everyone exercising the same rights of self-defense is positive or negative. Therefore , like a standard right to bear arms , it would not be an argument against this auxiliary right that bearing arms , in the aggregate , does nothing to make us more secure in our persons and property . </defend.v.2388><defend.v.2389>In experimenting with designs for tools used to defend and take lives , some things worked better than others. But these took time to permeate across regions to replace earlier patterns. The diversity among rapiers is explained easily enough when we understand that fighting men at the time were discovering what types worked best and how best to use them as swordsmiths were struggling to fulfill their needs. In the " evolution " of Renaissance weapons there were forms of blades developed that were not quite wide enough to cut strongly as other kinds but were also still not narrow and light enough to foyne as well as later " true " rapiers. Being unable to do either very well , they were not popular and in a few decades were quickly replaced by newer forms . </defend.v.2389><defend.v.2390>53 One might ask what the difference is between possession of a concealed weapon on a daily basis to defend oneself , if need be , specially in a dangerous place , and possession to deal with an imminent threat. I think that in the first scenario the purpose is inconsistent with the duty to avoid violent confrontation by escaping , asking for police protection or even negotiating. It reflects a willingness to engage in physical conflict , if confronted , with a weapon. This purpose is contrary to public peace. On the other hand , possession in a particular situation , on a particular day , to meet an immediate threat to one 's life with no real opportunity of avoiding it is a purpose that is not a threat to public peace as such . </defend.v.2390><defend.v.2391>Websites all over the world went blank but only temporarily.

Additionally , the New York Court of Appeals makes a strong point that estopping a carrier from raising coverage defenses on indemnity for a breach of the duty to defend means that the same standard for determining coverage is applied by fiat to both obligations. Normally , the defense obligation would be limited to the four corners of the complaint. Whereas , the indemnity obligation would be determined by the actual facts.

It is important to note that the State will have 21 days to file charges but they can request , and it often happens , a reset to the 30th date from arrest and then to the 33rd date. This is important to know because if charges are not filed by the 33rd date you are entitled to a Release on Your Recognizance.

As such , the Third Circuit Court of Appeals stated that an insurer 's duty to defend under Pennsylvania law was broader than a duty to indemnify , and that the former duty was triggered whenever an underlying complaint may " potentially " come within the insurance coverage. Furthermore , the Court of Appeals noted that if a single claim in a multi-claim law suit was potentially covered , the insurer must defend all claims until there is no possibility that the underlying plaintiff could recover on a covered claim. Also , in determining the existence of a duty to defend , the Court of Appeals stated that the factual allegations of the underlying complaint against the insured are to be taken as true and liberally construed in favor of the insured . </defend.v.2439><defend.v.2440>The court noted that State Farm agreed under the homeowners policy to pay expenses we incur and costs taxed against an Insured in suits we defend. Under the umbrella policy issued by State Farm , it agreed to pay the expenses we incur and costs taxed against you in suits we defend ... The court determined that the contractual obligation to pay costs under these provisions arises only if there is actually a contractual duty to defend. An insurer ' s implied-in-law duty to defend an entire ' mixed ' action , including claims that are not even potentially covered , does not give rise to an obligation under a supplemental payments provision to pay costs awarded against the insured that can be attributed solely to claims that were not potentially covered. Since it was conceded that the policies provided no coverage for the wage and hour claims against the insureds , there was no basis to hold State Farm liable for the attorney fees awarded as costs against the insureds . </defend.v.2440><defend.v.2441>If you face claims that may be covered under an insurance policy , you need an experienced attorney to review your insurance policy to insure your insurance company provides legal counsel or agrees to pay for legal counsel to defend against such claims.

But Dr. Rechkemmer wants to know without a shadow of a doubt. I anticipate more very good news to emerge from our anthocyanin research over the next few years , Rechkemmer says. His investigations do show that elderberry anthocyanins enhance immune function by boosting the production of cytokines. These unique proteins act as messengers in the immune system to help regulate immune response , thus helping to defend the body against disease. When asked if he thinks that further berry research will reveal additional health benefits , Rechkemmer nods. I believe so.

The magistrates in front of whom you first appear have to decide whether the case is suitable for summary trial. If they decide it isn ' t ( ie that it ' s too serious to be heard in a magistrates ' court ) , the case will be sent to Crown court. If they decide the case is suitable , the defendant can accept this or insist that the case goes to Crown court. New proposals put forward by the government would take this right away from the defendant , and leave the decision entirely up to the magistrates. In making their decision , the magistrates would have to consider not only the seriousness of the alleged offence but also the effect a conviction would have on the defendant - ie would it harm his/her reputation , cause him/her to lose their job etc. This suggests that activists with long records would be sent to magistrates ' courts ( where the conviction rate is far higher than in Crown court ) on the basis that they had no reputation to defend , and so would have to put up with second class justice . </defend.v.2457><defend.v.2458>The longest line of such precedents comes from Pennsylvania , where cases from 1917 to 2000 hold that the constitutional right to protect property entitles landowners and their agents to kill wild animals that are threatening the landowner ' s crops , and that it is unconstitutional for state game laws barring the killing of wild animals to be applied in such situations.

Likewise , a California court relied on the California provision to clarify the longstanding principle that self-defense is unavailable when the defender is the one who started a deadly fight , a principle that has sometimes been imprecisely cast as an exception for cases of mortal combat. The jury had been instructed -- in the language of the applicable statute -- that a person claiming [ self-defense ] if he were the assailant or engaged in mortal combat , must really and in good faith have endeavored to decline any further struggle before the homicide was committed ; the court concluded that this instruction was unconstitutional : </defend.v.2469><defend.v.2470>The criminal defense lawyer at our law offices in Evansville can assist you throughout the criminal defense process and help you understand your rights as a criminal defendant.

The Court of Appeal has reaffirmed that , notwithstanding the perspective of the insured , if it takes steps to retain its own counsel to adopt a " preferred strategy " in the defence of the action , it likely does so at its own expense. As long as it can be shown that counsel appointed by the insured to defend the action was not under any set of contradictory mandates , absent any specific policy wording , the insurer does not surrender its right to control a defence of an action and is not obliged to pay for independent counsel retained by the insured . </defend.v.2488><defend.v.2489>Milosevic was unequivocal in his position.

One of the questions that has been examined is whether an insured sometimes has the right to choose defence counsel. The Ontario Court of Appeal , in a recent decision in Appin Realty Corporation , Limited v. Economical Mutual Insurance Company , 1 has answered the question in the affirmative . </defend.v.2491><defend.v.2492> The wordings of section 220 subsection 2 ( a ) of the 1979 Constitution ( Cap 62 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria , 1990 ) , are very clear , they simply mean that there is no right of appeal from A decision of any High Court to the Court of Appeal where the former grants an unconditional leave to defend an action. In my opinion , the dissenting decision of Uwaifo J.C.A , in Societe Generale Bank ( Nig ) Ltd vs. Panatrade Ltd and Others ( 1994 ) 6 NWLR ( Pt. 353 ) 720 at p.734 is correct. The decision of the Court of Appeal in Nishizawa Ltd vs. Jethwani ( 1995 ) 5 NWLR ( pt 398 ) 668 at p. 670 per Nnameka-Agu J.C.A ( as he then was ) appears to me with respect , to be wrong. In reaching that decision the Court of Appeal had to import words not found in the provisions of section 220 subsection ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution to arrive at the decision that there can be an appeal against the granting of an unconditional leave to defend an action. </defend.v.2492><defend.v.2493>God also sanctioned the use of deadly force by an individual in certain circumstances.

Your immune system is like your body ' s army. The immune system consists of types of white blood cells called macrophages , T-cells and B-cells. Here ' s how it works : first , when the germ enters your body , a macrophage finds the bacteria or virus and eats it , and then the macrophage goes to the nearest lymph node or the spleen to tell the T and B cells that germs are invading the body. Next , the T-cells find the germs and start attacking them while the B-cells create antibodies to attack the germs with. The antibodies cover up the germs so they can ' t harm the body anymore and it will be easier for the T-cells to kill the germs , and finally , the germs are killed and they go away . </defend.v.2499><defend.v.2500>A small break made it to the finish.

If you can not afford to hire a lawyer , you can submit the appropriate application , called either Form 13.3 or Pauper ' s Affidavit , which asks the judge to appoint a lawyer to represent you. One good reason to be represented by a lawyer is to make sure your rights have not been violated.

" </defend.v.2506><defend.v.2507>But there can be a dark side to professional paradigms as well. Since observations , approaches , and strategies that do n't conform to the accepted tenets of the dominant paradigm are typically ignored , denied or explained away , an outdated paradigm can insulate a professional community from new developments that are " off the radar screen " of their customary ways of thinking. And the understandable professional impulse to defend and protect a valued paradigm can lead professionals to champion obsolete practices , to stifle needed change , and to make attempts at innovation-within the paradigm-unproductive . </defend.v.2507><defend.v.2508>d. Liability Insurance. Often , the most cost-effective way to obtain protection from legal risk is by means of liability insurance. A typical U.S. commercial liability policy will often provide protection from a surprisingly broad range of claims and lawsuits. The most valuable protection is not necessarily protection from liability , but rather the right to a defense paid for by the insurer. Under U.S. law , an insurer 's duty to assume the insured 's defense and pay his defense costs is much broader than the insurer 's duty to ultimately pay for a judgment or settlement in favor of the claimant. An insurer has a duty to defend whenever there exists a possibility that the insured will ultimately be held liable to the claimant on a theory for which there is coverage. American attorneys can assist in the evaluation of the claim and in asserting your client 's right to coverage against a reluctant insurance carrier . </defend.v.2508><defend.v.2509>The reason I share all this is because none of this is black and white.

Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani was the highest-ranking officer charged in the Haditha incident , in which a series of original investigations found nothing wrong. Ultimately the military restarted the case with a Board of Inquiry which found that Chessani was innocent of misconduct and should not be demoted but still should retire.

It is high time that institutions of higher education the most ardent practitioners of integration today forthrightly defend this ideal in its own right , and that the Supreme Court recognize integration as a compelling interest legitimately addressed through race-conscious means.

[ 89 ] If that number is valid , guns are used far more often to defend against crime than to perpetrate crime. Further , according to both surveys , 45-46 percent of the gun users believed that they or someone else might have been killed had they not used the gun in self-defense. Even if someone 's life was saved in only 5 percent of such cases , however , the surveys imply that 100 , 000 ( 5 percent of 2 million ) lives would be saved each year by the defensive use of firearms , far surpassing the number of lives lost to gun violence and suicide . </defend.v.2519><defend.v.2520>The requirements for defending others are the same as self-defense.

Having served as a defense attorney for several years , I acquired some ability in the field of criminal law that I did not care to just discard , so although the majority of my practice now consists of physician advocacy , I also maintain some criminal practice , which consists mainly of the defense of " white collar crimes. " In the course of that criminal practice , I have observed a trend with regard to the filing of criminal cases , particularly cases filed by the United States Attorney 's Office and state offices of the attorney general. It seems that with each administration , there are prosecutions of choice , that is , prosecutions of Medicare and Medicaid fraud cases that are near and dear to the hearts of Congress and the particular administration in office.

It concluded its written argument by asserting that " Plaintiffs are not entitled in that they were provided a defense to the Ramseys ' claims. " At the November 14 , 2002 , hearing on its motion , Farm Bureau again argued that it did not breach its duty to defend Lee.

It is not necessary to prove that the obligation to indemnify will in fact arise in order to trigger the duty to defend; the mere possibility that a claim within the policy may succeed suffices. Finally , to hold that the insurer is required to defend claims regardless of how far outside the scope of the policy they might be would give rise to practical difficulties. It raises policy questions of whether others in the insurance pool should be taxed with providing defences for matters outside the purview of the policy , and might result in conflicts of interest . </defend.v.2552><defend.v.2553>A significant part of our practice is dedicated to working with small-business employers to defend against class-action lawsuits , which have proliferated in our state since the year 2000.

Summary judgment is not often granted as the Court will not entertain debate about the merits of the defendant 's purportedly " bona fide " defence ( if an affidavit is filed ) as the preferred course of action would be to have the matter properly ventilated in open court. Of course , if the defendant puts up adequate security , the Court will not grant summary judgment and will similarly order that the matter proceed to trial.

They should also maintain their duty to come to the defense of this minorityas necessary to preserve their lives. This response serves several functions : it saves the innocent , and serves as a deterrent to those who are killing the oppressed; it bears testimony to the rights of the oppressed; it also bears witness to the people 's refusal to submit to their neighbor 's slaughter , and their determination to resist such an intolerable situation. The willingness of people to thus resist state-sanctioned murder ( as required by the Moral Law ) is a powerful incentive for the government to protect all the people , and not sanction the murder of any minority ( as occurred in the book of Esther ) . But if the citizens in a nation fail to uphold the right of a threatened minority to be defended , the results could be catastrophic.

In developed countries , where parasitic infestation is relatively low , allergies are more common than in less developed countries. It is thought that when the immune system is fighting parasitic infections , it does not have the resources to defend against less threatening agents. Another theory is that people with poor intestinal health may be more prone to allergies . </defend.v.2574><defend.v.2575>In 1985 Lumumba worked with a legal team that successfully uncovered evidence demonstrating how the FBI targeted and framed activist Geronimo Pratt.

( dissenting ) : The accused 's conviction under s. 88 ( 1 ) of the Criminal Code should be upheld. The trial judge found that the accused had not a single purpose but a double motive , each given the same emphasis , for carrying his knife on the day in question. The accused 's apprehension of a fight with a fellow inmate was one purpose , but this has to be seen in the broader context of the accused 's more general " purpose " of carrying his weapon on every day of his prison life , subjectively contemplating the use of the " shank " in the violent resolution of disputes within the prison population. This broader context raises a more general question about the lawfulness of prisoners carrying weapons inside a maximum security institution and demonstrates " a purpose dangerous to the public peace " within the Criminal Code prohibition. The concept of the " public peace " in s. 88 ( 1 ) aims at a state of order , the very opposite of a state of violent confrontation , and is not much concerned with who is the aggressor and who claims to be defending himself . </defend.v.2576><defend.v.2577>My thoughts and prayers go out to Officer Rivera 's family..

In this case , Shelby , a named insured under the policy , was cast in a defensive posture by U.S. Underwriters. U.S. Underwriters had a duty to defend Shelby , and Shelby ' s recovery of attorneys ' fees was incidental to that duty.

But the Jews did not passively submit; their use of defensive force prevented a calamity of immense proportions. ( In this case , the government also permitted the Jews to defend themselves , but the morality of their defense was not dependent on men 's approval ) . In much the same way , when abortion was first legalized in our nation , if the people had resisted this atrocity with the means necessary , it may have similarly saved millions of people from an untimely death.

The fact that respondents ' subjective impressions might be highly erroneous is not , nonetheless , necessarily good evidence that they did not actually use a gun for defense.

If the law prohibits at least 3.2 of American adult males from buying a gun because of previous criminal behavior -- and there is reason to think that this 3.2 will end up committing almost half of the murders -- it appears that a law banning gun ownership by convicted felons , if actually enforced , would substantially reduce the number of murders.

When Christians will not maintain the means that the Lord has ordained for carrying out His will , but bow in servitude to the devil , it brings a reproach on the Almighty God whom they profess. By not defending the Lord 's little ones , believers misrepresent the King of kings as being an uninvolved and impotent deity.

The problem is that well-intentioned pro-life lawyers , legislators and laymen have principally thought about the substance of Roe as a challenge whereby they must establish in subsequent legislation and litigation , that human life be conceived of in medical terms in order to warrant legal protection. While this is one aspect of the case , it is by no means the best means to protect unborn life.

As I have already illustrated , auxiliary rights are easily confused with standard rights.98 Like a standard right , an auxiliary privilege would not be justified by its instrumental effects , but because it directly protects a reserved natural right , namely , the right to engage in self-defense when one 's other reserved rights are violated. It would not matter that , in the aggregate , exercise of this right failed to increase the likelihood that reserved rights would be protected. Unlike a standard right however , the scope of an auxiliary privilege would fail to correspond with the scope of any moral right that could be legitimately exercised by all those who assert the privilege. It is simply false that all criminal defendants may justifiably engage in self-defense against punishment. Only those whose rights have been violated by the government may legitimately use silence to defend themselves.99 But because the government can not selectively provide the privilege only to those whose resistance to its laws it believes is legitimate without asserting absolute authority , rights of self-defense are provided to all criminal defendants , regardless of the merits of their resistance . </defend.v.2713><defend.v.2714>So you want a reason ?

Second , the argument is completely belied by at least 60 years of experience with discretionary licensing laws , which demonstrates that the issuance of permits under discretionary systems has little to do with rational determinations of who is likely to act responsibly when carrying a gun -- the sole matter that ought to be of concern to the public at large. The power that is conferred on the government under discretionary licensing systems is so broad and uncircumscribed that there is nothing to prevent the police from acting arbitrarily.

[ 83 ] Sir Anthony Mason has also asserted that there is a convention that the Australian Attorney-General defends the judiciary from criticism.

[ 85 ] Arguably , the role of the Attorney-General as defender of the judiciary transcends political exigencies.

Peter was going for his throat , you can be sure. Jesus said , " Put your sword back in its sheath. " He did n't say , " What are you doing with that thing ?

It would appear that the opinion letter fails to address the issue of whether a D &amp;O policy may contain a ' defence costs within limits ' provision. Indeed , duty-to-defend provisions are separate and distinct from provisions that place defence costs ' inside ' or ' outside ' policy limits , and although certain duty-to-defend policies reserve those policies ' limits of liability solely for settlements or judgments , many policies place defence costs inside limits of liability. Such defence costs do erode or exhaust policy limits. Thus , the department ' s position that it will not approve new non-duty-to-defend D &amp;O policy forms does not in itself indicate that the department will not approve new defence costs within limits D &amp;O policy forms . </defend.v.2805><defend.v.2806>Ultimately , the court stated that if it is not clear from the face of a complaint that no potential obligation to indemnify exists , an insurer will be deemed to have breached its duty to defend and be estopped from asserting its coverage defenses unless it : ( 1 ) defends the insured under a reservation of rights; or ( 2 ) commences a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that there is no coverage.

Id. The court found that the magistrate judge had made a reasonable application of Boone in selecting March 23 , 2006 as his ' constructive denial date ' because this was the day Professionals Direct informed Wiles that it was going to seek a declaratory judgment that the Illinois National claim was not covered.

The Court to which the application is made then considers same ex parte and if satisfied that there are good grounds for believing that there is really no defence to the claim enters the suit for hearing in a list which is called the Undefended List and marks the writ of summons accordingly and enters therein a date for hearing.

As is always the case in these situations , it is not the home owner who gets hurt , but , the intruder who wants nothing more than to commit a little random violence who is the victim of gun crime.

According to some teachers of the age the rapier 's manner of fight was actually very easy to acquire. It was still highly methodical , often presented with a wrapping of geometry and involved jargon , and frequently viewed as more refined and scientific than the traditional " military " fencing that it largely replaced off the battlefield. One master in 1617 even claimed a boy of fifteen could learn to defend himself against any man in very few lessons.

It is further interesting that the Court would accept review of an obscure title insurance case to reinforce or restate its duty to defend analysis , including the seemingly more stringent standard established in Woo v. Fireman ' s Fund Ins. Co. , 161 Wn.2d 43 , 164 P.3d 454 ( 2007 ) : ' [ T ] he duty to defend is triggered if the insurance policy conceivably covers the allegations in the complaint , whereas the duty to indemnify exists only if the policy actually covers the insured ' s liability.

Whereas large defendants are generally not too concerned about a single claim , they are very concerned about the economic consequences of losing a class action lawsuit involving dozens or hundreds of claims. They also realize the cost of defending such a claim will be significant. They further realize that the class action will not " go away " by throwing up a couple of legal hurdles. All of these factors create a strong incentive for the defendant to think seriously about proposing a proper settlement offer. Settlement terms that are negotiated and creatively structured are generally much more attractive to a large defendant than having the solution thrust upon them by an independent third party ( a court of law ) . </defend.v.2882><defend.v.2883>We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty.

Rather than giving both sides an opportunity to make their case , the decision shows that the proceeding was little more than a kangaroo court where Israel never stood a chance to defend itself on the need for a security fence to protect its people from terrorism. This opinion also challenges the ability of Israel 's allies to defend themselves in the global war against terrorism . </defend.v.2884><defend.v.2885>An " appearance of impropriety " in the eyes of an insured does not constitute a proper basis for requiring an insurer to surrender control of a defence and to pay for counsel that is retained by the insured. This is only required where there is a true conflict of interest. A conflict of interest will exist only where the insurer puts defence counsel in a position where his mandate from the insurer can reasonably be said to conflict with his mandate to defend the insured in the civil action . </defend.v.2885><defend.v.2886>The Second Amendment does not grant a right to bear arms. It merely protects the right which is the individual 's by virtue of his being human. An individual right to bear arms exists irrespective of government. An individual human being has the right to his life. He therefore has the right to defend his life. And it follows that he also has the right to the means necessary to defend his life. An Individual can delegate his self-defense right to a government , but does not surrender that right. In emergency situations , eg. when there is no time to call the police , an individual has the right to use deadly force to defend himself against an aggressor. A gun is often the best tool to use in defense of his life . </defend.v.2886><defend.v.2887>Contrary to the principles generally followed in Nichols , the motions judge applied the evidence generated by the summary judgment motions and made findings of fact relative to the Gucci claim.

This means that the carrier is trying to reserve the right to refuse at the end of the lawsuit to pay any award or judgment against you. Also , the carrier is often trying to reserve the right to sue you to recover back from you money it paid to the attorneys it hired to defend you . </defend.v.2894><defend.v.2895>Many gun control laws would fall under this rule.

For example , if you need a criminal attorney to defend you in court , your interview questions would be completely different than the questions you might ask an attorney if they were representing you in an insurance law suit.

This deferred involvement of counsel can sometimes prove to be a serious mistake. In controversial rulemakings , experienced counsel serve virtually the same function as they would at trial : marshaling evidence and arguments to persuade the agency of the client 's position and , that failing , to establish the best possible record for judicial review of the final rule. Evidence not presented in a rulemaking ordinarily can not be used to challenge or defend the rule in court; accordingly , it often is critical to develop a rulemaking strategy with the assistance of counsel and an eye toward eventual litigation.

The last six of the Ten Commandments require you to honor your neighbor , defend his life , chastity , property , good name , and to have a loving attitude towards him. It is clearly more important to preserve someone 's life than to preserve his reputation , property , or chastity.

The Taney opinion explained that the parties to the original American social compact were only those " who , at that time [ American independence ] , were recognized as the people or citizens of a State , whose rights and liberties had been outraged by the English Government; and who declared their independence , and assumed the powers of Government to defend their rights by force of arms.

Under Lapham-Hickey , it is clear that a " suit " was filed against Ehlco with respect to the Mena site. The EPA filed a suit against Ehlco in the federal district court in Arkansas , pursuant to CERCLA , on March 17 , 1988. This suit was instituted by the filing of a complaint.

There are a number of issues that the collections agency must prove to obtain a judgment against you , and they typically can not do so , again , as long as you properly defend yourself. You must force them to produce all of the documentary evidence in their claim against you , and then poke legal holes in their case. A knowledgeable consumer attorney can file the proper responses to the lawsuit and you very likely will never end up in a courtroom . </defend.v.2928><defend.v.2929>Impact : The Stanford Ponzi scheme continues to produce litigation and noteworthy decisions concerning coverage under the directors and officers policy. In this case , the policy affirmatively limited the insurance company ' s duty to defend. Despite this , the court employed the eight-corner rule to determine whether the insurer was required to reimburse the policyholders for defense costs incurred. This decision is notable because the court used the same duty to defend standard despite the fact the policy ' s insuring agreement imposed the duty to defend on the insured rather then the insurer . </defend.v.2929><defend.v.2930>Many men feel that the cards are stacked against them when it comes to matters of family law , and it is easy to come to that conclusion.

But the Constitution was designed to prevent a systematic kind of error that follows from the accumulation of political power ( see " Power and Liberty " by Bernard Bailyn , in the February issue of Econ '87 ) . The framers deeply distrusted the centralized political power they had created in the new federal government. To guard against the growth of this power they wrote a Constitution and charged a Supreme Court to defend it. Fear of error , Richard Epstein believes , is insufficient reason not to enforce economic liberties; the Supreme Court , he says , must take these " constitutional protections of economic liberties at their face value.

One of Lumumba ' s attorneys argued that he had spoken out only with the intention of defending his client ' s rights , that the statement made about the judge ' s demeanor was protected as free speech , and that the transcript of the proceedings failed to show any evidence Lumumba had disrespected or disrupted the court.

That is why it is always in your best interest to obtain your own legal representation. There is nothing stopping you defending yourself , in fact you have a right to do so if you wish , but the situation is likely to be emotionally charged , as well as complex , and it may be best to have someone who is not as close to the situation as you are; someone who can guide you through it all with a clear head . </defend.v.2940><defend.v.2941>I conclude that considerations related to insurance law and practice , as well as the authorities , overwhelmingly support the view that the duty to defend should , unless the contract of insurance indicates otherwise , be confined to the defence of claims which may be argued to fall under the policy. That said , the widest latitude should be given to the allegations in the pleadings in determining whether they raise a claim within the policy . </defend.v.2941><defend.v.2942>This duty to defend is not without limits. Insurance policies are written for specific purposes , contain coverage limitations and exclusions and typically even have specific provisions regarding the company 's defense obligations that have been included in the policy expressly to address issues about defense costs that may arise when the insured faces claims and possible litigation. Increasingly , insurance policies are written with aggregate limits , meaning that once the combined cost of a legal defense and payment of coverage exceeds the limits of a particular policy , the insurance company may no longer be obliged to continue providing a defense for its insured. Not infrequently , an issue will also arise as to whether the insurance policy in question was in force on the date of the incidents giving rise to the claims alleged . </defend.v.2942><defend.v.2943>Penal Code 211 robbery is defined as the taking of another 's property from his/her possession or immediate presence accomplished by force or fear.29 As a " forcible and atrocious crime , " it will be presumed that you acted reasonably if you defended yourself while you were being robbed . </defend.v.2943><defend.v.2944>I ca n't blame Burch for coming to Simms defense.

They were known to carry large sums of money , but as they were always armed and ready to defend their possessions they were not often molested. However , on this occasion , just as they were rising in the morning to prepare their breakfast , five white men opened fire on them from ambush and all save one of the Mexicans were killed. This one , though wounded , finally made his escape. A few days after the killing some cowboys on a round-up camped at this place and buried the remains ( what the coyotes 88 had left ) of these five Mexicans. Two years later , at the same place , a cowboy found a leather bag containing seventy-two Mexican dollars , which small amount of money had been overlooked by the robbers . </defend.v.2952><defend.v.2953>Life , they urge , would be intolerable if men were to be guided in all they did by reason and reason only. Reason betrays men into the drawing of hard and fast lines , and to the defining by language -- language being like the sun , which rears and then scorches. Extremes are alone logical , but they are always absurd; the mean is illogical , but an illogical mean is better than the sheer absurdity of an extreme. There are no follies and no unreasonablenesses so great as those which can apparently be irrefragably defended by reason itself , and there is hardly an error into which men may not easily be led if they base their conduct upon reason only . </defend.v.2953><defend.v.2954>Indeed , this latter principle ( insurer must defend entire action even though only small portion is covered ) has resulted in a great deal of gamesmanship on the part of the policyholders ' bar : A policyholder ' s attorney in a typical commercial or business dispute will allege the usual causes of action for breach of contract , fraud , intentional interference with prospective economic advantage , etc. None of these causes of action is covered and , indeed , there is no duty to defend such claims. However , a clever policyholder ' s attorney will tag on at the end of the lawsuit an additional cause of action for negligence , or ( even more popular in recent years ) a cause of action for defamation. Such a claim can trigger a duty to defend that cause of action and , as stated above , if there is a duty to defend a single cause of action , there is a duty to defend the entire complaint. Therefore the insurer is stuck defending what is essentially a business breach of contract/fraud suit the type of suit that can be extremely expensive . </defend.v.2954><defend.v.2955>In addition , if the other party has filed a Notice of Intent to Defend , and will appear in court , you may wish to present the testimony of any other individuals involved in the case ( witnesses ) .

A minority of jurisdictions require a victim to retreat to the wall if it is safe to do so , before using deadly force. Retreat to the wall ' is generally construed to mean taking any reasonable and apparent avenue of exit. However , even minority jurisdictions do not require retreat under three circumstances. There is no duty to retreat from one 's own home , if one is being or has been robbed or raped , or if the victim is a police-officer making a lawful arrest. In 1996 the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that " although a person is afforded discretion in determining necessity , level and manner of force to defend one 's self , the right to use force in self defense is a qualified , not an absolute right.

According to the Superior Court , the owner of the stable should have been defended by his insurers since the second source of liability alleged was not covered by an exclusion clause. Thus , the insurers were ordered to reimburse all of the insured 's defence costs , despite the Court finding categorically that the exclusion applied in relation to the duty to indemnify . </defend.v.2960><defend.v.2961>As citizens in a democracy , it is OUR duty to hold those in power responsable for the orders they issue- to see that the purpose of these orders is indeed noble and just , and when not , to remove those leaders from the chain of command.

Where an accused is found to have possessed a weapon for a defensive purpose , it is only where the attack is completely inescapable that possession of a weapon to thwart the attack is not possession for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. Many indicia will be relevant to this determination of avoidability , including location , atmosphere , nature of the threat , imminence of danger , and actual use. A finding that the accused actually used his weapon in a manner which constituted justifiable self-defence is relevant under s. 88 , but not sufficient for an acquittal thereunder. It is relevant insofar as it may reveal both whether the accused 's subjective purpose was truly to defend himself and whether , in the circumstances , the attack was escapable . </defend.v.2965><defend.v.2966>The lawsuit was filed in October 1997 on behalf of Jennifer Gratz , 23 , now of San Diego , and Patrick Hamacher , 21 , of Flint , who claim they were denied admission to U-M in 1995 and 1997 , respectively , in favor of less-qualified minority students.

Justice Roy decided that each of Bertrand ' s insurers for the 1986 to 1992 policy periods had an obligation to indemnify Bertrand , that Bertrand ' s excess insurers could be called upon to indemnify Bertrand where the primary policy limits were insufficient in any given period , that five of Lafarge ' s insurers were similarly responsible to indemnify Lafarge , and that those five insurers and three others were responsible to pay Lafarge ' s reasonable defence costs.

Typically , an insurance company with serious reservations about its obligations to defend an insured party will institute a separate lawsuit involving the insured. An insured party can also file such a lawsuit. This type of action is called a declaratory judgment; it is a means for the insurance company , or an insured party , to seek an opinion from the court regarding the insurance company 's duty to shoulder the costs of the legal defense against the claims asserted. The insured may need to retain separate counsel for such proceedings , seeking reimbursement for defense costs if the court reaches a judgment adverse to the insurance company . </defend.v.3004><defend.v.3005>Halifax accepted the advice of its coverage counsel and initiated an action for a declaration that it had no duty to defend Innopex in respect of the Gucci litigation.

The Scriptures teach that when the government requires a sin of omission ( as it has by forbidding the defense of our unborn children ) , we must obey God rather than the government.

We would not limit ourselves to legal and educational remedies that might possibly stop the bloodshed in the future; rather , we would take the immediate action necessary to save one another.

Once they were inside the sheepfold , it would open into a larger , circular area where the sheep would have more freedom of movement. That is exactly what Bozrah looks like. The only way into this city is by a very narrow passageway which extends for about 11/4 miles in length. Once you are through this narrow passageway , which can be defended by only two men against a whole army , you are inside a huge , circular area.

Likewise , the " duty to retreat , " which is to say the principle that deadly force can only be used in self-defense if it 's genuinely necessary , in that no safe avenue of retreat is available , is likely to be constitutional , too , because it has long been recognized in at least a substantial minority of states. There may be other examples as well. My point is that a federal constitutional right to self-defense likely exists , especially in the wake of Heller; but it is not unlimited , and is likely to be strongest precisely where there 's a broad and deep common-law and statutory tradition of recognizing such a right . </defend.v.3136><defend.v.3137>But such a perceived inequity in legal teams is not the norm throughout America.

" Only about 40 lawyers make up Utah 's prominent list of " Rule 8 qualified " attorneys who meet certain stringent criteria to defend death penalty cases. Under Utah 's Rule 8 , an indigent person facing a capital sentence can get two court-appointed attorneys.

A criminal attorney will defend you in court. A criminal attorney will take your side , and use his or her extensive education in the law to defend you from the charges that have been leveled against you. A criminal lawyer can be compared to a doctor , that is , an expert who comes in and takes care of something that you 're not capable of taking care of yourself.

I was surprised to read that you had tried to reach me for comment. I ' d welcome the opportunity to discuss ILADS ' point of view with you. Volkman is right regarding the need for better diagnostic solutions and more objectivity. The science to-date is woefully inadequate given Lyme disease has reached epidemic proportions. The most-oft cited studies are too small for the results to be generalized , causing conclusions to be based more on interpretation rather than iron-clad scientific evidence. The surest way to overcome the conflict is to increase the level of dialogue between physicians representing differing perspectives. Patients expect leaders in the medical field to work together to help solve complex health issues. Lyme is a complex disease. Physicians and patients need treatment guidelines that acknowledge the importance of clinical expertise in fostering patient wellness.

In cross-motions for summary judgment , the insurer argued that it was obligated only to defend against the counterclaim because the affirmative defense was not an occurrence that triggered coverage. It further argued that because the collection action was ultimately settled , plaintiff 's demand for reimbursement did not constitute a claim for property damage and defendant was under no obligation to pay. Plaintiff argued that coverage was triggered because the policy did not differentiate among a pre-suit claim of negligence , an affirmative defense of negligence , and a counterclaim for negligence , arguing further that while the matter initially was not in suit , the insurer should have settled the property damage claim . </defend.v.3192><defend.v.3193>There are other responses that the other party may make , but the most likely scenario is that the other party will respond by filing a notice of intention to defend , including any explanation or ground of defense to your Complaint.

Failure to do so may leave an insured party with a partially settled case , and only partially paid-for defense. Particularly for individuals with large net worth and for companies , it may be advisable to consult an attorney regarding realistic coverage limits.

Dogs have a release point where the lower jaw hinges into the skull that can be activated pretty easily on most dogs if you 're being bitten. It 's harder to activate , though , on dogs with massive musculature in the jaws ( like pit bulls ) . This area , too , is an area through which a massive tangle of facial nerves ( including the hypoglossal and accessory nerves ) exit the skull to fan out across the face. As with humans , a strike to this area from the back toward the front ( hitting the rear edge of the jawbone ) can be extremely painful and cause trauma , even unconsciousness. A dog ' s jaw bone doesn ' t protrude as much as does a human ' s , however , so you have to hit this just right. If you miss the first time , you can try again.

If the debtor does not make the deadline when filing the Notice of Intention to Defend , it will be dealt with as if it was a protest against the Default Judgement , similar to a Motion to set aside a Judgement. under Irish Law.

This is another reason criminal defense lawyers very often practice law by themselves. Preparing every case as if it were going to trial requires a great deal of lawyer time , more time than a lawyer can possibly charge the client for at three or four hundred dollars per hour. Because the criminal lawyer just has to work at an hourly rate effectively lower than that billed by civil lawyers , attorneys who are driven to defend people accused of crime are most often encouraged to open their own law practices.

Thus , whenever a court determines that a defendant charged with a felony or a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment is indigent or that the interests of justice otherwise require representation of an indigent defendant the court must appoint one or more attorneys to defend him or her as soon as possible.

They may exercise this right when the government fails in its duty to provide them with sufficient security or violates other reserved rights. This right to self-defense through force of arms exists even if arms fail to increase the level of security in society or the likelihood that other natural rights will be respected. It instead has its source in Lockean principles of autonomy and individualism. And thus Heston is correct when he says that this is a right to protect oneself " by whatever means necessary " -- that is , whatever the level of danger these arms create . </defend.v.3257><defend.v.3258>ISN appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Appellate arguments were held onMay 4 , 2001 , withJeffrey R. Schmieler , esq. again arguing on behalf of Federal. Judge Bloom of the Court of Special Appeals began his opinion with a discussion of the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify in Maryland. Quoting at length from Mesmer v. Maryland Auto Ins. Fund , 353 Md. 241 ( 1999 ) , the court reiterated the Maryland law that under the typical liability insurance policy , the insurer has a duty to indemnify the insured only up to the limits of the policy , based on a liability claim which is covered. The insurer also has a duty to defend the insured against a liability claim which is covered or which is potentially covered. If a tort plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage , the insurer still must defend if there is a potentiality that the claim could be covered by the policy. Essentially , the source of both duties is solely the insurance contract . </defend.v.3258><defend.v.3259>Pekin filed a declaratory judgment action , asking the court to find it had no duty to defend Dial.

Thus , a court inquires whether the insurer had a duty to defend and whether it breached that duty. See Clemmons , 88 Ill. 2d at 475-78 ( determining first that the insurer had a duty to defend , and then finding that the insurer had renounced that duty ) . Application of the estoppel doctrine is not appropriate if the insurer had no duty to defend , or if the insurer 's duty to defend was not properly triggered. These circumstances include where the insurer was given no opportunity to defend; where there was no insurance policy in existence; and where , when the policy and the complaint are compared , there clearly was no coverage or potential for coverage.

Because the duty to defend arises based on the possibility of the duty to indemnify a complaint , rather than based on a prediction of the likely outcome or indeed the actual outcome , we typically say that the duty to defend is broader than is the duty to indemnify . </defend.v.3264><defend.v.3265>Founded in 1998 , At Ian N.

The Court observed that the duty to defend is measured against the allegations of pleadings but the duty to pay is determined by the actual basis for the insured 's liability to a third person. By estopping the carrier from raising coverage defenses on the duty to pay if the duty to defend has been unjustifiably denied the appellate division was applying the same standard for both duties. Like the Georgia Supreme Court , the New York Court of Appeals concluded that the effect of the estoppel rule was to enlarge the bargained-for coverage as a penalty for breach of the duty to defend -- an impermissible outcome . </defend.v.3273><defend.v.3274>For us , this is far from heaving a sigh of relief , as the true challenge has finally descended upon us : to defeat Arts and defend our title.

We are seeing more and more cardiomyopathy , in younger and younger patients , and unfortunately this trend will continue ( until our society and our medical profession decide to recognize the problem ) . If you do heart muscle biopsy studies of cardiomyopathy patients , you will find tissue mercury levels 22 , 000 times above that found in normal individuals. The cardiomyopathy patients also have greatly increased heart muscle tissue levels of antimony , arsenic , and other metals. I think that patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have a genetic or acquired inability to defend themselves against environmental metal toxins ( similar to the situation with mercury in autistic kids ) . Much of the benefit of MME in cardiomyopathy has to do with metal detoxification. I have also used other forms of chelation therapy to improve pump function in cardiomyopathy patients ( most but not all improve - in some the problem is likely something other than a metal that we can chelate out ) .

Financial inability of the client to pay the amount due should also cause the lawyer to forego the lien because the failure to pay the fee is not deliberate and , therefore , does not constitute fraud or gross imposition by the client.

The Sirians were independent and considered to be the merchants of the universe. With the highest technology available in their possession , many races came to them for help. Even all the weapons used by the Draco came from Sirius. When Preston remarked that this made them guilty of hurting others , Mishka had an answer.

But Congress is not the only route here.

" The policies define the word " suit " as " a civil proceeding in which damages because of 'bodily injury , ' 'property damage , ' 'personal injury , ' or 'advertising injury ' to which this insurance applies are alleged. " The court of appeal held that the trial court was incorrect because WMB 's pleadings in the underlying action did not raise a potential for coverage and no claims were asserted at any time except those for breach of lease and the resulting contract damages.

If the government claims the authority to decide these disagreements and prohibit self-defense no matter what the individual thinks , then its authority is absolute , and citizens are really slaves. Although the government may give everyone plenty of rights to defend themselves , it could abandon them to death at the hands of third parties if it wanted to. Since this conclusion is intolerable , it appears that an auxiliary right to bear arms is necessary. The government must give individuals the rights to engage in self-defense that they would have if it were violating their reserved rights , even though these rights are anarchistic in the sense that they undermine the government 's ability to regulate self-defense in situations where it in fact has the authority to do so . </defend.v.3429><defend.v.3430>Whether an insurer is bound to provide defence coverage in an action taken against the insured arises as a preliminary matter.

In the 1950 's and 60 's , a generation of young black , other minority , and white people built a movement to fight for equality in American society. They made great sacrifices in a fight that they saw not only as their own , but also as a fight for future generations.

St. Paul Fire &amp;Marine Insurance Company , 106 Idaho 792 , 683 P.2d 440 ( 1984 ) . The physician 's carrier refused to defend. In settling the case , the physician assigned to the patient any and all of his causes of action arising out of the failure of the insurer to appear and defend. The patient sued the carrier. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to the carrier on the indemnity issue , but also held that the carrier breached its duty to defend . </defend.v.3449><defend.v.3450>In that case it was unclear whether the insurer might be liable to indemnify under the policy , so the duty to defend was held to apply. In the court 's view it would have been unjust for the insurers to be able to assert that " the claim is probably groundless , or will probably end up falling outside of the indemnity coverage. Since we have no proof that we owe an indemnity in this case , we take the position that we owe no duty to defend.

It seems to be a snowballing- an avalanche if you will- of a lot of processes gone wrong. For this reason , I believe the way conventional medicine treats cancer is largely a failure. Conventional medicine attacks the cancer , but does not look at the person as a whole. On the contrary , oncologists believe that they can poison the body and do lasting harm to the immune system , liver and other organs , but if they can kill the cancer , then treatment is a success. They even consider death to be within the acceptable range of side effects of their treatment ! So often , their treatments destroy the body 's ability to defend itself against future cancer. The underlying causes of the cancer are not addressed and the individual nature and needs of the patient are ignored. I have such a fear of this kind of " medicine " that I knew I would not survive it. The coldness and lack of humanity in that system of medicine seems anti-life.

Kim Seng and Great American cross-claimed against each other for a declaratory judgment as to whether the policies created a duty to defend and indemnify Kim Seng in connection with the underlying trademark infringement action. Kim Seng moved for summary adjudication against all insurers on the duty to defend and indemnity issues , claiming that the prior publication exclusion is inapplicable.
