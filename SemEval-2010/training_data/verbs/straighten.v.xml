Someone who supports the entire family , ensures life goes smoothly and offers strength to the members who can not help themselves ? Well , our spinal cord is the head of our body , and it offers the body tremendous support and ensures that the body functions against gravity for the entire lifetime. The spine is in an S shape. Correct posture is when your shoulders are in line with the hip , the neck is rested comfortably on the shoulder and not jutting forward. However , in our endeavour to gain a correct posture some people straighten so much that not only do their shoulders go beyond the hip but they develop stiffness. Others hold their shoulders in a leaning position , very much away from the hips , and this gives rise to tremendous pain. Holding the spine in a correct posture is very important; however this can not be done consciously , it is to be done subconsciously. This can be achieved by strengthening the postural muscle surrounding the spine.

Press down the 6th string at the 14th fret with your right hand. With a feeler gauge , measure the distance between the top of the 5th fret and the bottom of the 6th string.

However , some examiners frown on such slips so I additionally instruct slips that are performed only on final. Slips give beautiful visibility and control down to the landing.

I love the colour , the heatproof bag , the long chord and the longer plates but there 's just something missing. Although the straighteners heat up to 230 degrees very quickly they do n't have the same impact as the BaByliss 2085U , which I have gone back to using.

By sealing each hair cuticle , your hair retains its natural oils and shine , allowing it to be healthier than ever before. Also , because each hair cuticle is closed , the hair lays flat against the head instead of looking frizzy and standing up all over the place which is a common complaint for African American ' s who straighten their hair. You want the end result to be sexy , sleek hair , not frizzy damaged looking hair. This is why tourmaline is so important in a hair straightener.

During the 1960s black people who actively worked to critique , challenge , and change white racism pointed to the way in which black people ' s obsession with straight hair reflected a colonized mentality. It was at this time that the natural hairdo , the afro , became fashionable as a sign of cultural resistance to racist oppression and as a celebration of blackness. Naturals were equated with political militancy. Many young black folks found just how much political value was placed on straightened hair as a sign of respectability and conformity to societal expectations when they ceased to straighten their hair. When black liberation struggles did not lead to revolutionary change in society , the focus on the political relationship between appearance and complicity with white racism ceased and folks who had once sported afros began to straighten their hair . </straighten.v.2674><straighten.v.2675>Straightening hair does not have to be an activity that is simply left to the ladies.

I ' m also noticing so many black women I see that actually wear their hair naturally , but I just didn ' t notice before.
