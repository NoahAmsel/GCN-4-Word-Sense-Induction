From dippers and squirters , to sprinklers and smotherers , psychologist , Donna Dawson has identified seven " sauciological " types. Those who dunk into a well of ketchup are methodical and trustworthy. Secretly , they may also lead double lives as control freaks or spies who are afraid of change. Ambitious people splodge their sauce in the middle of their food. ( This may indicate that they are middle of the road politically as well , but it 's not a sure-fire test. ) Creative types swirl and squirt in thin lines. Those who dot their ketchup are friendly , but highly conservative in life style. Smotherers are the life and soul of the party , but keep them away from people sleeping on high pillows. Those with artistic ability may draw faces and words on their food. Gourmets who keep their ketchup in a cruet may appear charming , but deep down they are snobs and harbor animosities towards ordinary bottles ! </pour.v.2><pour.v.3>Concrete that 's mixed for pouring sidewalks , stepping stones , slabs , etc. , requires about 5-3/4 gallons of water per sack of cement if the sand is damp and about 5 gallons if the sand is wet . </pour.v.3><pour.v.4>Pick over beans , wash , pour over cold water and leave to swell overnight , then cook in the same water and add peeled onion.

The Farallon Basin has a spreading axis at its center , so the seafloor here is oceanic crust , transitioning into thin , rifted continental crust at the basin 's edges. Spreading centers in the Gulf , like this one in Farallon , are different from more well known spreading axes like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ( MAR ) and East Pacific Rise ( EPR ) , since they form as deep rift valleys rather than bathymetric highs. Some of these rift valleys are over 3 , 000 meters deep ! One difference is that the Gulf spreading centers are so close to land. Unlike the MAR or EPR , these spreading centers are inundated by massive amounts of sediment that pour into the Gulf. One familiar source of terrigenous input to the Gulf is the Colorado River , which empties into the northern Gulf ( though no longer consistently , as a result of overuse for irrigation ) . Further south , especially in the eastern Gulf , the Mexican Sierra Madre Occidental mountains are a more important source of sediment . </pour.v.37><pour.v.38>i 'd say when we got let out of school with cancelled practice for a tornado warning. ha. in ct. okay. and then it started to pour freezing rain and hail. and the wind was pretty bad too . </pour.v.38><pour.v.39>IV.

Seal the canister and store at room temperature in a dry place for seven to ten days. When the flowers are dried , pour off the mixture and dust the flowers with a soft artist 's brush.

The solution is not so easy for those homes with a septic tank because antifreeze can overwhelm the organisms in your septic system , causing damage to the system. If your wastewater goes into a septic tank , very small amounts over a period of time can be flushed with plenty of water. Better yet , ask a friend , relative , or neighbor who is hooked up to the sanitary sewer system to use their drain to dispose of your household quantity of used antifreeze.

If you use insulated concrete forms ( ICFs ) and pour a modest side wall and reinforce the top using the incredibly strong corners as support then you can bury one to at least four feet. The insulated forms will greatly mediate condensation problems but the site must be well drained. All in all it would have been much cheaper for me to just build a concrete storage site but I got into the " In for a penny , in for a pound mindset " and things just got out of hand. My next underground facility will be a large septic tank waterproofed inside and out buried to stash very long term food and munitions. The condensation problem is exacerbated by opening the doors and letting warm moist air into the very cool dry interior of the Conex.

It becomes a personal reflection and statement of the owner and anyone who had faith and lent them money. This is one reason why continued efforts and additional money is poured into the original investment. It is tough to let go. As in relationships that go bad , and when one does n't want to leave the other person , you have to be intensely honest with yourself , understand what you are feeling and why , and try to be objective in terms of where things are going ?

He is never niggardly nor stingy , and so it follows that every inadequate experience of our new life in Christ and failure to experience the abundant life led by the Spirit is always due to some human impediment. In other words , we believers can never blame God for our experiential " short fall " , as if He had not given us adequate provisions to walk in newness of life as more than conquerors in Christ Jesus !

According to Hippocrates , in order to maintain good health , these four humors should be kept in balance. As a part of his theory of the four humors , Hippocrates recognized the healing power of water. For feverish patients , he often recommended a bath in cool water. Such a bath would realign the temperature and harmony of the four humors. Hippocrates acknowledged that the water available in Greek aqueducts was far from pure in its quality. Like the ancients before him , Hippocrates also believed good taste in water meant cleanliness and purity of that water. Hippocrates designed his own crude water filter to 'purify ' the water he used for his patients.

This exaltation included the resurrection , the ascension , the enthronement at the right hand of God the Father and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon the church.

If I depart , I will send Him [ the Holy Spirit ] to you ( Jn. 16 : 7; cf. 14 : 16-18 ) . The language of anticipation indicates that the disciples will not be dipped in the Holy Spirit , but rather the Holy Spirit will come upon the apostles. Luke 24 : 49 reads , Tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high [ i.e. , from heaven ] .

Once you ' ve added what you want to add , you pour the soap into the molds and then let them sit about 30 minutes. You will see them starting to solidify. I usually put a sheet of saran wrap carefully over the soap surface to where it sticks to it and this protects the surface somewhat against the white stuff called soda ash that is a reaction from the air touching it but it washes off just fine later if you do get it . </pour.v.372><pour.v.373>" To MAKE CANDIED ORANGE PEEL , cut the peel of an orange into five pieces and scrape away the loose skin inside with a knife , then set them to soak in good , fresh water for nine days and change the water daily; then boil them , letting them come once to the boil only , in fresh water , and this done , spread them on a cloth and let them dry thoroughly , then put them in a pot of honey until they be quite covered therewith , and boil on a slow fire and skim.

The thermal energy of something is the total energy of all its moving atoms , or particles that make it up. A cup of hot chocolate , for example , has more thermal energy than the same-sized cup of cold chocolate milk. The movement of thermal energy from one place to another is called heat. Heat always moves from a hotter object to a colder one because of the second law of thermodynamics. If , for example , you pour some hot chocolate into a room-temperature cup , and then touch the outside of the cup , you will notice that the cup itself feels warm. There has been a heat transfer from the hot chocolate to the cup . </pour.v.376><pour.v.377>2 Corinthians 9 : 14 while they themselves also in supplications on your behalf pour out their longing love towards you because of God 's surpassing grace which is resting upon you.

Line a small kitchen funnel with a layer of absorbent cotton about 1/8 inch thick , and pour the contents of a milk bottle through it. Every particle of dirt will be clearly visible on the white cotton. There is one form of sediment tester in which the milk is strained through prepared disks of cotton which may be preserved as a record of the cleanliness of the milk.

Someone asked if you can use brown sugar. I use a recipe by Rose Levy Beranbaum in which she uses brown sugar : 1 1/4 cups brown sugar , 1/2 cup butter , 2 T water , 1 t vanilla. She also uses nuts and chocolate. The main difference is she cooks only to 285 , taking it off and adding 1/4 t baking soda along with the vanilla , then pouring over the nuts. She says the temp rises to 290 anyway. I prefer to cook it a bit longer to get a less chewy toffee. As noted above thread , hotter means more brittle. So , a 290 toffee is more chewy than a 300 , which is more chewy than a 305. But , you do have to be careful not to burn . </pour.v.408><pour.v.409>Floating Liqueurs Creating a rainbow effect in a glass with different colored cordials requires a special pouring technique.

The quickest method is to pour freshly boiled water over them and let soak for about 10 minutes. Use just enough water to cover them , since you want to use the soaking liquid in your dish ( precious flavor and nutrients end up in there ) , and if you rehydrate with too much water , some may go to waste. Stir the morels several times while they are soaking. After they have rehydrated , transfer to another bowl and let the water settle. Then carefully pour off and reserve the liquid , discarding the sediment at the bottom of the bowl. Morels can also be rehydrated by soaking in water overnight. Some people like to rehydrate in cream or white wine , which is of course then used in the dish being prepared . </pour.v.420><pour.v.421>Several methods can be used to establish the height and level surface of the pour. On small pours , such as a shed or single-car garage , experts often simply use 1/2-inch reinforcing rod cut into 2-foot lengths. These are spray-painted a bright fluorescent orange and driven into the subsoil at 3-foot intervals around the perimeter of the building and down through the center. The liquid concrete is poured to the approximate height of the rods , then screeded , pulling up rods as you screed past them. Using this method you can screed one side at a time as you make the pour , or screed one side , then go back , fill and screed the opposite side , but still making only one pour . </pour.v.421><pour.v.422>When decanting to remove the wine from its sediment , a few methods are popular among wine lovers.

So that people have more money in their pockets to spend. When more and more buyers are there in the market , the demand increases. When the demand increases the supply relatively decreases , if you can not cope up with the demand in time. If you have more buyers and less supply it increases the competition among the buyers and the prices go high. Now , to increase the supply , production should go high , and for the production to go high you need more and more money up front. Companies look for the money. They go to the banks to borrow more money. Banks go to government to borrow money. Ultimately more money is poured in the market. Now to increase the production you need more job openings. More jobs open , more money is poured in the market. People have more money in their pockets. People spend more money. Prices go high. And the cycle goes on. We say economy is improved. Thus , the inflation cycle goes on and on . </pour.v.428><pour.v.429>You can make your own crude charcoal filters to remove bad tastes , odors , and some pollutants such as organic toxic chemicals and radioactive fallout. The easiest way to make charcoal is to burn some wood and pick the bigger partially burned chunks out of the fire. Place these chunks into a 5-gallon bucket and pour the water to be treated into the bucket. Shake vigorously for a few seconds then allow to stand for several minutes before filtering this water through a cloth , sand filter , or coffee filter back into a suitable container. If toxic organic chemicals or radioactive fallout are significant concerns , you should filter your water through at least 3 to 5 feet of sand including two 3-inch thick layers of charcoal. A 50-gallon drum filled with sand and charcoal layers , with a few holes punched in the bottom , could do the job nicely. If you crush the charcoal with some rocks , it will do a better job of filtering . </pour.v.429><pour.v.430>Drain Cleaner : For light drain cleaning , mix cup salt in 4 liters water , heat ( but not to a boil ) and pour down the drain. For stronger cleaning , pour about cup baking soda down the drain , then cup vinegar. The resulting chemical reaction can break fatty acids down into soap and glycerin , allowing the clog to wash down the drain. After 15 minutes , pour in boiling water to clear residue. Caution : only use this method with metal plumbing. Plastic pipes can melt if excess boiling water is used. Also , do not use this method after trying a commercial drain opener -- the vinegar can react with the drain opener to create dangerous fumes . </pour.v.430><pour.v.431>And that ' s it , the solution that you have made will help to lift the ice from the windshield.

Once the mold is secured , I poured in the concrete and added a handle make from a brass-coasted U-belt. Fender washers are attached to the ends of the U-belt using a nut on each side of each washer. This keeps the handle securely embedded in the concrete. When the concrete is dry , the mold is disassembled and the block is ready for use.

And what happened was that she came to my study with a cup of milk and before I could understand poured the full cup of milk on my running laptop. I was stunned and without thoughts shocked for a moment. Immediately realizing what has happened I switched off my laptop and removed the battery , but it was too late. Something that I got to know from the laptop repair guy was that the milk that has seeped in had gone into the DVD drive and the head was spoiled. Also the motherboard is covered with dried up milk and is to be cleaned , later being declares as damaged.

His first move was the creation in 1977 of a prestigious Study Group on the Global Effects of Carbon Dioxide , chaired by the veteran nuclear energy administrator Alvin Weinberg. As an advocate of nuclear power the leading alternative to energy production from fossil fuels Weinberg became a strong supporter of greenhouse effect studies. Next , Slade set up an Office of Carbon Dioxide Research , a vessel into which he hoped to pour important sums of money. ( 24 ) He mobilized scientists around the country to help draft an elaborate research program.

From about three feet or so above your partner , tilt the candle and allow the pool of wax to splash down on his or her back. Monitor your partner 's responses and experiment with distance accordingly; decreasing the height from which you drip the wax , and increasing the amount of wax , will both make the sensation more intense . </pour.v.540><pour.v.541>Electric samovars use an electric coil to heat up water. The electric coil in European made samovars is rated for 220 volts , however most will work fine at 110 volts ( the US standard ) . In any case , a Voltage Converter is not necessary to operate a 220V samovar. Radio Shack sells an " Outlet Adapter " stock 273-1406D. It will not convert the voltage but simply adapt the two large round prongs on the end of the samovar cord to fit into the two flat rectangular outlet holes used in US homes. Because you are using 110V there will be an increase in the time needed to heat the water ( this can be offset by starting with hot or warm water ) . To use your electric samovar simply pour water inside , plug it in and wait for it to heat up. This will be your supply of hot water with which to make tea . </pour.v.541><pour.v.542>To prepare the chestnuts , cut an X on the top of each and set them in a saucepan of cold water.

Always pour the acid into the water , and wear skin and eye protection when working with acid.

The correct pressure is the pressure that pours a beer that ' s bubble free as it leaves the mouth of the beer faucet. Too little pressure and CO2 will start breaking out in the beer line and will show up as small bubbles coming out with the beer.

Violent criminals and those who deal in hard drugs ( not cannabis ) belong in jail , do n't get me wrong , but the conservative habit of dismissing or ignoring social problems in order to justify more tax cuts for the wealthy , foreign military misadventures , or to pour more money into say Quebec for narrow partisan purposes would mean many of the root causes of things like crime and addiction would not be addressed . </pour.v.697><pour.v.698>I get so angry when I watch those manipulative so-called , weight-loss commercials on the television.

We have seen the beauty of a boil spoilt scores of times by using dirty rags and rancid oil. A sugar boiler can not be too careful in these little details , the success of his work largely depends upon it. It is easy to inaugurate a good system , and much more comfortable to work to it than a slovenly " what shall I do [ Pg 24 ] next " sort of a method.

The empty bowl is put in a place convenient for you to hold your hands over it. The attendant then pours the water on your hands , and you wash them with soap or without , and the dirty water falls into the bowl.

Otherwise , the movement of the fluid in the bottle will mix the wine with the sediment exactly what we 're trying to avoid. On the other hand , young wines that show no signs of sediment do not require the light source or the gentle handling since you are not going to encounter any solid matter. Just pour the wine from the bottle into the decanter. It 's amazing how much that slight oxygenation can alter the textural sensation of the wine. Decanting is an easy process and should not be the least bit intimidating. A bit of practice with a few inexpensive bottles can make it second nature for you.

Plate tectonics has radically changed the appearance of the Earth over time. For instance , the Atlantic Ocean , currently the second largest ocean in the world , was once very similar to the modern day Gulf. The Atlantic Ocean did n't exist prior to 130 million years ago. It started to form as the most recent supercontinent ( called Pangaea ) broke apart. The early Atlantic also must have had huge amounts of sediment pouring into it and multiple sills injecting into the crust. The rifting of continental crust and the formation of an ocean occurring today in the Gulf are thus a young parallel to the Atlantic 's past ! </pour.v.894><pour.v.895>We should forbid pouring boiling water from a keli rishon into a utensil that was rinsed with cold water that had not been cooked , and drops remain on it , because the drops are cooked.

As the tectonic plates that make up the shell of the Earth move apart , hot , soft , partly molten rock wells up from the Earth 's interior and fills the space between. The melt , at 1200 C , rises from the solid residue to feed a belt of submarine volcanoes that girdles the Earth. This belt of volcanoes makes up the mid-ocean ridges and it is here that new ocean floor is created. The mid-ocean ridge volcanoes , though invisible beneath two to four kilometres of ocean water , pour out much more lava than the rest of the Earth 's volcanoes put together. From this lava , and from melt intruded deep below the ocean floor , comes new ocean crust. About 3 square kilometres form each year , from 20 cubic kilometres of magma . </pour.v.897><pour.v.898>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels , " Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.

We mentioned in our last lecture why the Prophet now at length speaks of the spiritual grace of God , having before spoken of earthly blessings. The order may seem indeed irregular; but it can be easily accounted for. The Prophet said first that God , being reconciled to the people , would openly manifest this by external proofs , by restoring abundance of wine and corn; for the almost wearing out of the people by famine and want , being the evidence of God ' s vengeance , the Prophet made the testimony of reconciliation to be in tokens of a contrary kind. But as the restoration of the Church consists not either in the fruitfulness of the land , or in the abundance of provisions , the Prophet now raises higher the thoughts of the godly , and makes them to look for the spiritual grace of God : hence he says , I shall afterwards pour my Spirit upon all flesh </pour.v.911><pour.v.912>I pour my candy out on a foil-lined cookie sheet ( sometimes I butter the foil , if I 'm in the mood or have the time ) and let it cool.

The lack of complete gel phase changes nothing but the look and feel of the bar and will not harm you , or dry out your skin.

The depressed priced caused by this out of balanced supply and demand dynamic prompted the South African government to fund the formation of the Koperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt ( KWV ) in 1918. Initially started as a co-operative , the KWV soon grew in power and prominence to where it was set policies and prices for the entire South African wine industry.

When you are making a pot of tea - using loose tea of course - you will see the tea leaves uncurl and expand dramatically. This uncurling and expansion is called ' the agony of the leaf ' . </pour.v.1081><pour.v.1082>When the soap is melted for the last time before pouring into moulds , it can be colored and perfumed.

Try to avoid putting it inside the car with you , as this is very dangerous on many levels , but if you have to , you can put it in the trunk as a last resort. Be sure to open the trunk every so often to allow any possible fumes to dissipate ( or open the windows if you keep it inside the cab ) , and pour it into the main tank as soon as the tank will take it , rather than waiting until you run out . </pour.v.1087><pour.v.1088>The Elisha anointing will come upon those who follow on to know their God.

Do not cut too deeply; all we need to do is to cut through the paper and into the adhesive. When you are finished scoring the paper , you should have a series of one-inch marks spaced about one-inch apart , covering the entire surface. Next , take your rough cloth ( such as a shop towel ) and soak it generously in the cola. Do not wring it out. If you do not have a rough cloth , a stiff brush will work. In the case of a brush , pour the cola directly onto the paper. Rub with the soaked cloth , or work the stiff brush over the scores in the paper. Be sure to use a motion that runs perpendicular to the scores in the paper , and it will begin to easily peel back from the wood. Repeat until all of the adhesive has been removed , and then clean thoroughly with plain water until the cola has been removed from the wood.

Be careful to use plastic that will not make the water taste bad - trial and error is best here. Because the taste will become " flat " after extended storage , periodic replacement is recommended. If possible , storage in a refrigerator is recommended. Water may taste flat after long periods of storage. This can be improved by pouring the water back and forth from one container to another ( called aeration ) , by allowing it to stand for a few hours , or by adding a small pinch of salt for each quart of water . </pour.v.1103><pour.v.1104>That 's a temperature issue.

This is similar to having a bucket of dirty water scoop out a cup of dirty water and you pour in a cup of clean water. Very gradually by this process the water become clear.

We split here means the vertical effusion of rain water when it is poured on earth; and it has been proved that rain water spilled on earth can cause fissures in which the depth varies between a few meters to two hundred meters. This permits water to pierce through permeable rock layers so that water is stored under the surface and its freshness and content is renewed due to the presence of oxygen. These fissures connect with similar varied rock fissures , stratification levels in sedimentary rocks , and dissolved caves in calciferous and saliferous rocks that can reach dozens of kilometers resulting in holes , routes , galleries , and agoras. This connection promotes weathering of rocks and storage of underground water , and enhances its role in making the fissures wider. This is done through different aspects; by mechanical erosion ( the effect of frost ) , erosion caused by living creatures , and chemical erosion ( through dissolution , carbonization , conversion , liquidizing and oxidation ) which weaken the rocks ' cohesion and helps them to split and fragmentize to make topsoil. It also helps plants get all they need from water and nutritious components . </pour.v.1148><pour.v.1149>late 14c. , " pouring out of wine in honor of a god , " from L. libationem ( nom. libatio ) " a drink offering , " from libare " pour out ( an offering ) , " from PIE * ( s ) leib- " to pour , drop " ( cf.

Crowds of people would follow him dancing and singing the Hellel , ( Psalms 113-118 ) The highlight of this ceremony was when the Priest would pour this water at the altar of the Temple.

If the manufacturer of the Soda Ash that you purchase does not require it to be diluted , then secure yourself on the pool deck , bend down very close to the surface of the water , and still pour the Soda Ash in front of each return jet. Since the granules are fairly powder-like , the wind can blow them out of the pool , or worse , in your face and eyes.

Unfortunately if your slab is already poured and hard this is going to be pretty difficult to do if not impossible. But if it ' s part of a new construction , having control joints in your basement slab will allow for cracks to form uniformly and expectedly due to movements caused in the drying and shrinking process as well as for contraction and expansion over time and temperature changes. These control joints are hidden and have to be made before the concrete cures. What happens is that the crew finishing your slab will actually slice through the entire thickness of the slab in a grid-like fashion. After it ' s all sliced , they ' ll re-trowel it to make it all smooth again giving the appearance of a completely solid piece. When it all cures and the slab eventually moves it will crack along those grid lines. In other words , when the concrete does crack as we all know it eventually will , you ' ll know where it will crack and that it will also crack in a straight line instead of randomly all over the slab . </pour.v.1214><pour.v.1215>Water temperature : This is where most mistakes are made. The proper brewing temperature for gyokuro is between 122 F ~ 140 F ( 50C ~ 60C ) degrees. This is quite a bit lower than sencha. Will 10 degrees make a difference ? Yes ! The problem is , if you pour a moderately hot gyokuro into cold cups , your finished tea will be lukewarm. This is why it 's important to pre-heating both your cups and teapot. A good proceedure is to pour boiled water that has been given a few minutes to cool off a bit directly into the teapot first , allowing it to sit for a minute or two. From there into the teacups , with the remaing hot water tossed. After everything has warmed up ( cups and teapot ) and at the same time the water has cooled down to around 130 F ( 55 C ) , we then add the leaves into the teapot followed by the hot water remaining in the cups. .

Do this so long until the flint will fill up the glass ( for in a little time it will fill it up and become to be of the form or figure of the glass ) for it attracts to itself the mucilaginousness of the water which , indeed , is a slimy saltish matter and the true matter of stones. And thus you shall have that done by art in few days which nature would have been perfecting many years and , indeed , just such a flint as is produced in the rivers.

No part of the hands should be left unwashed; therefore , the fingers must be slightly parted , and raised somewhat upward , in order that the water may run down the entire length of the fingers. It must also cover the finger tips and the full circumference of the fingers. The entire hand should be covered with one outpouring of water.

However , because Glaze Coat is very thick , it is usually necessary to help this process along immediately after pouring. Surface bubbles MUST be removed when surface is still wet , not once surface begins the curing process or else bubbles will turn into dimples once fully cured. Blow gently on the surface to force bubbles up and away. For larger areas , use a small , handheld propane torch. Keep flame 6 to 8 inches above surface. Move torch over freshly poured Glaze Coat several times until surface is bubble free. Be sure to use a waving action so the surface is only slightly warmed , allowing remaining air bubbles to disappear.

I 've also warmed up lye water in the microwave before so I think it 's fine but I prefer not to do it to avoid boil over or spill. Try using less ice and more water when dissolving the lye. I stir the ice water while pouring lye into it which helps it to dissolve faster ( otherwise it often forms a clump at the bottom of the ice water ) . Also make sure the oil temperature is not too low which can also contribute to long trace times. Hope this helps . </pour.v.1614><pour.v.1615>Consider trying to make a sculpture out of water.

As the milk is poured straight into the cup , the foam begins to surface on one side ( due to the tilt ) . The barista then moves the pitcher from side to side as he levels the cup , and finishes by making a quick strike through the previously poured pattern. This " strike " creates the stem portion of the flower design , and bends the poured zig-zag into a flower shape. Although the rosetta design is common , many others are possible. These can range from simple geometric shapes to complicated drawings , such as crosshatched patterns , apples , hearts , animals , and flowers.

It is argued that going down into the water and then coming up out of it sound just like the ritual of immersion. The problem with this common Baptist argument is : a ) It has Philip immersing himself as well as the eunuch ( both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water . They [ i.e. , both men ] came up out of the water ) which is very unlikely and absurd. b ) If Philip wanted to baptize the eunuch by pouring or sprinkling and didn ' t happen to have a branch with hyssop lying around , the easiest way to accomplish this task was for both men to step into the water so Philip could cup some water in his hands and pour it or sprinkle it on the head of the eunuch . </pour.v.1645><pour.v.1646>Process.

Therefore , if we desire to wash our hands with the water coming through the vent-hole , we must be sure that the entire hand is covered with the first gush; then we must close the hole , and open it again for the second outpour.

If he poured the first water over the hands as far as the wrist and poured the second water over the hands beyond the wrist and the latter flowed back to the hands , the hands nevertheless become clean.

Put plastic sheeting , wax paper or multiple layers of newspaper underneath the item being coated to catch drips. See " Seal Coats ' on back. The unique self-leveling qualities of Envirotex Lite can be attained only by using enough material to flood the surface. It is better to mix a little too much , rather than too little.

Wines have all sorts of organic things in them such as yeast , grape skins , so on and so forth. The wine naturally has very small particles of these things that , over the years that wine age , settle out of the wine. That 's why with older red wines , which have much more skin contact , you get more sediment. The trick is to pour the wine slowly into the decanter , keeping the same side down that was down during the aging process. You do n't want to mix all that sediment in now ! Be sure not to let the sediment end up in the decanting glass . </pour.v.2012><pour.v.2013>( d ) The first disciples experienced the baptism with the Holy Spirit by the Father and the Son pouring the Spirit out of heaven upon the church ( Ac. 2 : 1-4 , 18 , 33; cf. 1 : 8; 10 : 44 , 47; 11 : 15 , 16; 19 : 6; cf.

If you are using liquid perfumes , they will sometimes be affected by heat , so add them well after the soap has been re-melted , and stir in gently before the soap goes hard again. When trying out new perfumes , first test them on a small amount of melted soap , so that you can see how much will be needed for the entire batch. Perfumes will leave the soap and go into the air after a time , so use a bit more perfume than you think you will need when you are making the soap.

Smear the caulk out laterally , back and forth on a piece of wax paper to your desired thickness and size. Sort of like making a little shower curtain. It should look like falling water right away. Let it set then cut it into strips the way you want and glue on over your rocks etc. at the top and bottom with the bumpy side exposed. Highlight the strips ( drybrush ) with white enamel to simulate foamy water. Finally pour a gloss over the falls of Magic Water and complete the project. Great way to do whitewater is to mix some white paint with a small cup of the silicone and dab it on the Magic Water after it has set. Another neat trick is to impregnate the silicone with polyfider when doing the falls . </pour.v.2077><pour.v.2078>A.

Pour it down the sides as to not break up the surface of the powder. Gently insert the plunger into the syringe and apply gentle pressure. You want the water to take about a minute to travel evenly through the powder. It is important that it travel evenly , if not then you made a mistake in grinding , pouring , or packing the powder.

Now I am told that I should not have ventured past my fathers method of drip coffee because apparently that is what makes the best cup of coffee; much to my fathers amusement. I see no difference between ' pour over ' and ' drip ' coffee. Purists claim that pour over is brewed on a cup by cup basis with more attention given to how and where you pour the water , hence pour over . </pour.v.2140><pour.v.2141>Remember that when you hear about Jesus dying for you , you know now that it is more than just some whips. While one can not possibly depreciate the physical suffering it was nothing compared to the Son of God being crushed by His own Father. Comparatively those whips were nothing. And when He cried out " It is Finished " that meant Paid In Full'. If you are a Christian , God can never pour out His wrath on you. It is impossible because His son drank it. It does not exist anymore. There is no more punishment left for you . </pour.v.2141><pour.v.2142>To drain the brewer , see details , OR to clear vinegar out of brewer without draining , pour a decanter of fresh , cold water through the brewer.

This carafe keeps coffee hot for hours , although cooling takes place more rapidly as the volume diminishes and the surface area on top increases in the tapered chamber. Pouring is the only issue I might have here. The pour lip has no dimple and if you pour with the screw-in lid , it can spread a bit along the lip and cause some spilling. On the other hand , if you loosen the lid , turn it to the proper 1/4 positions and pour slowly , the coffee comes out leaving a nice ring of fresh-coffee bubbles inside the rim of the cup.

They are being offered 24 for the other 45 per cent of their milk , which averages out at about 28.6 per cent. Most of the dairy farmers who intend to stay in the industry have said that they will make up the difference in the shortfall by boosting their production. They are being offered 14 a litre for milk over and above their 1998-99 market milk production. For 14 a litre they may as well pour the milk down the gutter.

Most oil tankers are now double hulled to reduce the chance of oil leakage if a tanker runs aground. Ocean-going ships filter out most of the oil from bilge maintenance to ensure that it does not reach the ocean and recycling facilities exist to ensure people do not pour oil down storm drains and pollute millions of gallons of water. Another method is for people to spray-paint fish pictures near storm-drains so people do not put oils and other substances down the drain.

At first a man must necessarily come to this order of tears and through them a door is opened unto him to enter into the second order , which is superior to the first; this is the sign that a man has received mercy. These are the tears that are shed because of insight; they make the body comely and anoint it as if with oil , and they pour forth by themselves without compulsion ...

The two rays denote the blood and water which poured from the heart of the crucified savior. This is the final act of Christ 's physical sacrifice which effected the redemption of mankind. The outpouring of blood and water is the final signature of the covenant of redemption ! These rays on the image of Divine Mercy , symbolize the " matter " by which God redeemed mankind. ( 1 John 5 : 7 ) . This outpouring of blood and water consummated the the sacrificial offering of Christ , who thus exhausted himself for our salvation ! The response " Jesus , I trust in you ! " is necessary to effect the salvation of each individual , and all mankind ! Thus , this image , is a sacramental representation of the living covenant of salvation. Christ 's outpouring of blood and water is not enough ! Mankind must respond with trust ! These two elements , Christ 's oblation , and mankind 's response in faith , effects salvation for the human race. So , this image is more than an ordinary sacramental.

By which we understand that the grace of God the Father is the same as that of the Holy Spirit , and that without an y division or loss it is divided to the hearts of each.

" ( RVS ) In this type of situation water was used as a cleansing agent to remove evil while oil was used to impart virtue.

It indicates that women are losing less heat through their periphery. Men 's warm hands pour heat out into the environment. Your skin temperature is not 98.6F ( 37C ) . That familiar number is the average temperature of your core. Skin temperature is far cooler than core temperature. One of the ways your body resists heat loss through your periphery is by reducing warm blood flowing to your skin surface. In the cold , your skin temperature quickly drops to that of ( or close to ) the surrounding air or water. If skin surface temperature is close to surrounding temperature , the gradient is small , so heat loss is small. ( Heat travels down gradients from high to low , just as with nitrogen load. ) People with cooler skin in the cold have a smaller skin-to-environment gradient to lose heat. An analogy is if you stand outside your house in cold weather , touch the exterior wall and find it warm , you would notice the expensive loss of heat and know your home needed better insulation.

If enough cream is poured in , eventually you do n't even know that I had coffee in this cup. This is what happened with the March on Washington. The whites did n't integrate it; they infiltrated it.

Sometimes separated toffee or caramel can be saved by removing the saucepan from the heat and stirring constantly and smoothly until it comes back together , then gradually returning it to the heat , stirring constantly. You can also try adding a spoonful or two of very hot water to the toffee to help it come together. Start with one tablespoon and stir the candy to help it come together. Add additional spoonfuls if necessary , but do not add more than 1/4 cup of water total. If you have already poured your candy out to cool by the time it separates , the candy is unfortunately too far gone to save . </pour.v.2481><pour.v.2482>2.

" ( 3 ) And well does he say " gifts , " for as the Son was given , of Whom it is written : " Unto us a Child is born , unto us a Son is given; " ( 4 ) so , too , is the grace of the Spirit given. But why should I hesitate to say that the Holy Spirit also is given to us , since. it is written : " The love of God is shed forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit , Who is given to us.

It is , after all , only a simple process of pouring a liquid from one container to another. There are two significant reasons for decanting. The first is to expose a wine to air. Young red wines ( and whites too , for that matter ) will benefit from a good mixing with air. This " breathing " allows the sometimes harsh tannic elements present in a youthful red to soften , making the wine more pleasurable to consume. As red wines age , though , this softening process takes place naturally within the bottle as the wine changes chemically. The result of these molecular changes is the residue or sediment one can observe in a older bottle of red wine. Removing the liquid from the now solid portion of an older wine is the second reason for decanting . </pour.v.2497><pour.v.2498>Valuable Recipe for Dysentery -- Take of peach leaves one handful , pour one pint of boiling water over them; then add one tablespoonful of Epson Salts.

The best way to open a bottle of sparkling wine is to hold the cork in one hand and the bottle in the other. Slowly twist THE BOTTLE while gently allowing the cork to come slowly free. If you do this slowly , while holding the cork IN just as it starts to come all the way out , you will get a nice hiss as the cork comes slowly free.

Like an unbendable arm , you think your power is gushing out through your arm , it becomes very strong and difficult to bend. Such use of the mind is called pouring forth Ki. If you believe that your Ki is gushing forth , your Ki is really gushing out. For example , as you are walking along somebody pushes you by the shoulder. If you pull your Ki inward or your mind trails behind your body , your attacker will be able to push you back or throw you down. If you pour forth your Ki and your mind is ahead of your body , he will not be able to push you back instead he himself will be pushed back by the impact . </pour.v.2572><pour.v.2573>Refrigerate for 2 hours.

Wine often drips when poured , but there are a few clever ways to prevent this. One is to insert a small , round disk , often called Drop Stops , into the mouth of the bottle. This will encourage any drips that form to roll back into the bottle. You may also place a fabric-lined ring around the top of the bottle to catch any wine that rolls down the side. Both items are available in fine wine shops and houseware stores. Alternatively , you may always perfect the " pour and roll. " As you finish pouring , twist the bottle slightly as you pull it up and away from glass. This technique is nearly foolproof for preventing spills , but keep a napkin nearby just in case . </pour.v.2574><pour.v.2575>This is where you pour the wine out of the bottle into another container ( a " decanter " ) . Properly decanting a bottle lets you get rid of sediment. Use a candle behind the neck of the bottle to see when sediment gets to the neck ( I 'm repeating the standard line here -- -Assuming you do n't get it close enough to heat up the wine , is there some reason you ca n't use a light bulb ? ) . Stop pouring as soon as you see the sediment. Not all wines have sediment , but old vintage Port does and is always decanted for this reason.

Whilst boiling ( 212F ) water is excellent for most teas , delicate teas ( e.g. white tea ) are better with 180F ) . Using good quality water is essential.

Whereas a pot of cold water thrown into the air comes down as large blobs of water. This happens because the hot water is so close to being steam , that the act of throwing it into the air causes it to break up into tiny droplets. ( hot water is less viscous than cold water , listen to the sound it makes when you pour it in the sink ) The small water droplets have a large surface area which allows for a great deal of evaporation , this removes heat quickly. And finally , the cooled droplets are so small , that they can be easily frozen by the winter air. All of this happens before the water hits the ground. Cold water is thicker and stickier , it does n't break up into such small pieces when thrown into the air , so it comes down in large blobs.

As the lemon juice cuts through the dirt , the olive oil shines and protects the wood. Use a dry cloth to polish off. Be careful when using on modern surfaces , though , as many do not need regular polishing , and excessive amounts of oil could leave the surface feeling tacky.

Lye-based liquids usually contain a warning to avoid squeezing the container , but carelessness could lead to a disfiguring splash on the skin or a blinding squirt in the eye. Products that contain lye in a pellet form sometimes require you to measure a spoonful out of an opening which is too small for a spoon to fit. This situation is very hazardous because lye-based pellets are easily spilled as one pours the product from the container onto the spoon. Be extremely careful when using lye-based products. Wear gloves and goggles in addition to protecting exposed skin. Avoid fumes by using only under conditions where adequate ventilation exists.

The slab manifold is shipped in a plywood box that doubles as the form you pour the concrete around. Make sure the manifold box is installed plumb. Later , when the pour is complete and you unsweat the pressure test kit from the top of the manifold , you 'll want your supply and return pipes sticking up nice and straight.

Thus : take three handfuls of peach leaves and three medium sized potatoes , and boil them in two quarts of water until the potatoes are done; take out the leaves and throw them away , peal the potatoes and rub them up with a pint of flour , adding cool water sufficient to make a paste , then pour out the hot peach leaf tea , and let it stand for about five minutes. If you add to this a little old yeast , it will be ready for use in three hours. If you add none , it will require a day and night before use. Leaves dried in the shade are as good as fresh ones. As this is stronger than hop yeast , less should be used in making up the dough. -- Washington Telegraph , Ark . </pour.v.2885><pour.v.2886>Some professing Christians spend more on dog food , tobacco , recreation , or hobbies than they give to the work of the Lord. Christ said , For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also. 142 He was establishing the fact that we come to love the things we pour our money into. For example , if we spend every spare penny on our houses , then we will come to love those houses more than we love the Lord , and that is idolatry. It is as nauseous to God as bowing down before an image of wood or stone. If we are living to increase our assets , sinking every possible dollar into stocks and bonds , it will not be long before we will love those pieces of paper more than we love Jesus Christ and His work . </pour.v.2886><pour.v.2887>For ceiling stains , mix 1-half cup of household bleach in 1 quart of warm water and pour some into a spray bottle.

In like manner that you may believe that that which is shed abroad can not be common to the creatures but peculiar to the Godhead , the name of the Son is also poured forth , as you read : " Thy Name is as ointment poured forth. " ( 3 ) Of which saying nothing can surpass the force. For as ointment closed up in a vase keeps in its perfume , so long as it is confined in the narrow space of that vase , though it can not reach many , it yet preserves its strength. But when the ointment has been poured out of that vase wherein it was enclosed , it spreads far and wide; so , too , the Name of Christ before His coming amongst the people of Israel was enclosed in the minds of the Jews as in some vase. For " God is known in Judah , His Name is great in Israel; " ( 4 ) that is , the Name which the vases of the Jews held confined in their narrow limits . </pour.v.2890><pour.v.2891>For this reason , always pour the wax from the jar with the bottom of the jar facing toward your partner 's feet , not over your partner 's face.

Fresh milk with the addition of kefir grains stored in a goatskin leather bag was left for 24 hours to ferment at room temperature. This initiated the fermentation process. Separation of the grains was achieved by forcing the contents to a corner of the leather bag by hand , where most of the grains were retained. The liquid-kefir was separated from most of the grains by pouring the contents into a container. This kefir had a moderate sour taste , creamy in texture and consistency with an alcohol content of around .5 by volume. During cold conditions , the goatskin bag was kept in the sun during sunny cold days , or hung near a fireplace. Apparently , it was a custom to hang the bag near a door way , where by anyone passing by would shake the leather bag. This was possibly performed as a religious ritual , with a beneficial consequence by assisting the culture-process . </pour.v.2892><pour.v.2893>Luddites : Fill up your pail with fresh milk from your cow or goat. Let the milk stand for a few hours so the cream will rise to the top. Using a broad , flat ladle , separate the cream off of the top. If you drill small holes in the ladle , say 1/16 of an inch or so , the milk will pour through leaving the cream behind. Do this for a few days or a week , storing the cream in a cool place. If you are refrigerating the cream while gathering it , it will also need to be soured. If you are storing it in your root cellar , it will probably sour sufficiently before it comes time to make the butter . </pour.v.2893><pour.v.2894>Turn on the Separate Valley Polygons check button for the Watershed process to artificially separate basins at the intersection of each branch ( tributary ) where the outflow of the branch pours into the main stream channel.

One weekend while cleaning house , I decided to mix a Tide sample with the gloppy homemade laundry detergent. I shook it up and when I went to start my next load , it wasn ' t gloppy ! So , if the gloppyness of the homemade laundry detergent , bothers you , try adding a cup or so of a store bought laundry detergent to your liquid soap mix and shake. It pours out of the used laundry detergent bottles easily and helps keep the glop and water from seperating. There must be something in the store bought detergent to resolve this problem.

Passing to his more immediate subject , he proves that the Holy Spirit is above the whole Creation and is truly God , alleging as a special argument that the sin against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven , here or hereafter. He shows how the Holy Spirit is in Scripture called the Spirit of God; that He spoke by the prophets and apostles; that He sanctifies men , and is typified by the mystical ointment spoken of in Scripture. Next , St. Ambrose treats of His oneness with the other two Persons of the Holy Trinity , and shows that His mission in no way detracts from this oneness , but that there is in all the Divine Persons a perfect unity of peace , love , and other virtues . </pour.v.2902><pour.v.2903>Shake the ingredients ( use rum from Trinidad if you have it ) briefly with cracked ice , then strain into a Collins glass 3/4 full of shaved or finely crushed ice and swizzle.

Basically , you can pour a number of ways , all with their pros and cons , but which ever method you prefer there are a few basics. When you pick up a liquor bottle , hold it by the neck , wrapping your index finger around the base of the pour spout. This will give you maximum control of the bottle , allowing you to direct the liquor stream , and will prevent the occurrence of having the speed pourer slip out of the bottle. As you begin to pour keep the bottle just slightly off vertical. Tilting the bottle more than this , inhibits the steady flow which is vitally important to proper pouring technique. Of course you will need to develop a " count " for measuring your pour. Every type of pour spout has its own rate of flow. To stop a pour , lower the bottom of the bottle and , in the same motion , twist the pour spout towards you. Making sure each shot is poured with a finishing snap of the wrist which will knock the liquor back down and avoid dripping . </pour.v.2949><pour.v.2950>John 2 : 15 He made a whip of cords , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables.

If you do n't stir it immediately as you pour the lye into the water , the lye will settle to the bottom and quickly solidify. This is n't a problem as tapping it with the stirring utensil will break it up. As you mix it a chemical reaction takes place between the lye and the water , heating it up. If you are making a large batch of soap , the lye can possibly start the water boiling - with little droplets of lye water splattering all over the place. If this starts happening , stop stirring it until the bubbling stops. Generally , it does n't take more than a minute to dissolve the lye crystals in the water.

Many find relief in using their neti pot , a utensil that looks like a magic genie pot or a tea pot with a long narrow spout. The neti pot has been used in the Orient for many centuries to help unclog sinus passages. Using 1 cup of distilled slightly warm water , fill the pot and add teaspoon baking soda and teaspoon sea salt ( it has less sodium than regular salt ) . Bend over a sink basin and gently pour water into one nasal cavity until it flows out the other cavity , then reverse. The process helps clear sinus passages of the mucus which can lead to infections. Neti pots can be found online or in some drugstores , but if this process sounds awkward , there are plastic squeeze bottle nasal irrigation kits , sold in drugstores , which do the same thing and are easier to use for some.

The flat taste of boiled water can be improved by pouring it back and forth from one container to another ( called aeration ) , by allowing it to stand in a closed container for a few hours , or by adding a small pinch of salt for each quart of water boiled. When boiling is not practical , chemical disinfection should be used. Common household bleach contains a chlorine compound that will disinfect water. The treated water should be mixed thoroughly and allowed to stand , preferably covered , for 30 minutes. The water should have a slight chlorine odor; if not , repeat the dosage and allow the water to stand for an additional 15 minutes. If the treated water has too strong a chlorine taste , it can be made more pleasing by allowing the water to stand exposed to the air for a few hours or by pouring it from one clean container to another several times . </pour.v.3045><pour.v.3046>February Third Friday Ride in three days ! on Feb 16 , 2010 in Group Rides central austin izzoz tacos pour house scooters third friday </pour.v.3046><pour.v.3047>Radio has the biggest challenge of its life with the growth of the Internet and iPod , but we have to understand the real threat ... ourselves.

This will produce a fizzing action that will release dirt and mildew from the grout that can then be further cleaned and removed with a large toothbrush or other scrubbing brush or tool. A paste can also be made from the vinegar , baking soda , and lemon juice to scrub the grout with. Some people prefer to mix vinegar and water in equal parts and spray onto the area to be cleaned then wipe up with a wet sponge while others like to sprinkle baking soda on a lemon half and then scrub the grout that way. Lemon juice seems to be very effective when removing soap scum and water deposits. Running a hot shower to steam up the bathroom before cleaning it may loosen dirt and grime from grout and tile before you attempt to scrub it clean . </pour.v.3081><pour.v.3082>When the salve starts the thicken it is time to pour it into small jars and containers for easy use.

Once you determine how much to add and how it should be applied ( either diluted or broadcast ) , pour a portion of the pH Decreaser in front or each return jet-the return jets will disperse the pH Decreaser throughout the pool water. If the manufacturer of the pH Decreaser that you purchase does not require it to be diluted , then secure yourself on the pool deck , bend down very close to the surface of the water , and still pour the pH Decreaser in front of each return jet. Since the granules are so powder-like , the wind can blow them out of the pool , or worse , in your face or eyes.

Once the water level is low - add more water , and so on and so on - until the flavour of the tea is exhausted. Look at the pattern of the leaves in the brew - they foretell life. Alternatively as with all top quality teas , scoop 2-4 teaspoons of tea into the teapot , pour in boiling water that has been freshly drawn ( previously boiled water has lost most of its oxygen and therefore tends to be flat tasting ) , steep for 2-4 minutes ( to taste ) , stir ( virtually all the leaves will sink -the flowers will float ) , pour into your cup but do not add milk or sugar since green tea is enjoyed ? straight-up ? . </pour.v.3151><pour.v.3152>O men , worship ye Soma , him who is now purified , fain to serve the Gods.

The usual choice is 5.25 bleach. Chlorinated lime may also be used , and has the advantage of being a compact , dense , potent powder , so it takes up less space ( volume ) than bleach water. But be careful using chlorinated lime : it is a dry fluffy powder you do NOT want to breathe ! When using powdered chlorine , it is best to mix the proper amount of powder with a small amount of water , making a paste , then gradually dilute to one gallon and allow the inert material to settle out , then the clear solution should be poured off and used. If the tank has a bottom drain , however , the powdered chlorine can be put directly into the tank , then the precipitate flushed out the bottom through the drain prior to use . </pour.v.3220><pour.v.3221>Lightly oil an 8x8x2-inch pan.

Of what Angel do we find the power diffused over many ? For Angels were sent to few , but the Holy Spirit was poured upon whole peoples.

The use of the two activities during the lesson was an excellent way to stress inquiry in the lesson. However , the students may have learned more about scientific inquiry if they had been allowed to be more actively involved in the lesson. Chrissy and Christine stated that during the first lesson they allowed one student to participate in pouring the cold water and it did not work out well , so it is reasonable to assume that they were thinking of making the lesson more understandable for the students by doing the actual pouring themselves. However , we think it is possible that they could have considered this more in their planning and found more ways to get the students actively involved in actually participating in the lesson. However , they made excellent use of the technology available , and had a very informative and interesting lesson , so we think they did a great job . </pour.v.3359><pour.v.3360>The most important aspect of the Devotion of Divine Mercy is the need to trust in God 's goodness. " The vessel with which souls receive abundant graces , and special favors , is confidence ! " The confident , trusting soul is like a lightening rod for Gods mercy and grace. Jesus could not stress strongly enough , that it was the soul 's trust itself , that acted as the perfect channel by which God 's grace could pour into a persons life ! Trust is like a unitive kiss , by which God is helplessly drawn to the soul , and allowed to freely pour himself into the soul. " Trust itself is the channel !

With most of these kegerators , the first glass of beer is always foamy. This is because cold air is heavier than warm air and it sinks down into the kegerator and because the beer tower is mounted on top , it stays at room temperature. And so are the top of the beer line , the beer faucet &amp;beer shank that are inside and attached to the beer tower. The first glass of beer passes through the warm beer line , faucet &amp;shank and warms up and the CO2 breaks out of the beer causing foam. The second glass and subsequent glasses are OK as long as you keep pouring because now everything is cold. But you will get another glass of warm beer after 15 20 minutes have passed without dispensing a beer.

Set your CO2 regulator too low or even turn off your CO2 bottle between pours and often your keg will start to go flat before you can empty it.

I did some cost analysis and the cost of construction for this is about the same and in some cases cheaper than conventional stick built construction depending on your area. Another less expensive ( and less thermally efficient ) option is to construct wooden forms for the walls and pour them with concrete ( and reinforcing. ) Lastly , there is masonry construction. If a reader wanted to go this route , they could either erect the block walls and reinforce each cell or put a rebar in every 2 or 3 cells with the remaining cells filled with gravel.

When we artificially trap gases and compress them into anything , the smallest pin hole puncture or itty bitty leak empties the compressed gas. Only a trace will be left. Anyone who handles gasses knows this and this is why tanks have to be carefully sealed and kept very safe and not thrown about. This is why you ca n't fill old tanks that look OK. They have to be replaced on a regular schedule . </pour.v.3489><pour.v.3490>Abraham , Job and Joseph were righteous men. But God brought them low in order to test their obedience.

Notice I did n't put that can of molten lead on that tall stove without added support. In spite of all the suggestions to use a cast iron pot for the job , I found this large metal can worked fine. I drilled below the rim for a 1/4 " metal rod which holds a " bucket bail " made of plumbers strap. I also used plumbers strap to make a tilt control handle for the pour. It worked great - I actually lifted the can with the claw of a framing hammer and tilted it with strap handle.

This is to ensure that the water is still boiling when it hits the tea leaves. Rule Number Seven : As soon as the water has reached OBP ( Optimum Boiling Point ) , and while it is still bubbling , briskly pour it from a good height into your teapot. Fill the pot to the level required by the amount of leaves. The briskness and height of the pour will agitate the leaves and do away with the need for any further stirring.

By which we understand that the grace of God the Father is the same as that of the Holy Spirit , and that without any division or loss it is divided to the hearts of each.

With decanting , much of the sediment can be left behind in the original bottle , and the air will soften the flavors in the wine and accentuate delicate , and release complex or hidden aromas and flavors within the wine. There is very little need to decant most young and/or inexpensive red wines , or white wines at all. Very old red wines and vintage ports are the common exception , and should be decanted. Most wines open up nicely simply by being poured into a proper glass and standing for a few minutes. That being said , very young and often inexpensive red wines can benefit from aeration greatly. Decanting a young wine into a larger container several hours prior to serving , seems to take the " edge " off the wine and allow some measures of complexity to develop.

The translucent center is most likely due to " gelling " which happens after the soap mix is poured into the mold and while it 's saponifying ( oils and lye reacting to make soap ) , a lot of heat is produced and that causes the soap ( especially the center where it 's hottest ) to have more of a translucent appearance. If you like the translucent look and wants it throughout the soap next time , you can try covering the whole soap mold with kitchen towels after pouring in the soap mixture - this will help retain heat and gelling will more likely reach the edges of the soap block.
