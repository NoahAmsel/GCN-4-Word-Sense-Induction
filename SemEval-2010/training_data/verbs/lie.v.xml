<lie.v.train><lie.v.1>As Adam 's equal , Lilith refused to lie on her back while Adam took the dominant position in sex ( missionary style ) . Lilith believed that they should make love as equals ( the beast with two backs ) . Adam was adamantly against this , wanting his wife to be submissive , and Lilith left the Garden of Eden . </lie.v.1><lie.v.2>Thank you for the info , now I have to read all about his work. Maybe it will help me find out the truth without resorting to lie detectors or truth serum ! </lie.v.2><lie.v.3>I had a girl who was a love addict ( I did not know it at the time ) . She had two failed marriages and a current live in boyfirend of three years. She said It is over with him , but never left. She would disappear for two months and return to me suddenly. One time she came over , threw herself on me and her kid who was in the car caught us , naturally she lied about that to her boyfriend Now she is getting married. does this ever catch up with them ? I feel sorry for the dude who is hooking up with her. Patterns never end. I am finished with women for awhile. they all are deceptive to one degree or another. Life is not as complicated now.. </lie.v.3><lie.v.4>Another myth is that CPS can conduct an investigation in your home without your consent and speak to your child without your consent. CPS employees will lie to you and tell you they do not need your consent. The fact of the matter is they absolutely need your consent to come in your home and speak with your children. If there is no exigent circumstances ( imminent danger ) to your children with probable cause ( credible witness ) to support a warrant , CPS anywhere in the United States can not lawfully enter your home and speak with you and your children. In fact it is illegal and you can sue the social worker and the police who assist them and they both lose immunity from being sued . </lie.v.4><lie.v.5>The priesthoods are the branch of religious service that carries the greatest prestige and heaviest responsibilities. Because of the heavy responsibilities the office is avoided rather than sought , and considerable difficulty is experienced in recruiting the priesthoods. As one informant said , " They have to catch the men young to make them priests. For if they are old enough to realize all that is required of them , they will refuse. " She was not thinking of the taboos and restraints of the priestly life , but of the sense of responsibility for the welfare of the tribe which lies so heavily on the shoulders of the priests. The same informant continued : " Yesterday my younger </lie.v.5><lie.v.6>What I want to know is why this kind of lying is apparently OK. Is n't it worse to refer " repeatedly to intelligence ... that remains largely unverified " -- as the Wall Street Journal puts it -- in order to trick the nation into war , as Bush and other top US officials have done , than to lie about a blowjob ? Is n't it worse to put " pressure ... on the intelligence agencies to deliberately slant estimates , " as USA Today worded its report ? Is n't it more damaging to offer " cooked information , " in the words of the CIA 's former chief of counterterrorism , when you are asking young men and women to die for your lies ? Do n't we revile Lyndon Johnson for having done just that with his dishonest Gulf of Tonkin resolution ? </lie.v.6><lie.v.7>Islam is the only world-religion that implies in its scriptures that it is ever permissible ( or even encouraged ) to lie. In his Sira , Muhammad authorized lying to improve the chances of successful assassinations , for example in the case of Shaaban Ibn Khalid al-Hazly and Bin Kaab . </lie.v.7><lie.v.8>Through his uncontrolled laughter he confessed , I ' m not the real Mr. Clueless ! He lied to you ! Help ! </lie.v.8><lie.v.9>After he was reelected in 1996 , he lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He lied about his efforts to cover up that relationship. He lied to his wife , his daughter , his staff , his Cabinet , and his constituents and authorized a vast public relations campaign to slander duly appointed officers of the US Department of Justice charged with investigating many of the lies listed above . </lie.v.9><lie.v.10>Education : Typically , the lie goes like this : The institution listed is n't one the applicant attended. Or the institution is correct , but the degree listed was never actually earned , because the candidate finished school a few credits short. " Ironically , the absence of a few credits probably would not make a difference to many companies , but lying on the resume certainly will , " said Challenger CEO John Challenger in a statement . </lie.v.10><lie.v.11>Mr. Woodward , I suppose it has not occurred to you that lies hurt journalists as much -- if not more -- than presidents. The stock in trade of journalists is their credibility with the public. Once that 's gone , journalists have nothing else; presidents at least have the power of their office ( and nothing else , in the case of the current occupant . ) </lie.v.11><lie.v.12>All credit to Michelle Leslie for doing the smart thing - that is to show respect and humility by wearing islamic dress. Rather than look like white trash or a whore , she inspired sympathy by looking like an innocent young virgin. Although it may be hard to swallow for many Australians , western women are seen as promiscious sluts who sleep around like dogs on heat and this kind of image will not inspire much sympathy in a foreign country. Why be foolish and argue with the system or denounce the laws of another country - Michelle Leslie may have lied to get out but she has the rest of her life to live and reflect upon whether it was worth it and her case is in stark contrast to Schapelle Corby . </lie.v.12><lie.v.13>There 's no question that in her testimony , Plame Wilson omitted inconvenient facts and put an inapt emphasis on others. If Bond 's characterization of the evidence is correct , she may actually have lied. Lying under oath before Congress constitutes perjury and a violation of the False Statements Act -- the same crimes that accounted for three of the four charges that Scooter Libby was recently convicted of. Would n't it be ironic if Valerie Plame Wilson were to share Libby 's fate ? </lie.v.13><lie.v.14>One could write a thesis on " Why lies prevail " , and indeed no doubt countless such exist in hallowed halls. " That lies prevail " , however , is more than adequately documented . </lie.v.14><lie.v.15>Then Peter said , " Ananias , how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land ? Did n't it belong to you before it was sold ? And after it was sold , was n't the money at your disposal ? What made you think of doing such a thing ? You have not lied to men but to God. " Acts 5 : 1-4 </lie.v.15><lie.v.16>If Jindal comes out and says he merely made a " misstatement " , will that make everything okay like it did for Hillary ? " I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base ... " Ah , to be a politician ... The freedom to lie blatantly and never feel a moment 's remorse. What a great life ! </lie.v.16><lie.v.17>The main point I want to make from this reading from Proverbs is that Ellen White actually lied when she said , " The Bible nowhere sanctions the use of intoxicating wine. " </lie.v.17><lie.v.18>According to Pelosi today , it wasn ' t the CIA who lied to her but the Bush administration. Because that CIA briefer who identified himself in the meetings as a CIA briefer was really Scooter Libby in disguise , I guess . </lie.v.18><lie.v.19>But so it has gone in the past sixteen years , as lying became a Democratic disease in the press corps ' reliable scripts. In the journalism of the past sixteen years , Republicans have been allowed to misstate as much as they pleased. By way of contrast , the press corps has often invented lies , then pretended that Major Democrats said them. Covering Palin , hapless news orgs like the New York Times are enacting this drama again.Compare the treatment of Palin 's straightforward lie with the treatment of Gore 's ( accurate ) statements about his role in the development of the internet ( let alone the stuff that was entirely made up ) , and I think it tells you what you need to know . </lie.v.19><lie.v.20>No one could get through on the phone to fiery 's home. For days all we got was her answering machine. When one of us finally got though she just lied more to cover it up. Something about " our house sitter did it. " Just more lies . </lie.v.20><lie.v.21>Historically , the use of " zero " to label a null set has not always been obvious even in human cultures , which in many cases lacked a formal term for zero as recently as the late Middle Ages. The value of number research lies mainly in its ability to help determine the extent of animal cognition and animals ' potential for more complex capacities. To that end , Dr. Pepperberg 's studies on the avian brain are continuing with research into Alex 's ability to count , as well as add and subtract small quantities . </lie.v.21><lie.v.22>This is how the power game is played. It was through incessant lies that fascism took root in Italy , Japan , and China ( the Nationalist regime ) , Nazism in Germany , Communism in Russia , and China , all of one sort of socialism or another , and all tyrannies. Of course , we should not forget the American fascist tyranny under President Wilson , especially during WWI. ( Surprised ? Read your American history . ) </lie.v.22><lie.v.23>Yes , I can sort of see the point of allowing some social contexts in which people accept that it is ok to lie about certain topics; maybe folks there are more interested in seeing how well and creatively you lie , and don ' t really care much about the truth on those topics. But it seems to me ok to require some explicit opting in there; I ' m fine with a default to legally punish liars. Unless your audience agreed that certain lies are ok , they aren ' t ok . </lie.v.23><lie.v.24>Obama , Pelosi , The ACLU knew this would help ' Requite " Thousands of Al Quada want-a be 's . Just lie the Lie about the Koran being flushed down the John at Gitmo .So that was their Motive all alone .Then we would tuck our Tails and walk away from these wars with Al Quada and the Teligane since Radical Socialist have no Honor or Love of America in fact they all see America as the Problem ... .. Look no futher than Obama speechs in Europe on what was wrong with America ''before " Him ... .. He 's the damn problem as his FELLLOW ANTI WAR SOCIALIST FRIENDS . </lie.v.24><lie.v.25>For an elected Representative of the U.S. Congress to stand in front of hundreds of her peers , reporters , network television cameras , essentially the world , look at Judy Shepard , who , for ten years has worked to make her son ' s death at least have some meaning , for Virginia Foxx to stand up and lie is inexcusable. Our elected officials are supposed to stand for our highest ideals. They are supposed to stand for truth. They are supposed to make the world a better place for all people. For Virginia Foxx to lie to the world , and to Matthew ' s mother , is not only unacceptable , it is unforgivable. And it is time for Virginia Foxx to resign . </lie.v.25><lie.v.26>What is perplexing , however , are unnecessary lies. Silly falsehoods , said for no apparent reason , on topics that the world would have totally avoided had you not lied about it in the first place. One strange Sarah Palin falsehood , which she acclaimed as truth yesterday and the campaign reaffirmed tonight in video was that she successfully auctioned a private jet she deemed unnecessary for the State of Alaska to maintain on eBay. It 's a strange falsehood because , in the first place , really , who cares ? Moreover , it 's bizarre because eBay founder Meg Whitman works for the McCain campaign ! She 's right there ! In the building ! And surely she can explain to Palin that she is getting that weird bit of biography wrong . </lie.v.26><lie.v.27>I do think it is justified. Has anyone been held in Contempt of Congress ? Is n't Leahy the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ? For 8 years , we and they have been lied to , and nothing has happened as a result. You have to hold those with the responsibility , well , responsible . </lie.v.27><lie.v.28>The GOP has been lying throughout this election. It 's part of the Rove shift in politics. Rove and the GOP have been taking advantage of the fact that citizens do n't think candidates lie. The GOP lies , and it 's reported as " not completely accurate " . Time to start calling a spade a spade. A " lie " is when someone intentionally says something they know is false. GOP the party for liars . </lie.v.28><lie.v.29>4. He 's done it before. Okay , it does n't take a brain surgeon to tell you that if he has lied before , he may lie again. Not to throw the man under the bus or anything of course , it would also depend on what he 's lied about in the past but you can never trust someone who 's capable of making up stories too easily . </lie.v.29><lie.v.30>In the coming weeks , I ' ll be posting more items to this blog challenging lies told on the campaign trail. I will try to confine myself to lies told by the campaigns themselves , not their proxies , and I will actively seek those lies on both sides of the aisle; if you have one you think I should address , feel free to tell me . </lie.v.30><lie.v.31>If you are a young person having trouble with your parents , involvement with a cult such as Seventh-day Adventism is one way of getting back at your parents , showing your rebellion and expressing your independence. Anyone going through a painful or stressful period in life will search around for something better. In this state one is at extremely high risk for taking the bait. You may be interested in one of their vegetarian cooking classes , you may be a smoker and want to kick the habit at one of the Five Day Plans. These shows of interest will give Adventists considerable license over you. You may be under great pressure from one parent , spouse or other relatives of friends to join the church. You may just go along to keep the peace without realizing what might lie ahead . </lie.v.31><lie.v.32>And Jon may be the greatest liar in the history of " Survivor. " Not only has he lied consistently to everyone about alliances he 's made ( and quickly broken ) , but the guy lied about the death of his grandmother to win a reward. The truly amazing thing is that so many of his fellow contestants have believed him . </lie.v.32><lie.v.33>Which is true enough. But it kind of misses the point. The articles claiming Bush has been dishonest are n't only about the horizontal dimension of the graph ( did n't lie/lied ) . They 're also about the vertical dimension of the graph ( justified/not justified ) . See , Bush 's stated motives have basically been a laundry list of every conceivable justification for going to war. If a bunch of those justifications turn out not to be grounded in reality , then yeah , it will mean Bush was probably lying , and the partisan folks at the New York Times or the Guardian are going to make hay with that. But it will also weigh heavily in any rational determination about whether the war was justified. Not because Bush was lying per se , but because of what it was he was lying about ( namely , the evidence he supposedly used in making his own decision about whether the war was justified ) . </lie.v.33><lie.v.34>Lying is bad. It 's particularly bad for presidents to lie. Recent history suggests that when they do - as Lyndon Johnson did in Vietnam and as Richard Nixon did in Watergate - the consequences can be frightful. But is every lie a Vietnam-size lie ? </lie.v.34><lie.v.35>Ken and Lesley move into a bigger office to accommodate their booming business. Enter young couple , Brandon and Amber. Brandon invented fantastic stories about himself and his sex life to impress Amber , the girl he hopes to marry. But Brandon ' s lies add up to one big question for Amber : Can she trust Brandon enough to spend her life with him ? </lie.v.35><lie.v.36>My ex-husband lied to me from the outset about communication with his ex-GF who had moved from MA to TX. He lied when he went on a military tour to Corpus Christi about meeting up with her ( he told me he had no intention or plan to do so , but I found out when she called the house one night shortly before he left to finalize their plans - and it was confirmed when one of his friends called to tell me what a sweetheart she was when they met her ) . </lie.v.36><lie.v.37>Some of the " superhuman " feats of strength demonstrated by stage hypnotists are merely tricks. Such a trick involves having a person lie down on three chairs - one under his head , one under his buttocks , and one under his feet. The hypnotist gives a suggestion of rigidity and removes the center chair. Miraculously , the person remains there supported only by the two end chairs ! It is n't such a miracle. An average person can do the same thing. Even you can - unless you tell yourself that you ca n't . </lie.v.37><lie.v.38>I do n't know what is scarier. The fact that people do n't seem to care that they are being lied to by candidates for the highest political offices of this country or that the lies form the basis of a presidential campaign plan. Either way , our country is in big trouble . </lie.v.38><lie.v.39>Sheltering lies are areas where fish go ONLY to find protection from predators. Because of the relative lack of food in such places , fish usually do not hold in them for extended periods. Fish head to sheltering lies when alarmed or hooked , so in order to play a fish effectively , a fly fisher should scout out all probable sheltering lies before casting to a fish. Sheltering lies are always under something . </lie.v.39><lie.v.40>Why you should come clean : Although any doctor will be able to spot the lie if you 're seriously overweight , some naturally slimmer people are harder to suss out. If you lie about exercising , your doctor may assume your heart is healthy and fail to do the important cardio checks - blood pressure , cholesterol count and an ECG ( electro cardiogram ) heart test. This could prove fatal as undetected heart problems and high blood pressure can be silent killers . </lie.v.40><lie.v.41>Unfortunatly , when men lie to accomplish anything they make us all look bad. When women are burned by multiple bad experiences they start to become suspecious of anything thats said to them , which , then makes it hard , if not impossible for decent guys to find " the right one " . From personal experience , this is what creates the whole high-maintenance psycho bitch thing that you mentioned . </lie.v.41><lie.v.42>( 122 ) Mark writes thus , and Peter through him bears witness about himself. For the whole of Mark 's Gospel is said to be the record of Peter 's teaching. Surely , then , men who refused ( to record ) what seemed to them to spread their good fame , and handed down in writing slanders against themselves to unforgetting ages , and accusations of sins , which no one in after years would ever have known of unless he had heard it from their own voice , by thus placarding themselves , may justly be considered to have ( b ) been void of all egoism and false speaking , and to have given plain and clear proof of their truth-loving disposition. And as for such people who think they invented and lied , and try to slander them as deceivers , ought they not to become a laughing-stock , being convicted as friends of envy and malice , and foes of truth itself , who take men that have exhibited in their own words good proof of their integrity , and their really straightforward and sincere ( c ) character , and suggest that they are rascals and clever sophists , who invent what never took place , and ascribe gratuitously to their own Master what He never did ? </lie.v.42><lie.v.43>The urge to push. The longest part of labor is the time it takes for the cervix to open wide enough for the baby to pass into the birth canal or vagina ( first stage ) . You can tell the cervix has opened all the way ( fully dilated ) when the mother has a very strong need to push ( second stage ) . She can not hold back that urge and may make sounds like she is going to the bathroom. Once she starts pushing , the baby can be born in a few minutes or a couple of hours. As birth gets closer , the area around the vagina begins to bulge out until the top of the baby 's head can be seen at the vaginal opening. The mother should be encouraged to push the baby 's head out gently in any position that is comfortable for her. She does not have to lie on her back in bed; but , you will feel safer if she is lying down or squatting so the baby can slip gently onto a soft surface . </lie.v.43><lie.v.44>" It 's like if I 'm going to lie , I have to lie big , " she sighs. " What do you say ? 'His penmanship is that of a disturbed three-year-old ? ' " </lie.v.44><lie.v.45>To many people that might not seem like a such a serious 0r important lie. But it is; it ' s very important. Throughout her career , Bachmann has claimed that she represents personal devotion to Jesus Christ , Christian values , and to be acting on instructions from God. Yet here she is , lying in church , to fellow conservative Christians in the name of Jesus Christ . </lie.v.45><lie.v.46>It is quite comical for the left to be complaining about lying. They have spent the last 7 years telling the biggest lie of all , that Bush intentionally lied about Iraq and WMD . </lie.v.46><lie.v.47>I have vowed to keep posting on that sight until an American news org. runs the headline Rumsfeld lied . So far every U.S. news artical has said stuff like Rumsfeld ' s mistakes . Rumsfeld ' s misteps  etc </lie.v.47><lie.v.48>Address the lie. If you observe a child lying , even occasionally , do n't ignore the behavior. Lies that go unchallenged give students the impression that they can get away with lying and encourage them to tell bigger lies. A student whose lies go unchallenged also might become a more skilled , and even compulsive , liar. Intervening quickly also is important because lying can cause social problems for the student . </lie.v.48><lie.v.49>Well here we go again another " lie ' I am begining to wonder why she tends to lie maybe her husband is rubbing off on her ? He lied about Monica " L " and also gave pardon to crooks. By her husband campaigining for her it also is a realization that she ca n't stand alone as a candidate . </lie.v.49><lie.v.50>But I do believe in the power of truth ( though in the power of all humans to take it in , not so much ) , and I do believe lies must be fought with truth. It would be odd if I did n't , given what I 've spent the last three and a half years doing ! But that 's a different thing. I think the truth is the best answer to lies , but it does not follow and it is not true that I think the truth will always automatically prevail. It 's so visibly not prevailing right now - and why should we not consider this particular moment as 'the end ' just as much as some hazy time in the future which , when it arrives , will be no more special or end-like than this moment now is ? At any given time , there are myriad places and ways the truth is not prevailing; fighting lies with truth is a constant and often losing battle. Depressing but - er - true . </lie.v.50><lie.v.51>Palin not only lied about the bridge proposal and plane sale , she also lied about something as simple as her son going to Iraq. How is it that her son is going to Iraq in 2 weeks when he has n't even reported to boot camp yet ? Does Palin and the republican party have a problem with stretching the truth or what ? I do n't believe anything that comes out of their mouths ! </lie.v.51><lie.v.52>I , myself am not happy when I lie. I find I become very uncomfortable. It 's not for me. And I do n't want to be lied to. Ido n't ask if an outfit makes my but look big. i know it is big. If I have a terminal illness , I 'll want to know. There may be things I want and need to do. Just Me that 's all . </lie.v.52><lie.v.53>* If your child lies by making up things , you should n't bridle his imagination but instead help him understand what is actually real and what 's pretended with the aid of examples such as movies and books. Set aside definite time for imaginary play , why not with dress-up costumes to help him differentiate reality from fiction . </lie.v.53><lie.v.54>Fidgeting and awkward hand movements are also thought to be signs of deceit - the assumption being that when people are lying they become agitated and this gives rise to nervous movements of the hands. There is a class of gestures called " adaptors " which consists of actions like stroking one 's hair , scratching one 's head or rubbing the hands together. When people tell lies they sometimes feel guilty or worried about being found out , and these concerns can cause them to produce adaptors. This tends to happen when the stakes are high or when the liar is n't very good at deception. But most of the time the exact opposite happens. Again , because liars are worried about revealing themselves , they tend to inhibit their normal gestural habits. As a result their actions are likely to become more frozen , not more animated . </lie.v.54><lie.v.55>People lie during campaigns. If someone did n't talk about something before they ran for President , they do n't really mean it. I trusted Edwards because he was a neophyte when he made his mistakes , and he did his best to make up for them. Hillary talks a lot , but I have n't seen any real evidence to suggest she 's actually convinced her previous corporatism is wrong . </lie.v.55><lie.v.56>Obama ca n't stop lying now. That 's the thing about lying , you have to keep doing it to cover the previous lie. Tomorrow Obama will say he mis-spoke , or that his comment was inartful. Who cares , I just want him to pay my bills and send me my rainbow flavored unicorn . </lie.v.56><lie.v.57>givememyremote.com 1/21/2009 Would I lie to you ? Would I lie to you , honey ?

The truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help YOU if you find yourself ... </lie.v.57><lie.v.58>Now , this may not always be a lie. This must be said upfront. You may be the best she has ever had , but nine times out of ten , that 's a lie. Women say this to make you feel better about yourselves. And before you go off on a tangent about how there is no need to lie , picture your girlfriend telling you that her previous boyfriend was way better in the sack than you could ever dream to be. Smarts does n't it. Well this is why we lie. It 's only done to spare your feelings and avoid the confrontations that will eventually occur over her not enjoying your sex as much as someone else's. But do n't try to prove her wrong fellas , women stick to their guns on this subject. She will keep with the lie until the end . </lie.v.58><lie.v.59>Considering the zeal with which President Obama has in a very short time remade America , we can conclude that he will not stop until America is completely socialist. But one building block remains : government-controlled healthcare. As Lenin once said , " Medicine is the keystone in the arch of socialism. " To embark upon such an ambitious project that has yet failed at every attempt , President Obama must lie , since it is clear that a sizeable majority opposes his healthcare reform . </lie.v.59><lie.v.60> USAGE The words lay and lie are often used incorrectly. You lay something , as in they are going to lay the carpet , but you lie down on a bed or other flat surface. The past tense and past participle of lay is laid , as in they laid the groundwork or she had laid careful plans; the past tense of lie is lay ( he lay on the floor ) and the past participle is lain ( she had lain on the bed for hours ) . </lie.v.60><lie.v.61>I agree completely Tim. They start out believing thru the world , but we use it as kind of a make believe game as children love this sort of thing and it 's innocent if you do n't lie to them. You know , they watch the Santa Claus shows , look at the books &amp;pictures , hear the songs. When the younger ones ask I say well what do you think ? If they are doubtful , that 's fine , I tell them it 's still OK and fun to play make believe with your little brothers and sisters so you do n't spoil it for them til their ready , if not that 's OK too . </lie.v.61><lie.v.62>Nancy Pelosi caught in another lie. Who can believe that ? And just watch , those ultra left wing residents of San Francisco will again vote for her next year. Which is worse : a lying Speaker of the house or constituents without a clue ? </lie.v.62><lie.v.63>Why is it that so many people are more comfortable self-medicating for conditions that exist only in advertisements , than they are simply taking their doctor 's advice ? It 's because doctors are burdened with the need to actually practice medicine. They wo n't hide bad news from you or make up easy answers to please you. But that 's what people want : The easy answers promised by advertisements and alternative practitioners. They want the fantasy of being in complete personal control of what goes on inside their bodies. A doctor wo n't lie to you and say that a handful of herbal detoxification pills will cure anything that 's wrong with you; but since that 's the solution many people want , there 's always someone willing to sell it . </lie.v.63><lie.v.64>Everybody lies.

Schmidt made a mistake. Whether intentional or not , it doesn ' t change the fact that Wilson has consistently lied about the entire affair or that the Iraqis were actively trying to obtain more uranium. m.croche doesn ' t even bother to mention that the report also details ( unfortunately heavily redacted ) attempts by the Iraqis to obtain uranium from the Replublic of the Congo and from Somalia . </lie.v.65><lie.v.66>Bethlehem ( House of Bread - House of Lahmu ) is is a Palestinian city in the West Bank and a hub of Palestinian cultural and tourism industries. It is first mentioned in the Armana letters fourteen centuries BCE. It lies about 10 km ( 6 mi ) south of Jerusalem , standing at an elevation of about 765 m ( 2 510 ft ) above the sea , thus 30 m ( 100 ft ) higher than Jerusalem. The Bethlehem agglomeration also covers the small towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour , the latter also having biblical significance . </lie.v.66><lie.v.67>But Cloud deems Coulter mostly accurate : " Coulter has a reputation for carelessness with facts , and if you Google the words 'Ann Coulter lies , ' you will drown in results.

I ' m not proud of this , not one bit. I actually repent this one any chance I get , ' cause I actually told a College professor that I was undergoing surgery on my breasts. A doozie , yeah. I never actually said what I had , I was evasive , persuasive , and used a girly thing to make him feel uncomfortable ( God forgive me ) . I did have a breast surgery but about three years earlier , so when the Professor called me on it , I was able to produce my records in a snap , and had a doctor ' s note fabricated as well. I went to great lengths to get an extension in this class , imagine what would of happened if I actually applied myself ? Again , God forgive me . </lie.v.69><lie.v.70>- The whole of South Africa was shaken right after Thabo Mbeki was installed as president , when the entire press of the country condemned his silence with regards to the " lie scandal " . The prime minister of the Mpumalanga province , Ndaweni Mahlangu , had re-appointed a man as finance minister in spite of his admittance to the press that this man had lied publicly. Political lies , said Mahlangu , are " not really serious , they are accepted worldwide and quite common " . After all , he argued , a lie had not been the end of Bill Clinton. Mahlangu followed the argument of an American schoolboy who , when caught lying , defended himself , " when the president is allowed to lie what is the fuss about my lie ? " </lie.v.70><lie.v.71>Daniel Finkelstein 's grandfather was clearly an admirable man ( no , there is no 'but ' coming ) . I agree with him in a way , perhaps the most salient way; but ( there 's the but ) I do n't agree in another. ( At least , I do n't agree with one way that Finkelstein phrases the matter , which could be his own rather than his grandfather's. ) I do n't agree that the facts will win 'in the end ' - because I do n't think there is any end ( and probably neither do most people , if they pause to think about it ) . There is only now. There is a series of 'ends ' which keep coming in , like waves hitting the shore; they are never final , permanent , secure. The facts can win at any given moment , but they are never beyond being altered , distorted , hidden , burned up , lied about. There never comes a point at which we can all heave a sigh of relief because the truth or the facts have been established for all time and no one will ever again dispute them or tell whoppers about them. That just does n't happen and ca n't happen - humans being what they are , it is n't possible . </lie.v.71><lie.v.72>If you are afraid it is a good sign , for the gods are helping show you the right way to think.

From the talk of youths who come into my office , I 've decided that they do n't have sense enough to take care of themselves let alone protect the girl. They 're not bothered by false modesty , but a lot of them think it 's smart to fool the girls , either by lying to them or using some cheap trick to make their precautions useless. The older men have more sense , but some of them are selfish and not much concerned with protecting a girl , or they find it hard to believe that a young woman can be ignorant of matters so vital to her . </lie.v.74><lie.v.75>Horton 's slander is blatant in his discussion of the atonement.

The Bush administration recently announced a plan to distribute misinformation to foreign media through the Pentagon 's proposed Office of Strategic Influence. In February the administration quickly retreated; the propaganda office was aborted when its intentions were publicized and its potential effectiveness destroyed. Still , the president claimed to be acting on principle , not pragmatism. He professed firm disapproval of the lying initiative , saying , " We 'll tell the American people the truth , " shortly before his solicitor general defended the administration 's right to tell American people lies . </lie.v.76><lie.v.77>Another good breastfeeding position for lying down.

Our next guest is Dr. Paul Ekman , Professor of Psychology at University of California , San Francisco. Dr. Ekman has been studying emotion and facial expression for more than 30 years , and has led important original research into lying , and the observation of emotions that people lying attempt to hide. These emotions flash out in expressions that will cross over someone 's face in a bare fraction of a second , which Dr. , Ekman calls " micro-expressions. " Another clue is verbal. Liars will often de-personalize someone they are lying about , avoiding using their name ( former President Clinton 's reference to Monica Lewinsky as " that woman , " for instance ) . </lie.v.78><lie.v.79>Massages can also help.

( As his first presidential campaign was getting under way in 1884 , Cleveland , a bachelor , was accused of having fathered an illegitimate child. His advisers told him to " lie like a gentleman " and deny the charge. Instead , Cleveland courageously admitted the child was his , even though the paternity was in doubt : The child 's father may well have been Cleveland 's former law partner. ) Over the July 4th holiday in 1893 , amidst a financial panic , Cleveland underwent a secret operation to cut out a small cancerous formation about the size of a quarter that had appeared on the roof of his mouth. To prevent news from leaking out about the operation , the procedure was performed on a yacht steaming up the East River in New York City. Only one government official was told that the president was going under the knife , the secretary of war , who was present during the operation in case Cleveland died , which was altogether likely given that he was vastly overweight and at grave risk of a heart attack or stroke . </lie.v.83><lie.v.84>The National Enquirer says that Oprah may have tried to make Frey feel better about lying to the public by admitting that she had lied too.

The real danger throughout history lies in overemphasizing these differences to justify and legitimize discrimination against women. An evident example is Motahhari 's endorsement of the conclusions from the differences between the sexes : " All women are fond of being supervised ... Men 's spiritual superiority over women was designed by Mother Nature. No matter how much a woman wants to fight this reality , her efforts will prove futile. Women must accept the reality that because of their greater sensitivity , they need men to control their lives. " 6 </lie.v.94><lie.v.95>But how often do people lie , and when do they do it ? To find out , DePaulo and colleagues asked 77 college students and 70 community members to keep a diary detailing each lie they told.

Pyrole is the principal planet in their system and is about the size of Venus. Like Venus , it has a continuous layer of cloud hiding the surface features. There are 12 major cities with Grenova , meaning 'Island " as the capital. This is aptly named as it is surrounded by impenetrable marshlands. To the north and west as one flies over the region , one sees what appears to be grass-lands , but these are really swamps covered with green algae. To the south are giant trees , towering to 112 meters , with a tangled mass of evergreen swamp underneath. This marshy jungle ends abouth 1O kms further south in " a range of mountains , with two active volcanoes. To the east , there is very little marsh and jungle. Here lie the rich mineral deposits of Pyrole , in a low-lying plateau skirted by hills. Due to the marshy conditions on Pyrole there are very few road networks.

Patrick </lie.v.137><lie.v.138>When asked about his service , Bush has lied , changed his story repeatedly , and weaseled in a manner eerily reminiscent of Bill Clinton. First of all , he has flat-out lied. In his official autobiography , ''A Charge to Keep , '' Bush said he flew with his unit for ''several years'' after finishing flight training in June 1970. His campaign biography states that he flew with the unit until he won release from the service in September 1973 , nine months early , for graduate school. Both statements are lies. Bush only flew with the 111th for one year and 10 months , until April 1972 when he was suspended for failing to take his medical exam ( and drug test ) , and never flew again . </lie.v.138><lie.v.139>Severe bouts of cough or vomiting leading to soreness of the abdominal muscles may also present as abdominal pain.

I think that is because I have this idealism that my friends love me no matter what or who I am , a stranger hmmm ya I would lie to them. I have to say in my first marriage at a very young age I lied , mainly for survival , but after I married my husband Bryan it took years for me to learn I didnt have to lie about anything , anytime. So Yes , I can admit I have lied. I write it in my characters.

The lies that Bush and others told to con us into invading Iraq have resulted in thousands of deaths and probably permanent damage to the country ' s international reputation.

Does she go public , which she is not allowed to do , or does she remain silent and protect two war criminals ? Speaker Pelosi did not give the orders to waterboard ( a war crime ) . It is not what what was said to her or any other menber of Congress , it is what was done by the two war criminals , who ordered waterboarding to be carried out.

And , the Administration has stated that they are not opposed to the development of a civilian nuclear program in Iran. However , this language about " present course " is pretty tough to explain away. And even if Cheney is not directly telling a lie , he is pretty clearly ignoring evidence put together by the nation 's intelligence agencies that Iran has stopped its nuclear program.

The feature of the liar is clearly visible in the face , and everyone who has the eyes to see can see it.

In a woman who has not been pregnant , the almond-shaped ovary lies in a vertical position against a depression , the ovarian fossa , on the side wall of the lesser pelvis. This relationship is altered during and after pregnancy. Each ovary is somewhat over 2.5 centimetres ( one inch ) in length , 1.25 centimetres ( 0.5 inch ) across and slightly less in thickness , but the size varies much with age and with the state of activity . </lie.v.172><lie.v.173>Mike wants less truth , why ?

This will prevent inadequate blood flow and inadequate oxygen to her baby. If the blood flow is indeed compromised , the mother would feel dizzy and very uncomfortable and should shift her weight naturally. If the pregnancy is high risk and hypertensive , has maternal kidney malfunction , severe water retention or with suspected fetal compromise , resting on the left side is often recommended. During a healthy normal pregnancy a woman usually may assume any position which she finds comfortable throughout her pregnancy . </lie.v.178><lie.v.179>The PKU blood test itself is not dangerous , except that it does require insertion of a needle that will open a pathway for the bacteria that abound in every hospital nursery. The problem lies with the test results , which are notoriously inaccurate and result in many false positive findings. If your child is diagnosed as a victim of PKU , he will be placed on a restricted diet composed of protein substitutes that have an offensive taste , tend to cause obesity , and become terribly monotonous. There is disagreement among doctors on how long the diet should be continued. The range is from three years to life. Most doctors who diagnose PKU will not permit the mother to breastfeed . </lie.v.179><lie.v.180>But two wrongs do n't make a right , and the right response to Presidential lies is not more lies from his political opponents. Moreover , regarding the issues presented in Fahrenheit 9/11 , the evidence of Bush lies is extremely thin. Moore shows Bush claiming that a particular day at the ranch in Crawford , Texas , was a working vacation , but Bush appears to be dissembling. Later , after Osama bin Laden was driven into hiding but was not captured , Bush unconvincingly claims not to spend much time thinking about bin Laden. Within Fahrenheit 9/11 , most of the rest of alleged Bush administration lies actually involve Moore 's fabrications to create the appearance of a lie -- such as when Moore chops a Condoleezza Rice quote to make her say something when she actually said the opposite . </lie.v.180><lie.v.181>Oprahs response ?

A girl I dated lied to me several times , but always had some type of excuse or reason when she got caught. She would lie to me about where she was , who she was with , and even giving out her phone number to guys , getting caught by me , then acting like it was a work thing. A 2am text is not a work thing. So a year later she calls me up trying to convince me she has grown up. I caught her again in a white lie , nothing major , but just came to the realization that my sanity is much more important than this relationship. As much as I wanted it to work , and am still not over it , I can not be with someone who you just do n't know when they are telling you the truth and when they are not. Lying is one of the top relationship wreckers and it does n't matter why they are lying.

The position of the baby 's spine in relation to its mother 's is called the fetal lie. The vast majority of babies lie in the same direction as the mother 's spine. This is called a cephalic lie. However , a baby 's spine can sometimes lie at an angle to the mother's. When the baby is off on a slight angle it is called an oblique lie. This is fairly rare , occurring in only 1 out of every 300 births. When your baby lies at a right angle to your spine , creating a T-shape , it is called a transverse lie.

New research out of Stephen Porter ' s Forensic Psychology Lab at Dalhousie University determines the face will betray the deceiver ' s true emotion , but not in the stereotypical ways we think. It ' s not the shifty eyes or sweaty brow or an elongated nose ( la Pinocchio ) the lie detector should look for. Instead , other elements of a liar ' s face will give them away  cracking briefly and allowing displays of true emotion to leak on to the face. In fact , when Porter and his team analyzed White ' s plea frame by frame , they found hints of anger and disgust in his face , not noticed by most of the supportive public . </lie.v.198><lie.v.199>The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms , the circumstances , the intentions of the one who lies , and the harm suffered by its victims.

An attorney 's job is to represent their client. The problem is during cross examinations in particular they tend to ask certain questions hoping to confuse or tick off the person on the stand.

That is , there is more to lying than being untruthful. According to this condition , writing fiction , telling tall tales , cracking jokes , making ironic statements , using literally false metaphorical language , playacting , playing devil 's advocate , and so forth , without the intention that the addressee believe these untruthful statements to be true , is not lying : this is somewhat similar to the requirement in law that , to be convicted of fraud , a person must be shown to have intended to defraud his victim ( Morris 1976 , 391 ) . According to this condition , lying necessarily involves an intention to communicate with another person by means of a statement.

This straightens her sacrum relative to the lumbar spine and rotates the symphysis pubis towards the patient ' s head , thereby reducing the angle of inclination of the pelvic inlet when compared with the lithotomy position. It has no effect on the dimensions of the pelvis but the rotation of the symphysis pubis encourages the anterior shoulder to disimpact and pass under it. Maximum benefit comes if two assistants are used , one holding each maternal leg to produce hyperflexion of the hips , ( Gonik et al , 1989 ) . </lie.v.207><lie.v.208>There is no thing as a small lie , you either lie or you don ' t.

The biggest problem with all this is that it is fabricated. Sinbad recalls no such thing and there is video footage of Chelsea and the queen walking across the tarmac smiling and waving. Hillary lied to people about the experience and her campaign is now saying that she misspoke. Some advisers are saying that it is hard to remember all the details when there have been so many trips and it was so long ago. Bull crap ! If you are shot at you will never forget it.

Compulsive lying has often been indicated in the early stages of children suffering from social behaviour disorders , primarily that of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and Conduct Disorder. The current space does not permit a detailed discussion of such disorders. Suffice it to say that in such cases , compulsive lying usually accompanies other problem behaviours such as stealing , cheating , aggression , violent temper tantrums , skipping school , constantly losing items , and poor behaviour in groups , social settings or with authority figures. Problems such as impulsivity , an apparent inability to link consequences with behaviour , inattentiveness and discomfort with social situations may be at the heart of lying . </lie.v.224><lie.v.225> The Messenger of Allah ( peace and blessings of Allah be upon him ) said : ' Truthfulness is righteousness , and righteousness leads to Paradise.

A person will keep on telling lies until he is written as a liar.

The prosecution told the jury that the shoes in question were supplied strictly for prison use within the state and unavailable for retail sale. We now know that is not true. We know this because the former Warden of Chino Prison told the Sheriff 's department that this was a false theory , that the shoes could in fact be purchased at a retail store. Rather than reveal this very important information to Cooper 's trial attorney , both the District Attorney and the Sheriff 's Department withheld this information from Cooper. Why ? If that Warden had taken the witness stand and testified that those shoes were not solely prison-issued , then the state 's theory would have been exposed as a lie . </lie.v.226><lie.v.227>She lied about a major corruption foe ( she accepted campaign contributions in the same fundraising scheme at the center of a public corruption scandal that led to the indictment of Sen.

She lied about her initial support for the Bridge to Nowhere ( only reversing her opinion when it became politicially beneficial to do so ) . She does not support alternate energy sources. She is anti-environmental. She even lied about winning Miss Congeniality ! </lie.v.227><lie.v.228>Many pressures can cause a child to lie. Most frequently , when a youngster has been brought up in a loving and responsible home , she will first lie when she is confronted with having done something wrong and feels afraid of disappointing her parents or being punished by them. Already feeling guilty , she will try to protect herself from what she thinks will be harsh discipline . </lie.v.228><lie.v.229>First , Eckman 's understanding of the justification for honesty as a virtue is entirely limited to the argument that dishonesty destroys trust in relationships. No other reasons for honesty are given explicit attention. However , since so many lies go undetected , this argument from trust is one of the weakest arguments for honesty available. Additionally , trust works in strange and muted ways in family relationships , because the option of scaling back or terminating a relationship is simply not available as in adult relationships. Members of a family are , for the most part , stuck with each other for better or worse for many , many years. If a child betrays a parent 's trust , that parent can not trade in their child for a new and better one. But the ( limited ) power of the appeal to trust comes from exactly this possibility : that our relationships might be severely hampered or even destroyed by the discovery of a lie. As a result , where children are concerned , the argument from trust really boils down to the fact that kids avoid lying for fear of being caught and punished. This sad fact certainly highlights the need for a more complete view of why honesty is a virtue . </lie.v.229><lie.v.230>So here we see Cain committing both Murder and lying about it.

If you think the NYT lied in order to make Kerry look better and the president worse then follow your logic. The NYT lied about Nancy Pelosi on Monday saying She favors alternative sentencing over prison construction , schools without prayer and death with taxes. That is a lie to make the democrats look worse and the republicans look better. The NYT and tons of other news organizations , as I listed in a comment above , lied about Rush Limbaugh stating that he had apologized about what he said concerning MJFox when he had not. That was a lie designed to make the democrats look worse and the republicans look better . </lie.v.276><lie.v.277>This was the most amazing experience of my life. Niko is an amazingly strong , powerful , visionary woman. Having Caleb at home was her vision. She wanted us to be relaxed and to get to labor and give birth in a natural and free flowing way. She wanted Caleb to be born into a relaxed , warm , soothing and inviting environment. And , as usual , what she created was absolutely amazing. Going through labor and Caleb ' s birth was the most intimate experience for us. Knowing that she wanted me near; that she needed to grab hold of me to help her get through her contractions was incredibly gratifying. Getting to pull Caleb out of her and then lie with her on our bed while he took his first breaths was otherworldly . </lie.v.277><lie.v.278>After a given period of time , the radionuclide will be injected into a vein in the arm or hand.

So do I. The Word does n't have flaws. It does n't matter now who was in the pulpit , the result God was after is this : that we would hear the word to believe His Word.

What is more ! no one wants to hang around people who say naked ( read nasty ) truth about them. First of all most people believe in themselves and therefore constantly lying to themselves about their abilities hence any comment incosistent with their belief is outrightly unwelcome unless it is uplifting. Neccessarily people do n't comment postively of people they hate and thus love is the culprit to lying.

Is there a place in social production occupied exclusively by women ? When I posed this question rhetorically in a lecture on the sociology of gender , one zealous woman student immediately suggested : kindergartens . If this is serious , women have an exclusive role in the process of reproduction , since women produce human beings physically , and in this lies their particular role in the social division of labour. In human society , I repeat , this is not a question of biology but of the social system and of social relations; that is , it is a social question. Women ' s natural destiny is an almost unquestioned tenet of ideology , beneath which numerous forms of discrimination lie concealed . </lie.v.283><lie.v.284>Updated 1.06.10 , 12 : 02p To define a sample of the universal meaning of " lying wonders " which are to MARK people who have lied to God and about Him and the Word. Because it is easy to prove that the " proof texts " are out of context and ignore that the national Jewish system had been abandoned to Sabazianism or STAR worship , I have decided to not be " infiltrated and diverted " and look at music as the MARK of people who have told God in Christ to shut His mouth. The Levites ( an old cult from Egypt cursed by their father ) made sacrificial noise to " make the lambs dumb before the slaughter. " In all sacrificial systems the instrument players were called PARASITES and religious music has always been known as sacred violence. The CROSS has the meaning of cooling down the blood and flesh lust of tribalists still ritually murdering their gods , then kings , then scapegoats and finally animals. Christ in the prophets says that it was NOT commanded when God rescued Israel by pure grace and they rose up in musical idolatry of the Egyptian trinity under the golden Calves . </lie.v.284><lie.v.285>As children enter the school age years ( 6-8 and up ) , they begin to fully understand the concept that lying is wrong.

Some clinical practitioners believe that virtually everyone can be hypnotized , if only the hypnotist takes the right approach. However , there is little evidence favoring this point of view. Similarly , some researchers believe that developing positive attitudes , motivations , and expectancies concerning hypnosis can enhance hypnotizability. However , there is also evidence that such interventions may only affect behavioral compliance with suggestions , not the subjective experiences that lie at the core of hypnosis. As with any other skilled performance , hypnosis is probably a matter of both aptitude and attitude : negative attitudes , motivations , and expectancies can interfere with performance , but positive ones are not by themselves sufficient to create hypnotic virtuosity . </lie.v.292><lie.v.293>Here ' s a tip for Bush Administration cronies : if you are going to lie under oath , on the record , with a video camera in your face , don ' t lie about something for which there is documentary evidence directly contradicting your statements.

At one point of near hopelessness concerning his inability to improve the deteriorating condition of his people , Shoefoot increased his drug intake in order to go deeper into the spirit world to find more trustworthy and benevolent spirits. That led to even more wicked spirits ( Lk 11 : 26 ) , greater frustration , and intense despair. However , during his dark spiritual journey , he was made aware of a powerful Spirit , who , he was told , was the enemy of his spirits and his people. Ironically , the location where this Spirit , Yai Pada , dwelled was a beautiful place of abundance and peace , the very blessings Shoefoot desired for his tribe and for himself.

Larry Lindsey reportedly lost his job as chairman of the National Economic Council for blabbing to the Wall Street Journal that the war would cost between $ 100 billion and $ 200 billion.

For example; Why would my child lie about taking that toy from his brother , when it is so obvious that he did do just that ? Then , deepening the mystery , parents often ask , Why would he make up such a far-fetched story to cover up his actions ? The lie and cover up seem so illogical and unnecessary. Thus , parents sometimes tend to treat the problem as one of logic and intelligence; they puzzle over why their children would lie. Scripture solves the mystery. Children are born liars. When we sin , we lose the ability to be logical. We are blinded by self-interest ( Proverbs 4 : 19 ) . </lie.v.340><lie.v.341>Approval of the techniques is not in question by conservatives. It 's the hypocritical actions of people like Pelosi ( and others , to be fair ) who to the public condemn it and scream that they knew nothing only to be found to have lied about their foreknowledge. The outrage is not about whether or not they oppose strong interrogation techniques. The outrage is about dishonesty.

The song is a driving R &amp;B number beneath the gospel -- it provided the melody for Ray Charles 's " Leave My Woman Alone " -- but when you 're talking about something as serious as lying , it 's better to end on a comic note. I once dated a woman who insisted that the funniest lyric in pop music came in Nine Inch Nails ' " Terrible Lie , " when Trent Reznor , after lamenting the meaninglessness of existence , raged to the Lord above , " Hey God , I think you owe me a great big apology.

Surely health care and wages that allow parents to clothe , feed , and educate their children are pro-life issues. Making abortons illegal will not stop abortions.

The great human being is a finale; the great age the Renaissance , for example is a finale. The genius , in work and deed , is necessarily a squanderer : that he squanders himself , that is his greatness ! The instinct of self-preservation is suspended , as it were : the overpowering pressure of outflowing forces forbids him any such care or caution. People call this " self-sacrifice " and praise his " heroism , " his indifference to his own well-being , his devotion to an idea , a great cause , a fatherland : without exception , misunderstandings. He flows out , he overflows , he uses himself up , he does not spare himself and this is a calamitous involuntary fatality , no less than a river 's flooding the land.

In order to keep the prerequisites to a minimum , the author restricts attention to matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. This approach keeps the discussion concrete , allows the reader to get to the heart of the subject quickly , and covers all of the most interesting examples. The book also introduces the often-intimidating machinery of roots and the Weyl group in a gradual way , using examples and representation theory as motivation. The text is divided into two parts. The first covers Lie groups and Lie algebras and the relationship between them , along with basic representation theory. The second part covers the theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras , beginning with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU ( 3 ) . The author illustrates the general theory with numerous images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank three , including images of root systems , lattices of dominant integral weights , and weight diagrams. This book is sure to become a standard textbook for graduate students in mathematics and physics with little or no prior exposure to Lie theory.

Further , I will use Jungian theory to explicate the way gender construction grants priority to masculinity as that which is figure , and , thus , necessitates that the feminine stand as implicit ground. Social construction is , itself , a necessity of social beings and , as such , is not in itself a fault. Rather , the evil lies in reifying and , consequently , essentializing those constructions by assuming their veracity without question. The many different ways to look at truth have inspired me to speak from my own perspective and to honor my own constructions with the understanding that , in so doing , I am merely telling a different story. My hope is that this paper inspires others , regardless of their own predispositions , education , political leanings , etc. to tell their own stories from their own perspectives , and to be willing to change those stories as their lives unfold . </lie.v.373><lie.v.374>Yeah , I know; it ' s not OK to lie.

It 's simply a piece of information people do n't know what to do with. ( My sense is that people right now are simply taking it as evidence that she is a politician. ) The Obama ad that went up yesterday about lying has a chance of changing it into evidence that the maverick image is a con job , that both McCain and Palin are in fact normal political hacks.

I 'm going to put you in a position where you 're going to have to research everything I say , or else just give up on your civic duty.

With an average difference in under-five mortality rates of around 50 points between the two regions , of which perhaps one half can be assumed to be associated with malnutrition , the maximum effect of higher mortality on rates of child malnutrition could be only about 7 percentage points . </lie.v.411><lie.v.412>Sometimes the placenta lies very low in the uterus , close to or covering the cervix.

Most commentators believe forbids all lying , which is why so many adults treat their children like major criminals when they do n't tell the truth. However , it would have been very simple for the Bible to say , " Thou shalt not lie. " But the Bible did n't do that because lying is not always the wrong thing to do. Sometimes a " white lie " like , " No , you look fine in that dress , " or " Hey , it happens to the best of us ! " is the proper thing to say. And sometimes it is definitely immoral to tell the truth. For instance , a hate-filled person asks you the location of a person he is seeking to kill. Telling him the truth would make you an accomplice to murder . </lie.v.415><lie.v.416>What Hillary did was rub salt in the wounds of her family for her own political gain.

Propensity to lie varies greatly between children , some doing so habitually and others being habitually honest. Habits in this regard are likely to change in early adulthood . </lie.v.419><lie.v.420>God 's attitude toward this sin is strongly marked throughout both the Old Testament and New Testament. The righteous are called upon to hate lying ( Proverbs 13 : 5 ) , to avoid it ( Zechariah 3 : 13 ) , to respect not those who lie , and utterly reject their company ( Psalm 40 : 4; Psalm 101 : 7 ) , to pray to be delivered from it ( Psalm 119 : 29 ) . The wicked are said to love lying ( Psalm 52 : 3 ) , to delight in it ( Psalm 62 : 4 ) , to seek after it ( Psalm 4 : 2 ) , and to give heed to it ( Proverbs 17 : 4 ) . Lying leads to worse crimes ( Hosea 4 : 1 , 2 ) . </lie.v.420><lie.v.421>" Go on , fight me , " he laughed. " Better than having you lie there like a dead woman , as you usually do. " </lie.v.421><lie.v.422>A man who has obtained a leadership position through a lie faces an interesting challenge. If he can not convince the people around him that there was no lie , then he must try to persuade them that it was the last one; in other words , that lies can be contained. Since his entire authority , the position itself , was obtained by that lie , it will be a very difficult task. It is on a moral plane with : " We had to commit one murder to achieve our goals , but there will never be another.

Because the message lies in the frame of an unrelated story , the message typically will bypass the client 's conscious mind and go right into the unconscious mind. We therefore use therapeutic metaphor and design to have a similar structure to the client 's experience. Because of the similarity , their unconscious mind will interpret the metaphor in relation to their own needs. The client will take what he hears and represent it in terms of his or her own experience . </lie.v.425><lie.v.426>I wish Oreilly , Hannity or Beck would answer this question for me by e-mail ? I do n't think enhanced interrogation or torture itself should be taken off the table if the situation calls for it. It is obnvious that Pelosi lied and should be investigated.

While being held on the charge of disturbing the peace , Oswald asked to speak to an FBI agent , who turned out to be Quigley. Oswald told Agent Quigley about some very basic personal information which the Bureau knew to be false. ( 22 ) For example , Oswald lied about Marina 's maiden name , claiming it was " Prossa " and claimed to have been married to her in Fort Worth , TX. When these comments are taken in combination with Oswald 's reticence on the topic of the F.P.C.C. and its specific details in talking with Quigley , the interview essentially boiled down to Oswald requesting permission to talk to the FBI purely so he could lie to them . </lie.v.427><lie.v.428>In May 2005 we launched AfterDowningStreet.org to publicize the Downing Street Minutes. By June we 'd had great , if fleeting , success. During the following months and years , mountains of new memos and statements emerged on the Iraq War lies , many of them more damaging than the Downing Street documents. But increasingly nobody cared , because evidence of crimes was less interesting once Congress had dropped the pretense that it might take action. The single most powerful , and yet largely ignored , document yet to emerge , might , now in 2009 , finally , produce results. And , of course , it is our friends over in England who are , as always , two steps ahead of us . </lie.v.428><lie.v.429>This review is from : Little White Lies , Deep Dark Secrets : The Truth About Why Women Lie ( Hardcover ) I picked up this book after I saw Ms. Barash on the Today show. I found it insightful and through provoking. It was comforting to know that other women felt societies pressure to be " perfect " , and lying is a way that most women achieve that. It 's a must read for all women ! ! It illuminates how we act/survive in this over-sexed and ageist culture . </lie.v.429><lie.v.430>My boyfriend and I had this problem , but compounded with a couple BIG lies that he was telling because he did n't think the truth was important , even though he knew I thought it was important. We fought about the big stuff and resolved those problems , but he 'd still tell white-lies . </lie.v.430><lie.v.431>Nevertheless , lying and violence in themselves warrant condemnation ? Of course , even as does the class society which generates them. A society without social contradictions will naturally be a society without lies and violence. However there is no way of building a bridge to that society save by revolutionary , that is , violent means. The revolution itself is a product of class society and of necessity bears its traits. From the point of view of eternal truths ' revolution is of course anti-moral . But this merely means that idealist morality is counter-revolutionary , that is , in the service of the exploiters . </lie.v.431><lie.v.432>Immanuel Kant took the view that lying is categorically wrong. What makes it wrong , he said , is that it treats other people -- the ones to whom the lies are told -- as a means to an end rather than as an end in themselves. In other words , when we lie to people , we use them , and no one has the right to use another person . </lie.v.432><lie.v.433>A survey conducted by recruitment site Monster.co.uk , questioning 3 , 800 people , revealed that four in 10 respondents lie about their reasons for leaving a job , 18 lie about their current salary and 10 about their qualifications . </lie.v.433><lie.v.434>Fabrikant says that men tend to look you in the eye and lie straight to your face; women will look away or down.

Of course we 've been labelled as " dirty rotten hippies " and our foreign policy/security views have been scorned as a result in the big right wing universe - but it really does boil down to whether one has to buy into blatant lies in order to support our leadership and spend our money and send our boys and girls off to die . </lie.v.436><lie.v.437>When it comes to men lying , the survey respondents had their own notions about what was acceptable. The majority said it 's OK for a man to lie to her about how she looks. ( I suppose that 's assuming it 's a complimentary lie. ) Nearly half said it 's fine for him to lie about his attraction to other women , and 40 percent said ditto for her performance in bed. What should n't a man lie about ? His feelings , particularly about love , said nearly all of the respondents. In fact , that lie was identified as the very worst lie a man could tell. One respondent elaborated that the I-love-you-completely lie hurts like hell when you find out " he has another family in another state and has been living two lives. " </lie.v.437><lie.v.438>So Hillary relied on a story given to her by a police officer and repeated the story to illustrated an already documented fact.

What they should remember is this. If they lie to the whole world , as Mr. Bush does , it ' s not a crime. If they lie to a Congressional committee , it is a crime. Instead of worrying about whether members of his administration will testify under oath , Mr. Bush should consider suggesting they tell the truth. Were they to do that there would be no possibility of criminal charges being filed since truth telling is not a criminal offense. In this administration , however , truth telling would come as a surprise , if not a shock . </lie.v.446><lie.v.447>Secondly , it is interesting that this study claims that Bush lied about links with al-Qaida.

When the rest of the philosophic crowd rejected the testimony of the senses because it showed multiplicity and change , he rejected their testimony because it represented things as if they had permanence and unity. Heraclitus too did the senses an injustice. They lie neither in the way the Eleatics believed , nor as he believed they do not lie at all. What we make of their testimony , that alone introduces lies; for example , the lie of unity , the lie of thinghood , of substance , of permanence. " Reason " is the reason we falsify the testimony of the senses. Insofar as the senses show becoming , passing away , and change , they do not lie. But Heraclitus will remain eternally right with his assertion that being is an empty fiction. The " apparent " world is the only one : the " true " world is merely added by a lie . </lie.v.449><lie.v.450>By the way , P : getting punked as you were by the investor may be uncomfortable , but it 's likely to still be profitable , possibly MORE profitable. Brittney Spears ' fake image of having-it-together has collapsed , to be replaced with the brutal reality of her disfunction , but it 's keeping her in the spotlight and her record sales are strong as a consequence. Her brand is adapting to the market , as every good brand must. One strategy you have is to lie about your reality as a parent like Angelina. But another strategy is to not lie like Britney. Both are profitable. Try to move past your pain and see the profit possibilities in all this . </lie.v.450><lie.v.451>Equally important in adding depth to the characterizations are allusions , such as the references to Aphrodite and Anchises ( p. 8 ) , and the lines Virtue , sought by man with travail and toil and The Moon ' s gone down , but / Alone I lie , quoted from Greek lyric poems by Simonides and Sappho , respectively.12 An author expects a reader to recognize such explicit allusions and to draw relevant parts of their original contexts into the story : thus the comparisons of Psyche to Helen ( p. 23 ) are disturbing because Helen was not only beautiful but also a source of discord , the cause of the famous Trojan War ( which is alluded to on page 33 ) . But allusions are often less explicit; there may be no more than a key phrase to indicate that the author is pointing toward an external reference and invoking its associations. One such allusion appears in the second paragraph of Till We Have Faces. Orual writes , </lie.v.451><lie.v.452>Did James lie about her qualifications. Her experience ?

Scot Denhalter ' s presentation focuses on the musings of Princeton moral philosopher Henry G. Frankfurt about a quality of misrepresentation that falls on the continuum between telling the truth and lying ( somewhere just short of a lie ) , which he names bulls*it. Denhalter asks if this type of discourse exists in Mormon culture and , if so , to what extent ? Is there a different type of it in Mormonism than is found elsewhere ? Does the Church employ social mechanisms that increase or decrease the incidence of b.s. in Mormon culture ? Ryan Wimmer explores a religious principle , taqiyah , that Shi ' a Muslims use as a means to protect their faith. Taqiyah means to safeguard or defend as well as to fear ( as in the sense of being pious ) and allows members of the faith to be untruthful when their life or religious faith is in danger. Wimmer argues that a similar principle exists in Mormonism though it ' s unnamed and has yet to achieve a recognized status as an aid to faith. He asks , Should it ?

She disobeyed a direct command of the " king of Jericho.

Rather than relieving him of his duties , the ecclesiastical authorities simply moved him from one parish to another between 1960 and 1967 , actually providing him with a fresh supply of unsuspecting families and innocent children to abuse. After treatment in 1967 for pedophilia , he went back to work , this time in Minnesota. The new diocese was aware of Father Porter ' s obsession with children , but they needed priests and recklessly believed treatment had cured him. More children were abused until he was relieved of his duties a year later. By his own admission , Porter may have abused as many as a hundred children. Ignoring the facts may not in and of itself be a form of lying , but consider thecontext of this situation. If a lie is a false action done with the intent to deceive , then the Catholic Church ' s conscious covering for Porter created irreparable consequences. The church became a co-perpetrator with Porter . </lie.v.546><lie.v.547>The last form of deception to be discussed here is compulsive lying. In most situations , we lie for one reason or another.

While everyone does lie to some extent , most are harmless lies that many times are necessary to preserve social civility. But in extreme cases lies can quickly become like a cancer. Once lying becomes a regular habit it tends to snowball and spread until a person needs to lie continuously just to uphold the factious stories that they have spewed the day the week or month before.

For instance , you may feel comfortable having a one night stand at the time , but if he turns oout to be a real idiot or you have a fight , you start telling yourself lies later - either lying to yourself about how it actually went " It did n't happen that way , he was actually a really nice guy " ( so you do n't think you picked a jerk ) or you say " I picked him and just used him for sex and dumped him " when in fact he hurt you , in order to make you feel like you were in the controller , not the one being controlled . </lie.v.563><lie.v.564>Um , let 's try to get this straight.

The worst lie is perjury. Calumniation is also wrong because it deprives its victim of dignity and honor. The gods may deceive. Indeed , all superiors have a certain freedom to lie , and social or political lies are acceptable. So is deceit in art. In tragedy deceit and cunning bring about just punishment. Historians , however , contrast the truth of their accounts with the fictions of poets. They often give assurances of their reliability in their prefaces . </lie.v.613><lie.v.614>Alezan reared up on his hind legs and kicked at the Saracens.

We do this because , when you like someone , you want to impress them so they stick around. It 's also a sad fact that women are guiltier of this than men. Are women more insecure ?

Use a towel to drape over the head to guide the steam onto the face. If you prefer a special aromatherapy steamer , take extra precautions to clean it thoroughly , since bacteria can easily breed in the warm , moist environment. For inhalations , breathe the steam in deeply but comfortably. Continue for ten to thirty minutes and end with a splash of cold water over the face. Lie down and relax for at least fifteen minutes , preferably longer. To heal an upper respiratory infection , it is recommended to use a longer inhalation and lie down for an hour or more to promote sweating and hasten the removal of toxins from the body. To avoid getting chilled , keep warm indoors for at least an hour after an inhalation . </lie.v.616><lie.v.617>Leaving aside the self-serving revisionism of several of the leftist commenters above ( the Democrats ushered in lying us into war in the modern period with WWI , WWII , Korea and Vietnam , so they have as much pedigree as the GOP ) -- there can be no question that this Administration falls into the category of deceptive and delusional. Even in their lying , the Administration 's officials delude themselves about the policy prescriptions they suggest. Indeed , I think Dr. Samuel Johnson provides the formula for decoding the Administration 's statements.

" Yuck , " he says about food that does n't taste good. Adults slowly teach children that this kind of honesty is not always welcome that there is a fine line between telling the truth and not hurting other people. Children also observe active lying by the adults in their lives.

Inguz reminds us of that ancient connection between the Gods and the land , and re-links ( the real meaning of the word 'religion ' ) us with our spiritual natures through the realm of the physical.

It is of course not the child 's fault but I do suspect that social workers are often not telling the whole truth and do have a full history of the child 's past but do not pass it on in case it puts people off adoption. All this dishonesty does is make huge problems. Unsuspecting parents suddenly find out they have adopted monsters who wreck their homes , families and marriages. If you were warned beforehand , at least you would have the option not to continue with the adoption , or be able to make an informed decision as to what lies ahead for you and the child.

The same holds true about Peim n-e D n or D n-no Kalmo. It follows the Islamic profession of faith Shah dah , also known as Kalema-e D n among Indo-Iranian Muslims. In fact , Din-no Kalmo is a mere Gujarati rendering of Kalema-e Din. One may also see a response to 99 names of Allah in the much popularized 101 names of " Hormazd.

There is something similar in the upward , branching gestures of branch and bone. Though discarded and weather-tarnished , each still retains some of its original grace , a fragment of former glory. Neither branch nor bone 's service to the ecosystem ends here. Cast-off antlers provide an important mineral supply for small rodents , mainly voles , who gnaw on the antlers to replenish their stores of calcium. The voles themselves also feed on aspen bark during winter , nibbling at the base of trees from tunnels excavated between the snow and the ground. Vole feeding generally occurs in areas where the vole population is high , especially on grassy south-facing slopes and in riprian areas along streams. During the icy yet sun-drenched days of January and February , the aspen periderm absorbs enough heat to melt a small space in the snow around it , providing voles with room for feeding and movement . </lie.v.684><lie.v.685>I could n't imagine lying to get someone into bed as that would take away half the fun !

Nevertheless , just as with the state , when these authorities overstep their bounds , it may be necessary for a Christian to lie to pursue justice. In those areas of life where God has not delegated authority to a hierarchy over the Christian , the Christian must determine for himself what course of action , truth or lie , will best serve the cause of justice.

To envision what happens when the testes and spermatic cord descend to form a scrotum , imagine pushing your fist against a rubber sheet. In this example , your fist becomes equivalent to the testes and your arm to the spermatic cord. The problem is that you have created a weak space where your arm sits. Where once the rubber sheet was a simple wall , you ' ve now made another space , between your arm and the rubber sheet , where things can slip. This is essentially what happens in many types of inguinal hernias in men. Some of these inguinal hernias are congenital when a piece of the gut travels with the testes as it descends. Another kind of inguinal hernia is acquired. When we contract our abdominal muscles , our guts push against the body wall. A weakness in the body wall means that guts can escape the body cavity and be squeezed to lie next to the spermatic cord . </lie.v.730><lie.v.731>I believe that this demand for difference continues throughout a man 's life and that he is always answering a call toward self-identity and definition in response to the feminine.

Although the demand for difference will continue to call upon him , he can thus answer to it in ways that include and listen to the other and do not make false claims concerning his superiority.

The Eighth Commandment , for example , prohibits bearing " false witness against thy neighbor , " which seems to bar false testimony , defamation , and malicious gossip , perhaps , but not most other kinds of lies. Hypocrisy , Dr. Johnson reminds us , is the tribute that vice pays to virtue.

We tolerate the harm a friend did another because we do not want to give up a friend. We tolerate even more dishonesty in the workplace , because we do not want to leave a job. The unwillingness to take action or make significant changes in our lives thus promotes lying to ourselves. Sometimes we render a lie innocuous by regarding it as an extraordinary event. Someone told a lie to promote a particularly important goal , but now that things have returned to normal he will return to truth and I can count on him . </lie.v.755><lie.v.756> Lying is morally wrong , says Hal Thorsrud , an assistant professor of philosophy at Agnes Scott College. However , he laughs , there are , I believe , cases in which lying is either morally irrelevant - trivial lies you might tell , to save someone ' s feelings - or cases in which it is useful to lie for the sake of a good cause. </lie.v.756><lie.v.757>Do n't buy the Bush spin that the lies about Iraq are only " 16 words " -- the administration lied , deceived or committed outright fraud about every single point they used to justify invading Iraq ( except to say that Saddam was an evil man . ) </lie.v.757><lie.v.758>Pelosi has changed he story a few times and now she is reverting to the political game of claiming to be misled.

Where do people get such silly childish notions about Christmas , but from churches , who keep the tradition for love of money , perhaps the Salvation Army kettles being an example of such. For what do they do with the money donated , but print War Crys , when told Christ is our peace who abolished the law to bring an end to all the law vs law and law vs grace divisions.

Is true knowledge always preferable to false beliefs ? Some would argue that even here it may be acceptable or even desirable to lie but I feel that this line should not be crossed. All people should be encouraged to seek the truth , even if it may destroy cherished beliefs. Furthermore , the reason that something is false is because either the evidence contradicts it , or the arguments in favor of it don ' t make sense , or believing it leads to logical contradictions. Encouraging people to believe in false things is to also encourage them to discount the value of evidence and to abandon their reasoning skills and this can making them easy prey for liars and charlatans and demagogues . </lie.v.774><lie.v.775>Tellng a lie is not something that comes out of Obama 's mouth , I 'm taking the liberty of speaking for him.

The crown of the child 's head is generally directed upward and becomes fixed against the pubic bones of the mother , which lie just in front of the bladder. Around this firm pivot the child 's head rotates upward , and , as a result of the movement , forehead , eyes , nose , mouth , and chin successively emerge from the birth-canal.

He feels dumb for failing the test and bad for lying. Those negative feelings are not likely to motivate better behavior. In contrast , a parent might say , " You must have felt very bad about that grade. " " You were embarrassed. " " You were afraid you would be in trouble. " When a parent accepts the child 's fears , it helps the child solve the problem.

That means that every single piece of paper that purported to prove that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was by default a fraud , a hoax , and a lie. There could be no evidence that supported the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction because Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. In a way , the existence of any faked documents about Iraq 's WMDs is actually an admission of guilt.

Authoritatively debunks numerous wartime hoaxes , including such durable tales as : the bayoneted Belgian babies , the German " corpse factory , " " The Crucified Canadian , " the martyrdom of Nurse Cavell , and the " passenger ship " Lusitania. In the publisher 's foreword , historian Mark Weber points out fascinating parallels with World War II atrocity tales . </lie.v.807><lie.v.808>While many people are resigned to being lied to by politicians , few will defend the premise that a leader should lie to us for our own good. Even liars want the people around them to be truthful , so that they do not lose their own way . </lie.v.808><lie.v.809>The problem for Bush is that he swore under oath , in a July 20th 1999 affidavit , that he " had no conversations with [ SCI ] officials , agents , or represenatives concerning the investigation or any dispute arising from it. " If Rogers is telling the truth , than Bush Jr. lied directly under oath. He filed the affidavit in an attempt to avoid testifying in a whistleblower lawsuit concerning this investigation and it 's alleged squashing by Bush 's administration . </lie.v.809><lie.v.810>Well that 's typical , that 's what people like her do.

I 'd bet it 's the latter , in which case he might not have lied to you at all. He may have taken lunch to work , been invited to lunch by co-workers at the last minute , and changed his mind when the circumstances changed. For that matter , even if he planned to brown-bag it but just failed to find time every morning to pack a lunch , that 's just a change of plans , not a lie. Even " I 'll do the laundry " was n't a lie if he believed it to be true at the time , regardless of whether he should have predicted or avoided being irresponsible later . </lie.v.811><lie.v.812>In the " Alice in Wonderland " White House world in which Mr. Bush lives , a spokesperson said the most recent disclosures did not mean Mr. Gonzales was lying on March 13. Tasia Scolinos , a spokesperson for the Justice Department , said the meeting didn ' t contradict Mr. Gonzales 's news conference statement that he was not involved in any discussion about what was going on. Those skilled at reconciling two contradictory statements to demonstrate why neither is a lie can practice their skills on those statements. Another spokesperson carried the explanation one step further saying Mr. Gonzales didn ' t remember the November 17th meeting. That is understandable since November 17th was a long time ago . </lie.v.812><lie.v.813>2. AHMEDINIJAD MEETING : Joe Biden lied when he said that Barack Obama never said that he would sit down unconditionally with Mahmoud Ahmedinijad of Iran. Barack Obama did say specifically , and Joe Biden attacked him for it . </lie.v.813><lie.v.814>Obama and his administration are socializing liars. They do n't even lie well. They have given more lies and more crap in the first 2 months of their administration than any other administration , including Bush . </lie.v.814><lie.v.815>Far less have been killed in war than by abortion , so your lies hold no water. Funny hw you intolerant , lying , liberals attack Chrisians , but Muslims and Jews believe the same also. You are hateful hypocrites who have no credibility and no standing and every year , fewer and fewer believe in abortion because it is murder. You are living proof for the study that shows liberalism is a mental illness . </lie.v.815><lie.v.816>How is this relevant to health care ? The same tendency for people in fascist societies to commit violence against dissenters and individualists lies at the core of " scientific " methods commonly applied to health care. A medical procedure or treatment protocol is legitimated by a series of scientific experiments that " proves " it has the desired action ( not necessarily from the patient 's but from the medical researcher 's perspective ) . The scientific literature provides the initial authorization , whereupon clinicians ( and , now , insurance companies ) develop standard procedures that transform the new treatment method into a routine procedure. Next , the medical conception of the human body as a bag of chemicals , cells , tissues , and organs dehumanizes the patient in the mind of well-trained and indoctrinated physicians to the point that the patient 's symptoms , feelings , and perceptions are commonly ignored as being irrelevant to the protocol . </lie.v.816><lie.v.817>Some people do n't actually know that they 're lying , or have told a lie for so long that it becomes their subjective interpretation of reality. Lie detectors function on the assumption that there is one , acknowledge-able , objective truth that the lie-teller knows and is distorting or consciously not telling. But reality is always open to subjective interpretation , and lies ( and the people that tell them ) take more effort for some and none for others. Lie detectors might work if you know you 're lying , if it requires effort , if it does n't match with your subjective experience of " reality , " if you even recognize reality . </lie.v.817><lie.v.818>Symbol And Form : Everything in this world is a symbol and form of higher reality. An important reality is portrayed by the early Church Father Origen writes : It is sufficient however , to represent in the style of a historic narrative what is intended to convey a secret meaning in the garb of history , that those who have the capacity may work out for themselves all that relates to the subject. Why are the scriptures composed in the allegory and form that convey to those with eyes to see a concealed meaning ? Because all of life is a symbol and form of higher reality that carnal men are blind to. And with regard to what would otherwise be historical symbols and events that would appear to us as the knowledge of superficial episodes of the past , Origen writes : I believe that every man must hold these things for images , under which the hidden sense lies concealed ( Origen - Huet. , Prigeniana , 167 Franck , p. 142 ) . </lie.v.818><lie.v.819>Its getting easier to catch out this lying excuse for a man. Its easy really , any time you see him open his mouth , then be sure the lies are flying. Bad news when he is having to go for the sympathy votes. ( menos ) </lie.v.819><lie.v.820>A man 's women folk , whatever their outward show of respect for his merit and authority , always regard him secretly as an ass , and with something akin to pity. His most gaudy sayings and doings seldom deceive them; they see the actual man within , and know him for a shallow and pathetic fellow. In this fact , perhaps , lies one of the best proofs of feminine intelligence , or , as the common phase makes it , feminine intuition . </lie.v.820><lie.v.821>Of course Senator Clinton lied. And cows give milk , and pork comes from pigs.

During the segment Brit Hume dropped all pretense of being an impartial journalist and repeated lies in order to defend the administration. ( With video . ) </lie.v.823><lie.v.824>It would be the same effect if you were speaking with someone who always knew when you were lying. Big lies , small lies , little white lies , fibs , none of them would work . </lie.v.824><lie.v.825>When the press/media admits to the bias they show to any particular candidate , party , or country then they will be able to level the charge of lying against the offenders. Do n't we all hate the lies. McCain -Feingold is a travesty but what does it have to do with this subject ? </lie.v.825><lie.v.826>I 'd argue the two are n't mutually exclusive ... whatever one can say about the pre-war bamboozlement , whether they were technically " lies " , " misrepresentations " , or just " bullshit " , they have unequivically lied about the run-up to the war repeatedly. Most obviously when they said " Saddam was n't letting the inspectors do their job " or " we could n't wait any longer " , referring to the period when they were in Iraq and not finding shit. So like most good politicians , Bush and Co. were smart enough to couch their falsehoods in such away that they can now get away with the " we were just dead wrong about EVERYTHING " line , which is pretty much the most charitable interpretation possible . </lie.v.826><lie.v.827>Since the rates of child malnutrition are greater than the incidence of low birth weight , this factor alone can not account for all of the difference in nutritional levels between South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. But the social conditions that lie behind low birth weights continue to affect the nutritional well-being of the small child. The search must therefore now turn to what happens after the child is born . </lie.v.827><lie.v.828>Nevertheless , attempts have been made to offset their seemingly unmistakable import. For example , it is argued that in the same chapter ( i.e. , Leviticus 20 ) , five verses after the injunction against homosexuality , the death penalty was also required for a man and his wife for having sexual relations during her menstruation : If a man lies with a woman during her sickness and uncovers her nakedness , he has exposed her flow , and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from their people ( Leviticus 20 : 18 ) . Thus the homosexual activist ( who wishes to maintain some semblance of affiliation with the Bible ) dismisses this text as ritualistic and limited to Israels peculiar concern for purity , thus having no universal significance. After all , the Israelites lived during an ignorant , primitive period of human history. Consider the following wording of this viewpoint : </lie.v.828><lie.v.829>My mother-in-law watches our daughter twice a week. We 've asked her to tell us when she takes the baby somewhere , but she ignores us -- and now she lies to us ! She says they 've been home all day , and then I hear from relatives that they 've all been out shopping or to lunch. What should I do ? </lie.v.829><lie.v.830>Retiring Rep. Paul McHale was the first Democrat to call for Clinton 's resignation. " When the president spoke last January I believed him , " says McHale , of Pennsylvania. " I did n't think he would have the audacity , the lack of integrity to mislead the American people . . . but then he pervasively lied under oath. He was blatantly , intentionally untruthful. I would not accept as president of the United States a man who has lied under oath. " </lie.v.830><lie.v.831>You may lie to yourself. Be honest with yourself about your stability , both financial and life. Just because you can make a $ 2 , 000 a month payment , does not mean that a $ 1 , 800 payment would be a whole bunch smarter. Escalating loan payments mean you need to have corresponding escalating income. Are you emotionally equipped to own and maintain a house ? </lie.v.831><lie.v.832>Start researching Bush 's broken promises and lies , and soon one is deluged by floods of information. Sorting through all these lists of Bush lies , rants about the Bush " Big Lie , " theoretical analyses of Bush 's lying pattern and " techniques of deceit , " calls for Bush 's impeachment for lying , and much , much more , is not easy. Nor is it particularly uplifting or enjoyable. But it is important to get the facts straight. And ultimately , it 's important because Americans need to know that President Bush is not the " straight shootin ' , plain talkin ' Texan " he claims to be . </lie.v.832><lie.v.833>When one lies face-to-face with the intended recipient. This also may be an expression describing the act of lying with a smile or other patronizing tone or body language . </lie.v.833><lie.v.834>Ezekiel 4 : 9 " Also take for yourself wheat , barley , beans , lentils , millet , and spelt; put them into one vessel , and make bread of them for yourself.

" </lie.v.836><lie.v.837>I had this problem , too , for the same reasons , but I got over it when I left home , and I only really lied to my parents. I did n't even understand why I lied sometimes. It could be some completely mundane question , but I 'd answer dishonestly and immediately think , " Huh ? Why did I say that ? " The reasons were fear and habit. I had a parent who would turn every minute detail into a criminal investigation. I mean , everything. So I got into the habit of tailoring my responses just to avoid the emotional strife. No , it did n't always work , but I think I thought that I would be treated like a criminal or ridiculed no matter what , so I might as well at least try to say something pleasing even if it was ... incorrect . </lie.v.837><lie.v.838>DO N'T BLAME Queen Pelosi for what she says or does not say. We all know she lies , cheats , steals , misrepresents herself and others , etc. She is unworthy of the office she holds . </lie.v.838><lie.v.839>I have done the same thing Sarah did. I lied to my husband for several years about a large amount of debt. When I came clean a few months ago , it was difficult , he was angry , but we have survived. We are working to resolve the debt and also considering counseling to work through the trust / anger / communication issues. It has been a difficult few months , but the end result of confessing has lifted a great burden from my heart. No longer do I have to hide bills , statements , or wonder if the next phone call will be a collection agency calling about a missed payment. Now , I can sit down with my husband and discuss openly how much we bring in , how much we are spending , and where to send the money we make each month. You can not believe how much of a difference that makes ! </lie.v.839><lie.v.840>1Decide if what you are lying about is worth the effort and the potential consequences. It is a personal decision. You need to be realistic with yourself. It is easy to become a compulsive liar and ruin your life. Under what circumstances are you willing to risk damaging relationships , reputation , and future opportunities and do the benefits of telling the lie outweigh the risks ? </lie.v.840><lie.v.841>And again , I 'm sorta befuddled. Counting lies , long nose jokes -- frankly , it sounds like you 're talking about G.W. Bush. ( And yes , maybe there 's a lesson in that for all of us. ) So no , I do n't know where all this anger is coming from. The desperation is a little easier to figure.

It is approximately 2.5 cm in length. It projects into the vault of the vagina. Nearly half of the cervix lies in the vagina. It is called the portiovaginalis. It provides an alkaline secretion , which helps the penetration of sperm for the purpose of fertilization. It acts as a sphincter for the uterus and plays a very important part during pregnancy and child birth. Cancer of the cervix and chronic cervicitis are diseases of the cervix . </lie.v.843><lie.v.844>The rulers of ancient Egypt are now known by the pyramids they built. The present ruler of modern America will be known by the pyramid he is building , but it is not one of stone; it is a pyramid of lies not just lies , but bald-faced lies. They are too numerous to catalog here in any comprehensive fashion , but it is a useful exercise to put some of them on display together to better communicate the character of the president and the Democratic Party that now controls the Congress. We are indeed in crisis when Obama and his Democratic followers practice leadership by lies and deception . </lie.v.844><lie.v.845>We sometimes hear it said that " God is sovereign and supreme and can do anything He wants " . That may sound good , but God is not a man that he should lie , and he can not alter his Word.

They weren ' t 11 years old when Bush plied the world with lies. Neither was I. I remember hearing former U.N. weapons inspector and U.S. Marines intelligence officer Scott Ritter speak at Syracuse University , pleading with his audience to do everything they could to prevent this war , because we were being lied to there was no evidence that the alleged weapons or weapons programs existed. And Ritter wasn ' t just speaking to small audiences on college campuses. National alternative media outlets such as Pacifica Radio and The Nation were reporting on what Ritter and a host of other whistleblowers were saying. These were all well-documented stories that , unlike the assertions of the Bush administration , were based on real evidence and on words that had real meaning and could withstand challenges . </lie.v.850><lie.v.851>Only about 3 of children lie so frequently that it is considered a problem. If lying is so persistent that it is destructive to the life of the liars -- or those to whom they lie -- it is a problem. Of course , children who frequently get into trouble are those who lie the most. In psychological studies , being chronic liars is linked to more serious trouble as the children grow older. A study was done with 466 men in Massachusetts who were labeled as " liars " in grade school. By their early twenties , they were more likely than other boys to have been convicted of felonies . </lie.v.851><lie.v.852>E.g. , Leviticus 20 : 13 ( New Oxford ann. , New Rev.

The strangest thing is that it shows that either some people tell the truth and then claim to have lied or that some people lie and then admit to having done so under the slightest of pressures. It basically doesn ' t even suggest that everyone who lies admits to having done so instantly. Also , I don ' t know what epistemic class the respondents belong to. It isn ' t clear to many people , and is in fact a point of serious philosophical contention , whether the fact that dreamers think themselves awake impairs the ability of waking people to rationally and confidently know that they are awake . </lie.v.854><lie.v.855>Lies , what would we do without ' em ? They drive the books we read , the books we write. Whether our hero lies , or the heroine someone always lies. White lies , lie by omission , deliberate lie , protecting-you lie , the internal lie.

If you prefer this to be done by a female examiner , ask for this when you make your appointment. You will be asked to undress from the waist down and lie on your back on the examination table. You should be given a blanket or sheet to put over yourself but if you are not , just ask for one. The health care provider will ask you to bend your knees and let them fall open. Some women find this position difficult , so if you can not lie this way , say so. The health care provider can do the examination with you lying on your side with your knees drawn up in the fetal position. In fact , many health care providers will do this anyway when looking for prolapse as it is a good way to check the front and back walls of the vagina . </lie.v.885><lie.v.886>The third and most important way of teaching honesty is to be honest yourself.

American colonists believed the lie that people of one race had the right to own , buy and sell people of another race. More recently , hundreds of thousands of people believed Hitler ' s lie that the Jewish race should be eradicated. Most of us can hardly imagine that anyone could have believed these lies.

This is because your diaphragm - the broad , flat muscle that lies under your lungs - is being pushed up out of its normal place by the expanding uterus. The diaphragm rises about 1 1/2 inches ( about 4 centimeters ) from its usual position during pregnancy. This may seem like a small amount , but it 's enough to decrease your lung capacity ( the amount of air your lungs are able to take in ) . At the same time , the hormone progesterone acts on the respiratory center in the brain , causing you to breathe more deeply. As a result , although your total lung capacity is decreased , the volume of air you are taking in with each breath is actually increased during pregnancy . </lie.v.897><lie.v.898>Part of the small intestine that lies just behind the uterus ( in a space called the pouch of Douglas ) may slip down between the rectum and the back wall of the vagina.

The circumstances of Palin 's " secret " pregnancy and Trig 's around-the-world birth are bizarre in the extreme. And before Palin 's nomination turned pre-marital sex and teen pregnancy into virtues , the fundy governor of Alaska had a motive to pass Trig off as her own son. Now we could give Palin the benefit of the doubt here -- indeed , she would deserve it -- if everything else that 's come out of Palin 's mouth was n't a lie. She lied to the American people about the bridge to nowhere , divestment from Sudan , trade missions to Russia.

Indeed , God actually does it himself once in a while. This would seem to throw Scripture into a state of self-contradiction. After all , it is argued , God can not lie.35 In order to defend the idea that some lies are acceptable , it will be necessary to look at some texts that demonstrate that lying is sometimes compatible with the character of God. The following argument will proceed by examining some key passages that demonstrate this compatibility through Gods actions and commands , and through Gods reactions to lies told by biblical heroes.

It was the responsibility of journalists to fact-check the obvious glaring lies of the Bush administration during the run-up to the war. But they didn ' t. Instead they acted like stenographers taking dictation because the truth the allegation that the government would lie us into a war was too dangerous to tell. We went to war because telling the truth instead of lies would be too radical , and no one wants to be seen as a radical.

But it is here also as an initial undermining of the Fox. The Fox , upon finishing the story , hastens to add , Not that this ever really happened. . . . It ' s only lies of poets , lies of poets , child ( p. 8 ) . The Fox , as a Stoic and rationalist , will admit into his world only that which is open to scientific explanation.

They may be good reasons prima facie , but those supposed good reasons are likely to evaporate if the lie is discovered and the fact that it is a lie is broadcast or spread to a larger public.

Lying requires correct or accurate knowledge of the truth on the part of the giver , and it also depends on the intent with which the falsehood is given. In order for a falsehood to be a lie the person giving it needs to know that it is false , and it must be given with intent to deceive. If the person making the statement thinks or believes that it is true , but it is in fact false , then it is not a lie. Since lying requires that the statement given be false , understanding and discussing lying is parasitic on the existence of truth and on that truth being discoverable . </lie.v.920><lie.v.921>The sensations that each partner feels in this position depend to a large extent on the tightness of the woman 's vagina.

But it 's also possible for a woman to keep her legs closer together , and in fact you may find you both prefer the sex if she does so.

When they fall they also bring down the world around them . </lie.v.946><lie.v.947>children learn to lie at an early age , often being carefully taught a reference-writer who does not conform to implicit should the truth be told in such circumstances , or is a. between the truth and a lie about to ensure that whatever you ve told it es m not clever enough to . </lie.v.947><lie.v.948>Animals that are now enemies will dwell together : the wolf and the lamb shall eat together , the lion will eat straw; the cow and the bear will feed their young ones and lie down together. The infant child shall play on the hole of the cobra , and the young child shall put his hand on the viper ' s nest. What a glorious day it will be ! </lie.v.948><lie.v.949>There are also times when we also have to tell lies to protect the innocent. If a child whose mother has died asks where her mummy has gone , the answer is not usually , 'She 's dead ' , but 'She had to go somewhere very far away'. Some people also lie to keep their children from knowing they have been adopted. This is not a case of downright lying , but of a need to protect people who do not yet understand the truth - until one day when that person is old enough to know it . </lie.v.949><lie.v.950>These guidelines are all quite general there may be circumstances that require Christians to act in ways that these guidelines might not predict. Hopefully , they are biblical , submissive to Scripture , designed to further justice and to honor God. Whatever standards and guidelines one adopts , it should be clear that Scripture allows Christians to lie in certain circumstances , and even , dare it be said , requires the occasional lie . </lie.v.950><lie.v.951>This affects the layer of gristle which lies beneath the skin on the palm of the hand , fastening the skin to bone , enabling us to clutch and grip. The disease first makes its appearance as a small lump in the pit of the palm. Over time , this lump may form a cord of tissue that runs from the palm to the finger. After a while , this cord begins to shrink , drawing the finger into a clawed position . </lie.v.951><lie.v.952>From this it appears that the very language itself supports the act of lying. The total number of words related to lying exceeds at least three hundred ! Perhaps the growth of the vocabulary of lying is a result of the human tendency to do so. Since all humans sometimes lie on occasion , rather than tell the truth , the very language itself might accommodate this behavior. Under this view , the terms used to connote lying could actually grow within the language , much like weeds sprout up on a lawn of green grass. A language that grows from lying , then , can enhance the habit s survival , since it becomes all too easy to construct a lie. The degree of difficulty for lying is eased by the rich vocabulary that supports it . </lie.v.952><lie.v.953>However , the national campaign has now come forward and lied about what happened in Pennsylvania. McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers has now told NBC that alleged quotes from the McCain campaign in early reports of the story were actually the product of sloppy reporting and that they were actually quotes from the Pittsburgh police . </lie.v.953><lie.v.954>Finally , inform the class that over the past several decades , lying has kept pace with technology. Explain that , these days , people do not just lie in person , but they lie over the phone , through text messages , by e-mail , bulletin boards , blogs , websites , and in Internet chat rooms. To demonstrate how difficult it is to detect lies communicated electronically , you might want to create an example or two of e-mail lies and share them digitally or on an overhead projector . </lie.v.954><lie.v.955>Tags : brendan hines , dr. paul ekman , Dr.PaulEkman , fox lie to me , human lie detectors , HumanLieDetectors , kelli williams , lie to me , LieToMe , monica raymund , MonicaRaymund , paul eckman , paul ekman , samuel baum , tim roth </lie.v.955><lie.v.956>Duh of course its filled with lies ... That is what the republicans do best.. I hear tons of lies which they just keep repeating and hoping it will be true. After the George Bush lies and lies from Palin and McCain during and after the convention , it is clear that they are indded more of the same we have not which is horrible. I am voting for real change that we can believe in.. Eight is enough as my wallet cant afford four more years. With McCain 's plan I will pay more taxes , with Obama 's plan I will pay less taxes..

They sound the same to me so what maverick are you speaking of it sure isnt Palin or McCain.. </lie.v.956><lie.v.957>But our parents and grandparents can be wrong ! Remember too , that even though they may have taught you lies ( myths ) it is probable that they were taught the same things themselves and did not recognize them as deception. Nor , as is too often the case , did they investigate to discover for themselves if those things were true . </lie.v.957><lie.v.958>Pads and Toppers are essential All changing tables should be equipped with some sort of pad , to keep the infant comfortable and protect the table top. A baby who likes the changing table is much more likely to lie still while the parent is fussing with extra sticky disposable diaper tabs or slippery tubes of diaper rash ointment. The pad or topper provided with many changing tables is thin and cheap , often of white plastic. If you keep this pad , lay a receiving blanket on it , so your child 's delicate skin is n't in contact with the plastic . </lie.v.958><lie.v.959>It is easy enough to prove the duplicity of jews , who changed the truth of God into a lie. The Word says , " Ye shall not lie " ( Lev. 19 : 11 ) . God hates " a false witness that speaketh lies " ( Prov. 6 : 19 ) . " Lying lips are abomination " ( Prov. 12 : 22 ) . Whereas , the Babylonian Talmud says , " A Jew may lie and perjure to condemn a Christian The name of God is not profaned when lying to Christians " Baba Kama 113a , b; " Jews must always try to deceive Christians " Kohar 1 160a; " It is not permitted to imitate the customs of the Akum ( Christians ) nor act like them " Iore Dea 178 , 1; " God rewards clever liars " Kallah 51a . </lie.v.959><lie.v.960>Deuteronomy 28 : 30 You shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit. ( WEB KJV JPS ASV DBY WBS YLT RSV ) </lie.v.960><lie.v.961>Since parents are important role models , teens may learn to lie from them. Teens who hear their parents constantly lying even about insignificant matters will tend to lie with relative ease . </lie.v.961><lie.v.962>MANAGEMENT : It is not always easy to probe the mind of a child. If the symptoms persist , take the advice of a doctor , who may even refer him to a family counsellor , psychologist or a psychiatrist. Don ' t upset the child by remarks like , ' You are just acting ' or ' Do not try to fool us ' . I believe that such children do get pain , but the symptom is probably due to some , not yet fully understood mechanism or is related more to the mind rather than the body - possibly a subconscious way of attracting the parents ' attention for more body contact. Hence , the treatment lies in understanding the child , helping him with his underlying emotional problem , if any , rather than being harsh towards him . </lie.v.962><lie.v.963>In your initial consultation , Dr. Berzin will evaluate your health , determine where your fat deposits lie and assess the condition of your skin. Dr. Berzin will explain the body-contouring methods that may be most appropriate for you. For example , if you believe you want liposuction in the abdominal area , you may learn that an abdominoplasty or " tummy tuck " may more effectively meet your goals; or that a combination of traditional liposuction and UAL would be the best choice for you . </lie.v.963><lie.v.964>Paul Ekman , a psychiatry professor from the University of California , San Francisco , attributes this to 'duping delight'. People who tell such lies do so not to get out of trouble , but for fun. For them , lying is like a drug that provides an adrenalin surge or a 'kick ' sensation , and the feeling of being able to control the person they are lying to . </lie.v.964><lie.v.965>The WTS automatically classes all who question its teachings as " God 's enemies " and all those outside the WTS as being under the influence of the Devil. ( Revelation - It 's Grand Climax at Hand ! 1988 pp. 228 , 234 , 270 , 271 ) The Devil 's influence would of course extend to the courts of law and the presiding judge. So in fact the WTS 's reasoning provides JWs with a carte blanche to lie to most of the world ! </lie.v.965><lie.v.966>Quite a few of my Girlfriends said that they were light-headed early in their pregnancies. Getting out of bed too quickly could give them tunnel vision and make them see stars. Bending over to tie their shoes could result in their having to lie on the floor until the blood returned to their head. A word of caution here : A significant number of women have gotten pregnant after too much to drink , and sometimes pregnancy and a hangover are hard to tell apart. The general rule should be that a hangover that lasts for more than a couple of days could be pregnancy , and it might be a good idea to give up the partying until you know for certain. Even if you are n't pregnant , if you have hangovers that last more than a couple of days , it is probably a good idea for you to give up partying anyway. If you are light-headed , it is usually nothing to worry about , but you could pass out and bonk your head on something , so move slowly and let your blood pressure adjust at its new , slower pace . </lie.v.966><lie.v.967>Officials can only get away with lying as frequently as they do when they are in possession of mountains of vital information not available to the general public. It 's not the lies that are the fundamental problem. Politicians are always driven to lie , and will do so to the extent that they can get away with it. The problem is that in a supposedly democratic country most of us have been successfully trained to think nothing of the fact that only the executive branch operates intelligence agencies , that these agencies all work ultimately for the president , and that the White House , the Defense Department and the entire Byzantine , executive branch Mukhabbarat is permitted by law to withhold much of what they know from the very people who are supposed to be governing themselves. Meanwhile , the public has nothing remotely similar to these agencies , whether in reach , clandestine capabilities , penetration or analytic skills. We just have the sorry " media " . </lie.v.967><lie.v.968>The people I blame are in California. Land of fruits and nuts. They keep voting her in. I blame San Francisco voters.

We deserve better . </lie.v.968><lie.v.969>Perceptions of lie acceptability vary as a function of the motivation for the lie , the relationship between deceiver and deceived , and the perceiver ' s cultural background. The current study examines the relation between one cultural background that is , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ( LDS ) and perceptions of lie acceptability , and whether this varies as a function of lie and rater characteristics. Participants rated lie acceptability in 12 scenarios varying lie motivation and lie recipient. Overall , the LDS group rated lies as less acceptable than did the non-LDS group , and lie acceptability varied according to lie motivation and lie recipient. Participant age was negatively correlated with lie acceptability. Implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed . </lie.v.969><lie.v.970>But it gets worse. And , of course , there was Pfc. Jessica Lynch , the first rescued prisoner of war. See the full story of the lies , cover ups , and more lies that accompanied this story at ' The Jessica Lynch Corner. Jessica Lynch was no hero , as the media and military made her out to be. They lied about the source of her injuries she was tortured and she was raped. And she was in the Army in spite of the fact that she was nearly blind without her heavy , thick glasses. And she never fired her weapon during the ambush of her unit . </lie.v.970><lie.v.971>In the general uproar , some of the boys revealed -- in youthful boasts -- how they had lied about Bessie and how young X had bragged that Bessie was a virgin. The banker soon saw that he had stirred up a hornet 's nest. The whole story came out , and was whispered throughout the community. The banker 's enemies took delight in spreading it. Finally he tried to buy off the widow. She refused any of his money , even enough to pay for the abortion. The banker 's son was shipped off to a military academy . </lie.v.971><lie.v.972>In the New Testament , Jesus refers to the Devil as the father of lies ( John 8 : 44 ) and Paul commands Christians " Do not lie to one another " ( Colossians 3 : 9 , Cf.Leviticus 19 : 11 ) . St. John the Revelator reports that God said " ..all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone : which is the second death. " [ Rev 21 : 8 ] </lie.v.972><lie.v.973>So it should come as no surprise that Clinton 's contention that ''to the best of my knowledge no one has said anything to me about any espionage , which occurred by the Chinese against the labs , during my presidency'' is a lie. Or that ''I can tell you that no one has reported to me that they suspect such a thing has occurred'' is also a lie. These lies concern the largest spy scandal since the Rosenbergs . </lie.v.973><lie.v.974>I definitely have lied to past boyfriends to get what I wanted. Mainly my dishonesty was due to immaturity and greed. Whether you ' re male or female , I think that a time comes when you ' re aware of what you want , you realize that anyone who doesn ' t want you as you are and will put up with your shit diesnt really love you , and you learn really embrace the golden rule. I think its just part of growing up. Some folks don ' t do that until well damn never . </lie.v.974><lie.v.975>Detailed instructions for correct use are included in the packaging. Be sure to read and understand them before you use any of these products. Usually , a woman lies down or squats , then gently inserts the spermicide deep into her vagina. Contraceptive foams , creams , jellies , film , and suppositories usually require waiting 10 minutes after insertion before intercourse can begin. These methods typically only remain effective for one hour after insertion. More spermicide must be inserted each time vaginal intercourse is repeated . </lie.v.975><lie.v.976>Fainting can happen after injections , and is more common in pre-teens and teens. Falls that happen when someone faints can cause serious injuries. To help prevent injuries , anyone getting the vaccine should rest ( sit or lie down ) for 15 minutes after the injection is given. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if you notice ringing in your ears , sweating , nausea , dizziness , or changes in your vision. These can be signals that you are about to faint. It is also important to know that some people can have muscle jerks or lose control of their bladders , almost like they are having a seizure , as they are fainting. This is not a seizure , and symptoms get better quickly after the person lies down . </lie.v.976><lie.v.977>Sara I don ' t feel much different now than I did when I was a teen either ! ! !

Kochis lied and said that no blue shirt existed despite the fact that it was proven that a blue shirt did exist and was turned in by a woman who came to the hearing to testify to that fact. The blue shirt was picked up and logged into evidence by a Deputy Sheriff. There is a police log documenting the blue shirt being picked up and the phone call to the dispatcher reporting this blue shirt. The shirt was found on a different day and in a different location than the t-shirt which was subjected to EDTA testing in 2004 . </lie.v.978><lie.v.979>Sarah lies because she fears exposure. She thinks her thoughts and doubts are hidden , and a lie is the best way to solve her problem. She does not want to be exposed as a mocker and doubter to her husband and to God. She is afraid she lies. However , nothing is hidden from God . </lie.v.979><lie.v.980>The Lebanese Civil War was the result of a complex set of religious , political and ethnic conflicts that included the Palestine Liberation Organization , Maronite Christians , Israel , Syria and the United States. It became a site for not only armed conflict but struggles for public relations through the use of spectacle. Raad understands that autonomous claims to truthin the institutions of both politics and artrest upon the shifting ground of representation. But once we reawaken our skepticism , we can be more finely attuned to see not only the political forces that lie behind the representations of conflict but also the mundane , tragically funny , paradoxical and absurd realities that define life outside the frame . </lie.v.980><lie.v.981>While presidents did not generally find it necessary to lie about their sex life , they often found it essential to lie about their health.

This is the norm. However , there are rare occasions when you face a moral conflict between two values such as telling the truth OR saving a life. Corrie ten Boom faced such a choice when she lied to the Nazis in order to save Jews hiding in her home. Just War theories are also developed on this premise . </lie.v.983><lie.v.984>Another Hillary lie. Big suprise. Big deal.

Of course , in selecting a position of comfort in later pregnancy , the foetus may have chosen a position which is difficult or impossible for vaginal delivery. In this regard he may be accused of lack of foresight , but this is a trait not unknown in adults . </lie.v.987><lie.v.988>But the Marquis wasn ' t the kind of man to lie , and she knew that. Oh , God , she thought , with a growing sense of dread. What if she was wrong ? What if Trina had been duped ? What did she really know of Shelley Peirce , other than secondhand repetition of what he ' d told a sixteen-year old schoolgirl ? What did she know of the love words spoken between a man and a woman ? She knew a rake would say and do anything to seduce a woman. Look at how easily she herself had lost her head to the Marquis ' kisses ! Wasn ' t Shelley Peirce , given dire financial circumstances , capable of being every bit as ruthless to his intended victim ? The only difference being that the rakehell sought favors , while the fortune hunter sought wealth. How would sweet , stuttering Trina know the difference ? " No , " she moaned. Oh , damn , damn , damn , what have I done ? Comprehension of the enormity of her actions dawned on her . </lie.v.988><lie.v.989>In this process lies the true secret of heredity. The inherited energies retain their full measure of power , and all their original quality in the growing and dividing chromosomes ( the chromosome is one of the segments into which the chromoplasmic filaments of a cell-nucleus break up just before indirect division ) . On the other hand , the egg-substance of the female germ-cell , which is assimilated by the chromosomes , and which is turned into their substance by the process of organic chemistry , loses its specific plastic vital energy completely. It is in the same way that food [ 13 ] eaten by the adult has absolutely no effect on his qualitative organic structure. We may eat ever so many beef-steaks without acquiring any of the characteristics of an ox. And the germ-cell may devour any amount of egg-protoplasma without losing its original paternal energy. As a rule a child inherits as many qualities from its mother as from its father . </lie.v.989><lie.v.990>This is perhaps the most common position used for breastfeeding by many mothers.

The cannula is pushed then pulled through the fat layer , breaking up the fat cells and suctioning them out. The suction action is provided by a vacuum pump or a large syringe , depending on the surgeon 's preference.

" When she would n't stop telling the lie that she never supported the " Bridge To Nowhere " during her vice-presidential run in 2008 , it was n't a huge leap of faith to believe that she would stoop to lying to the public again if she felt the need.

" Goldhor-Lerner brings this to our attention. When parents lie to protect their children from information they would not be able to handle , the results bob to the surface : " When children sense information is being withheld , they become confused and anxious , lose their sense of trust , and often end up blaming themselves. In searching for a way to explain the inexplicable , they create private beliefs , myths , and fantasies. " Goldhor-Lerner , page 142. This example suggests that children may craft lies as a way to relieve anxiety. They do this because they have no other way of coping with the upsurgence of confusion in their psyche..The lie they absorb acts as a burr that " beats up " on the children , by clouding their understanding. Then , in turn , they create their own lies. So we begin to see with these examples , that whatever the undergirding of a lie is , it inevitably leaves a wake of destruction in its path . </lie.v.1038><lie.v.1039>55.

Detectives are very good at creating the illusion that you are free to go , when actually , you are not.

In this authors opinion , many who wish to maintain an unbreakable prohibition on lying have so diluted the applicability of that prohibition that their stance against lying is more permissive than the stance of those who define lying broadly and admit to exceptions. By using such strained hermeneutics and equivocation , Murray and Augustin fling open the door to deconstructive tactics that can ultimately justify far too many lies.33 It is the broader understanding of the prohibition against lying34 that rightly denounces more lies and deception , even though it admits exceptions to the rule.

Perhaps one woman plans to experience the trek by preparing to hike the full way , with friends and guides by her side , learning how to pace herself along the way and comes out on the other side feeling empowered and exhilarated.

Sperm are finicky little cells that need exactly the right range of temperatures to develop correctly for the three months they live. Too hot , and sperm are malformed; too cold , and they die. Male mammals have a neat little device for controlling the temperature of the sperm-making apparatus : the scrotum. As we all know , the male gonads sit in a sac. Inside the skin of the sac are muscles that can expand and contract as the temperature changes. Muscles also lie in our sperm cords. Hence , the cold-shower effect : the scrotum will tuck close to the body when it is cold. The whole package rises and falls with temperature. This is all a way to optimize the production of healthy sperm . </lie.v.1116><lie.v.1117>Oh , now here 's a big surprise ! ! ! ! Should we all pretend that we had no idea that a democrat would lie ?

The root problem in health care lies in the patient ' s life choices something a person can only change himself. Some may assume that a sexually transmitted disease can be treated with just an antibiotic and it will go away. In reality , this just scratches the surface. Some sexually transmitted diseases can be slowed but rarely if never cured by medical therapy these include Hepatitis C , HIV , infectious arthritis and many others. The problem is simply much larger than the infectious source. Eradicating a bacteria or virus by administration of an appropriate drug will sometimes provide a complete medical cure. But it can also overlook permanent damage caused by a sexually transmitted disease before the time of diagnosis in these cases , treatment , if there is any at all , can have devastating consequence.

You must lay stress on the unbreakable connection between woman ' s human and social position and the private ownership of the means of production. This will draw a strong , ineradicable line against the bourgeois movement for the emancipation of women. This will also give us a basis for examining the woman question as part of the social , working-class question , and to bind it firmly with the proletarian class struggle and the revolution. The communist women ' s movement itself must be a mass movement , a part of the general mass movements; and not only of the proletarians , but of all the exploited and oppressed , of all victims of capitalism or of the dominant class. Therein , too , lies the significance of the women ' s movement for the class struggle of the proletariat and its historic mission , the creation of a communist society . </lie.v.1124><lie.v.1125>Placenta previa is defined as implantation of the placenta in the lower uterine segment in advance of the fetal presenting part. The placenta either totally or partially lies within the lower uterine segment. Placenta previa complicates approximately 0.3 -0.5 of pregnancies or about 4.8 per 1 , 000 deliveries. The risk of recurrent placenta previa is as high as 4 to 8 . The risk of placenta previa increases with the number of prior cesarean sections , rising to 10 with four or more. Although some distinctions in outcome may be made among the different degrees of true placenta previa , all are potentially associated with life-threatening hemorrhage during labor. The degree of placenta previa can not alone predict the clinical course accurately , nor can it serve as the sole guide for management decisions.

In fact ... let 's actually LOOK at the facts ! , when Carter left office , the national debt was ONE trillion dollars. Remember REGAN 's ( sic ) ... it was Reagan , by the way ...

But that is the cruelest lie of all : the lie that legal abortion is about choice. In fact , it is about limiting women 's true choices by eliminating the truth.

That is why they burnt not only corresponding books like that one of ancient Greek philosopher Porphyry ( 232/3-304 ) but later they also burnt those individuals that told the repressed truths , which this terrorism wanted to replace by lying and deceiving.

Hallie Ephron ' s skilled storytelling produces the perfect suburban couple , then relentlessly twists their lives into distrust , deception , and danger. This compelling thriller proves : when secrets and lies fester into obsession , there ' s no statute of limitations on revenge. " </lie.v.1144><lie.v.1145>Lies are sometimes necessary in life but they should be used sparingly. You 'd better have a very good memory if you lie often. You are bound to be found out eventually . </lie.v.1145><lie.v.1146>At Amazon.com there are 210 books with the word " liar " in the title , 2 , 378 books with the word " lie " in the title and another couple hundred with the word " lying " in the title. It appears that lies and lying are nothing original. Yet , no other president in history has had seven books -- all labeling him an almost pathological liar -- published within months of each other . </lie.v.1146><lie.v.1147>That Catholic theology insists the woman in Genesis 3 and Revelation 12 is Mary , the mother of Jesus , is proof positive that Rome ' s agenda in this case the Immaculate Conception doctrine takes precedence over the Word of God , and actually contradicts sound exegesis. No wonder Rome doesn ' t want Catholics interpreting the Bible on their own ! The earthly mother of the man Christ Jesus died and was buried two millennia ago. It is the nation of Israel referred to as the woman both in Genesis and Revelation who will flee into the wilderness for God ' s protection during the coming tribulation. But Catholics are not permitted to believe that. They must believe Pius XII ' s lie that the woman is Mary , our Lord ' s mother . </lie.v.1147><lie.v.1148>A good example of how important it is to lie low at home during the first 9-12 days. My instructions from my ENT reiterated that bleeding can occur during that period due to the scabs beginning to come off and that to avoid bleeding , you should avoid any unnecessary exertion and really just hang out at home taking it easy on the couch . </lie.v.1148><lie.v.1149>" All U.S. presidents have lied , " said Bradlee , who , as managing editor of The Washington Post , made his legendary reputation revealing them. His publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and the relentless coverage of Watergate helped lead to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974 . </lie.v.1149><lie.v.1150>Sometimes , other people would lie about their age to either use you or take advantage of you , or try to hurt you. Someone may say that their twenty one for example or twenty to get a younger person , and their true age would range from twenty five to twenty nine. That could constitute a possible rape or even a killing. Just remember to be on your guard if you are going to date online , and use your logic and gut before trusting your heart . </lie.v.1150><lie.v.1151>Production and reserves are different words that have specific meanings that seems to escape the McBush/Pal-cheney defenders. Only one relates to " supply " . Not only does it remain that Palin lied ( or simply has no knowledge of what is produced in Alaska ) but it is further ignored that very little of the dwindling Alaska sources oil even goes to the US mainland. Most is sent to Asia . </lie.v.1151><lie.v.1152>I had a guy who used to lie to me about a sleep disorder he had. Apparently everytime he had sex he would instantly fall asleep as soon as he was done. He called it hyper-circadian rythm syndrome. He used to claim it would knock him out for about 30 mins. The first couple of times I actually left as I thought he had really fallen asleep , but by the end of the relationship I started thinking that maybe he was just doing this to make me leave. One night I left straight after and went across the road to his local pub and sure enough 10 mins later he walked in with his alcoholic flatmate and I caught him out. I ca n't believe I was so dumb as to fall for a guy like that ! </lie.v.1152><lie.v.1153>I have a child who never lies. She ' s 26 now. You ' d think I ' d be thankful , but it ' s actually horrible. For example , when we were talking about her boyfriend , she let me know that he doesn ' t like me he blames me for her being bipolar. Great. Even though she says that he has since changed his mind , I find myself incapable of caring about him. Social lies are useful. When she ' d do something wrong as a kid , because she couldn ' t lie about it , she wouldn ' t say anything , thereby admitting her guilt without explicitly stating what she ' d done. She ' s too open about everything. I grew up with a punitive mother , so I learned to lie early and often. I sometimes view her lack of lying as a sign of my better ability to mother she didn ' t have to worry about telling me the truth but I ' m happier dealing with my two lying sons than with my never-told-a-lie daughter . </lie.v.1153><lie.v.1154>Complicating matters is the fact that the Bible declares Gods inability to lie. Murray takes this to mean that all untruth or falsehood ... is a contradiction of that which God is.38 However , the few instances in which the Bible states Gods inability to lie place that inability in the context of an oath. That is , they state that when God swears an oath , his word can not fail because it is contrary to Gods character to violate his oath.39 These instances use such constructions as : in the hope of eternal life , which God , who can not lie , promised long ages ago; 40 and </lie.v.1154><lie.v.1155>If an individual is made to concentrate upon ungodly or Satanic symbols , such as prescribed by Gurus , Rishis , and the followers of Kali and other satanic entities , the soul of that individual will definitely fly towards the object of his concentration and see these clearly. He becomes a tool in the hands of certain non-human entities and their human operators. He develops severe headaches , fits , and suffers all sorts of hallucinations. At time , he is turned into a medium for healing or telling the future. This is a tactic of the invisible entities to spread the most deadly physical disease to all those who come into contact with their mediums. The ability to do out-of-body traveling is present in all , and there is nothing mystical or supernormal about it. However , the difference lies in channeling this ability for the betterment of the individual . </lie.v.1155><lie.v.1156>I used to support this THING with everything she done , her charity work , her career. But now , what a change ! Her past record shows us she is a bitch but what she done with Brad proves to us this THING is a pure evil bitch ! Its all lies that her PR team are saying just trying to save what reputation she has left , which is none ! In fact it angers me that they think we are so stupid to believe anything about her . </lie.v.1156><lie.v.1157>Her Bosnia lie and appearing on Jay Leno to joke about it has pissed off Bosnia , the military , and a lot of people at home. Ireland thinks she 's a " wee bit silly " as does much of the world. Lie upon lie ! Can you trust someone who keeps lying to you ? I ca n't ! </lie.v.1157><lie.v.1158>He is so two-faced. He 'll go to any biker rally , alley bar , redneck town hall and jump in the sewer , and then he 'll " clean up " for a moment for things like Thursday night 's Service Forum , as if he was n't busy telling dirty lies the night before , and this encourages the media to be squeamish about calling his crap what it is . </lie.v.1158><lie.v.1159>Men are by nature flirtatious. Men tells lies because they want to avoid troubles and problems. One lie leads to many lies. Men tell lies so as to hide what they are doing. Men lies so that their women , be it girlfriend or wife , will not be disappointed by them. Men lies to other men so that they can feel proud of themselves. For example , lying to people that they are rich is one example. Still another example , lying that they are single when in fact they are married , so that they will be crowded by women. When men are surrounded by women , they feel proud of themselves . </lie.v.1159><lie.v.1160>In a way , the whole situation is simultaneously much worse and much more innocent than Isra ls imagines : despite Freud ' s positivist rhetoric , psychoanalysis was , from the very beginning , a purely speculative ( a purely ' metapsychological ' ) enterprise in which facts and evidence played , at best , a role of marginal importance. In that respect , to establish that Freud lied about clinical matters is not enough to account for that ' longest error ' , psychoanalysis. We must also , as Henri Ellenberger and Frank Sulloway have done , reconstruct the theoretical context from which Freud drew his inspiration and which alone explains why he so easily mistook his speculations for reality and , above all , why he so easily managed to convince others to do the same ... ... </lie.v.1160><lie.v.1161>The Boy Who Cried Wolf , a fable attributed to Aesop about a boy who continually lies a wolf is coming.

Yet this is precisely what contemporary feminism attempts to deny. Some state outright that women are the morally superior sex [ 12 ] . Others would deny such an explicit claim , yet the claim lies implicitly in all feminist writing nonetheless , by way of the incessant depiction of men as cruel exploiters , and women their innocent victims. How can one claim to believe in the 'moral equality ' of two groups while simultaneously maintaining that one of the two has supposedly " exploited " and " oppressed " the other in every society that has ever existed ? The belief in the 'moral equality ' of the sexes implies the belief that the universal human expectation of male dominance and female submission are in some sense 'natural ' and proper; to deny one is to deny the other . </lie.v.1165><lie.v.1166>Fidgeting. Fidgeting is different from hand gestures. Usually when someone speaks from experience , speech comes with gestures naturally. But when a formulated lie is being told , the person usually stands still to control nervousness or stammering. For some people though , weird fidgeting clearly tells you when the guy is lying . </lie.v.1166><lie.v.1167>Wow ... I like how " docbears " says " if a patient lies about doing cocaine or having 2 previous csections because she believes what she reads ... " Nice that you try to compare a hard drug user with the mother in the story. Chill out doctor. And I love your first comment ... " Ms. Patzelt is the reason there are bad outcomes ... " Ok ... so all of a sudden , doctors are perfect and do n't make mistakes ? My uncle works for the second largest law firm in the world and by far , their biggest legal department is medical malpractice and wrongful death. Doctors , pharmaceutical drugs , hospital administrators and nurses ALL have caused and continue to cause accidents , injury and death to hundreds of thousands of people every year. That is what your own medical journals admit. Gim me a break . </lie.v.1167><lie.v.1168>" When one sees , for the first time , the maternal soft parts stretched out to a diaphanous thinness by the presenting portion of the child , to all appearances just upon the point of cracking open , the impulse to place the hand upon the bulging flesh becomes almost an instinct. We must not , however , forget that these tissues are not only elastic , but living and sentient; and -- what is of still greater weight -- that the process of labour is a strictly physiological act. Nature in all her operations intends to adapt means to ends , and the perineum was certainly not created to be torn , unless shored up by the hand of the physician. It unfortunately labours under the disadvantage of lying on the external surface of the body , and its distension is really the only visible process of parturition. Were the os uteri or the uterus itself equally visible and tangible , I doubt not we would be frightened into encircling them with our hands , greasing them , folding towels about them , etc. etc. Fortunately for their integrity they lie out of sight and out of reach . </lie.v.1168><lie.v.1169>When confronted with a child who is lying , it is important to first remember the child 's age and developmental stage. Children under the age of 3 do not lie on purpose. This age group does not understand what they are saying and instead are just experimenting with language and new found facts about the world. They might also lie to avoid punishment because they understand the consequences but have an undeveloped moral code . </lie.v.1169><lie.v.1170>Do you understand what drives a narcissist who believes herself to be special , exempt from the controls that the rest of us labor under , with even her God behind her wanting what she wants over and above all else ? It 's strange , but narcissists have a tough time telling the truth. They stretch and embroider and even tell flat out lies because they love the narrative and adore hearing themselves speak. Reality is something they manufacture from minute to minute ( which is why you can be their best friend one minute and find a knife in your back the next -- they make up reality as they go along , and you are a pawn in their game. Sound familiar ? ) </lie.v.1170><lie.v.1171>it would be nice if CNN reported the objective facts instead of just parroting republican lies. When some one is lying , i expect them to be called on it. McCain 's campaign is LYING abotu Palin 's bridge to nowhere . </lie.v.1171><lie.v.1172>As a child he played Scarecrow in neighbourhood reenactments of the movie , The Wizard of Oz. But he was n't a big fan of the film version. He told an interviewer : " I wanted Dorothy to shut up. . . And Glinda ! She steps out in this prom gown from some era that we never lived in , and with that helium voice , lies to her , when she knows all along the ruby slippers will take her home instantly and that Dorothy does n't have to suffer anything. That lie , on top of the Wizard 's lies , made me furious as a kid. And of course I grew up in the shadow of Vietnam , when boys I knew were being sent to kill the Wicked Witch of the Vietcong , by Nixon , who would n't come out of the White House and who would n't answer questions. " </lie.v.1172><lie.v.1173>He lies about anything and everything to the point where his partner might doubt her perception , his sanity , or her own. His lies inflict a deliberate delusion on his partner , which he expects her to accept without question. And no matter how often he lies , he still expects her to trust and adore him . </lie.v.1173><lie.v.1174>Yeah ! I saw a movie like that recently Some old straight to DVD movie.

The width varies at different parts along the length , being more towards the ovarian side and thinner but more muscular towards the uterine side. Its widest part , the ampulla lies next to the fimbria and its importance lies in the fact that fertilization of the ovum by the sperm usually occurs in this region . </lie.v.1175><lie.v.1176>His wife had no reason and had nothing to gain by being honest with LW about her affair. The fact that she owned up to it shows a level of bravery and honesty that most people lack. Why , after coming clean about it all , would she lie about the paternity of the child ? She told him the physical affair did n't start until after the baby wasborn. She was angry the dentist ended the affair for the exact reason she gave- because HE was the one who pursued her and pressured her into sex , and then he decided he did n't want it after all . </lie.v.1176><lie.v.1177>I am so happy whenever I read someone else realizes these two lie. They feel they are owed the whitehouse and even more so they are lieing to get there. I can ' t stomach either one of them. I would love to know the big change they plan on doing and what his plans really are I have heard nothing but beating around the bush. There is nothing anyone can do for years to come after what Bush has done . </lie.v.1177><lie.v.1178>Thus the statement " I had to lie " is never true , because there are other choices which we evaluated but found too costly. A common experience of my generation was the choice of whether to lie to avoid the draft during Vietnam. ( I turned 18 the year the draft ended. I had already formulated the ideas I am expressing here , but I can not say with certainty that I would have had the courage of my convictions. ) On the one hand , most people who evaded the draft had a genuine belief that the war was immoral. On the other hand , many missed the fact that draft evasion was not a moral choice , nor was it in any way ( because concealed ) an act of protest. On a spectrum of moral statement , two other choices were more honest. The highest form of protest , involving the most personal risk , was to refuse to serve and accept the consequences. Few people had the courage to do this. Another choice was to withdraw from the community altogether and go live in another country , which more people did . </lie.v.1178><lie.v.1179>And no , PZ , I 'm not faulting the headline , because however monotonous it is to say that the DI lies , they just do it again on a nearly daily basis. The boredom this causes is no reason to quit , and headlines really should do what this one does , inform us about the article . </lie.v.1179><lie.v.1180>16 ) Finally , just to show that Bush 's lying did n't start when he entered the White House , and is n't just related to policy matters , let 's go back to those halcyon days of " youthful indiscretion. " Bush never has owned up to his drunk driving conviction from 1976. In fact , he lied to the Dallas Morning News in 1998 when he said that he had not been arrested " after 1968. " Bush also has dodged questions about cocaine or marijuana use with the following convoluted formulation : " I could have passed the [ FBI ] background check on the standards applied on the most stringent conditions when my dad was president of the United States -- a 15-year period. " Huh ? Finally , Bush has changed his story about , oh , a million times on his Vietnam-era military service , or lack thereof. The truth is , though , that Dubya simply stopped showing up 10 months before the end of his six-year , part-time commitment to the Texas Air National Guard. Obviously , lying goes way back with this guy . </lie.v.1180><lie.v.1181>Tell Me No Lies offers a riveting account of the lies we tell our partners ( and ourselves ) in marriage. Some people lie because they lack the nerve to tell their partners what they feel , while others are so terrified of hearing the truth that they encourage their mates to lie to them , thus falling into " Lie Invitee " behavior. This book examines the four marital stages-The Honeymoon , Emerging Differences , Freedom , and Together as Two-and how deception interferes with development in each of the stages. For example , couples in the Honeymoon stage are often under the illusion that they are perfectly content and have everything in common . </lie.v.1181><lie.v.1182>God values those who are honest to a fault -- who refuse to lie and deceive even when their honesty hurts them.

I think lying to America and the rest of the world about our reasons for going to war is a good reason for impeachment. But one thing that is being overlooked , I fear , is the nature of the lie we were told , and the extent to which many Americans were and apparently are still willing to participate in it . </lie.v.1184><lie.v.1185>Our country is so screwed. He lied to get into the office and continues to lie to us , the media lied to get him into office and continues to lie for him and the idiots of America voted for him. Good job liberal hypocrites . </lie.v.1185><lie.v.1186>But he lied , you say ? And under oath , no less ? I say this is the one lie justified by morality. No man kisses and tells if he 's any good , and no woman , either . </lie.v.1186><lie.v.1187>Clearly , lying is an issue worth examining , as many people believe it is a bigger problem today than it has ever been. A recent Time magazine cover story concluded , " Lies flourish in social uncertainty , when people no longer understand , or agree on , the rules governing their behavior toward one another. " Maybe social uncertainty abounds because we are a mixture of Kantians , virtuists , and utilitarians who share no common ground. More likely , the problem is that too few persons adequately consider any ethical perspective when facing a situation that tempts a lie. Either way , it seems that the solution to our dissatisfaction begins with acknowledging the value of ethical reasoning and ends with a commitment to follow through with what we determine is the right thing to do . </lie.v.1187><lie.v.1188>To read a collection of Wolff 's work that spans the years is to realize that he is obsessed with the act of lying. Asked in an interview why so many of his characters lie , Wolff replied , " The world is not enough , maybe ? To lie is to say the thing that is not , so there 's obviously an unhappiness with what is , a discontent. " A recent outbreak of faked memoirs has set off a storm of outraged pontification about why people pass off false histories as their own , so it 's satisfying to read about liars who lie for interesting reasons rather than the usual despicable ones. Wolff is , in fact , a genius at locating the truths revealed by lies the ancient and holy tongues , you might say , the otherwise inexpressible inner realities that lies give voice to . </lie.v.1188><lie.v.1189>Brynhild told Gunnar that Sigurd had broken his vow to him , and slept with her the night before she arrived in the palace. Anger at the betrayal , Gunnar sought Sigurd 's death. Since vow to brotherhood to Sigurd , Gunnar and Hogni could not kill Sigurd without violating their oaths. His brother ( Guttorm ) mortally wounded Sigurd. At his death , Brynhild mocked Gudrun 's grief and told her husband , that she lie about Sigurd betraying him. Brynhild told Gunnar and Hogni that her brother would avenge her death upon them. Gunnar tried to prevent her from killing herself , but Hogni saw that it was inevitable . </lie.v.1189><lie.v.1190>Well , we 'll find out in a few months , as FOX will air an American version of the hit Colombian game show Nothing But The Truth. Basically , the idea is this : a contestant is hooked up to a lie detector. He 's asked a series of questions , and if he passes , he wins $ 50 , 000. If he does n't , he has to face the wrath of friends and family backstage regarding what he lied about . </lie.v.1190><lie.v.1191>Marcum claims that the district court erred in finding that the adulterous nature of the relationship in question automatically barred constitutional protection. We disagree. The adulterous nature of Marcum 's relationship with Abbott is a fact that must be considered in determining where on the spectrum this relationship lies. See Roberts , 468 U.S. at 620 ( explaining that objective characteristics of the individual relationship must be considered to determine where that relationship lies on a " spectrum from the most intimate to the most attenuated of personal attachments " ) . The Supreme Court has set forth factors which may be used in determining whether a particular relationship is constitutionally protected. These factors include : " size , purpose , policies , selectivity , congeniality , and other characteristics that in a particular case may be pertinent. " Id. The adulterous nature of the relationship between Marcum and Abbott is an objective characteristic that is pertinent to this case and we find that the district court correctly considered it in determining whether the relationship was constitutionally protected . </lie.v.1191><lie.v.1192>I was bothered on so many levels that I could only babble incoherently as I readjusted my pants and patted down my handles.

Sidney Rigdon in the 18 June 1845 'Messenger and Advocate ' reported that Parley P. Pratt , in speaking of the means by which church leaders should sustain Smith , advised that 'we must lie to protect brother Joseph , it is our duty to do so. ' Not only were church leaders willing to violate the law to promote polygamy , they did not hesitate to blacken the character of individuals who threatened to expose the secret practice of plural marriage. Sarah Pratt was not the only woman to suffer from this policy. The 27 August 1842 'Wasp , ' for example , branded Martha H. Brotherton a 'mean harlot , ' and Nancy Rigdon suffered the same treatment after she opposed Smith 's polygamous proposals ... ..Jane Law , wife of Smith 's counselor William Law , was also blacklisted for rejecting Smith 's polyandrous proposal.

A sudden frightening experience is thought to cause it. The literal meaning is " loss of the soul. " There are several potions listed as being treatments but the link from Rice below explains that a ritual called a barrida , or sweeping , is often used. The victim lies down along the axis of a crucifix while the ceremony is performed. Incantations are spoken as prayers in groups of three. The body is swept with herbs and several treatments are necessary to effect a cure. This information links suggestibility to treatment. The delay created by twice weekly barridas would allow a recovery from exposure to Subliminal Distraction. Just as ICU Psychosis victims recover once they leave a hospital intensive care unit , victims of Susto should recover once their exposure stops or drops in frequency . </lie.v.1198><lie.v.1199>Glancing Away : Sometimes it 's so quick that it 's easy to miss this signal unless you 're watching a persons eyes. Liars do it out of embarresment that they 've lied and a subconcious awareness that there 's something about the eyes that always tells the truth. It 's one of the signals that most people actually recognise so habitual liars train themselves not to do it. The result is the frozen-stare that 's described lower on this page. In this picture the signal is reasonably strong and obvious. In reality it can be far more subtle. This is a powerful signal and should n't be ignored . </lie.v.1199><lie.v.1200>-- We notice various degrees of harm in all the passions , and this is certainly the case with lying. There is one judgment for him who lies through fear of punishment , and another for him who lies when no danger is at hand . </lie.v.1200><lie.v.1201>5Slide the lie into a casual conversation. It 's better to lie to the person in advance than have him question you later on the same topic. That way , the victim 's mind has hours , possibly days to fill in the blanks , and if he/she does come back to question the story , you 'll have a much easier time as your victim starts in on you. If the victim discovers your misdeed before you explain yourself , they 'll have time to deduce what has happened with a certain degree of certainty before they ever even question you . </lie.v.1201><lie.v.1202>A word of warning , signals that indicate a person is lying , particularly those related to stress , can be caused by the situation. Nina , a member of the team , once interviewed several human resources managers and identified a pattern. Most of the interviewers felt strongly that that the interviewees were lying even when they weren ' t. The reason was that the stress of the job interview was causing the candidates to display signals very similar to those associated with the lie.

Watergate did not come close . </lie.v.1207><lie.v.1208>So then , from this brief analysis of the Old Testament , there are times when it is appropriate to lie , and a time of war is one of those times. Those who are trying to kill us do not deserve the truth . </lie.v.1208><lie.v.1209>The truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help YOU if you find yourself being analyzed by Dr. Ekman and his team. Fox ' s new series LIE TO ME , which premieres tonight at 9pm ( in the coveted post-IDOL spot ) , tells stories inspired by Dr. Paul Ekman , a real-life specialist who can read clues embedded in the human face , body and voice to expose both the truth and lies in criminal investigations . </lie.v.1209><lie.v.1210>Men also lies for the sake of money.

When You Tell One Lie was the theme song used in a series of Latter Day Saints public service announcements 15 or 20 years ago. I forget the exact storyboard , but it starts out with a kid telling a lie. By the end of the 30 second PSA he ' s told a dozen lies to cover his tracks and is now being chased by mugger-looking dudes wearing masks chanting the above song . </lie.v.1211><lie.v.1212>As far as the psychology of the unconscious is concerned , lying is a fact of life. But the act of telling lies is something else entirely. When you tell a lie you make a deliberate , conscious effort to deceive someone , and that deception , at its psychological core , is an act of aggression . </lie.v.1212><lie.v.1213>It is almost amusing. The pundits and politicos are justifying each other 's vapid and useless existence these days by carrying forth an empty debate as to whether or not Mr. Bush and his people lied us into a war. Yet when hard evidence of these lies is presented in stark black and white , the response is a whistling silence . </lie.v.1213><lie.v.1214>The media , Obama and McCain endorsers are blaming Hillary for the story. There were reporters and cameramen when the sheriff was relating the story to Hillary. She did not make it up. Hillary trusted this individual , I suppose the fault lies with whomever 's job is to check these facts , we can not possibly think that this should be Hillary 's task.Although , let 's not forget we still do not know for sure if the hospital is being truthful . </lie.v.1214><lie.v.1215>Well , it ' s not like you or I could walk up to the White House and submit a job application for Press Secretary and really expect to be called in for a chance to get the job. Tony Snow got his job because he was willing to lie for the administration and because he believed in the illegal causes they supported , which he demonstrated through his radio and television commentary.

They were summarily dismissed and had no one to stick up for them , or get them rights , new jobs , job aid or even severance pay . </lie.v.1216><lie.v.1217>Dair Canard has made up tales since she was a child. Now , as an adult , she finds herself lying at the slightest provocation , with greater and greater finesse. She has established herself as an actress , and bonded with her husband , Peyton , on the premise of her greatest lie ever -- a fictitious twin sister who died at the age of 10. But Dair now finds herself at a point in her life where her lies threaten to avalanche. The mysterious death of a dear friend , the divorce of her parents , her increasingly serious drinking problem , and the strain of deceiving Peyton all finally collide . </lie.v.1217><lie.v.1218>The issue has earned new relevence because Shea-Porter has been vocally critical of protesters at her own town hall events. She has dismissed opponents of health reform as tea baggers and has claimed that Democrats never behaved as Rep. Joe Wilson ( R-SC ) behaved when he shouted you lie at President Barack Obama during a recent joint session of Congress. A vocal critic was removed from a recent Shea-Porter town hall event , though accounts differ as to whether he was removed because he was disruptive or because Shea-Porter has him escorted out . </lie.v.1218><lie.v.1219>The only dietary requirement in the Bible that is applicable to Christians today is that we should eat fatty meat. Those who recommend abstaining from eating meat are labeled in the Bible as having departed from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , doctrines of devils , speaking lies in hypocrisy , and having their conscience seared with a hot iron. In other words , they are very bad people and none possess saving faith. They are enemies of God . </lie.v.1219><lie.v.1220>" The worst thing that can happen to you in this society is to be labeled a liar. You ca n't have a society based on lies , " said Keenan. " We also all have an innate feeling of fairness. And lying is n't playing fair. " </lie.v.1220><lie.v.1221>Herein lies the Great Falling Away , the Apostasy , for American Christians I fear. A European minister confided in me that he strongly believed the spiritual darkness in Europe was a direct result of the horrors of WWII many Christians felt betrayed by God , that He had let them down by allowing such destruction to come upon their world. So many Christians here have embraced a belief system that will not accept they should ever see hard times. God help and deliver us all ! </lie.v.1221><lie.v.1222>However , the moment the new regime hardens into a dominating bureaucracy [ 11 ] the humanist dimension of the struggle is lost and it is no longer possible to speak of liberation. Hence our insistence that the authentic solution of the oppressor-oppressed contradiction does not lie in a mere reversal of position , in moving from one pole to the other. Nor does it lie in the replacement of the former oppressors with new ones who continue to subjugate the oppressed all in the name of their liberation . </lie.v.1222><lie.v.1223>Have you ever stopped for just a brief moment and given a thought about the women ( or men ) in the porn ? That is somebody 's daughter or son. That is a REAL person being abused through the exploitation of the body God fashioned around their soul. They are made in the image of God and they are being hurt. Lust lies when it deceives you into thinking that it does n't hurt anyone . </lie.v.1223><lie.v.1224>If we love God , we should obey Him ( John 14 : 15 ) . To love God first means to obey Him first before looking at our neighbor. So , is the greater good trusting God when He says not to lie or trusting in our fallible , sinful minds about the uncertain future ? </lie.v.1224><lie.v.1225>The Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible both contain statements that God can not lie ( Num 23 : 19 , Ps 89 : 35 , Hab. 2 : 3 , Heb 6 : 13-18 ) . </lie.v.1225><lie.v.1226>McCain may be telling the truth when he says he would rather lose and election than lose an essentially unwinnable war. But of course he lies blatantly when he says Obama would lose a war to win an election. Michael hit the nail on the head when he said that McCain would rather lose his honor in order to win an election . </lie.v.1226><lie.v.1227>Ah. Those were the days. And then we had a new president. And it appeared that , whatever else President Bush would be called , it wouldn ' t be Liar. Until Joseph Wilson piped up and accused him of lying to try to manipulate evidence , and suddenly it was a given that the President lied in his State of the Union address , which of course was far more serious than the lying that Bill Clinton had done . </lie.v.1227><lie.v.1228>218 Further evidence of tolerance of torture lies in the promotion , sometimes to the highest levels , of security police officers involved in torture. Statements before the Commission implicate four former heads of the Security Branch , two of whom subsequently became commissioners of police . </lie.v.1228><lie.v.1229>This is not a 'lie or someone else will die ' situation. Most hypothetical 'lie or die ' situations are not such. What it comes down to is that the person doing the lying considers it more expedient to lie than to risk their own life by their silence. The Bible is clear what the right course of action should be : </lie.v.1229><lie.v.1230>Another reason people lie is because they do things that they 're afraid they 'll get in trouble for and it 's a way to avoid this.

Jupiter ' s lowering brow did not refuse her. Venus happily quitted heaven at once with Mercurius accompanying her , and she spoke seriously to him : ' My brother from Arcaida , you surely know that your sister Venus has never had any success without Mercurius ' s attendance , and you are well aware for how long I have been unable to trace my maid who lies in hiding. So I have no recourse other than that you as herald make a public proclamation of a reward for tracking her down. So you must hasten to do my bidding , and clearly indicate the marks by which she can be recognized , so that if someone is charged with unlawfully concealing her , he can not defend himself on the plea of ignorance.

Enacted in 1996 , DOMA was codified in two separate titles of the United States Code. First , DOMA enacted a garden-variety ban on same-sex marriage by establishing a " one-man , one-woman " definition of marriage for the purposes of federal law.162 Until DOMA , there had never been a federal definition of marriage; moreover , the Supreme Court has long recognized that the regulation of family law -- including determining what constitutes " marriage " -- lies beyond the reach of federal [ *pg 589 ] authority , instead falling squarely within the states ' regulatory powers.163 DOMA 's second part purported to fashion an exception to the Full Faith and Credit Clause164 by allowing states to refuse to recognize any same-sex marriage performed in another jurisdiction.165 The constitutionality of DOMA has been the subject of much speculation and analysis.166 </lie.v.1242><lie.v.1243>The scriptures state that God can even control whether a man 's wife is unfaithful : Thus says the LORD , Behold , I will raise up evil against you from your own household; I will even take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your companion , and he shall lie with your wives  ( 2 Sam 12 : 11 NAS ) . Moreover , if , as Robertson 's Word Pictures of the New Testament suggests , that the fact it is the Hand of God which brought about these events , and this fact did not absolve  the people from their personal responsibility and guilt , that means the wives who God forced to be unfaithful are guilty of adultery -- even though it was the Hand of God that forced them to be unfaithful . </lie.v.1243><lie.v.1244>It does not lie in our power to transfer " disposable " energy at will to a rationally chosen object. The same is true in general of the apparently disposable energy which is disengaged when we have destroyed its unserviceable forms through the corrosive of reductive analysis. [ It ] can at best be applied voluntarily for only a short time. But in most cases it refuses to seize hold , for any length of time , of the possibilities rationally presented to it. Psychic energy is a very fastidious thing which insists on fulfilment of its own conditions. However much energy may be present , we can not make it serviceable until we have succeeded in finding the right gradient. [ The Problem of the Attitude-Type , " CW 7 , par. 76 ] The analytic task in such a situation is to discover the natural gradient of the person 's energy . </lie.v.1244><lie.v.1245>He was not old , or set , or dried in mangonel least.

Many women do not know that PND can occur unexpectedly after delivery and typically blame themselves , their partners or their baby for the way they feel. Some try hard to ' snap out of it ' without understanding that women with PND have little control over the way they are feeling . </lie.v.1246><lie.v.1247>The Old Testament adds that God hates a lying tongue ( Prov 6 : 16-19 , Ps. 5 : 6 ) and forbids men to lie ( Lev 19 : 11 , Pr. 14 : 5 , Pr. 30 : 6 , Zep 3 : 13 ) or to take refuge in lies ( Isa 28 : 15 , Da 11 : 27 ) .

A righteous Mormon senator from Utah discovers that Fonda has lied and vows to expose him. But he 's not the hero in the movie; Fonda is. As the president explains to the senator , we all have things in our past we 'd rather lie about. The Mormon senator proceeds to try to destroy Fonda , but ends up destroying himself when it 's revealed that he had a lie of his own he 'd been concealing : During the war , he 'd had a homosexual fling. The only one in the movie who does n't seem to be telling any lies is a reprehensible Southern senator played by Charles Laughton . </lie.v.1249><lie.v.1250>" I was incensed by Larsen 's remarks. He must not be allowed to continue with these lies " , stated Dr. Zangen to Maariv. " I was there during the fighting , and I saw close up what was happening. I know that the IDF did everything it could to prevent civilian casualties. It is clear to everyone that if the IDF had resorted to aerial bombardment or heavy artillery , we would have completed [ our mission ] in the refugee camp within half a day , without suffering any casualties on our side. We did not adopt that policy , and we took risks in the fighting , in an attempt to rescue those innocent civilians that were caught up in the battles. Anyone who says that Israel carried out a massacre is lying and inciting the Arabs. Instead of acting to bring about reconciliation and peace , Larsen is creating hatred.

The mistake was not simply continuing to lie ... and , specifically , the decision not to just lie and say that WMDs were found there ( thank you , Lewis Black , for pointing that out. ) Had they said that ... people would have believed it. Hell , there are a significant chunk of the American population who believes that we DID find WMDs even now ... and that they had both Saddam &amp;Osama 's autographs on the side of every missile.

And just because it happened on the eve of the war , that proves what the president is saying about in the months leading up to the war , that the real cause of insecurity and the threat the Iraq presented was that they had weapons of mass destruction. We ca n't explain why they may have destroyed them. Perhaps over time we will find out what drove them to do that. Perhaps it was the fear of actually being discovered , caught red-handed with the very weapons we said they had. " It actually proves the case , when you think about it , that if Iraq did , indeed , destroy some of them on the eve of war , they had them , they lied to the United Nations about them , they lied to the world about them , they lied to the United States about them , and they fooled the inspectors when it came to having them.

However , as this passage in Acts shows , there is a particular type of lie that qualifies specifically as lying to God. I think of this as lying on steroids. Often , this lie is not about hiding things that are wicked , but about misrepresenting things that appear to be good , even righteous.

That is why your parenting must go beyond addressing behavior . </lie.v.1260><lie.v.1261>Prenatal massage can be done in different ways. Expectant moms mostly lie on their sides. A newly designed pillow especially for expecting mothers is available. This pillow has deep center cutout enabling the moms to lie flat on their bellies making them relaxed and comfortable.

My mate was strongly reprimanded and never allowed near prenatal classes again , a blow he took with equanimity. But then , prenatal classes are universally quite appalling. Some superannuated member of the medical clergy shovels honeyed lies at the gathered throng , the point being to convince the women that childbirth will be a breeze , no more inconveniencing than a spot of shopping. Just follow our advice : no drugs , do n't lie down and do n't even think about a Caesarean. Then you mull this over for a bit and eat some biscuits and the other doctor or midwife stands up and tells you more utter lies. Your minge will snap back into place straight after the birth with the speed and precision of a spring-loaded man-trap; your weight will slough off within 24 hours.

There are many reasons , but it is not widely appreciated that the neocons believe in lying on principle. It is the " noble " thing for the elite to do , for the " vulgar " masses , the " herd " will become ungovernable without such lies. This is the idea of the " noble lie " practiced with such success and boldness by Scooter Libby and his co-conspirators and concocted by the political " philosopher " Leo Strauss whose teachings lie at the core of the neoconservative outlook and agenda , so much so that they are sometimes called " Leocons.

Here are some of his biggest lies [ ... ] </lie.v.1274><lie.v.1275>Sadly enough , some level of suspicion might actually be warranted from time to time. Research indicates that if you want to look for deception in your own life , the best place to start is close to home. Lovers often lie about their true feelings for each other , the feelings they have for others , their level of commitment , their whereabouts ... And people tend to tell their most serious and consequential lies to those they love ( see , what lovers lie about and secrets lovers keep ) . </lie.v.1275><lie.v.1276>Do lies serve a purpose ? Are they ever justified ? Have you seen a lie serve the truth ? Do you write a well told lie in your stories as a matter of course ? I do. I admit it. ( 2nd Chance doesn ' t lie. But I do Bwah ha ha ! ) </lie.v.1276><lie.v.1277>Clinton lied ! Which minute , which hour , which day we talking about ? Be specific here. All that a -- hole does is lie. Oh yeah , and so does his fat a -- wife ! </lie.v.1277><lie.v.1278>Hold the front page , a politician has lied ! Really , is anybody surprised ? Politics is a profession which is designed to reward liars. If you are honest you end up like Ron Paul. Let me make this easy for those who follow Clinton , Obama , McCain , Cameron or Brown : if you believe these people you will be disappointed. Mrs Clinton is simply following a family tradition . </lie.v.1278><lie.v.1279>It is common knowledge that politicians lie all the time to " protect " us. They are supposed to be honest. It 's a shame that we even have to consider a law like this. It 's a good one ! </lie.v.1279><lie.v.1280>When you have children , you know at some point that the little white lies of youth will begin to rear their ugly head. As children transition from a world where make believe and imagination are encouraged into one that is suddenly structured and seemingly unimaginative , lying may peak. Be patient with this behavior and understand that the lies may not be purposeful or intended even. Simply point out the differences between the truth and lies and ensure that your children feel safe and comfortable talking to you even when things go wrong. The younger you instill this feeling the better off you will be. Most importantly , set an example and try to be honest with your children and in your own life. Even if you are telling a vagrant you do n't have any change because you want to avoid the situation , remember that your children are watching you do that and they may not understand why it was okay for you to lie. In these instances , silence can be your best friend. Keep in mind , when it comes to children what they are not telling you - may be the biggest lie of all ! </lie.v.1280><lie.v.1281>To me , the above are lies that the government has told us and continues to tell us , and these specific lies touch home to me on so many levels. I enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it to my friends , to those who like history/government and to those who don't. This book really makes you think and I am glad I chose to read it . </lie.v.1281><lie.v.1282>Personally , the only punishment I 'd set is taking her phone away for a while. I do n't think the media is the issue ( they could have been talking about this face to face; the problem is the content , not the phone ) nor is it even the fact she lied , but she needs to know that you think she made a bad decision ( in talking about such topics via cell phone ) so she needs time off the cell to think about those things . </lie.v.1282><lie.v.1283>I think Augustine has a discussion of lying somewhere. The upshot is that saying something intending it to cause a false belief ( or a belief the speaker does not actually have ) is lying. Asserting a false proposition is neither necessary nor sufficient to constitute a lie. It doesn ' t matter if the statement is semantically true. Not that Thanks , but no thanks was semantically true . </lie.v.1283><lie.v.1284>'Cause up 'til that moment you 'd never lied about anything that mattered. You 'd never told a lie that could hurt me. And I 'd believed that you wouldn't. I 'd always thought I could depend on the fact that although you lied , you would never lie about anything that really mattered. And I 'd never expected you to tell me you loved me so it was n't even like you 'd needed to tell me and I 'd made it abundantly clear that you did n't have to tell me , that I did n't need to hear you say it. But you went ahead and you said it anyway , lied when you had no reason to about something that everything we had together could rest on. In that one moment , I hated you . </lie.v.1284><lie.v.1285>You arrived and started questioning me. You are aware of Madam Songs arrival ? I have no intention to lie to you. This is some simple concern for a good friend. I hope you can stay away from the woman who has framed you 3 years ago. Am I wrong ? </lie.v.1285><lie.v.1286>In our political movies today , it 's the politicians who tell lies who seem reprehensible. But in real life - as in Preminger 's movie - that is n't always the case. Sometimes the good guys lie . </lie.v.1286><lie.v.1287>The list of such lies Bush lied , 9/11 was an inside job , the CIA and Vice President Johnson murdered Kennedy , America is an imperialist power , Israel has brutally suppressed the Palestinians , there is global warming , CO2 is causing global warming , only nationalization of the economy will cure the present economic crises , our health crisis demands nationalization of health is endless. When these lies are imbedded in a structure of falsehoods and half-truths , and repeated often enough with conviction by the information/news gate-keepers in the major media , the public will believe them. Thus , lies become a source of power for the highest offices , for legislation , for court cases , for regulations , and for laws to control the American people . </lie.v.1287><lie.v.1288>The key problem arises due to this whole lying thing. In your standard procedural , people often lie to us , causing a second or third round of interrogation later on , with the truth coming out later. However , since Lie to Me is keen to show us how people lie , we get these odd moments when the camera zooms in on a ruffled nose , the sound dies so that we can hear only the person ' s breath , a person ' s head scratch is compared to a picture of Saddam Hussein doing the same thing , or so forth. In other words , we know when people are lying. In and of itself , that might be acceptable , and these moments clearly aim to be the scientific studies that CSI down the esophagus -style CGI also aim to be. But in order for us to see these characters ' lies happening , the actors are called upon to make silly facial expressions and to make it so patently obvious that they ' re lying. If the point is that Roth has these special skills , it ' s sad irony that anyone with a modicum of social skills will see the lie themselves. There ' s nothing special about his skills , in other words . </lie.v.1288><lie.v.1289>Its kind of difficult to pin you down. Now lets start with the title : The unit testing lie aka dynamic typing testing lie . Which lie ? whose lying ? Can you provide a link ? </lie.v.1289><lie.v.1290>I try not to lie , but I ' m also not brutally honest. If Jacob asks about a topic I don ' t think he ' s ready for , I tell him exactly that , that I ' m not ready to talk to him about it , but one day we will. Don ' t like your friend ' s rug ? It ' s not my preference , but it complements your couch nicely; I ' m glad you like it. Friend ' s husband is a jerk ? He hurts my feelings sometimes , but maybe I ' m too sensitive. Hubby doesn ' t like his belly ? Honey , you are still the handsome man I married , and being a father makes you sexier; if you don ' t like it , I ' ll support your efforts. You can still spare someone ' s feelings without lying. And I ' m trying hard for that , since Jacob has just learned about lying and we ' re trying to instill honesty. Hope it works . </lie.v.1290><lie.v.1291>" What really bothered me about my anxiety was depersonalization , that feeling like you 're not really connected to your body. I started the Anxiety Lie Program and by the time I 'd gotten to about chapter three , I was feeling more in control of my own destiny. I really like the " ringing your doorbell " technique and now I know that I really can control this. I consider the Anxiety Lie essential to getting down to the nitty-gritty detail of how anxiety lies to you and what the truth REALLY is. " </lie.v.1291><lie.v.1292>Ok , finally an Independent here. First , it is clearly a bow. To say otherwise is to be dishonest. In this respect , to come out after and lie about it becomes a problem in and of itself. Second , depending on the culture and the relationship with that country bowing may not be that bad. Here , in the U.S. , a sign of repect is a handshake , elsewhere it may be different. With that being said , however , if both leaders want to put themselves on " equal " respectful footing , they should have bowed to each other. Because Obama is the only one to have bowed it puts the king in a superior position. This is a sign of weakness , at least in the observational standpoint. Perhaps from a dimplomatic standpoint what he did was wise. That I do not know. The danger is that people make judgements from little cues like this. If , and I say IF , he is percieved as being weak and inferior because of physical cues like this , than that could put the country on a weaker platform that it may have been on otherwise . </lie.v.1292><lie.v.1293>I 'm very curious to see where the press goes from here with McCain. They 've stuck with him through all the pandering to the religious right and to Bush , even though that contradicted everything he 'd supposedly stood for. Now information indicating that he 's just another pol , perfectly willing to lie when it suits his purposes , is being waved in their faces. The big question is whether the press does a " la la la I ca n't hear you " in response , or turns on McCain with all the fury of a jilted lover. The election , and possibly the future of the country , may depend to a large extent on the outcome of this . </lie.v.1293><lie.v.1294>We have searched and searched and ca n't find a single adult who never told a lie as a child. Actually we cant ' find any adults who never lie now. Is n't it interesting how upset parents get when children have not mastered a virtue they have not mastered themselves ? We do not make this point to justify lying , but to show that children who lie are not defective or immoral. We need to deal with the reasons children lie before we can help them give up their need to lie. Usually children lie for the same reasons adults dothey feel trapped , are scared of punishment or rejection , feel threatened , or just think lying will make things easier for everyone. Often lying is a sign of low self-esteem. People think they need to make themselves look better because they do n't know they are good enough as they are . </lie.v.1294><lie.v.1295>It ' s easy to see how easy it is to lie ! Let ' s look at the most common ways we apply these good and bad lies . </lie.v.1295><lie.v.1296>Today , as a mother who has spent most of the last ten years trying to investigate my actions , I read books on psychology and infant development , searching for all the ways I can protect my girls from everything , including me. I ' m haunted by visions of them at 15 , alone in a foreign city feeling inadequate , unloved , staring at shop windows while sophisticated looking women pass by. I don ' t want my daughters to live the anguish of feeling trapped in the wrong body. I don ' t want them to ever succumb to the dismembered life of a false self. I don ' t want them ever to lie on a stretcher at an abortion clinic. Their fate depends , to a great deal , on me . </lie.v.1296><lie.v.1297>And so on. In other words , even the authors ' own document , while condemning the Bush administration in unequivocal terms , continually leaves open the possibility that Bush did not knowingly pass along false or flawed intelligence. Sympathetic readers are meant to come away believing that the authors have presented evidence that the Bush administration lied , but the authors never actually say that . </lie.v.1297><lie.v.1298>I clearly said I agreed with everything Rasta said so how is it that it seems both of you didn ' t get that ? Hummm.. Was offering other instances of why men lies as well through what I said but like I said- there aren ' t conversations only monologues..nobody wants to hear anything but themselves.. Huuuuuummmmm I guess </lie.v.1298><lie.v.1299>Lying matters , the truth matters , and the truth is that Al Gore is a liar , a huge , fat liar. It now turns out that almost no personal note , aside , or allusion Al Gore offered during the first presidential debate was n't substantively fraudulent. Al Gore does n't lie as well as Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton 's dishonesty is baked into his motherboard , as the computer geeks might say. Gore lies like his outdated processors were n't designed for it , but his software compels him to. ( Note to readers : I would list all of Gore 's lies but there is n't room here. Instead I refer you to NRO 's list of Gore lies. It is n't exhaustive by any stretch. The editors have set an extremely high bar for inclusion , but it will give you a nice sense of things. You might also see New York Times ' s woefully belated discussion of the topic . </lie.v.1299><lie.v.1300>CONTEXT : On the much publicized C-Span book expo , Al Franken exceeded his speaking time limit without challenge , alleging ( dishonestly ) that O ' Reilly lied about winning a Peabody award. During O ' Reilly ' s allotted time to defend himself , Franken interrupted saying no no no no no no , and O ' Reilly shot back as shown . </lie.v.1300><lie.v.1301>Another week , another lie from Hillary. I wonder why I 'm even writing about this because writing about Hillary lying is like writing about the temperature hitting 100 in Dallas in August. It 's just something you expect to happen ... Here 's what really happened , according to The New York Times , who proved that the Gray Lady has someone on their staff who can actually investigate a story . </lie.v.1301><lie.v.1302>" I have no objection talking about abstinence as a surefire way to prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , " Waxman said. " I do n't think we ought to lie to our children about science. Something is seriously wrong when federal tax dollars are being used to mislead kids about basic health facts. " </lie.v.1302><lie.v.1303>However , I have been lied to often by women who want relationships with me. They lie about their emotional state , about their ability to deal with a relationship , about what they want , about what makes them happy ... A few examples : </lie.v.1303><lie.v.1304>Everyone lies. Well maybe not everyone. Mother Teresa probably never lied. Perhaps that 's one qualification of sainthood : to have never lied. However , one must not condemn lying outright. We might argue , as did Episcopalian priest Joseph Fletcher , that certain situations require the bending of our ethical rules. Father Fletcher defined situation ethics as " 'situational ' or 'contextual ' or 'relative ' in the sense that actual circumstances rather than generalized norms 'form conscience ' and determine what actions ought to be taken. " According to Dr. James H. Toner , Department of Leadership and Ethics at the Air War College , " Lying is wrong. But would you lie to a Nazi if you owned a house in Warsaw in 1939 and he knocked on your door , asking if you had seen two fugitive Jews ( whom you were hiding in your basement ) ? Of course you would , for you recognize the importance of the situation , circumstances , or realities. " </lie.v.1304><lie.v.1305>This column will address the ways we often lie to others and ourselves in order to be accepted. There is no freedom there. How can there be ? If we are not free to be ourselves in the liberating life God made us for , how can we have meaning , purpose , and ultimate fulfillment in life ? We cannot. So , check back here , too . </lie.v.1305><lie.v.1306>I 'll take the kids to the park -- when the weather gets nicer With Valentine 's Day right around the corner , love 's predictably on everyones minds. The topic of trust is an important factor in all matters of the heart -- and here 's why. Men lie to women. Women lie to men. And most people agree that some lying is even necessary -- to avoid petty squabbles and to grease the wheels of a relationship . </lie.v.1306><lie.v.1307>Leviticus 19 : 20 " 'If a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave girl , pledged to be married to another man , and not ransomed , or given her freedom; they shall be punished.

We didn ' t just go to war because of lies. We live in a society where all discourse is crippled by a growing culture of lying. Despite the fact that it ' s now common knowledge that top Bush administration officials lied us into a catastrophic war , they ' ve faced no consequences. There ' s not even any serious national discourse on impeachment even though lying to Congress just once is a crime. Then there are all the political campaigns where politicians compulsively lie. They never have to answer for their lies; they ' re expected to lie. The only consequence is that most of us give up on voting since all we really ever accomplish by voting is to make fools of ourselves by voting for liars . </lie.v.1309><lie.v.1310>Q16 : 106 If a Muslim is compelled to disbelief , do it. And Muhammad even took the pain to explain what he considered " compelling " : ( please see " Compelled to Lie " for more details ) . This verse does not mention when being " under fear of death " or " if a knife is put to your neck " . This verse opens the door to lying , since you can deny faith , you can deny less important things . </lie.v.1310><lie.v.1311>Like the song says , you ca n't hide those lying eyes. Indeed , all but the hardened liar experience symptoms of nervous system arousal when telling a lie.

Only thing I do not do anymore , is having candles on the birthday cake - the fire alarm would go off ! Why are we really so obsessed with age ? Do we really have to know the age of every person you meet , talk to , watch on Tv/the movies or read about ? ? What about the newspapers ? Are your papers the same as here ( Sweden ) - when writing about somebody , it ' s always Mr So-So , aged XX or Mrs XX , aged XX  Why is that ?

Social psychology and developmental psychology are concerned with the theory of mind , which people employ to simulate another 's reaction to their story and determine if a lie will be believable. The most commonly cited milestone , what is known as Machiavellian intelligence , is at the age of about four and a half years , when children begin to be able to lie convincingly. Before this , they seem simply unable to comprehend why others do n't see the same view of events that they do and seem to assume that there is only one point of view , which is their own . </lie.v.1315><lie.v.1316>I would not ask a loved one or a friend to take a lie detector test ! !

An obstetrician with a team of students came in; he pushed my hospital gown up and stuck two fingers in my vagina. " Hmmm. " He had a student do the same; " vertex ( head down ) and two centimeters dilated " , she said. The obstetrician disagreed; he gave my cervix a REAL good feel and roughly twisted my uterus around. " You have a breech here. " I wept ! I had strangers casually touching my most secret parts; my husband was gone; I was hungry. The student asked if she could check me again , in the " interest of science " . I annoyed everyone in the room with more weeping. The doctor told me the baby was in a transverse lie ( lying sideways ) . </lie.v.1318><lie.v.1319>Planned Parenthood and abortion proponents lied about the scientific fact that abortion takes the life of a human being. For years abortion proponents have said that " no one really knows " if we 're talking about a child in the womb. Yet in 1965 , Planned Parenthood published a pamphlet which stated : " An abortion kills the life of a baby after it has begun. " Planned Parenthood went on to operate the nation 's largest chain of abortion clinics , yet admitted the truth again during a weak moment on the Phil Donahue show , when former director , Faye Wattleton responded to the statement : " It 's not a frog or a ferret that 's being killed. It 's a baby , " with " I am fully aware of that. I am fully aware of that.

In particular , they use lay instead of lie and laying instead of lying : Im going to lay out in the sun. He is laying down. The American Heritage Book of English Usage asks us to be tolerant of such misuses in informal speech. The editors write , What if Bob Dylan , in a fit of zeal for correctness , had written Lie , Lady , Lie / Lie across my big brass bed ? Somehow its hard to imagine the lady sticking around ( 114 ) . </lie.v.1321><lie.v.1322>As part of his expansion plans , in 1684 Carpenter purchased 5 , 000 acres in what is now known as Montgomery County , 4 , 200 of which lie within what is now Horsham Township. The delineation of the land was determined by William Penn 's engineers , and they projected parallel lines , at intervals of a mile and a half and extending northwesterly direction from settlements along the Delaware. These acted not only as base lines for the measurements of land grants , but as courses for future highways , which can be seen today. After a number of years ' delay , his purchase was finally ratified by William Penn 's Board of Property in 1702. Between 1708-1714 ( the year of his death ) , he disposed of some 2 , 500 acres at a price of between eight to ten shillings an acre. Given that he had probably paid only £ 100 for the whole 5 , 000 acres in the first place , his had been a canny investment . </lie.v.1322><lie.v.1323>There are hundreds , if not thousands of reasons that people lie. We all have lied at times; maybe we tell " white lies , " or maybe we simply leave out small portions of the truth every now and then. Or maybe we just exaggerate-has your 3-pound bass ever become a 10-pound bass ? Lying usually begins around the age of 4 or 5 when we realize we can manipulate words to get what we want. This usually is not meant to be malevolent , but often begins as just " testing the waters " to find out what we can get away with. Most of us grow out of this and learn to tell the truth in everyday situations , but not everyone. While most of us may not understand liars and why they lie , to them it may seem normal , or they may not even know they are doing it . </lie.v.1323><lie.v.1324>A man will lie to his wife if he had an affair because she may leave or divorce him.

" </lie.v.1326><lie.v.1327>The reasons politicians lie is because the public does n't want to hear the truth. People want to hear what they want to hear. When two candidates are running and one of the tells the truth and the other says what the public wants to hear , the one who says what the public wants to hear wins the election. Thus , and there are exceptions to this , if you want to win an election , you better start lying , because the guy who 's telling you the truth does n't have a chance . </lie.v.1327><lie.v.1328>I do try not to lie but its hard. Sometimes I just dont want to hurt someone ' s feelings. Like when my mom calls and I hit the ignore button.

This feeling may be permanent , and if you ever confess the truth , you may find that it would have been better to never lie in the first place . </lie.v.1329><lie.v.1330>The " telling lies " bit comes from all directions. Karchy lies to win a radio contest that gets him a meeting with Magic -- Magic is impressed by Karchy 's gall and hires him to be the DJ 's flunky. Magic -- who 's prone to saying things like , " You 're looking slick , Slick " -- gives Karchy enough lessons in being oily that Karchy is able to transform himself , awkwardly and uncomfortably , from a sweet kid to a sleazeball for his first date with Diney. Karchy 's " lie " about the kind of guy he is does n't sit well with either of them -- she , natch , prefers the sweet kid he was , and he just ca n't sustain Magic-brand scumminess. Still , desperate to impress Magic , Karchy lies about all the things he 's done -- when Magic asks if he 's ever done anything from eat filet mignon to have sex , Karchy answer invariably is " Sure , lotsa times. " </lie.v.1330><lie.v.1331>I ca n't help but be outraged by the deceitful campaign that McCain and Palin are running. I am outraged not only because it is intensely misleading , but because it is taking advantage of the lower and middle class. Those making the least in our society are the ones likely to not have home internet , likely to be the least educated among our society and likely to have the least resources to fact-check each of McCain 's statements. And these are the people McCain is successfully preying upon to lure additional votes at the stake of their own economic and social futures. If it is illegal to pay off American voters in order to secure a following then so too should it be illegal to lie to an entire sector of our society that lacks the means to identify the difference between truth and falsity. In a nation where we so value our right to vote , McCain and Palin with their lies , are almost stripping that right from those they are able to deceive with their campaign tactics.

( I say " we " for politeness ' sake. ) In the past , alteration , change , any becoming at all , were taken as proof of mere appearance , as an indication that there must be something which led us astray. Today , in contrast , precisely insofar as the prejudice of reason forces us to posit unity , identity , permanence , substance , cause , thinghood , being , we see ourselves somehow caught in error , compelled into error so certain are we , on the basis of rigorous examination , that this is where the error lies . </lie.v.1332><lie.v.1333>-- Lots and lots of dialogue about lies and lying , and about how it 's not working any more.

The lies of Satan beget the lies of sinners. So Paul says , " Put off that old nature put off lying and put on the new nature the nature created by God and marked by righteousness and holiness that come not from Satanic deceit but from the truth " ( v. 24 ) . </lie.v.1334><lie.v.1335>In America , the press is curiously shy , even embarrassed when faced with the need to use some form of the verb 'to lie ' even now when public tolerance for the unexplained and for the unbelievable explanation is wearing thin. We seem to drop quickly into a defensive crouch , when even , as now , we are accused of abusing our power by not accepting explanations which often defy acceptance. We are , too often , close enough to the Establishment ourselves to be [ un ] comfortable in calling a lie , a lie. I am not talking about little lies as in Vice-Admiral Poindexter asked to give up his job as National Security Adviser to return to active duty in the Navy. Little lies as in we did not trade the Soviet spy TK Sakharov for the American journalist Nick Danilov.

But a method employed by Christians which had not been used by their Muslim predecessors is of importance to us here. This is the attempt to use the Buddhist and Hindu texts themselves as a critique of Indian religions. For this purpose many missionaries studied Pali and Sanskrit in their attempt to refute Buddhism , Hinduism , Jainism , etc. ( 2 ) In general this tactic has not been very successful because compared to their own Bible the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures were far less vulnerable. Nonetheless the combing of these texts either to distort their meaning or to use them to show that these religions hold positions that are not compatible with what is currently considered fashionable , has indeed continued. This activity is usually presented as an ecumenical exercise in inter-religious dialogue , but the " evangelical " objective that lies behind them is very often plain to see . </lie.v.1340><lie.v.1341>But Dr. Mark George , the genial neurologist and psychiatrist who let me lie in his scanner and be grilled by his computer , said he does n't see a privacy problem with the technology . </lie.v.1341><lie.v.1342> There are all kinds of potential applications for this research , from our daily lives to settings like police interrogations , security checks in airports and courtrooms , says Dr. Porter.

They have got it exactly and diametrically wrong. The discrimination and the deprivation , the sense of alarm and resentment , lies not with the immigrant population but with those among whom they have come and are still coming.

They divide lies into many different categories and choose differing categories and place differing emphasis on their categories. Much like any of us they have a set of ideas about lies which ones we should be angry about , which ones we feel we should expect , and which ones we will divorce over. We all know what lies are and we all frown on them to a certain degree , but we all find a regular use and excuse for them. For the most part this book is all about those uses.

Oh , indeed they asked questions but in every case , they just asked for more lies from the liars !

No word on whether simply telling the truth counted as a tactic , although it was further noted that 8 out of 10 parents were willing to lie to their children to protect them from the truth. The upshot ? By the time the kids were eight they stopped believing the lies of their parents !

We learn to lie and to detect deceit as a developmental task. Dr. Ford s philosophy is that lying is part of the bridge between one s internal world ( beliefs , perceptions , expectations , fantasies ) and one s external world ( reality ) .

Many writers used to deplore the selfish opportunism , competitive jealousy , and disregard for others which they discerned in individual conduct outside the bond of family , clan , and personal relations. It is a perennially fascinating paradox - this contrast , to the Western way of thinking , between loyalty to family and friends and disregard of the public interest , between the most meticulous sense of responsibility , when responsibility was customarily expected and clearly undertaken , and a callous irresponsibility regarding the suffering of strangers or public evils that concerned no one in particular . </lie.v.1383><lie.v.1384>I reminded the girls that we shouldn ' t tell lies even when they ' ll get us out of trouble.

Rahab of Jericho was under no oath in Jehovah 's name to tell the facts to the king 's officers and hence was not a false swearer or a false witness. " A faithful witness will not lie; but a false witness uttereth lies. " ( Prov. 14 : 5 , AS ) A faithful witness does not love a false oath. So he tells the truth as he swore to do. What he does speak will be the truth. If he speaks at all he will tell the truth. To the extent that he chooses to talk he will state the truth. If for conscientious reasons he refuses to tell everything he will be willing to suffer the consequences if he be judged deserving of a penalty.

According to Kyle Pruett , parents should let go of the small lies go but calmly and briefly let them know you are aware of them. Blaming and punishing a child for small lies breaks the trust between you and your child. Similarly , grilling a child about details makes your child close up or lie more rathern than disclose the facts. During the course of normal conversation , occasionally discuss a story of someone who lied and how and why it bothered you. Then add that your family 's values and discuss that you would never expect that from anybody in the family or how you would have handled the situation differently.

It has been proven that they lied directly to the media for the purpose of manipulating reporters into libeling people who were completely innocent.

As my eyes increasingly opened to the events of the natural world , I began to perceive the key place aspen holds in supporting and sustaining the biodiversity of our region. Aspen has always held a special place in my perception; but since beginning my nature journals , I 've come to appreciate more fully its great array of ecological roles. Aspen 's importance , to the montane ecosystem as a whole and to the myriad of creatures who turn the groves into microhabitats , is immeasurable. My interest lies not only with aspen 's interaction with other species , but with its own biology.

It did n't provide a pretext for aggression , as did the government 's manipulation of intelligence regarding the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

A close look at their reviews indicate a bias against looking at the reality of the role of lies in society. You may chose for yourself , but I found in this book , pieces of wisdom worth considering. The author describes the various ways and methods people lie. He includes sections on everything from little white lies , to social lies , to " whoppers " . Everyone says that lying is wrong , but when we say that lying is bad and hurtful and that we would never intentionally tell a lie , are we really deceiving anyone ? In this wise and insightful book , David Nyberg exposes the tacit truth underneath our collective pretense and reveals that an occasional lie can be helpful , healthy , creative , and , in some situations , even downright moral.

I do not do so from the perspective of a moralist. While the moral consequences of lying are certainly a worthy subject for a book , they are not the subject of this one. Parents have been warning children against lying for millennia , with merely mixed success at best. Most people , like most presidents , know that lying is wrong , but most people do it anyway. The argument has certainly failed to convince most postwar U.S. presidents.

Although concern had been expressed by experts as early as the 1960s about the effectiveness of the conventional system of institutionalized rehabilitation services , leading to the introduction of community-based rehabilitation ( CBR ) as an alternative , the situation has been slow to improve. For most women with disabilities , their only hope for some degree of rehabilitation lies in CBR reaching them where they are , with the active involvement and support of their families and communities. While certain rehabilitation services requiring specific technology or skills will still need to be based in the cities , this is not the case for many essential types of assistance. For example , training in basic skills such as self-care ( eating , drinking , dressing and personal hygiene ) and mobility for visually-impaired women is better done in the environment of the home. Such assistance can make a highly significant contribution to the development of the self-reliance and dignity of a woman with a disability . </lie.v.1509><lie.v.1510>People lie.

The real estate professional sometimes lies when they puff a property. A bit of comparison shopping will usually take care of that issue. Sometimes lies happen when somebody tries to tell you what a house is worth. The best the professional can do is demonstrate what similar houses have been selling for recently. While that is a very reasonable guide to worth , the fact is , worth is decided by the buyer and seller agreeing about a price. Sometimes the professional will tell you about things that may happen , or not tell you. Sometimes they do not know , because there is more to know today than ever before.

In stead they cover up the body by wearing several layers of clothes and socks , covering the head with a scarf or a piece of cloth , even when the room is quite warm.

Take a look at Milbank 's gingerly worded page-one October 22 , 02 Washington Post story if you doubt me. To cite just two particularly egregious examples , Bush tried to frighten Americans by claiming that Iraq possesses a fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used " for missions targeting the United States. " Previously he insisted that a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency revealed the Iraqis to be " six months away from developing a weapon. " Both of these statements are false , but they are working. Nearly three-quarters of Americans surveyed think that Saddam is currently helping Al Qaeda; 71 percent think it is likely he was personally involved in the 9/11 attacks . </lie.v.1521><lie.v.1522>Charitable folks are still inclined to believe that Bush lied only to protect the great unwashed from dealing with imperial realities.

What Rahab did in assisting the spies to escape ( viz. , she lied ) was wrong , and consequently , it is nowhere praised in the Scriptures. Those who use the case of Rahab to justify lying , simply " err not knowing the Scriptures , or the power of God " ( Matthew 22 : 29 ) . Neither Hebrews 11 : 31 nor James 2 : 25 commend Rahab for lying. Instead , she is commended for the faith she exercised in believing God.

I do n't think he was talking about religion itself as much as about the ( frequently dogmatic ) institution of religion. I think spirituality can indeed be a driving force and prompt us to be " good " ( even though the same could be said of a humanistic approach to life ) , the problem lies in the fact that 1 ) religious leaders or officials often " interpret " holy texts to their benefit and 2 ) people who are convinced they hold the Truth tend to be narrow-minded because they think they 're on the right path and everybody who disagrees is on a highway to hell. Thinking you 're one of the chosen few or " righteous " does n't help you become more tolerant. I spent many years in a Catholic school and I do agree that there is a lot of good to be found in the Gospels and Jesus was truly an example of tolerance.

All groupings of bourgeois society , including the anarchists , utilize its aid in the struggle against the proletarian revolution. At the same time the petty bourgeois democrats attempt , at least to the extent of fifty percent , to cast the repulsiveness of the crimes of its Moscow ally upon the indomitable revolutionary minority. Herein lies the sense of the now stylish dictum : Trotskyism and Stalinism are one and the same.

Sometimes called the prostitute effect , it says that a very small number of women have an extremely large number of partners. If these women are n't sampled , the statistics are thrown off. I would add that the promiscuous women would n't necessarily have to be prostitutes. There are probably a fair number of ordinary women who have large numbers of partners. My guess is that these women are usually dysfunctional in some way ( sexually abused , alcoholic , etc. ) I would imagine that these dysfunctional women , hoping to pass for normal , would be inclined to lie on surveys. I speak from personal experience : I 'm a male with a dozen sexual partners. These women have averaged about 20 partners apiece. Nearly all of those partners were concentrated in a single women with over 200 partners , with most of the remainder in a second woman with 40 partners. Six of the women had two or fewer partners.

As examples , he uses four key lies told by presidents in the postwar era. From FDR at Yalta to LBJ in Vietnam , and from JFK in Cuba to Ronald Reagan in Central America , Alterman shows how attempts to mislead the American people ended up haunting their authors and dooming the very policies they were meant to advance.

We can discuss the relative merits of so many good guys surviving the final showdown or the incredibly bizarre and out-of-character scene with Adama openly mocking Boomer as a young Raptor pilot in training ( a scene in which Adama appears to be drunk while on duty ) . We can pick over the various character arcs that seemed to be forgotten or dismissed , but at the center of the failure that was BsG ' s finale lies the this fact : when Galactica reached this new and untrammeled Earth , the show became a stranger to itself and its fans; it stopped honoring the core narrative principles that made the series so compelling and it delivered a kidney punch to its reputation as a serious work of science fiction . </lie.v.1618><lie.v.1619>Herein lies one of the reasons for the prohibitions and the difficulties ( to be discussed at length in Chapter 4 ) designed to dissuade the people from critical intervention in reality.

From Joseph Smith 's denial of having more than one wife , to polygamous Mormon missionaries telling European investigators that reports about polygamy in Utah were lies put out by " anti-Mormons " and disgruntled ex-members , to Gordon B. Hinckley 's dishonest equivocation on national television over Mormon doctrine , Mormonism 's history seems replete with examples of lying. Common members see such examples as situations where lying is justified. For the Mormon , loyalty and the welfare of the church are more important than the principle of honesty , and plausible denials and deception by omission are warranted by an opportunity to have the Mormon organization seen in the best possible light. This is part of the larger package of things that lead many to describe Mormonism as a cult.

It is purposefully placed in front of the priest as he leaves the sacristy to celebrate Mass , a permanent reminder to him that he is called to give himself entirely to God and be a servant to His people , and woe to the priest who selfishly withholds from his promise ! The Altar of the Lie is so called because of its mosaic altarpiece. It shows the sacrilegious fraud committed by Ananias and his wife Sapphira , who lied to St. Peter about the price of a field sold by them , and were therefore immediately struck dead.

Rape Relief submits that the political aspect of Rape Relief lies at its " very heart " and " colours all its activities and programs.

Like the role of a teacher in Caldwell , the role of a Rape Relief volunteer is fundamental to Rape Relief 's work. The work requires volunteers not only to be committed to upholding certain political views , but also to have the life-long experience of being treated as a girl and woman. In this way , Rape Relief is distinct from other volunteer organizations , focusing on , for example , AIDS awareness or children 's poverty.

Yes , it 's true , moderators like host Tim Russert are supposed to inform the audience with facts when lies like this are told - but as we all know , Timmeh is the one who helps make sure the panel is stacked , and he 's not about to embarrass his right-wing friends when they use his esteemed show to mislead the public . </lie.v.1673><lie.v.1674>is there a point to be made here ? what difference does it make if he lied or not ? the Republican Party is not participating in the governing of the country.your time would be better spent criticizing your own Republican congress people for not attempting to solve the countries problems . </lie.v.1674><lie.v.1675>No I don ' t lie about my age.

When you sense yourself crafting a lie , take a pause. Ask your " audience " if you might take a moment to consider the issue or question at hand , if you need time to collect your thoughts. During this thinking time , review the question or comment , your motivations and intentions . </lie.v.1676><lie.v.1677>But that ' s not how science works.

People are hurt more by lies and misunderstandings than anything else. People lie for one purpose their own self-interest. People will lie if it gets them what they want and if it worked in the past , they will keep doing it until it no longer works and they simply move on to a new strategy . </lie.v.1678><lie.v.1679>Trust and honesty are essential for healthy relationships. Being lied to feels like a double betrayal the behaviour that was lied about and the lie itself. Being lied to makes us feel disrespected and vulnerable. To be intentionally told that something is other than what it is feels like an assault on our judgement , perception , and ability to assess our world. Lying is a hostile act , withholding the facts of reality to someone who has a right to them . </lie.v.1679><lie.v.1680>And like most addictive behaviors , compulsive lying is hard for the person involved to see , but it hurts those who are around it.

At 42 , kissing a 17 y/o intern in the mens room surely would violate that. Obviously , his friends knew he was teetering on the edge because he was warned to stay away from the teen. He did n't lie just once; he had a whole campaign strategy to paint his opponent as the liar , accusing him of playing into stereotypes of gays , and painting himself as the one with more integrity than implied by the accusation ( which , turned out to be true. ) Then he asked the teen to lie , and had a political associate coach the teen on how to lie.

God forbids us to lie because he does n't want us to do the devil 's dirty work. For you see , liars and deceivers are not free. They are the toilet cleaners , the gutter sweepers , the lackeys and slaves of Satan. People who tell lies and practice deceit are doing Satan 's dirty work for him. They make life for Satan easy. They advance his purpose against God. And they gain nothing. Lies achieve nothing worthwhile. Liars are losers. It sucks your life away . </lie.v.1684><lie.v.1685>" The best journalists today are the best lie detectors. Not just the relentless skeptics who sort of automatically disbelieve everything , but the reporters who instinctively are alert to the possibility that their sources do n't know what they are talking about , who are leaving out vital details that would tend to discredit their stories or they are deliberately lying . </lie.v.1685><lie.v.1686>" I told my girl my dog died to get out of going on a date with her.

The commission alleged that Paterson paid for the tickets only after media inquiries brought them to the publics attention , and then provided the Yankees with a backdated check in an attempt to cover his intent.

It is around age 5 or 6 that children tell lies to avoid punishment or having to do something they don ' t want. All parents have heard their child state clearly they have brushed their teeth , only to find a dry toothbrush in the holder. It is when this habit continues into adolescence that there may be another disorder assigned to it , since at this age young adults begin to truly understand the consequences of lying . </lie.v.1697><lie.v.1698>I was recently reading an interesting post by Gayla McCord on the 10 Lies Men Tell , and it got me thinking about why men tell lies to begin with. It ' s an important question. I know you want to be able to identify if a man is lying to you , but even more important , is that you want to know why would a man want to lie in the first place ? That is the question you want to answer . </lie.v.1698><lie.v.1699>Did you know that Superman comic books were created by jews to counter the rise of those evil 'nazis ' ? Because everybody knows Hitler was the author of the " Big Lie " . The jews needed a fictional hero , because they did n't have the credibility in real life to be a hero themselves. This is the truth of how jews lie. Most educated Americans think they 're sophisticated enough to distinguish jewish propaganda lies from the truth. The jews told us Hitler said , " Tell people big lies often enough and they 'll believe it. " We 've heard this propaganda a million times , right ? What we have n't been told is what Hitler actually said in Mein Kampf. In fact , the opposite of what jews said was true. Far from advocating the use of the " Big Lie " , Hitler had warned his people that the jews use this " Big Lie " technique , and that the German people should be cautious in accepting the word of a jew . </lie.v.1699><lie.v.1700>More likely , Safire probably meant it in the sense of a birth defect , like a cleft palate.

To determine the varying degrees of lying terribleness , context matters. For example , murdering 50 people and then saying in court that you never killed anyone is a very bad lie. On the other hand , it 's pretty innocuous when married partners tell each other that they just had great sex when it was n't that great . </lie.v.1702><lie.v.1703>'Cause that makes me mad and I get shook up as a man can beGetting shook up in this fashion is unpleasant , and not just for the person who 's being lied to : a verse later , Berry explains that the lies make him " evil as a man can be.

It 's all a question of where the lie 's effect eventually lands . </lie.v.1703><lie.v.1704>Now if you can find a place in the gospels where Jesus is faced with a situation like the few where I said it would be right to lie , and it 's not something his miraculous abilities would allow him to deal with differently , then maybe I 'll concede that the example of Jesus is relevant. Since I do n't see him encountering such situations in the gospels , we ca n't very well know what he would have done. As it stands , the only examples of righteous lies in the Bible are not Jesus ' lies , because he was n't faced with those situations.

When none of the churches had instruments because they were informed from the Bible and all recorded history and SOME imposed instruments that meats the test of heresy or sectarianism. When then imposed the organ over the objections of J.W.McGarvey and refused to let him preach the truth , they claimed that he became sectarian when he left the church.

He got a lot of coverage showing that the story originating with a soldier was accurate. Do you think Obama put an investigative team on the story to make sure it was " vetted " or did they take this soldier 's word ? Clinton was told this story by a deputy sheriff with no reason to lie and apparently , someone in her camp still tried to confirm it but had no hospital/family names , etc. But as your NYT article points out , two newspapers with real journalists reported on the story this week. Neither of them questioned the veracity of the story. That is , the media did n't " vet " it either . </lie.v.1713><lie.v.1714>Senator Hillary Clinton told the story as it was told to her and it probably was true.

Whether the White House can squash this story remains to be seen , but it 's out there , and is certainly getting coverage. The only shame is that all the many , many other egregious lies and scandalous behavior and actions of the White House have been swept under the rug to this point.

From what I 've read about Mr. Odom , I think he is very smart and capable. He is the Executive Director of the American Liberty Alliance. I 'm skeptical that he really believes in his heart that there is anything sinister going on with the White House 's request for rumor alerts. I 'm just a little disgusted with Senator Cornyn , Eric Odom , and anyone else who is determined to seize on something so innocent and exploit it to further inflame the " birthers " and tea party patriots who appear to be somewhat unhinged and are proud of it.

We therefore do not understand why the original followers of Yeshua believed very differently than we do today. We do not understand why the Christian world is divided into an uncountable number of opposing sects and opinions. We do not understand why our schools are failing -- why our children do not learn -- why the moral core of our society has degenerated. We fail to perceive that because we look at life through the vision of Constantine , Justinian , Theodora , Darwin , Marx , and a whole host of other cultural and worldly philosophers , that our walk with the Lord remains incomplete . </lie.v.1720><lie.v.1721>For Gigi , the heroine of Where Secrets Lie , and her best friends , the goal for the attractive young urban girl is wealth and a man , with an added bonus if the two come together.

Gigi finds herself scoring on both counts , but when her husband 's wealth throws her into a new social class she finds herself grasping for the person she used to be.

' A certain starveling practitioner of Algiers , Dr. R. , was ill-advised enough to entertain this man and to exhibit him in public at Algiers in a white mantle to play the ghost before spectators. That is the most that had been said against the experiments at the Villa Carmen. The general public blinded by ignoble newspaper tales , imagined that the fraud had been exposed. All that was really proved was that an Arab thief could lie impudently , that he could put on a sheet , could appear thus on a stage and could get a doctor to endorse his lies. It is averred also that Marthe confessed fraud to an Algerian lawyer who took a pseudonym.

Military tactics sometimes call for the planting of false information for enemies to retrieve and misinterpret - 'leaked ' information about their next target , for instance.

" The reduction in gray matter predisposes them to lie in the first place , " he says. The researchers ' findings could eventually be used in making diagnoses of behavioral problems and might have applications in the criminal-justice system. And , of course , in politics ! </lie.v.1729><lie.v.1730>Morals have little to do with truth. They are simply rules , or guides that man has created to live in harmony with his perceived image of the truth. When does lying hurt ? When it denies who you see yourself to be , and does not allow others access to the truth , so that they can freely make a choice about how they see themselves. Lies hurt and do not work when they deny access. Lies hurt because they create judgments , about others. Judgment is never truth. When you hold back the truth you deny yourself and the other access. Because your very evolution depends on access , you deny your growth and the growth of the other. The reason ' s for lying are many , they are not right or wrong. They simple don ' t work on a spiritual level for either. When you lie , you always hurt yourself first , and then the one that you are lying to. Self denial always comes first and denial of the others existence follows. Denial is really confirmation of an awareness. You can not deny a lie unless you know the truth first. A lie repeated often enough becomes your new truth . </lie.v.1730><lie.v.1731>I do not understand why CNN initiated an anti-Clinton campaign. CNN only reports stories pro-Obama and con-Clinton.

This gives reason why Cheny denied handing over information about Enron 's role in energy policy and why the GAO ( General Accounting Office ) will attempt to sue Dick Cheney to make him reveal the list of officials from Enron and other companies who met with President Bush 's energy task force. Perhaps the tip of the iceberg remains legal but who knows what lies beneath ? And when you lie about the tip , there could very well lurk illegalities below.

And the results can be surprising , even disturbing. For instance , we have based our society on the assumption that deciding to lie or to tell the truth is within our conscious control. But Harvard ' s Joshua Greene and Joseph Paxton say this assumption may be flawed and are probing whether honesty may instead be the result of controlling a desire to lie ( a conscious process ) or of not feeling the temptation to lie in the first place ( an automatic process ) . When we are honest , are we honest because we actively force ourselves to be ? Or are we honest because it flows naturally ? Greene asks . </lie.v.1757><lie.v.1758>Jeremiah lies in Jer 38 : 24-27 , but it 's at the command of his king.

Maybe it 's to protect his own life , maybe the king 's , maybe something greater. The passage does n't explain Jeremiah 's motives. More importantly , it does n't say whether his lie was wrong or the right thing to do in the circumstances. I ca n't even detect a contextual sense as in other passages , e.g. that he did this and it went well for him or that he did this and had negative consequences. The point of the passage seems to be about Zedekiah and what led to this situation , not about whether what Jeremiah did in the situation caused by it was the right thing to do in that situation . </lie.v.1758><lie.v.1759>1854 July 19 Sailed for Bomarsund on Aland Island , in company with many other ships.

They ' ll lie about their intention to have a home birth ( which well-informed women know places them higher up on the waiting list ) . And from time to time , they ' ll fudge their due dates. There are months in the year that you ' re more likely to get a midwife , says Parra. December is really difficult because of the holidays.

Alongside changes in popular and learned culture , legal and political systems , and economic trends , the conflicts between rival religious faiths and their suspicion of any possible deviation played their part , but no special responsibility lies with Lutheran teachings. Protestants had differing views about witches , as did Catholics. Luther believed in witches , but not in the more fanciful aspects of folklore , like flying on broomsticks. He did contrast the witches ' union with the Devil to the Protestant ideal of womanly obedience in marriage. At the other extreme the Lutheran Johannes Weyer was one of the first to argue , in 1560 , that witches were really harmless but deranged. Such views eventually won through , but not until a long time after they were published . </lie.v.1773><lie.v.1774>I see habitual lying about small stuff as quite erosive , because of my experiences , and this is one of the reasons I do n't lie.

Older trees show lines of charred bark along their lower trunks , and burned aspen logs lie decaying in the wake of a fire that swept through several years ago. Human intervention prevented the fire from spreading far or afflicting many conifer trees , but the few thin barked aspens interspersed with fir and spruce were more vulnerable and suffered heavy damage. Now surveying the exuberant growth of the young ramets , I gain a deeper understanding of the aspen growth cycle. Fire is essential to the health and rejuvenation of a grove burning away dead undergrowth , over-mature ramets , and conifer branches that shade out the sun. Fire provides a form of renovation , a return to the beginning. Without fire , an aspen grove becomes stagnant and over-mature; the shade of the tallest tree eliminates the possibility of any new growth. The roots grow dormant under the shade of evergreens. Yet with the removal of older growth , the resilient young suckers continue the life cycle . </lie.v.1791><lie.v.1792>With regard to the meanings of the hadeeth and reports on this topic , they discourage speaking about everything that one hears. For usually a person will hear both true things and lies , so if he were to speak of everything that he hears , he would be lying , by telling of something that did not happen. We have stated above the view of the people of truth : that lying means telling of something in a manner other than the way it happened. It is not conditional upon it being done deliberately , but its being done deliberately is a condition of it being a sin. And Allah knows best. </lie.v.1792><lie.v.1793>German philosopher and ethicist Immanuel Kant also rejected all lying even though lying might lead to good consequences because Kant rejected consequentialism itself. Kant did this on the basis of his notion of the status of human rationality and his view that rationality is directly connected with human dignity. To lie to a person , Kant claimed , is to offend against that person ' s rationality and dignity and also to offend against the rationality and dignity of the one giving out the lie. Thus a lie is always wrong in Kant 's view even though it may seem to lead to good consequences. In Doctrine of Virtue Kant wrote , By a lie a man throws away and , as it were , annihilates his dignity as a man. </lie.v.1793><lie.v.1794>Typical was Kate Michelman , president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.

That tactic alone has proven to recover nearly 60 percent more information than accusatory style tactic. It is a technique that is least likely to contaminate and alienate any witnesses or victims during their interviews. It also assists cooperative victims and witnesses in recalling more critical details. At the same time if the subject decides to lie during their statement , there are generally many more lies disclosed making it easier for the interrogator to develop leads as well as impeach any false statements made by the subject. A narrative-based interview of a suspect also dramatically reduces the possibility of a false confession because of it 's non-coercive nature. Also by using a narrative-based interview , the interrogator does n't have to reveal much of his case information if in fact he does reveal anything at all . </lie.v.1798><lie.v.1799>Detecting lies and deceit : the psychology of lying and the implications for professional practice ( Book , 2000 ) [ WorldCat.org ] </lie.v.1799><lie.v.1800>According to the addressee condition of the most common definition of lying , lying requires that a person make an untruthful statement to another person.

If A pretends to be talking to another person on the phone , and makes the untruthful statement to no one , The pick-up is tomorrow at 6 : 00 p.m. , with the intention that eavesdropping B believes that statement to be true , then A is not lying , even if A is attempting to deceive.

It is possible for a person to lie by sending an untruthful e-mail to everyone on a mailing list , or by publishing an untruthful report about an event ( Kant LE , 203 ) , or by making an untruthful statement on a tax return , or by making an untruthful claim in a magazine advertisement or a television commercial . </lie.v.1800><lie.v.1801>You can probably ignore the scolding , co-dependent tone in these responses.

But thinking about it practically instead of morally : you can only directly change your own behavior , not his. If your husband believes that white lies are better than telling the truth about petty mistakes ( or worse , as in the cases I 've picked out above , petty non-mistakes ! ) , what changes in your behavior will convince him that lies are worse than he thinks or that the truth is better than he fears ? </lie.v.1801><lie.v.1802>Lets see if Pennsylvania state has there head in the sand.

I 'd like to think that most people are honest , and if anything , my past experiences with liars , ( whom , by the way , I no longer have anything to do with ) have enabled me to see through a liar early on , so that I do n't get burned , and can associate with people who are worthwhile . </lie.v.1806><lie.v.1807>When we get to the " bottom line " , many parents want to know if they should punish a child for lying , and if so how. Recall that one of the main motivators of lying is fear. Many children choose to lie because it seems the lesser of two evils , and they imagine they could get away with it. In a sense , lying is punishment-avoidant behaviour. The dilemma regarding punishment for lying is that the parent may risk reinforcing fear , thus increasing the likelihood of lying in the future , rather than decreasing it ! </lie.v.1807><lie.v.1808>I understand you exactly.

This kind of revamping of our form of government not only affects me , but can have devastating effects on the future of our country. , </lie.v.1863><lie.v.1864> She ' s lying to you , Riley.

Is it so hard to believe that she lied to you , too ? </lie.v.1864><lie.v.1865>The development and liberation of the male and female gametes are steps preparatory to their union through the process of fertilization. Random movements first bring some spermatozoa into contact with follicle cells adhering to the secondary oocyte , which still lies high in the uterine tube. The sperm then propel themselves past the follicle cells and attach to the surface of the gelatinous zona pellucida enclosing the oocyte. Some sperm heads successfully penetrate this capsule by means of an enzyme they secrete , hyaluronidase , but only one sperm makes contact with the cell membrane and cytoplasm of the oocyte and proceeds farther. This is because the invading sperm head releases a substance that initiates surface changes in the oocyte cytoplasm that other competitors can not master . </lie.v.1865><lie.v.1866>and they may lie as a coping mechanism.

However , in the interests of simply giving a brief listing of claims that I consider to be lies , I will ignore this distinction between obvious and probable lies , leaving it to readers , if they wish , to look up the discussion in The 9/11 Commission Report : Omissions and Distortions. For ease in doing this , I have parenthetically indicated the pages of the book on which the various issues are discussed . </lie.v.1867><lie.v.1868>I have had this problem , in a small way , with a housemate who would reflexively lie to avoid confrontations , without even realising he was doing it. What you need to do is teach him how to argue with you without it being the end of the world. Maybe this is something you need to learn to do , too. So talk to him about how the two of you need to be able to have conflicts and then move on from them , and agree to try to figure out how to do it together. Having good arguments is like having good sex - not as easy as everyone makes it out to be , but generally something you can figure out together if you 're prepared to loosen up and help each other . </lie.v.1868><lie.v.1869>Eddie takes her to the rough part of town where they get attacked by thugs.

Let 's just say I was doing some personal research over the weekend. And let 's just say that somebody in my household may lie to me on occasion. If this has happened to you , you may have been upset about it as I was and called your child on it , as I did. Well ... I learned a lot by doing some research. And I think it 's important to share some of my findings with you . </lie.v.1870><lie.v.1871>Deedat mentions that , according to Luke 3 : 23 , Joseph was the supposed father of Jesus ( Is the Bible God 's Word ? p.52 ) without further comment. Here , in this one word , lies the key to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke. Throughout the list of ancestors he names we find no mention of a woman. Although he concentrates on Mary 's role in the birth of Jesus , when he comes to her genealogy he does not describe Jesus as the son of Mary but as the supposed son of Joseph , meaning that , for the sake of sustaining a masculine genealogy , Joseph was being named in her place. Luke has very carefully included the word " supposed " in his genealogy so that there could be no confusion about it and so that his readers would know that it was not the actual genealogy of Joseph that was being recorded. This very simple explanation does away immediately with alleged contradictions or problems . </lie.v.1871><lie.v.1872>He lied about Whitewater. He lied about Castle Grande.

It was previously thought that an epidural placed too early in labor could increase the risk of caesarean section. This has been disproven , and a woman can reasonably receive an epidural at any point during labor , provided there is enough time and she is willing to lie still for the procedure. Another concern is regarding chronic back pain following the placement of an epidural. Epidural anesthesia does not appear to be associated with chronic back pain , and any discomfort of the back is believed to be due to the stress of labor . </lie.v.1876><lie.v.1877> . . .don ' t always fit the stereotype of caring only about themselves.

When the believer stands on the ground of faith , the devil always over-reaches himself. Satan goes too far. That is because he commits himself to extremes , and in that lies his defeat. Sooner or later , the truth of reality must become apparent. The devil can never take the ground of truth because that , of course , would defeat his own aims. God is truth , and the devil can not defend and support God , for he is out to attack and outwit God. All the devil can do is take the ground of untruth , extremism , distortion , and deception. Ultimately , because God is truth ( and truth is always the reflection of God ) , truth must finally prevail. Because God never changes , this has been true throughout the entire history of the world , and it will be the continuing record on into eternity . </lie.v.1878><lie.v.1879>You 're right concerning your friend and her dog , but proper usage is a grammatical matter and has nothing to do with the nature of the object , if there is one.

" Of course , you can lay down a sleeping dog , an inert robot or a passed out princess. Or yourself. But to use " lay , " you have state the object : " Lay yourself down ! " </lie.v.1879><lie.v.1880>Father Hell , in the Eighteenth Century , two Roman Catholic priest used hypnotic procedures and gained a reputation as healers. Due to their influence on Dr. Franz Anton Mesmer , they played a significant role in the history of hypnosis. Father Gassner would have those desiring to be healed brought into a room where they were told to wait. As their expectations mounted , Father Gassner would then majestically enter the room , lower his cross on the head of a patient and command him to sleep. The patient would collapse and upon command would rise praising God for healing. Father Hell used hypnotic techniques and metal plates. He believed that illness occurred when the magnetism of the body was out of polarization. He would have his patients lie down and pass mental plates over them. His suggestions and the passes of the metal plates seemed to cure those who came to him for healing . </lie.v.1880><lie.v.1881>One French writer , who usually displays more intelligence , has said that , in fairness to Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton , he made the new year 's wish that " the American people , which forgave neither Clinton for lying about one case of fellatio nor Richard Nixon for having pushed on a tape recorder button , will sanction next November a Bush who lied on the theme of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. " </lie.v.1881><lie.v.1882>The lie that women will die from back-alley , " unsafe , " abortions is nothing but a scare tactic to coerce pro-life cultures into compliance with abortion. The truth is that abortion-free cultures have a greater respect for women and babies and are not subject to that degrading pall of killing that lies over the medical profession. In the case of Nicaragua , their rejection of abortion in 2006/2007 coincided - not surprisingly - with a greater provision of basic pre-natal services for pregnant women and accompaniment in childbirth which is what led to the surprising turn-around in the maternal death rate. Even aside from legal protection of babies , pro-life cultures just protect women better , it 's that simple . </lie.v.1882><lie.v.1883>1 Timothy 4 : 1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils; 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 3 Forbidding to marry , [ and commanding ] to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. 4 For every creature of God [ is ] good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving : 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer . </lie.v.1883><lie.v.1884>To provide you with as much information as possible , I interviewed a number of people who are " experienced " at being lied to.

This is where a parent can really fail their child miserably. To both allow your child to see and hear you lying and then to go one step further and let them believe that this is an acceptable behavior , by not also allowing them to see you openly correct yourself , ought to be criminal. Children learn , and they learn very quickly , how to manipulate and play one parent against the other. Shall we then compound this with teaching them to use lies in this process as well ? </lie.v.1886><lie.v.1887>According to this condition , it is sufficient for lying that the person who makes the untruthful statement intends that the addressee believe the untruthful statement to be true; it is not necessary that the addressee believe the untruthful statement to be true. That is , a lie may be disbelieved. If A makes the untruthful statement to B I didn ' t get any homework today , with the intention that B believe that statement to be true , and if B does not believe that statement to be true , then A is still lying. According to this condition , ' lie ' is not an achievement or success verb , and an act of lying is not a perlocutionary act the existence of an act of lying does not depend upon the production of a particular response or state in the addressee ( Mannison 1969 , 135; Wood 1973 : 199; MacCormick 1983 , 9 n. 23 ) . </lie.v.1887><lie.v.1888>Blair himself is a keen purveyor of this self-serving and self-deluding nonsense.

The real trick is interpreting them correctly. To do this it is necessary to understand a little about people and why these signals happen. Anxiety is the key. When people lie , they put themselves in a state of stress. Adrenaline floods the body , the heart beats faster , muscles tense , blood vessels dilate ( or contract ) , pupils ' shrink , the need for nicotine increases and breathing becomes faster.

This type of person is often stereotyped as effeminate , but a more accurate characterization is androgyny " ( 1986b : 2 ) . At the basis of this definition lies the observation , also attested to both by numerous primary sources and by Native American terms for women-men and men-women , of " gender mixing. " Gender mixing represents a combination of masculine and feminine gender statuses instead of a genuine change from " one " gender into " the " other. Consequently , gender mixing is often expressed by a combination of the feminine gender role with the masculine gender role ( see Callender and Kochems 1986 ) . As will be shown in what follows , this combination is not uniform , and comprises a spectrum from quasi-masculine to quasi-feminine role makeup and organization ( Ausgestaltung ) . </lie.v.1901><lie.v.1902>A HISTORIC TICKET ... .

Make sure your fingernails are short so they do not hurt the skin. Provide a pillow for the comfort of the massage recipient , lying it under the stomach or ankles for support. If the person lies on his or her back , the pillow should be placed beneath the knees. When you start , rub a little oil into your hands to warm it , and then massage the oil into the skin.

It is hard enough to keep track of the truth , and exceedingly difficult to keep track of serial lies , or to keep them entirely consistent. Pathological liars do not deal well with being confronted , and seem to consider this simply unfair of others . </lie.v.1928><lie.v.1929>With his misrepresentations and false assertions , Bush has dramatically changed the nation and the world. Relying on deceptions , he turned the United States into an occupying power. Using lies , he pushed through tax cuts that will profoundly reshape the US budget for years to come , most likely insuring a long stretch of deficits that will make it difficult , perhaps impossible , for the federal government to fund existing programs or contemplate new ones . </lie.v.1929><lie.v.1930>As a culture , we laud truth-tellers. From an early age we 're taught to revere two of our most noteworthy presidents , Honest Abe and George Washington , who could not tell a lie. What does it indicate , though , when the well-known story about the first US president coming clean after cutting down his father 's cherry tree is nothing more than fiction , a bold-faced lie ? Certainly , there are occasions where telling the truth , plain and simple , is the appropriate thing to do , such as when under oath. But let 's be honest , lying , by embellishment or fabrication , is something we do as part of our everyday lives; it 's part of being human. By acknowledging our deceit , we may learn something about our nature . </lie.v.1930><lie.v.1931>" The first time you got the touch was the day you had brought a cart of turf from that bog at Ballinabucky to Scahanagh.

Its confession of sins has been instrumental in creating numerous Patets , penitence pieces in late Middle Persian , in which all the possible sins are listed and repentance is expressed for each of them in daily prayers faithfully recited by many.

When she walked in the house , there was the familiar feeling that he was near. She figured it was impossible and shrugged it off to just being with him the previous night. She could n't stay with him. Not in her condition. It was something she had gone through before , even though the first time was a lie. This time it was real. When it happened before , she was ready for it and accepted it. This time , she was n't ready. She still felt she had so much more to do with her life and with Sonny. She could n't let him happen though. She left him in Greece. It was the right impulse decision. She was n't about to have him watch her die. She loved him too much for that . </lie.v.1934><lie.v.1935>The Republicans know that the majority of Americans will NEVER hear the truth of this. The ones who do are democrats who can ' t or won ' t do anything about it or intellectually dishonest Republicans who think it is a good thing to lie to America to save it for their version of God and the rabid nationalism they push off as patriotism. The Moonies who have been the number one financiers and molders of today ' s right over the last 30 years , call this type of lying , Heavenly Deception. </lie.v.1935><lie.v.1936>There are so many ways to manage pain that hospitals do n't give you. If you give birth in the Bay Area , you 're likely to lie down in a hospital. Other countries with better outcomes for mothers and children think that this is so barbaric. Lying down is the most excruciating position in which to labor. Childbirth educators teach you to lunge , pace , pull on the furniture or your partner. These are great ways to manage pain. But if you go to a birthing class - if your birthing class educator is hired by the hospital , they teach you to do these little , woofy kinds of breaths and your partner to look at his watch . </lie.v.1936><lie.v.1937>We are presently witnessing in the political arena , the lawful result of what happens when American citizens abdicate their responsibilities as citizens for far too long. As a political activist for many years , I can personally attest to the fact that the problems lies not so much with the corrupt leadership but with the fact that the people have allowed this to happen. For far too long , the baby boomer generation has gone along with free trade economics , privatization , de-regulation , post industrial society in favor of the me , me lifestyle . </lie.v.1937><lie.v.1938>The major portion of Ethiopia lies on the Horn of Africa , which is the easternmost part of the African landmass.

Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the Great Rift Valley , which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands , steppes , or semi-desert.

In midpregnancy with plenty of room , neutral buoyancy and intervertebral discs virtually synovial joints , he can assume postures difficult or impossible for the child or adult. In late pregnancy , as the foetus elongates more than the uterus , he must fold to fit in.

A person either lies down or sits in a chair with his or her head supported. Each muscle group ( such as face muscles , arm muscles , leg muscles , etc. ) is tensed for five to seven seconds and then relaxed for 20 to 30 seconds. This helps the person recognize the feeling of tense and relaxed muscles. This entire procedure is repeated one to five times , and usually starts with the face muscles and moves downward to the foot muscles. When relaxation is used with chronic pain and childbirth , the techniques focus the person 's attention on breathing and relaxing muscles as a distraction from the pain. For mastery , relaxation techniques are typically practiced every day for one to two weeks. A person may engage in these techniques anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour per session. Sometimes , a person will record and replay instructions on tightening and relaxing various muscle groups until the person becomes familiar with the muscle groups and establishes a routine in which he or she is comfortable . </lie.v.1992><lie.v.1993>British theologian-evangelist John Wesley similarly rejected consequentialist justifications of lying on the basis that a lie is a sin and sin can not be condoned even if it leads to good.

But you are correct : We must deceive ourselves into believeing in our selves. My problem lies exactly at that critical junction : I don ' t really believe , so I am easily defeated. I won ' t give myself the opportunity to be lied to , so I cave much sooner than necessary. I have more success with a simpler , I will not fail approach. Failure is not acceptable as a mantra just seems to work better though I do fail at athletic self tests more often than at real life events where failure really is not an option.

While he acknowledged the existence of a tendency toward simulation and lying in hysterics , he attributed it to the fact that the patient " wishes to be ill , " ( p. 249 ) , itself the result of patients ' need to convince themselves and those around them of the reality of their suffering . </lie.v.2004><lie.v.2005>The secret of her importance lies in the tremendous burden and responsibility that is placed on her , and the difficulties that she has to shoulder - responsibilities and difficulties some , which not even a man bears.

First , children who lie out of fear usually know that they have done something that is wrong. This provides an important clue for parents responding to the lying child. Consider that the child 's problem is not in knowing what is wrong , but in resisting its temptation. Claiming " I 've told you more than a hundred times ...

Her Sutra &amp;Other Stories allows the reader to peer into the extraordinary lives of ordinary people living in Iran. Each of the six tales has a folkloric tone , but their strength lies in presenting the woman 's point of view , the infrastructure of interpersonal bonds that still operates in the face of rapid change. Neither preachy , nor judgmental , the stories often contain a universal message. In " Potshards , " an impoverished boy chooses to remain with his invalid brother rather than move to Tehran to be adopted by a wealthy woman.

If the person taking the oath lies , on one level that is a matter between that person and his or her conscience or God.

It is in front of the presenting part of the baby and can cause life threatening bleeding. This can be found on an ultrasound during a routine office visit. Placenta previa occurs in about 1 out of every 200 pregnancies and there are no known causes. Women are at higher risk for developing placenta previa if they have previously had children ( usually more than 2 ) , are of advanced maternal age , smake , have had a previous abortion or curretage , are diabetic or women who have a large placenta-as found in twins. Most women who experience placenta previa have painless vaginal bleeding that is usually bright red. The amount of blood varies from light to heavy and may stop on its own. Blood tests will be performed to check for blood loss. If the bleeding is severe enough to put the mother 's life at risk , an emergency cesarean is usually performed.

Until truth and lies stop being equated equally , we can not possibly elect the best leaders . </lie.v.2141><lie.v.2142>Still , I don ' t think any men have lied to me about their reading habits , although my husband started off our married life reading serious nonfiction ( which awed and humbled me , a lifelong addict of novels ) , but now appears to be reading only Scandinavian murder mysteries. ( Reading this over my shoulder , he just admitted that early on in our relationship he bought several books by Camus to display on his bookshelf to impress me. Aw . ) </lie.v.2142><lie.v.2143> On a recent shopping trip to Marshalls , Colleen Weston decided to skip the parenting advice about teaching kids life lessons at every opportunity. Instead of explaining to her son why he couldn ' t have a toy that day , which surely would have triggered a tantrum , she took the easy way out : She lied . </lie.v.2143><lie.v.2144>" My empire is of the imagination , " says the white goddess of the lost city of Kor at one point in this novel , &amp;, so saying , sums up the primary element that has fascinated three generations of readers of H. Rider Haggard 's She. For She is a classic of the imagination , a milestone &amp;foundation stone of a whole sector of fantastic novels upon which others have built &amp;still build novels of wonder. The sector is that of the lost land , the lost race , the wonder that lies over the next mountain or beyond the farthest sea . </lie.v.2144><lie.v.2145>I think you people are missing the bigger picture. The cop lied which is an offense called perjury. Now in all that , where are the criminal charges ? Why hasn ' t the district attorney ' s office filed charges against the officers who lied ? Why hasn ' t the judges publicly denounced the officer ' s actions. The judges above all should be outraged over police officers lying to them in order to get a warrant. A warrant must be signed by a judge or a magistrate upon oath of affirmation. The statements can ' t be verbal. They must be written . </lie.v.2145><lie.v.2146>In 1965 alone the British sent 136 ships with oil and other war goods that docked at the port of Haiphong. At a time when America had 300 , 000 troops in South Vietnam , England had sent only 11 police instructors and a professor of English. Standard and Shell were taking 33 , 000 barrels of oil daily out of North Thailand and refining it at Bangkok and Srivacha. While Thailand officials lied , the Bangkok News said that foreign companies had taken 40 , 000 , 000 barrels of oil out of the Burma ground in 1965. President De Galle of France blasted the Standard Oil " policy " in Vietnam. Standard Oil had operations in North Vietnam and Burma. The Shelf Coast extended from Hong Kong to Vietnam , Burma and Thailand. No news stories revealed that thousands of barrels of oil were being taken out by Standard Oil every day. Moody 's Manual of Industrials listed nearly 300 foreign operations but not a line about the Thailand wells. Once this was revealed , the next issue eliminated all mention of foreign operations. It was first said there was no oil industry in Thailand. Later authorities advised that the production of oil was a major industry . </lie.v.2146><lie.v.2147>When the Gestapo bangs on your door , you had better lie about the Jew you 're hiding in the basement. The moral choice , however , is not always so clear : Do you have a right to lie to governments or other interrogators whenever you believe they are acting unjustly ? If you consider the tax code oppressive , are you justified in lying to the IRS ? If you oppose the death penalty ( as I do ) because you consider it immoral , should you lie if you 're called to serve on a jury in a capital case ? Should you tell the court that you have no quarrel with capital punishment in the hope of qualifying as a juror and thwarting an execution ? </lie.v.2147><lie.v.2148>And like any other behavior which provides comfort and an escape from discomfort ( i.e. , alcohol , drugs , sex ) , lying can become very addictive and hard to stop.

Who is going to put everything they have accomplished on the line to tell people they have to Stop Sinning and Get Right with God ? Are there any Prophets out there ? Other than the phony charlatans in the charismatic movement who act like a bunch of mentally deranged maniacs ! I wonder how Jeremiah and Isaiah felt when they had to expose the Reprobated System in their time. You think they loved telling the people they were following lying , deceived Pastors , Dumb dogs , who preached nothing but LIES ! ? How were they received by the general public ? Were the people even SLIGHTLY aware of the times in which they were living ? How Spiritual and Physical Bondage were just around the corner and their precious liberties were about to be swallowed in brutal tyranny ! </lie.v.2150><lie.v.2151>Believing is key. That is for sure.

I ' m gullible with myself . </lie.v.2151><lie.v.2152>The author devotes considerable space to the problem of detecting lies , and his conclusions came as a surprise to me. We are not good at detecting the liar , and even those who have had a lot of experience and training in the field such as customs officers and policemen are not much better than the rest of us , and the better they think they are , the worse they are in fact. Even successful poker players are better at lying than in detecting lies in their opponents , and to do so they make detailed lists of the habits of each individual player , suggesting that there are few valid generalizations to be made. Moreover , people can not be trained to detect lies . </lie.v.2152><lie.v.2153>Just as he lied to you in the beginning saying , surely you shall not die , he is now lying to you that you can die and all will be made better.

Satan knows this and that is his ultimate purpose in his lieto lead you to eternal death once and for all . </lie.v.2153><lie.v.2154> The thing about the phrase ' everybody lies ' is , it ' s as if you are saying there is no difference between nuclear war and my punching you in the nose , Adler says. Both are aggressive. </lie.v.2154><lie.v.2155>But biology is not the only factor behind lying. The environmental factor in childhood also plays an important role in determining whether or not a person grows up to be a chronic liar. Those who come from chaotic and dysfunctional families have a greater tendency to lie than those who grew up in a caring household. Busak hypothesises that children from such families lie to change or modify reality so as to make life more tolerable - that in this case , lying becomes a strategy of coping with the hostile environment . </lie.v.2155><lie.v.2156>However " there are people who are essentially psychopaths , such as con artists , and these people often make very good liars because they do n't have the emotional response that other people have to lying , " says Robert Galatzer-Levy , MD , a psychoanalyst in private practice in Chicago and a lecturer at the University of Chicago. He explains that when most people lie , they feel some discomfort and it will show up in their facial expressions , manners , and style . </lie.v.2156><lie.v.2157>The lie : " President Bush lied to the American public when he went into Iraq , insisting that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction when he knew that he didn ' t. </lie.v.2157><lie.v.2158>HIllary was not too far off because one of the leading figures in Move On did oppose the US actions in Afganistan. She was wrong that it was the organization. Of course , that misstep is not as serious as others maintaining that she was working for the lawyers for the Black Panthers or lying about Bill Clinton pardoning two of the Weathermen women. Clinton did not pardon them , but commuted their sentences after they had served over 15 years in prison for transporting explosives. Those are virtually the same lies from Rove and the GOP. Obama 's people take them at face value and use them as though defending the Panthers against police attacks was wrong. THAT is using the GOP values , NOT progressive ones . </lie.v.2158><lie.v.2159>Since you asked , I interpret the L'Amour passage to say that once you lie to the Apache , the negotiations are over and the killing starts.

Whether we want to protect feelings , lessen the wrath inflicted upon us from a mistake we made , or we fail to follow through on a promise , we have our reasons for these non-truths. Men and women handle lies differently. In my experiences I see that women defeat men hands down with the skill , accuracy , and perfection of their lies. While men are deliberate and careless with lies ( on average ) , some dudes would never suspect their women was cheating , or even lying ! To solidify my point , I thought over 5 reasons why women lie better than men : </lie.v.2160><lie.v.2161>Michele lies again. She loves God , and follows him. God says don ' t lie. But Michele lies anyway. Does God have a different set of rules for Michele ? Is she allowed to lie ? </lie.v.2161><lie.v.2162>There have been times in my life when I , like most people at one time or another , have taken the path of least resistance. Not that it was my intention to lie , but at that particular moment , it allowed me to avoid conflict , avoid disappointment , or avoid having to take some form of action that I was in no mood to take at that moment. For example , if asked to take the garbage out during a football game , I might say that I 'll do it later , simply to put the issue to rest. But ultimately , it is the fear of unknown consequences that mostly causes men to lie . </lie.v.2162><lie.v.2163>All the campaigns to encourage people to eat healthier are having an impact on mothers , but not necessarily in the way that you might expect. Instead of giving up fried foods or other things deemed to be unhealthy completely , some mums are not changing what they feed their kids - they 're just lying about it. A new survey , which was sponsored by the British Potato Council , found that as many as 93 of mothers lie from time to time about what they feed their kids , and they mostly spin the tales to their own mothers and other relatives , since they make up the group that is most likely to criticize parenting choices. The most commonly made claim is that the kids are not allowed to eat fried foods , followed by telling people that their children " eat mostly fresh food at home. " Other untruths include assertions that the kids are only allowed candy at weekends , are never fed frozen food and get all the required servings of fruits and veggies every day . </lie.v.2163><lie.v.2164>Sick and Insane Teachings , Gittin 69a .

So am I sinning if I lie by not telling them what I know or am I saintly because I ' m not perpetuating gossip that does no good to anyone ? </lie.v.2166><lie.v.2167>God ' s Penalty which will be bestowed to liars is of the severest kind. They are positively and absolutely excluded from Heaven ( Rev 21 : 27; 22 : 15 ) , and those who are guilty of this sin are cast into the lake of fire ( Rev 21 : 8 ) . We are reminded of the awful fate meted out to Ananias and Sapphira when they lied to God and man ( Acts 5 : 1-11 ) . God will " destroy them that speak lies " ( Ps 5 : 6 ) , and " he that uttereth lies shall not escape " ( Prov 19 : 5 ) , yea " a sword is upon the liars " ( Jer 50 : 36 ) . The liar is thereby debarred from rendering any true and acceptable worship unto the Lord ( Ps 24 : 4 ) . </lie.v.2167><lie.v.2168>Petraeus is that strange kind of intelligent and honest man who will not lie , but will confine his statements to such a small area of discovery that what he says is valid while being stupid and useless.

Sometimes a 3 year old will start to tell a story , and you will hear it get out of hand as he adds bits and pieces to fit the ideas in his head. Lies at this age might succeed , but 3 year olds are generally poor liars because they fail to lie appropriately. They do not consider that their listener will actually think about either the statement or their intention. As a result , they tend to lie at the wrong time or place , or neglect to think about other important facts , such as covering their tracks to conceal the deception . </lie.v.2171><lie.v.2172>By Thursday , 12 to 15 inches have soaked the forest floor atop Cold Mountain , still sodden from Frances , a similar storm nine days earlier.

Lay is a transitive verb , and has for its preterit laid; as , he told me to lay it down , and I laid it down. Lie is intransitive , and has for its preterit lay; as , he told me to lie down , and I lay down. Some persons blunder by using laid for the preterit of lie; as , he told me to lie down , and I laid down. So persons often say incorrectly , the ship laid at anchor; they laid by during the storm; the book was laying on the shelf , etc. It is only necessary to remember , in all such cases , that laid is the preterit of lay , and not of lie. " [ 1913 Webster ] </lie.v.2175><lie.v.2176>Here comes the question of terrorism. We often speak about terrorism caused by an individual or by a group. We never discuss the terrorism caused by a State. And again , think over a State. What is a State ? Is it a group of people reside within a Political and Geographical boundaries ? Is a State 's identity , mood and wishes are separate from its ruler ? Is the wish of George Bush is not considered as the wish of America ? Has it reflected the mood and wish of the people of America ? So , every time , the State 's arranged anarchism or terrorism is mere a reflection of a terrorism caused by an individual. The great truth lies beneath Safique as a terrorist is actually develops from the mind of that military man . </lie.v.2176><lie.v.2177>Despite the most optimistic outlook for change in employment opportunities for women with disabilities , the present reality is that the best hope for productive work may lie in self-employment , probably on a cooperative basis with others.

Why exactly can you report the Obama campaigns calls it a lie , but not do any reporting of your own. Too busy ? I did some research this weekend FOR FIVE MINUTES and found quite a bit of information showing that Palin is lying through her teeth. She was committed to the bridge. She only did an about-face when Congress cut the funds , leaving Alaska with a $ 329 million shortfall for the project. Then Palin decided to cancel the project ... she did n't want the state to pay for it. She wanted the rest of the country to pay for it. And she sure did n't tell Congress " no thanks , " as she keeps repeating. Oh noes ! Journimalism is such hard work ! </lie.v.2184><lie.v.2185>Not all faith is good , of course. It can produce dangerous fanatics. The test lies in the quality of life it produces. Jesus valued and exhibited love and compassion above all else. He valued justice , tempered with mercy. He had a special concern for the poor. He dared to condemn some of the religious people of his day and we must have the courage to discriminate too. Jesus did not say anything about global warming , but he grew up in a tradition that believes god made the earth , that is good , and that man is meant to enjoy it and care for it.

However , no-one who is anti-war should turn a blind eye to or even praise that role ! The fact that the Iranian regime has opposed the Taliban from the start and helped the US to overthrow them not only demonstrates that Iran is pro-imperialist but is used by Zadeh to bolster the assumption that US interference in the affairs of another country is justified.

You will be asked to undress from the waist down and lie on your back on the examination table. The doctor will ask you to bend your knees and let them fall open. Some women find this position difficult , so if you ca n't lie this way , say so. The doctor can do the examination with you lying on your side with your knees drawn up in the fetal position. In fact , many doctors will do this anyway when looking for prolapse as it 's a good way to check the front and back walls of the vagina . </lie.v.2194><lie.v.2195>Muhammad is worshipped by over a billion Muslims. Many non-Muslims also think of him highly. He must have been a great man for so many people to follow him , they argue. You can ' t fool so many people for such a long time , they say. Well , you can. I have written a book where I have proven that Muhammad , far from being a great man , was a thug , a pervert with no conscience or scruples. He was a cult leader who fooled people with the power of his oratory and big lies. If you wonder how Muhammad influenced so many people with nothing but lies , watch Obama.

We can certainly think that a parent who passes on to his or her children certain ideas that are " factual " as far as he knows , is not lying per se. He just may not know the truth. But still , the result is that lies pile on lies and our understanding of our world becomes little more than a whispered conversation passed along a line of 100 or more people , at the end of which , the final statement bears no relation whatsoever to the original one . </lie.v.2198><lie.v.2199>Are we seriously supposed to be surprised that Hillary Clinton has been caught in yet another attempt at subverting the electoral process just so she can " win " the presidency ?

But his perception of this - why he chooses to say that he did n't have time , or that he did take lunch , etc instead of simply saying " Nope , sorry " is equally important.

It 's who He is , not merely what He chooses to be. To use the claim that God is not bound by His Ten Commandments as justification for making the claim that God could lie , or want others to lie in some circumstances , goes against who God has revealed Himself to be. The very reason the Ten Commandments ( and Scriptures ) speaks against lying is because God can not lie and He wants us to be like Him . </lie.v.2222><lie.v.2223>Then she said , " All the Cathars I have ever known have been scrupulously honest.

Pinocchio always has a thousand good intentions , he sets out with a kind of touching naivety , but then , he always diverts from his course so as to follow the easiest route , namely to lie whilst hoping to get off scot-free. He gets so used to lying that he is no longer able to see the difference between true and false , right and wrong. We ' re like this. Official reports and media news are full of good intentions and are as unreal as Pinocchio ' s. We ' ve heard world leaders say these things , decade after decade , from Rio to Johannesburg. They are like the puppet on his first day at school , making false plans/promises about brotherhood and voicing concerns for the unfortunate , poor , starving and oppressed of the world . </lie.v.2227><lie.v.2228>Lying is most vigorously condemned in the Law : " Keep thee far from a false matter " ( Ex. xxiii. 7 ); " Neither deal falsely , neither lie one to another " ( Lev. xix. 11 ) . Regarding the false oath see Perjury. Lying on the witness-stand to harm another is a crime specially mentioned in the Decalogue ( Ex. xx. 16 ) , and the punishment is that the false witness be dealt with as the one witnessed against would have been dealt with if guilty ( Deut. xix. 15-21 ) . Regarding lying in fraudulent dealing see Fraud and Mistake . </lie.v.2228><lie.v.2229>An example of this type of lie are when a child got their report card and tell their parents that they have n't come out yet.

But for now , they are still free to do the things they want to do . </lie.v.2229><lie.v.2230>Of all the ways to lie , I like this one the best , probably because I get tired of trying to figure out the real meanings behind things. At least I can trust the bald-faced lie. I once asked my five-year-old nephew , Who broke the fence ? ( I had seen him do it. ) He answered , The murderers. Who could argue ? At least when this sort of lie is told it can be easily confronted. As the person who is lied to , I know where I stand. The bald-faced lie doesn ' t toy with my perceptions it argues with them. It doesn ' t try to refashion reality , it tries to refute it. Read my lips . No sleight of hand. No guessing. If this were the only form of lying , there would be no such things as floating anxiety or the adult-children-of-alcoholics movement . </lie.v.2230><lie.v.2231>- German Bundestag ( Parliament ) by request from the opposition formed a " Lie-Committee " to investigate the fraudulent argumentation of the government parties in the September 2002 elections. Chancellor Schroeder , who also activated anti-American resentment to get the necessary votes for re-election , as well as finance minister Eichel , are both accused of having lied to the population regarding the desperate financial situation of Germany. The truth could have spoiled their bid for power. Immediately after election victory the grisly picture emerged. Five weeks before election date , for instance , Schroeder had promised " we do not have the intention to raise taxes. I speak for the government and my [ socialist ] party. " Taxes , however , were substantially raised right after he had been safely installed in office. There are seven more documented cases of similar lies to the population . </lie.v.2231><lie.v.2232>Everyone lies in Hollywood.

Bush does not lie about sex , I suppose -- merely about war and peace. Most particularly he has consistently lied about Iraq 's nuclear capabilities as well as its missile-delivery capabilities. Take a look at Milbank 's gingerly worded page-one October 22 Post story if you doubt me. To cite just two particularly egregious examples , Bush tried to frighten Americans by claiming that Iraq possesses a fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used " for missions targeting the United States. " Previously he insisted that a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency revealed the Iraqis to be " six months away from developing a weapon. " Both of these statements are false , but they are working.

Lying is a commonplace behaviour , and children are subject to lies all the time. The problem is that children learn to lie through experiencing others lie.

Down the line , it 's also noted that women lie about motherhood in general and infertility specifically . </lie.v.2238><lie.v.2239>Parents should hold their kids responsible for lying. But the mistake parents make is when they start to blame the kid for lying. It ' s considered immoral to lie.

False charity constrains the fearful and subdued , the " rejects of life , " to extend their trembling hands.

There are many excellent books and articles focusing on the powerful experience of VBAC - the courage , faith , joy , and triumph of a vaginal birth after a previous disillusioning cesarean. The technical information about cesarean sections and VBACs in this article is designed to assist the midwife in analyzing her knowledge , training and emergency resources to attend VBACs , regardless of setting. My hope is that a midwife reading this will write ( or re-evaluate ) her practice protocols for pregnancies following a cesarean section. The vibrant future of midwifery in the United States and around the world lies in midwives being accountable for superior outcomes for mothers and babies , while promoting the gentlest birth possible for any clinical situation . </lie.v.2241><lie.v.2242>It 's an argument that 's been heard more and more in recent weeks. " Does it matter that we were misled into war ? " asked the New York Times 's Paul Krugman.

But in the long run , these lies are eventually exposed. The fact is , lies have a tendency to compensate themselves; this is called the " snowball effect. " In other words , once a lie is told , others soon follow to justify the previous ones , and so on , and so on ... . Lying for survival will ultimately fail , and lying only serves to make matters worse. In Clinton s case , self preservation , or even just " saving face , " gave the lie its value. But his lie , despite its apparent value , still can not be sanctioned . </lie.v.2243><lie.v.2244>No one likes or trusts someone who will lie about anything , but I suggest we cut a little slack to people who lie about sex if it does not involve some clear illegality , unless , of course , one has never , ever lied to another or oneself about sex.

Their poses embody sorrow , resignation , composure , solemnity , and love , determined love , love which will have a hard time of it. Compare them to the subjects of contemporary fine -art portraits , like Richard Avedon 's and Irving Penn 's , and you may notice that , however different the styles of Avedon and Penn , both artists tend to capture their sitters in moments of unrepentant , sometimes even antisocial self-assertion. Their subjects seem to say , " This is who I am. Want to make something of it ? " At the other end of the ladder of contemporary portrait photography , commercial studios strive to generate images of women that say , " I 'm fun. I 'm friendly. I 'm enjoying life and will help you enjoy it , too. " When such college-yearbook or engagement photographs are used to show the faces of the victims of a disaster , the absurdity of the smiling face convention is all the more apparent. If Cameron 's portraits of women convey a message , it 's " I 'm ready for the worst.

She-who-must-be-obeyed , the immortal white queen of a lost city , is possibly Haggard 's greatest creation. Her origins lie in mythology , but what was their significance for Haggard himself ? In his biography , he speaks of a particularly hideous rag doll hidden in a closet with which a nursemaid used to threaten him when he was a very small boy. Young Henry used to call this terror-doll She-who-must-be-obeyed ! Perhaps it was from that almost forgotten memory of his childhood that he dredged the phrase when he was writing She in a heat of inspiration that took only six weeks from start to finish.

The Obama campaign on the otherhand needs to make sure they are presenting the entire truth , especially if they are going to bash Hillary about this. Now the Bosnia thing is an entirely different animal. That was a huge lie. I am a retired Army NCO and I tell you , after serving in Iraq , I KNOW what happened every time my life was in danger. No person has to remind me of what happened. She was lying and she knew it. If you had to run with your head down because of snipers , its something you never forget.

's sex-ed curriculum has produced such a controversy and a restraining order against it from a judge. The curriculum contains the usual systemic lies from America 's health and education establishments ( in reality , they care nothing for either health or education ) , lies that not only permeate the sex indoctrination curricula of most public schools in this country but also many of the Third World programs funded by First World nations. The curriculum does go one step beyond the usual in trying to imply that one can be a good Christian while engaging in promiscuity and even sodomy , which apparently is what got the program into real hot water. Usually , such curricula officially ignore students ' and parents ' religious beliefs while indoctrinating children into their own implicitly pagan religious dogmas involving mystical sexuality. The curriculum promotes homosexual activity as normal and healthy while neglecting to mention its deadly nature , encapsulated in this astonishing fact : Up to 65 of sexually active homosexual men are dead or HIV-positive by the time they are 30 . </lie.v.2281><lie.v.2282>So what greater good was achieved by these lies ?

Current facts on the ground clearly indicate that a substantial number of Iraqis consider Americans to be an occupying force. So what " good " has come of this invasion ? Yes , a brutal dictator has been removed. But did Bush and his cabinet need to lie to the American people in order to accomplish this goal , this end ?

( This is where they belong in the first place ) . Even at a few hours of age George had the spunk to know what he was missing and the persistence required to get it. The cry of a high need baby is not a mere request , it 's an urgent demand. These babies put more energy into everything they do. They cry loudly , feed voraciously , laugh with gusto , and protest more forcefully if their needs are not met to their satisfaction.

The difficulty with most men is not so much that they have not a refuge , as that they have a false refuge , a refuge that will fail them in the hour of crisis and need; what our text characterizes as a " refuge of lies.

What is acceptable or otherwise to them ? </lie.v.2342><lie.v.2343>Some of the problem in finding information about Wadjet lies in the fact that , while she is one goddess , she has many names.

" So the mother caught it , and then she thought she 'd like to see what would Biddy Early do with it. So she brought it up to her house and laid it on the floor , and it began to rustle its wings , and it lay over and died. It was from her brother Biddy Early got the cure. He was sick a long time , and there was a whitethorn tree out in the field , and he 'd go and lie under it for shade from the sun. Anf after he died , every day for a year she 'd cry her fill.

He wants to know her true self. He wants to love and care for her true self. He wants to mingle his soul with hers and enjoy her existence. When one loves her he puts her in an uncomfortable position. She wants to be loved but she does not want to be found out. She wanted to be cared for but she did not want to be uncovered. So , for the present , she goes along with the love and for the sake of love she reveals enough of her true self to give her lover some false hope. But when he gets too close she lies. At first she lies with shrugs and sighs. Then she lies with quizzical looks. And then she answers his questions with cute sounding , beautiful little lies. And she tries with all her subtlety to get him not to ask such searching questions . </lie.v.2351><lie.v.2352>" The Army Reserve officer who wants to unseat U.S. Rep.

'Dear Mr. Speaker : I have been called to active duty in the United States Army , ' the letter states. 'Pending further orders , I request immediate indefinite leave of the House of Representatives to accommodate my military duties. ' Hardy , who announced plans Tuesday to challenge Buyer in next spring 's primary , said the letter offers proof that Buyer lied about being called to active duty for the war in Iraq ...

Watch this video ( produced in May ) : </lie.v.2359><lie.v.2360>For Douma , A lie of necessity may be used only in dire circumstances , that is to say , only in situations where a life is at stake , either our neighbors or ours.83 This is certainly a rather limited view of when a lie of necessity may be employed. Bonhoeffer suggests a far looser standard : Telling the truth means saying how something is in reality , i.e. respect for secrecy , confidence and concealment.84 By this , Bonhoeffer means that the truth is that which shows the proper respect and deference for the structures and institutions in life. The higher the obligation owed to an institution , person , etc. , the higher the obligation to protect it/him/her even with a lie. His famous schoolboy example85 demonstrates this in practice : a child has a greater obligation to lie to protect his family secret than he does to reveal that secret to his teacher. For Douma , a lie is only appropriate in a justifiable instance and when a life is in jeopardy; for Bonhoeffer , any occasion in which the proper loyalties and structures are challenged may justify a lie. Probably , the biblical picture is closer to Bonhoeffers conclusion than to Doumas . </lie.v.2360><lie.v.2361>Ms Harbury , a lawyer , has alleged that the US officials lied to her to conceal the involvement of a Central Intelligence Agency informant in the torture and murder of her husband.

That imperative lay behind the publication of the September 2002 dossier , Iraq ' s Weapons of Mass Destruction : the Assessment of the British Government. The document attracted even more attention than it would otherwise have done because of the report on 29th May 2003 by the Today programme ' s defence correspondent , Andrew Gilligan. He asserted that Blair had knowingly lied , specifically in having a claim that missiles could be fired within 45 minutes inserted into the document. Gilligan ' s claim was shown to be false , but rather than being corrected , it was then defended by the BBC , triggering a prolonged series of events that outed David Kelly and culminated in his suicide , and that later caused the resignations of the BBC chairman , Gavyn Davies , and director general , Greg Dyke . </lie.v.2362><lie.v.2363>I once went out with a guy who turned out to be married.

The rights of alternative practitioners to practice their art has rarely been questioned by the courts. Rather , they have often been prosecuted for using words and language reserved by the medical profession to exclusively describe their business to the public.

For a small house with a lot of needs , you may want a folding changing table that lies flat when not in use. Portable changing tables are easily rolled from one room to another , which makes them ideal for day care organizations or hotel rooms catering to new parents. Many changing tables also act as dressers , with drawers providing space for receiving blankets , diapers , baby powder and clothing. A corner type baby changing table helps save space in the room , as does the wall mounted variety. If you want to save money , you can find cheap baby changing tables in the classifieds : since they are soon outgrown , lots of parents get rid of them once their child has been potty trained. For space saving options , try the crib combo , where the changing table is a part of the infant bed.

And by the way , when you set rules and boundaries on when we can and ca n't have sex , then that is first second of the downfall of your relationship with your woman. Men do n't need rules , but we think we need them because we do n't understand women. You know why you do n't understand women ? Because you 're not fully mature yet to realize that women are not static like men are. Woman and their feelings " at the present " time are like clouds in the sky. Women do n't lie and do n't need to be prodded into doing or saying something they may not feel in the next five minutes or in the next week. The weatherman lies , but the weather does not . </lie.v.2408><lie.v.2409>Whoever above suggested that people lie but things lay is incorrect.

These locations and centers have NO RIGHT to lie to women. Again ... BUT condoms DO NOT prevent STD 's that are spread by contact. They only prevent STD 's that are spread fluid to fluid. Also , you can not deny that women are MUCH LESS careful about who they sleep with and how it is done b/c there are so few consequences for them. Get pregnant and do n't want it , just have an abortion or give that baby up later on. Like I said , I 100 support a woman 's right to choose , but I feel women need to be more responsible with their choices and their bodies. 9 Fri , 01/29/2010 - 10 : 20am Report Comment </lie.v.2410><lie.v.2411>Think about the analogy of the open borders around our nation; allowing unlawful entry and the resultant damage done by the invasion of foreigners coming in like a flood with no intention of benefiting the country , but only taking from it. These illegal invaders rape , kill , steal and commit every crime imaginable. Our so-called leaders jump up and down and yell about the threat of terrorism which is like someone yelling about the threat of home invaders breaking into someone ' s home but then , not only leaving the back door open , but taking the door off its hinges ! Likewise , we have not erected defenses against the horror of abortion. Remember the many remarks by many people during the Clinton sex scandal ? It ( his lie ) is only about sex , and everybody lies about sex. Sexual sin is disregarded even by Christians , and the result is that we have rampant sexual sin and the predictable outcome; abortion. Most Christians wring their hands over the abortions , but like the Americans who wring their hands over the damage done by the invasion of foreigners and their costs to society , nothing is done about addressing the cause of either situation. How blind can we be ? </lie.v.2411><lie.v.2412>Most broadly , there is evidence that drugs have least effect on well-adjusted individuals with good defenses and good emotional control , and that anyone who can withstand the stress of competent interrogation in the waking state can do so in narcosis.

I have lied to my wife , and then had to come back and confess my lie. It hurt , it was hard , and what I feared was her hurt and my losing face.

But that ' s not a lie that ' s a random rule I made up that he will haunt me about till he ' s 14. Then this afternoon while cruising past a Dunkin Donuts Matthew started screaming I want donut !

Interestingly enough , hagalaz lies between kenaz ( fire ) and isa ( ice ) , reminding us of the Norse creation myth and the creative potential that lies between these two opposites , even though their meeting may seem at first to be destructive. Like the Tower in the Tarot , hagalaz is only a negative rune if we choose to view it in that way , and refuse to learn its lessons. Appearing as it does at the beginning of the second aett , it marks both a beginning and an end , and knocks us out of the safety and complacency of wunjo.

I would suspect that in surveys and studies that ask that sort of question you ' ll find much of the difference can be explained by the fact that men like to appear like they ' re studs and women like to appear as if they ' re not sluts because there exists an odd double standard in many cultures ( America especially ) . I would be more interested to see the result of surveys like this in non-western cultures , like some remote native tribe in South America. Perhaps there are some places where that cultural double standard isn ' t as strong , is non-existent , or even the reverse. That might lead to less of a reason to lie when asked how much you get around . </lie.v.2421><lie.v.2422>Why do people lie ?

The fact that she met one of these guys at a bar either by contrived or actual chance and did n't mention it to her husband tells me it 's gone beyond " harmless flirting " .

We didn ' t just go to war because of lies. We live in a society where all discourse is crippled by a growing culture of lying. Despite the fact that it ' s now common knowledge that top Bush administration officials lied us into a catastrophic war , they ' ve faced no consequences. There ' s not even any serious national discourse on impeachment , though lying to Congress just once is a crime. Then there are all the political campaigns where politicians compulsively lie. They never have to answer for their lies; they ' re expected to lie. The only consequence is that most of us give up on voting since all we really accomplish by voting is to make fools of ourselves by voting for liars . </lie.v.2424><lie.v.2425>And then with all this lying to others we must ad-dress the far more relevant and often harder to detect kind of lies.

I believe it is never fair to use truncated scales on bar graphs. On the other hand , sometimes you will feel that a small change is significant and that accurate display of the statistic requires clearly displaying the change. ( Examples : A small increase -- say 5 -- in the volume of the oceans would mean an almost total loss of important coastal regions. A small decrease in species -- say 5 in a decade -- extrapolates to a major extinction event over a century. ) If you feel you must use a truncated scale , consider using a line graph , where truncated scales are more expected. However , any use of truncated scales leaves you open to the charge of trying to Lie with Statistics.

Brother Freeman claimed that all of God 's promises were either true or not true. That the promises for healing are just as valid as the promises of forgiveness of sins. How could God tell the truth about one and lie about the other ? Either all of the promises are true or throw the Bible away. Stop blaming the teacher for it is written : Luke 12 : 48 Unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required. Many just do n't want to pay the price of fasting and study of God 's word. Brother Freeman always pointed us to the word of God ! I do n't have to know why he died , just what God said. Obviously some of you have forgotten this or just simply never knew. Stop blaming others for your unbelief. That 's the problem. The promises are clear and abundant. We either believe them or we don't.

To render informed and wise choices about the crucial and complicated controversies of the day , people need truthful information.

For example , we tend not to tell our friends that their new girlfriend or boyfriend is bad for them. We might tell ourselves that it is not our business or that we really don ' t know the new person. In fact , because we are so afraid of being judged , we tend to back away from being seen as judgmental. We are also very competitive creatures , so if we sense that someone else might be miserable in love , we might refrain. After all , jealousy of another ' s happiness can be most unpleasant. Despite television shows such as Friends and Sex and the City , true sisterhoods of women are hard to come by. Our early heritage of social competition for resources including males can make women refrain from giving another woman an edge.

Origen quotes Plato and approves of his doctrine on this point ( Stromata , VI ) . He says that a man who is under the necessity of lying should diligently consider the matter so as not to exceed. He should gulp the lie as a sick man does his medicine. He should be guided by the example of Judith , Esther , and Jacob. If he exceed , he will be judged the enemy of Him who said , " I am the Truth.

We can not in good moral conscience ignore this lie , this crime , lest we encourage future leaders to continue to lie to us to send our kids off to pointless wars. Lying to start a war is more than an impeachable offence; it the highest possible crime a government can commit against their own people. Lying to start a war is not only misappropriation of the nation 's military and the nation 's money under false pretenses , but it is outright murder committed on a massive scale. Lying to start a war is a betrayal of the trust each and every person who serves in the military places in their civilian leadership. By lying to start a war , the Bush administration has told the military fatalities and their families that they have no right to know why they were sent to their deaths. It 's none of their business . </lie.v.2449><lie.v.2450>My new boss lies to his customers to get their business , misrepresents 3 of his companies as not associated to his incorporated company , and requires his employees to sign alias names to documents such as warranties , certificates , agreements/contracts and these customers are in foreign countries , as a regular part of their employment , to keep the lies alive. He obviously cares little for his employees because if you mess up and let a customer know , you are escourted out the door. One of his employees told me it was legal to have two aliases.

Based on that description , lies exist primarily for purposes of pride and power. With a lie a person can exalt themselves , steal honor rightfully due to another , or manipulate others for self gain 1. In virtually all major examples of lies being used in this manner , most people ( especially Christians ) would be quick to say that they are wrong. For the purposes of this examination it is necessary to focus solely on a Christian view of lying. Much of the world quickly will adopt an ends-justify-the-means approach to the subject of lying when the results are viewed favorably. At the heart of this issue is the question , 'are all lies always wrong ? ' This can not be an opinion based study , rather it must be one based solely on what can be proven by the Word of God. Left only to opinion , a group of three would likely have four different ones ! In the realm of Christianity - even conservative evangelical Christianity - there are two primary views on this subject; which are as follows : </lie.v.2452><lie.v.2453>He withdrew from her and turned on his side , his back to her , feeling sad and angry.

That 's not even debatable. What this anecdote illustrates so clearly is how easily she lies how effortlessly. She lies without giving it a second thought.

The protection of political belief in section 41 can be seen as closely linked to section 2 ( b ) of the Charter. It provides that everyone has the right to freedom of thought , belief , opinion and expression. The importance of these fundamental freedoms has consistently been upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada. Thus Cory J. , in Edmonton Journal v. Alberta ( Attorney General ) , [ 1989 ] 2 S.C.R. 1326 , 64 D.L.R.

When I tell her that I think I resemble Brad Pitt , I want her not to double over laughing . </lie.v.2462><lie.v.2463>The first reason is that God 's Word specifically forbids us from lying. Read it for yourself in the Bible at Leviticus 19 : 11 , Psalm 34 : 12-13 , and Colossians 3 : 9-10. In fact , not only does God 's Word forbid us from lying , but in Proverbs 6 : 16-19 , it instructs us that the Lord hates a lying tongue. And from Revelation 21 : 8 , we can see that He hates lies so much , that the liar 's final destination will be the fiery lake of burning sulfur -- hell. Also , Proverbs 26 : 28 tells us that a lying tongue hates those it hurts. So , as you can see , even such an " innocent " lie as telling your child that the Easter bunny , Santa Claus , or the Tooth Fairy is real is something you must avoid for your sake. But it is n't just your sake that you should be concerned with , either . </lie.v.2463><lie.v.2464>Bemard Nathanson , the founder of the the National Abortion Rights Action League ( NARAL ) , also admitted he lied about the number of women who died from illegal abortions in order to repeal this country 's pro-life laws : " We spoke of 5 , 000-10 , 000 deaths a year ... I confess that I knew the figures were totally false ... it was a useful figure , widely accepted , so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics ?

They are doing so by spreading lies and are purposely misinforming these women and trying to fill them with fear that they have a 1 in 5 chance of committing suicide and that their bowels may be sucked out or they 'll get breast cancer.

No one knows why it occurs , though it seems to be quite common. Many women have no symptoms from it , but if the tissue is lying behind the uterus it can cause painful sex , especially on deep thrusting. A sign of endometriosis is bad period pains especially if they last throughout the period . </lie.v.2471><lie.v.2472>I have explained how Socrates fascinated his audience : he seemed to be a physician , a savior. Is it necessary to go on to demonstrate the error in his faith in " rationality at any price " ? It is a self-deception on the part of philosophers and moralists if they believe that they are extricating themselves from decadence by waging war against it. Extrication lies beyond their strength : what they choose as a means , as salvation , is itself but another expression of decadence; they change the form of decadence , but they do not get rid of decadence itself. Socrates was a misunderstanding; any improvement morality , including Christianity , is a misunderstanding. The most blinding daylight; rationality at any price; life , bright , cold , cautious , conscious , without instinct , in opposition to the instincts all this was a kind of disease , merely a disease , and by no means a return to " virtue , " to " health , " to happiness. To have to fight the instincts that is the definition of decadence : as long as life is ascending , happiness equals instinct . </lie.v.2472><lie.v.2473>Well , if he continues to lie , then drop his sorry arse. But if they do n't explain themselves clearly , you get to the point of assuming , and we all know what ASS.U.ME means ... </lie.v.2473><lie.v.2474>God 's Attitude toward this sin is strongly marked throughout both the Old Testament and New Testament. The righteous are called upon to hate lying ( Prov 13 : 5 ) , to avoid it ( Zeph 3 : 13 ) , to respect not those who lie , and utterly reject their company ( Rom 16 : 17 , 18 ) , to pray to be delivered from it ( Ps 119 : 29 ) . The wicked are said to love lying ( Ps 52 : 3 ) , to delight in it ( Ps 62 : 4 ) , and to give heed to it ( Prov 17 : 4 ) . Lying normally leads to worse sins ( Hos 4 : 1-2 ) . </lie.v.2474><lie.v.2475>We learn to lie and to detect deceit as a developmental task. Dr. Ford ' s philosophy is that lying is part of the bridge between one ' s internal world ( beliefs , perceptions , expectations , fantasies ) and one ' s external world ( reality ) . Lies work not only to deceive others but to deceive ourselves . </lie.v.2475><lie.v.2476>The arsenic screw-up was one of the few lies for which Bush took a hit. On the matter of global warming , he managed to lie his way through a controversy more deftly. Months into his presidency , Bush declared that he was opposed to the Kyoto Protocol , the 1997 global warming accord. To defend his retreat from the treaty , he cited " the incomplete state of scientific knowledge. " This was a misleading argument , for the scientific consensus was rather firm. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , an international body of thousands of scientists assembled by the UN and the World Meteorological Organization , held that global temperatures were dramatically on the rise and that this increase was , to an unspecified degree , a result of human-induced emissions . </lie.v.2476><lie.v.2477> ' Whoever tells lies about me , let him take his place in Hell ' , i.e. , let him take his place in Hell where he will abide and settle; it is not like a manzil or camp where he stays for a while and then moves on. </lie.v.2477><lie.v.2478>1 John 1 : 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie , and do n't tell the truth.

While the parent is saying , " I 'm punishing you because you lied " , the child may be thinking , " You are punishing me because you found out the truth. " For the child , punishment is not associated with lying but being found out. The next time around , the child finds new ways to misrepresent the truth , and the parent is left in a quandary of suspicion and distrust . </lie.v.2479><lie.v.2480>Let 's be specific and make ourselves aware of some of the deceitful desires that tempt us to lie. I think all the desires that lead people to lie can be summed up in these two : fear and greed. Two kinds of fear and two kinds of greed . </lie.v.2480><lie.v.2481>When your children lie , or even when you think they may have lied , you always want to remind them that God knows their hearts and thoughts even better than they do themselves. You want to call them to repent and trust in Christ , for he alone can help them overcome the fear of self-exposure. Only the power of the Gospel can free them from the tyranny of lying. You can and should confidently tell them that God knows whether they have been truthful or not. Discipline for lying must come from compassion for a lost heart. Yes , your children have offended you with their lies , but more importantly , they have offended and mocked God. Help them to see this reality. It is sometimes difficult to realize that a child who is defiant and seemingly unfazed by lying may actually be dominated by fear. Yet this is often the case . </lie.v.2481><lie.v.2482>What I Saw and How I Lied takes place in post-World War II Palm Beach , Florida. Evie Spooner , her glamourous mother and stepfather leave their home in Queens for a vacation in Florida in 1947. While vacationing , Evie and her family meet Peter Coleridge , a 23 year-old ex-GI who served in her stepfather 's company in Germany. Evie , 15 , immediately finds herself attracted to Peter despite their eight year age difference and her family 's objections. As she falls deeper for Peter she finds herself in a web of complicated lies that only she sees. When she discovers that everything she believed to eb the truth was a lie , she must choose between her love for Peter and her loyalty to her parents . </lie.v.2482><lie.v.2483>Ross Perot pointed out , correctly in my view , that where lying is concerned you can not separate the spheres. He did not want adulterers working for him because " any man who will lie to his wife will lie to me. " You can test this assertion by asking yourself : why would n't he ? Because his wife is a thing to him but I am a person ? There is no answer to the question likely to inspire continuing confidence in the individual. Once we know that another violated a relationship of trust and reliance , there is no moral distinction to be drawn based on the " sphere " in which the deed occurred . </lie.v.2483><lie.v.2484>The whole race is guilty of this sin : " The wicked are estranged from the womb : they go astray as soon as they are born , speaking lies " ( Psalm 58 : 3 ) . It is a part of the old Adamic nature , " the old man " ( Colossians 3 : 9 ) , which the believer in Jesus Christ is called upon to put off. So prominent a factor is it in the experience of the race that among the condensed catalogue of sins , for the commission of which men are finally condemned , the sin of lying finds its place : " All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone " ( Revelation 21 : 8 the King James Version ) . </lie.v.2484><lie.v.2485>But Doctor Stockman continues in the faith he entertains for his townsmen. They would hear him. But here , too , he soon finds himself alone. He can not even secure a place to proclaim his great truth. And when he finally succeeds , he is overwhelmed by abuse and ridicule as the enemy of the people. The doctor , so enthusiastic of his townspeople 's assistance to eradicate the evil , is soon driven to a solitary position. The announcement of his discovery would result in a pecuniary loss to the town , and that consideration induces the officials , the good citizens , and soul reformers , to stifle the voice of truth. He finds them all a compact majority , unscrupulous enough to be willing to build up the prosperity of the town on a quagmire of lies and fraud. He is accused of trying to ruin the community. But to his mind " it does not matter if a lying community is ruined. It must be levelled to the ground. All men who live upon lies must be exterminated like vermin. You 'll bring it to such a pass that the whole country will deserve to perish. " </lie.v.2485><lie.v.2486>The simplest way to catch this kind of lying is to ask the most relevant questions directly. In the above example , the woman could ask , " Did you go to the bar at all tonight ? " Many people are willing to avoid the truth , but not willing to lie outright , at least not in every case. Force them to make a choice and they may just tell the truth . </lie.v.2486><lie.v.2487>Let ' s face it : lying is a very common human activity. Not only is it easy to lie it can even be the polite or politically correct thing to do. Your baby is beautiful.  Don ' t worry , spilling your drink on my carpet is no big deal.  Your party was so much fun. We often find ourselves lying for the sake of kindness and social graces . </lie.v.2487><lie.v.2488>There are no quick and easy answers.

Our focus should have been on the war in Afghanistan. It should have been our priority. Instead money , troops , and resources were diverted away from that theater to another. We lost precious time , and squandered precious lives in capturing and killing Saddam Hussein , who posed a possible future threat , instead of our PROVEN enemy , Osama Bin Laden ... The lie was that Iraq was more important than Afghanistan ... </lie.v.2490><lie.v.2491>We personally have witnessed good LDS members mislead and lie about the ceremony to nonmembers , converts , family members and Church members who did not go through the temple before 1990. We 've watched people , who have been through the old temple ceremony , fumble over their words trying to figure out what to say when confronted with someone who has been told about the prior ceremony but is skeptical that good Latter-day Saints actually performed those rituals with the death oaths. They say " it was n't like that " , " I do n't remember " , " you 're exaggerating " and even " that was never part of the ceremony " when the simple facts about the pre-1990 ceremony are mentioned to them for verification . </lie.v.2491><lie.v.2492>Magic acts are illusions , not reality. Still , when skillfully performed , they convince many people that the rabbit really lives in the hat. George W. Bush has consistently LIED. He LIED when he told the people of Poland that we had found the WMD ' s in the form of harmless vans. He LIED when he told us that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat to our safety. He LIED when he said ( eleven times in his SOTU speech ) that Iraq was connected to the terrorists who attacked the US on 9/11. He LIED about aluminum tubes , uranium purchases , tons of chemical and biological weapons , and about his motives for invading a sovereign nation. He LIED about his support of the troops whose benefits he cut. He LIED about his education program , his AIDS concerns and his support of women ' s rights. He LIED to the Congress about exhausting every diplomatic means before using his war powers. He LIED yesterday. He continues to LIE today. He will LIE tomorrow. But we can pull the curtain back to expose the wizard . </lie.v.2492><lie.v.2493>Why the lie ? Again this is our need to impress. But lying about your education is dangerous. While you may be able to get away with quoting It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . It ' s not so easy to quote the theory of relativity or debate the presidential candidates if you have no idea who they are or that there was even an election happening . </lie.v.2493><lie.v.2494>Is it helpful to know the exact number ? Does it make a difference ? After all , presidential lying is n't exactly a revelation. Pretty much a national pastime , really. Hell , Bill Clinton lied in a harmless civil lawsuit , and was even impeached for it. Of course , his little oral fixation did n't lead us into an unwinnable trillion-dollar war that will scar the nation for multiple generations and which has wasted 4 , 000 American lives and resulted in tens of thousands of wounded , crippled and brain-damaged U.S. soldiers. But that 's just splitting hairs , really . </lie.v.2494><lie.v.2495>The pendulum has also swung a bit in the other way.

While only two per cent of bosses believe it is acceptable to lie to take sick leave , and just three per cent when making an expenses claim , 14 per cent are comfortable with employees lying on their CVs and 24 per cent about being late for a meeting . </lie.v.2498><lie.v.2499>adrivahni , I don ' t know That ' s a good question though. Some ideas that come to mind might be to ( a ) protect the client from an insight or information they have that they believe the client may not yet be ready to hear ( e.g. , will likely cause the client more harm than benefit ); ( b ) about aspects of their personal life ( some therapists may find it easier to lie , omit , or give a generalization about some aspect of their life rather than give truthful details , which is what some therapists have been trained to do ) . </lie.v.2499><lie.v.2500>But each advance in the field of lie detection has met with a hitch. Polygraph machines have drawn considerable scientific scrutiny and remain inadmissible in courtrooms. Functional imaging has pinpointed which areas of the brain become active when people lie , but the results are based on group averages and become less accurate when a single person is tested. Even people with incredibly accurate facial analysis skills , so-called lie detection " wizards , " were called into question last month in the journal Law and Human Behavior . </lie.v.2500><lie.v.2501>Hirsch called this the " Pinocchio syndrome " , after the character whose wooden nose becomes longer every time he tells a lie.

At that moment , you dont care whether you are married or not . You want her irrespective of what you have to say , " he says rolling his eyes heavenward.

One then looks up the coordinates in an atlas and cites the name of the gyrus/sulcus , region or Brodmann 's area. While this provides some information and facilitates comparisons across labs , remember that activation is seldom a single point and the cluster activation may encompass several regions. My personal favorite " lie " is when some task activates most of the intraparietal sulcus ( which is ~7 cm long in humans ) , a single point is cited , and the label for the region can be either the superior parietal lobule ( if the point lies even 1 mm medial to the IPS ) or the inferior pariteal lobule ( if the point lies lateral to the IPS ) . </lie.v.2505><lie.v.2506>Why do people lie ? There are a number of reasons. A teenager might lie to avoid parental disapproval. Parents like to hear that their children are spending their after school hours in productive activities. They prefer that they study , work or participate in sports. They do not want to learn that their child is hanging out at a street corner , possibly getting into some form of trouble. So when parents inquire about after school hours , teens often answer what they know their parents would prefer to hear . </lie.v.2506><lie.v.2507>Deputy Attorney General Holly Wilkins also lied about this shirt. Wilkins also lied about all of the new evidence found by Cooper 's attorneys since his stay of execution.

That is new evidence ! </lie.v.2507><lie.v.2508>I would like to begin this morning by addressing the most notorious but not the most important issue relating to falsehood; namely , the question : Is it ever right to tell a lie ? I am going to address the issue , but I am not going to answer the question directly.

One of the Ten Commandments , for example , forbids " bearing false witness , " meaning giving or promulgating a lie or deliberate falsehood in a juridical or evidence-giving context ( Exod. 20 : 16 ) . That prohibition would presumably also apply to such things as falsifying data in a scientific or engineering situation. Lying when under oath ( in a judicial proceeding or similar legal context ) , even to achieve some greater good , is itself the crime of perjury , and is subject to criminal penalties. Lying to government investigators , even if there is no underlying crime , has often resulted in people being prosecuted for that crime of lying although the supposed crime that was being investigated had not actually occurred . </lie.v.2524><lie.v.2525>Your baby 's position can have a major influence on the kind of labor you will experience and the way that your baby is born ( no/low intervention vs vacuum , forceps , or cesarean ) .

Their birth is usually gentler because midwives rarely help the baby out by pulling or other means. When the baby is born she enjoys the soft warmth of her mothers chest , not the impassive incubator. Her eyes open to greet her family in the diffused glow of home lighting.

Those in government and other positions of trust should be held to the highest standards. Their lies are not ennobled by their positions; quite the contrary.

We live a sinful life because of the sinful nature and life that is in the blood. Therefore , we need to be BORN AGAIN of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Who had shed His Pure Sinless Blood for us. We need to apply His Blood onto our heart so that His Life is released on us. Only then would we change. We would have a new heart , a new life ( because of His Blood ) .

It lies atop of the vagina which acts like a hammock , much like the one you find in the backyard. The urethra lies on top of this hammock and is supported , like you would be if you were lounging comfortably on the hammock. Two things provide support while you lie on the hammock : the ropes that tie it to the base ( connective tissue ) and the strength of the actual canvas ( vaginal wall muscle ) . When SUI occurs this hammock effect is weakened and can no longer offer the proper support. This results in urine leakage during physical activity such as running , jumping , sneezing or coughing . </lie.v.2550><lie.v.2551>This is the only biblical passage that specifically mentions a male-on-male sexual act , and it makes its point in a roundabout way.

So , there is no doubt this is referring to male-on-male sex. There is no hint of lesbian sex in this passage , so only the guys are in trouble here. Sounds pretty straightforward , doesn ' t it ?

Women may feel pressured to lie about the pain to avoid being devalued in their own positive experience of childbirth. This unintentional deception can leave subsequent generations of women in our culture vulnerable to a recurring cycle of mystery and inadequate information surrounding birth. When this happens , messages recur which promise women the positive experience with no pain if they adhere to a particular method. Though these methods do not succeed at very high rates statistically , they fit the socially accepted value that positive experiences should not include pain. Research has shown that the best preparation in terms of statistical success for any method of natural childbirth is a realistic one which includes an experience of mastery in coping with pain. Why is it that we as a society have difficulty accepting that something intensely difficult or even painful might also encompass a feeling of power , beauty and ease ? </lie.v.2573><lie.v.2574>do not lie. never tell lies , lies are bad , and when yer mates find out theyll talk to your other mates and then the spiral starts ... . youll be known for lieing ... do NOT lie </lie.v.2574><lie.v.2575>A leaked British memo , and other documents , make it clear that Bush intended all along to invade Iraq -- and lied about it to the American people.

It 's clever , and entertaining , but I think it 's basically an example of the straw man fallacy. Those claiming Bush lied are not arguing that Saddam never had any weapons of mass destruction. They 're saying that Bush misrepresented ambiguous evidence as being much more certain than it actually was , in order to build support for an immediate invasion , as opposed to the slower approach represented by things like sanctions and continued UN weapons inspections. Which , as far as I can see , is a legitimate criticism. True , it 's not as bad as if Bush had invented the idea of an imminent Iraqi WMD threat out of thin air , but it 's still dishonest , and needs to be looked at carefully by anyone being asked to believe what Bush says in the future . </lie.v.2583><lie.v.2584>I have be lied to by women and I usually say " WTF , why did you not tell me the truth in the first place ... .

" Actually , he seems pretty good at it. It 's a queasy-making read , as Franken and his research assistant lie to well-meaning people who have strange religious beliefs ( what happened to an appreciation for " diversity " ? ) . To his enormous credit , by the end of his charade Franken seems to get a sick feeling about himself . </lie.v.2600><lie.v.2601>FORWARD : My hunch is that Hillary Clinton will say whatever she needs to say to serve herself , and I dont believe for a moment what shes saying.

This behavior , however , can be very upsetting to parents. Many parents wonder how they should handle their children 's lying. How lying is handled often depends on the age of the child , the specific situation , and the established family rules about lying.

For example , midwives may place an IV if the mother has tested positive for Group B streptococcus and needs antibiotics during birth. Coached pushing is only necessary in rare situations where it is important to get the baby out quickly and could include an episiotomy. Most midwives will probably prefer to do an internal exam at some point to check the progress of your labor. However , they do n't do them often and as long as there is no danger , will respect your wishes if you do not want one at all. Your midwife will encourage you to try different positions during labor and will never force you to lie on your back . </lie.v.2612><lie.v.2613>Monika says go back to sleep. I do.

Don ' t accept candies or toys from strangers , especially if it ' s from a truck. If it ' s an ice cream truck , of course it ' s safe. Otherwise , don ' t go and buy items that you are not familiar with from a person or a stranger. It could be that the person may have been a thief and stolen that item for their benefit.

The Greek word for the New Testament devil is diabolos and simply means false accuser , calumniator and slanderer. Nowhere is it used of a superhuman-being tempting men to sin.

Obama ' s campaign did not deny it , they instead said the news was inaccurate. To me this means there is some substance and CTV News is sticking to the story. Yes there were denials from both sides of the border. I guess that should set it straight because we all know that politicians and ambassadors do not lie ( I never had sex with that woman ) and would never deny something that was true.

What we don ' t realize is that once we lie , it is actually us who begins to shut down -emotionally and intimately because we create more fear in ourselves the fear of being found out. We become more controlled in our actions , behaviors and words , we limit our free expression and we destroy the bond and connection in our relationship. Thus , even before we get found out , we are hurting ourselves because we can no longer be ourselves and subconsciously we will create guilt and shame and , in turn , we will subconsciously create the situation for us to be caught and/or punished . </lie.v.2635><lie.v.2636>Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it is confusion.

What do any of the mostly white men I 've seen criticizing this association really know about the black experience in this country ? How can anyone criticize religion in any church while justifying Hillary 's lies about the SCRIP insurance program for children , bringing peace to Ireland , opening the borders in Kosovo and on three occasions saying she dodged bullets in Bosnia ( with a very young Chelsea at her side ) ? </lie.v.2640><lie.v.2641>For example , one girl I knew lied to cover up her betrayal of her boyfriend.

And 300 US soldiers have died as a result . </lie.v.2643><lie.v.2644>Ultimately though , it ' s not necessary to prove that a god doesn ' t exist. It is up to the god-believers to prove that their god or gods exist , for they are making the assertion of the existence of something that is not immediately visible. For example , if I were to claim that there 's an invisible ten-foot tall pink unicorn standing next to you , and demand that you feed her , you could justifiably expect some sort of hard proof. The same concept of proof lies with those who claim that an invisible , immaterial god exists. Thus , even if all proofs of the nonexistence of gods were to fail , it would still be necessary for theists to prove the actual existence of their god , if they expect us to take them seriously . </lie.v.2644><lie.v.2645>Finally , she said , " they share this assumption that truth and deception are somehow connected.

In some cases , lying is due to a child seeking attention. Most often , it 's the " Get Out of Jail Free " card.

Let it be known , though , that I am all about Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.

All this and more has been aired on blogs , sometimes slopping over into the MSM. When a mess doesn ' t stick to the wall , they throw something else. Sullivan says he ' s just asking questions. But here ' s how that works. At an on-line outlet nobody would otherwise credit , say someone writes that the Palins have human bodies buried in the backyard.

That isn ' t open for debate. Some people never overcome thinking with their genitalia first and their brains second. This is in no way meant to endorse sex with children by adults. I do hate child molesters worse than I hate fascists ( and that ' s saying something ) but the difference between an 18 and 15 y.o. mentally and physically is far far different than between a 40 y.o. and 15 y.o.

Political leaders often fall prey to this temptation , thinking that people can not handle the truth , that they must do things 'in the public interest ' that the actual public may not agree with , and the only way to do that is to lie. The trap here is obvious. There is a very thin line that separates telling lies for the benefit of the people being lied to , and telling lies that benefit the liars themselves. It is all too easy for political leaders to think that only they have the wisdom and judgment to understand the complexities of a situation and the action it demands , and treat the public as simpletons who must be fed some bogus story to get them to agree to a pre-determined action . </lie.v.2665><lie.v.2666>We wait , we hope.

For one thing , he doesn ' t tell his colleague when her husband is lying , and he lies to the press about the Congressman ' s real relationship with a prostitute. To draw another comparison to House , I was watching the pilot the other day , and the patient had decided to refuse treatment and go home , even though they knew what could save her. House said to his team , We figured out what was wrong with her. Our job is done. And I think that is how Cal Lightman operates. We found out who was lying; that is what we were hired to do. This suggests that his obsession with finding out the truth , about discovering whether someone is lying and discerning what the truth is , stems from curiosity even more than it stems from a devotion to honesty itself. House isn ' t a doctor so he can ' t help patients; he wants to solve puzzles. Perhaps there is an element of obsession with the question in Cal Lightman as well . </lie.v.2675><lie.v.2676>The same applies to Mohammad 's contaminated version of " apostasy.

The islamic , lying version of " apostate " is one who turns towards that which is true , regardless of whether such " apostate " means to convert others to his truth or not. In the original , the danger involves the spreading of false or incorrect doctrine amongst the faithful. In the contaminated version , it does not matter if anything " false " or " incorrect " is involved. It only matters that someone is n't worshipping God the way EVERYBODY ELSE is worshipping Him according to Mohammad 's contaminated teaching . </lie.v.2676><lie.v.2677>*Lies to get something they want or to avoid something they do n't want - Preschoolers tell these types of lies for the same reasons that adults do , but they often do n't see anything wrong with telling a lie to gain a result they want.

Kant suggested that a lie is " a crime of man against his own person " and should be avoided at all costs.

" Ferenczi , too , stigmatized the pedagogy of his time , which imposed upon children the repression of emotions and ideas. In " Psychanalyse et p dagogie " ( 1908; [ Psychoanalysis and education , 1949 ] ) , he wrote : " The closest thing to it is lying . . . current pedagogy forces the child to lie to himself , to deny what he knows and what he thinks.

Like the best of Kellys work , however , Bawas is interpretative rather than descriptive , and its strengths ultimately lie in formal tension and its activation of the surrounding architectural space . </lie.v.2740><lie.v.2741> Finally !

Perhaps lying to protect someone from harm is an example of loving others more than ourselves -- I 'm willing to take the rap for the lie ( if any ) so as to save the life of the Jew in the basement. And , so as not to be a party in the death of another person , I may lie to my captors ( as a prisoner of war ) to protect my brother soldiers. If loving our neighbor is the second-greatest of the commandments , lies to protect others may be justified , and the Hebrew mid-wives exemplify that principle . </lie.v.2743><lie.v.2744>Every young dog fears sheep getting away when it lies down.

This can be categorized under the title , " lies as wish fulfillment. " This type of lie is very common in children of the ages 4-7 years. Children often confuse a wish with reality. They believe that if a fantasy is spoken out loud , it will come true. This idea , then , can give rise to all kinds of falsehood. Among some of these false notions would be such ideas as " My daddy is a king and I live in a castle , " or " Puff the Magic Dragon visited me last night in my bedroom. " The fact is , neither of these are true , but the mere mention of them , the child believes , will bring it to pass. As we get older , of course , this type of thinking gradually erodes. The overspreading of ideas does not guarantee their becoming reality , nor is this process believed or enacted with advancing years . </lie.v.2745><lie.v.2746>She is going skiing with the school on Friday , so I ca n't ground her immediately.

On the contrary , and to his credit , the conflicting absolutist believes it is always wrong to break an absolute moral law of God. There are no exceptions or exemptions , he tells us. One 's lying to save a life is always wrong ( i.e. , it is sinful ) , but it is truly the lesser evil and , therefore , must be done under the circumstances. But , just as it is wrong to lie , the conflicting absolutist believes it would be wrong ( i.e. , sinful ) not to lie to save a life. Consequently , in practice , both the graded and conflicting absolutists would practice lying in order to do what they would consider to be the higher good . </lie.v.2749><lie.v.2750>Yes , Bush lied - According to the consensus of Bush 's intelligence services , there was " low confidence " before the war in the views that " Saddam would engage in clandestine attacks against the U.S. Homeland " or " share chemical or biological weapons with al-Qaida.

After all , his articles were going to be read by his colleagues and seniors : Breuer , Exner , Billroth and Obersteiner , who had all witnessed the Fleischl fiasco at first hand. Freud must therefore have convinced himself of his imaginary success , otherwise he would not have so recklessly invited their criticism. Similarly with his response to Erlenmayer : as Isra ls points out , it was insanely risky to lie so transparently when anyone especially Erlenmayer could at any time confound him by citing his own article. Even supposing that this was a brilliant bluff , one must concede that it presupposes an uncommon confidence in the magic of words.

For many reasons , besides the obvious , repeating an entire surgical procedure like a myomectomy would not happen. There 's no way this story is true. I agree her lies insult our intelligence.

Alterman , a columnist for The Nation , refers to the Bush Administration as a " post-truth Presidency , " but in general he is hardest on Democrats. He writes of Roosevelt 's " deliberate mendacity " at Yalta and Kennedy 's " nasty double game " during the Cuban missile crisis tactics that , respectively , he claims , started and deepened the Cold War. Alterman argues that such behavior , whatever its justification , invariably exacts a price L.B.J.

Women should learn in quietness ( 2 : 11a ) . This requirement that a woman should learn in quietness ( 2 : 11 ) is buttressed in 2 : 12b with , she must be silent. The same Greek word ( hesuchia , 2271 ) lies behind both quietness ( 2 : 11 ) and silence ( 2 : 12 ) . Fundamentally , hesuchia means stillness ( the root means tranquil ); it does not necessarily mean mute. For instance , hesuchia is used in 1Ti 2 : 2 ( quiet lives ) to refer to freedom from persecution and war. It is used in 2Th 3 : 12 ( settle down ) to describe the opposite of being a busy body. Thus , it would seem that Christian ladies are to be quiet , settled down , still , and uncontentious in the context of learning ( being taught ) .

They should also let their children know that lying is dishonest , and there are often negative consequences for lying. Parents can discuss examples of truthfulness and lying that they see on television , read in books , etc. Parents can also help prevent lying in their children by communicating effectively with them.

In sorrow ( or pain ) you will bring forth children. Kaiser adds ,  note that bearing children in itself was a blessing described in the so-called orders of creation in Genesis 1 : 28.

When trying to do the right thing in a difficult situation , perfect honesty may seem second best next to values like compassion , respect , and justice. Yet many philosophical and religious traditions have long claimed that rarely , if ever , is a lie permissible. What , then , is the truth about lying ? </lie.v.2877><lie.v.2878>( 3 ) Characterized by " Taqiyya " - the Islamic principle and Qur'anic teachings of lying in order to protect/advance the fortunes of Islam -Muslims are permitted to lie , deceive and betray non-Muslims if it helps to advance the cause of Islam and its eventual domination over all societies and the entire world. The Qur'an instructs Muslims to never take non-Muslims as friends nor have any bond with them. If a Muslim is in a non-Muslim land , the Qur'an instructs that he or she may publicly appear friendly but should fill their hearts with hate and enmity towards the non-Muslim society , religion and its followers. This best describes Mohammed 's beginnings as a prophet in Mecca - appease , lie and deceive to protect oneself but secretly aim to destroy non-Muslims . </lie.v.2878><lie.v.2879>They will lie to make Islam more attractive to potential converts as they speak of no compulsion in religion while all of them know that verse was abrogated by later verses. They will quote verses that speak of tolerance and kindness knowing that those verses were written when Mohammed was desirous of tolerance and kindness , but when he climbed into the catbird seat , everything changed and he became a terrorist . </lie.v.2879><lie.v.2880>While the above reasoning is logical , critics of utilitarianism claim that its practical application in decision making is seriously flawed. People often poorly estimate the consequences of their actions or specifically undervalue or ignore the harmful consequences to society ( e.g. , mistrust ) that their lies cause. Following the examples above , the son 's abuse of his mother 's faith in him and the doctor 's lie undermine the value of trust among all those who learn of the deceits. As trust declines , cynicism spreads , and our overall quality of life drops. In addition , suggesting that people may lie in pursuit of the greater good can lead to a " slippery slope , " where the line between cleverly calculated moral justifications and empty excuses for selfish behavior is exceedingly thin. Sliding down the slope eventually kindles morally bankrupt statements ( e.g. , " Stealing this man 's money is okay because I will give some to charity. " ) Those who disagree with utilitarianism believe that there is potentially great cost in tolerating lies for vague or subjective reasons , including lies in honor of " the greater good. " </lie.v.2880><lie.v.2881>No one , however , likes to be lied to. If a hearer is asked whether it is permissible that he or she be lied to in order to prevent or forestall a greater evil , the hearer is nearly always likely to say that the answer is no , so no one should deceive himself or herself by saying that a lie is a small or inconsequential or minor thing. Thus any claim that lying is sometimes justified must be based on strong evidence that deceiving a hearer or hearers will , in fact , actually result in a lesser evil or harm than the harm caused by the lie . </lie.v.2881><lie.v.2882>4. TROOP FUNDING : Joe Biden lied when he indicated that John McCain and Barack Obama voted the same way against funding the troops in the field. John McCain opposed a bill that included a timeline , that the President of the United States had already said he would veto regardless of it ' s passage . </lie.v.2882><lie.v.2883>The untruthfulness condition is to be distinguished from the putative necessary condition for lying that the statement that the person makes be false ( falsity condition ) , which is not a necessary condition for lying for the most common definition. In Jean-Paul Sartre 's short-story , The Wall , set during the Spanish Civil War , Pablo Ibbieta , a prisoner sentenced to be executed by the Fascists , is interrogated by his guards as to the whereabouts of his comrade Ramon Gris; mistakenly believing Gris to be hiding with his cousins , he makes the untruthful statement to them that Gris is hiding in the cemetery , with the intention that they believe this statement to be true. As it happens , the statement is true. Gris is arrested at the cemetery , and Ibbieta is released ( Sartre 1937; cf. Siegler 1966 : 130 ) . According to the most common definition , Ibbieta lied to his interrogators , although the untruthful statement he made to them was true , and he did not deceive them about the whereabouts of Gris ( Isenberg 1964 , 466; Mannison 1969 , 138; Lindley , 1971; Kupfer 1982 , 104 ) . </lie.v.2883><lie.v.2884>EVERYONE says just keep it real , I ' m as real as it gets , you don ' t have to lie to kick it , yet we ALL continue to lie If every person who claims be be ' real really were there would be NO liars.

Although the paper is writ-ten in Italian , there is no lack of clarity about his findings. Perhaps part of the explanation of this misquotation lies in the antiquity and obscurity of tile journal in which the paper was published. It seems that once Rigoni-Stern 's findings were misinterpreted many subsequent authors have merely accepted the accuracy of earlier quoters'. Two observations support this view-when the paper is quoted the title of the reference is often incomplete; the British Library , who do not hold a copy , have no record of any UK library holding a copy and had no record of having obtained a copy for any reader. ( Recently his paper and the reference to it were published in full English translation , Rigoni-Stern 1987 ) . It would be interesting to learn who first misquoted Rigoni-Stern and who was , therefore , responsible for the genesis of the myth. Skrabanek &amp;McCormick ( 1 989 ) have described this type of phenomenon as 'the Bell-man 's fallacy ' , whereby if an untruth is repeated often enough it becomes accepted as true . </lie.v.2890><lie.v.2891>The only courageous journalist that I have seen so far who has actually listed the number of lies the Republicans have promoted is Rachel Maddow.

Foetal position , whether he lies with his spine anterior , posterior , or lateral , is determined by other influences. In late pregnancy , the most important of these are the location of the placental , which converts the circular cross section of the uterus to an oval , the tone of mother ' s uterine and abdominal wall , the shape of the maternal lumbar lordosis , and the inclination of the pelvic brim. Maternal movement and change of maternal position , Brazton-Hicks contractions , and external palpation all disturb the foetus and may provoke him to seek a new position of comfort.

Alterman focuses on four key presidential lies : Franklin Roosevelt and the Yalta accords , John F. Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis , Lyndon Johnson and the second Gulf of Tonkin incident , and Ronald Reagan and Central America in the 1980s. Looking beyond the moral aspects of the deceptions , Alterman examines the destructive consequences : Yalta , for example , led to 40 years of cold war. For each lie , he offers details of the particular deception and the long-term effects for the president , his party , and the nation. " Without exception , each of the presidencies ( or successor presidencies ) paid an extremely high price for its lies , " he notes. The nation , of course , has paid a price as well.

Truth is the ultimate power because it is reality. " Men may all lie , but God is always true " ( Romans 3 : 4 ) . Truth always wins , in the long run. In the short run it may seem that lies win. But truth sustains life while falsehood destroys it. Jesus said that Satan " was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie , he speaks from his own nature; for he is a liar , and the father of lies " ( John 8 : 44 ) . Lies do have power , but it is a fatal power and eventually self-destructs. In our society there are lies that an unborn baby is not human , and that marriage is not naturally the union of male and female , and that truth is only opinion. When a society accepts these lies , it eventually clashes with inescapable reality and crumbles. Even Satan is forced to tell the truth in the presence of Christ : " I know who you are , the Holy One of God " ( Mark 1 : 24 ) . </lie.v.2944><lie.v.2945>That said , its still cheating -- even if its just emotionally.

Contrary to the structure of the modern church , the Word is presented at varying levels in accordance with the needs of the individual. The sinner is invited to partake of the healing of the Word -- and if they repent , and have a change in heart and mind , they will have prepared themselves to move onward. After purification from the transgressions and mindset of this world and servitude to man 's carnal nature , the minor mysteries can be revealed to the disciple -- which minor mysteries will then enable the disciple to begin the process of gaining entrance to the spiritual kingdom within them. As the disciple gains spiritual strength and vitality , and develops his innate spiritual attributes -- attributes which lie dormant in the carnal believer -- the disciple is then able to take the hand of the Lord and walk in the footsteps of the Master . </lie.v.2948><lie.v.2949>The oppressed , who have been shaped by the death-affirming climate of oppression , must find through their struggle the way to life-affirming humanization , which does not lie simply in having more to eat ( although it does involve having more to eat and can not fail to include this aspect ) .

This may seem to be a paradox , because how can something that is thought to be directly controlled by moral and ethical decision , have a genetic basis ? What is the relationship , in this case , between science and behavior ? There is some evidence for the notion of lying as having a genetic basis : " Rowe ( 1986 ) investigated several potential causes of delinquency and found that general environmental factors , such as social class or child-rearing styles , were not influential.

For some reason , media outlets have a policy that they must not offend anyone. Why not ? Journalists are a vital part of democracy. Their view is just as important as those of people running for the White House , but for some reason , journalists do n't seem to understand the power they have. In a way , journalists are a lot like Democrats : They have a lot of power but they are frightened to use it , falling back on the same excuse that they must be fair to everyone. I would argue that its being unfair to everyone to refuse to do your duty and report a lie as a lie. The truth , no matter what the politicians think , is important and it 's worth irritating people to stick up for honesty.

For this reason , women are encouraged to recline on their left sides instead of their backs. As a practical matter , lying on one ' s back during late pregnancy is usually reported as very uncomfortable for the woman and so it is most unlikely that anyone would elect to lie in that position.

They 'll tell you that when someone is lying they 're more likely to use a smile to mask their true feelings. However , research on lying shows it 's the other way round - people who are lying smile less than those who are telling the truth. It seems to be that liars occasionally adjust their behaviour so that it 's the opposite to what everyone expects of people who are telling a lie. This does n't mean that liars have abandoned smiling - it simply shows that they smile less than people who are telling the truth. When dissemblers do smile they often give themselves away by producing a counterfeit smile. There are several identifying features of counterfeit smiles : </lie.v.3015><lie.v.3016>JusticeForAll said on Jun 15 , 2009 ... .

If you are a Democrat and you say that you " experimented " with Pot back when you went to college and now you " regret it " , the public will accept that. Even moderate Republicans can get away with saying that back when they were a Democrat they used to smoke Pot. But a Democrat ca n't say that they still like to get high on the weekends and that it 's a better and safer high than Beer. A person who admitted that would lose to someone who did the same thing and lied about it. And certainly a religious Republican could never admit to having smoked Pot at all. Having been touched by the evil drugs , they would be tainted for life ! So you 'll not find John Ashcroft admitting to having smoked as much as a cigarette . </lie.v.3017><lie.v.3018>Incidently , college students are not necessarily like all the rest of us , being subjected to social tortures like dating , so they may be inclined to lie a bit more. Another study by Hancock supports that , showing that older persons also lie often , and they do it most often over the phone , but less frequently than college students . </lie.v.3018><lie.v.3019>The same is true of Bush. Acting against the somber backdrop of 9/11 , he may have acted in haste , and he might have acted in error , but he did not act in bad faith. Therefore the claim that Bush lied is itself a lie. By acknowledging this , we remove some of the poison that currently infects the Iraq debate , and help lay the groundwork for a constructive discussion of America ' s future role in Iraq and in the Middle East . </lie.v.3019><lie.v.3020>You lied to me : why are you not telling about Madam Song in the hotel ?

Of all of the possible scenerios to cause a problem in that marriage , that one is really lame. I think she lied because for some reason yet to be divulged , she can tell him the real problem. She knows that he will know that she 's lying , so she gives him the whole " respect the line " speech.

More specifically , George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Colin Powell , Condoleezza Chevron Rice , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and White House Press Secretaries Ari Fleisher and Scott McClellan lied to the American Congress , the American people and the world. These lies built public support for the war , muted opposition and created a rationale for elected officials such as Senator Hillary Clinton to vote to allow the invasion even though they should have , and probably did , know better . </lie.v.3031><lie.v.3032>It was a slow newsday , Friday before a holiday , so why should n't Sarah Palin suck up all the oxygen in five continents ?

Same as it ever was : she lied. Seven ways from Sunday. She lied about being cleared in all the Alaska investigations; she lied about their cost; she lied about wanting to serve the people of Alaska; she lied about fulfilling her goals; she lied about people attacking her son Trig; she lied about being like a point guard; she lied when she said " and " and " the " . She spoke , therefore she lied . </lie.v.3032><lie.v.3033>Lying ought to concern us. Yet what concerns us most is when a child lies compulsively. By that we mean that a child lies frequently or for no apparent reason. Parents subject to compulsive lying become suspicious and distrustful of their children , and the children conversely become more unruly and more dishonest. Once the cycle of lying and distrust is in full swing , it is difficult to find a single way in which the cycle may be stopped. That is the primary purpose of this pamphlet : to initiate a process of thinking through why a child lies , and then find the help necessary in discontinuing the behaviour . </lie.v.3033><lie.v.3034>At that rate , any moron can apply to be the poop pope , and they will be marching in and out , all trying to raise the dead.

I 've known that as long as I 've known you. You lie and you get yourself into trouble. Then you lie to get yourself out. You lie so you do n't hurt people 's feelings , even if the only person I 've ever seen that applied to is me. You lie so people think better of you. You lie so people wo n't think worse of you. And the worst part sometimes you lie for no reason at all. You 're a pathological liar , Hunter , and you know it. You do n't even deny it . </lie.v.3037><lie.v.3038>Ironic that most articles about why men lie are written by women. Men and women are not equal nor will they ever be equal. The brains are wired differently. If you want a man to be honest all the time , then the woman needs to provide an environment where he will feel safe. Men learn to lie to their woman due to the responses he gets from her. If she accepts what he says , doesn ' t judge , doesn ' t try to change him or his thinking , doesn ' t yell , bitch , etc. with what he says , then he won ' t lie. Problem is most woman will judge , complain , and refuse to accept the mans response as it is. Therefore , the man must lie to avoid extreme pain inflicted by the woman. And yes , to the woman it is not painful , but to a man being nagged and judged over an honest statement is pure torture. Most men would rather have a finger cut off than to go through the torture of nagging and bitching. For most men , they only lie because the woman has taught them to lie . </lie.v.3038><lie.v.3039>( 2 ) In the real world , if you try to spin your spouse , and s/he figures it out , you ca n't bag out of trouble by claiming what you said was a spin , not a lie. The rules are different in politics. To accuse your opponent of " lying " is a grave charge in politics , and in fact it is a charge that is almost never made in Democratic primary politics ( despite the fact that all successful Democratic politicians spin ) . In politics , spin is not a lie. That 's just the way the game is played . </lie.v.3039><lie.v.3040>As Wolberg states in his book , Medical Hypnosis , " The importance of Breuer 's work lies in the change of emphasis in hypnotic therapy , from the direct removal of symptoms to the dealing with the apparent cause of these symptoms.

Lying has a great effect in blackening the face and covering it with a mask of shame which every truthful person will be able to see. The feature of the liar is clearly visible in the face , and everyone who has the eyes to see can see it. But Allah will bless the truthful person with dignity and respect , so whoever sees him will respect him and love him , and He will give the liar humiliation and shame , so whoever sees him will loathe him and despise him. And Allah is the Source of strength . </lie.v.3041><lie.v.3042>As I 'm wrapping up my rescheduled phone call , the man I 'm interviewing mentions that he recently visited the just-refurbished art museum in my town. " Have you been yet ? " he asks , conversationally. The lie pops out before I have time to stop it : " Yes is n't it lovely ? " ( Well , I do drive by it five times a week. ) This is scarier than the deliberate lies I told yesterday it 's completely reflexive . </lie.v.3042><lie.v.3043>This week I found out that someone I trusted , who I considered a very good friend has been lying to me ( and not just once , but many , many times ) . I have n't confronted my friend yet ( let 's call her Mary ) because when I do it will change quite a few things in my world. ( Do n't get the wrong idea -- I did not discover my best friend is cheating with my husband. It is n't all that bad ) . I mean the lies themselves are n't the kind that would really harm anyone and that 's the part I do n't get at all. They are dumb lies that did n't need to be told -- not that there is an excuse for any lie . </lie.v.3043><lie.v.3044>Anyone with a history of fainting when receiving injections or having blood drawn should lie down before the procedure. They should try not to look at the needle , and their legs should be kept elevated if possible . </lie.v.3044><lie.v.3045>Critics of utilitarian justifications for lying further note how difficult it is for anyone , even honorable persons , to know that a lie will bring more good than the truth; the consequences of actions are too often unpredictable. Lies frequently assume " lives of their own " and result in consequences that people do not intend or fail to predict. Moreover , it is very difficult for a person to be objective in estimating the good and the harm that his or her lies will produce. We have a vested interest in the lies we tell and an equally vested interest in believing that the world will be better if we lie from one instance to the next. For these reasons , critics claim , lying is morally wrong because we can not accurately measure lies ' benefits and harms . </lie.v.3045><lie.v.3046>" Corn , whose weekly 's October 13 cover depicts Bush 's with a long Pinocchio nose , concedes in his book that 'a liar in the White House is not a remarkable development.

We have an explicit lie when the Report claims that the core of each of the Twin Towers consisted of a hollow steel shaft or when it claims that Vice President Cheney did not give the shoot-down order until after 10 : 10 that morning. But we have an implicit lie when the Commission , in its discussion of the 19 alleged suicide hijackers , omits the fact that at least six of them have credibly been reported to be still alive , or when it fails to mention the fact that Building 7 of the World Trade Center collapsed. Such omissions are implicit lies partly because they show that the Commission did not honor its stated intention to provide the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11. They are also lies insofar as the Commission could avoid telling an explicit lie about the issue in question only by not mentioning it , which , I believe , was the case in at least most instances . </lie.v.3048><lie.v.3049>Perjury , also known as forswearing , is the willful act of swearing a false oath or affirmation to tell the truth , whether spoken or in writing , concerning matters material to a judicial proceeding.

I was just home over the weekend and my mother , who voted for Hillary but will support Obama in the general if ( when ) he wins the nomination , said something to the effect of " But has n't Hillary won more votes ? " It 's sad because my mom immigrated here from Mexico and only has a 6th grade education level. The more Hillary repeats her lies over and over the more likely people are likely to believe them.

What times of crisis , however , justify this form of lying ? </lie.v.3057><lie.v.3058>Pluto rules upheaval , breakdown and decay , but also regeneration and the purifying fire of catharsis. It reflects the archetypal Underworld -- the dark , mysterious , and often terrifying reality which lurks beneath the surface of things , beneath our ego and societal conventions and the veneer of civilization , and which is periodically unleashed with great destructive and transformative force. Many of the problematic instincts that lie deep within the human psyche , such as murderous hatred , violent jealousy , compulsive greed and lust and so forth , reflect the activity of Pluto : this is Freud 's broiling cauldron of the instincts. Pluto is visible in the elemental power of a volcanic eruption , of a devouring lion , of a war , of an orgasm , of a mother in the climactic stages of giving birth. It is present in all violent , purgatorial discharge of pent-up energies -- from the Earth as in an earthquake , or from the human body and psyche as in therapy or in a psychotic break. Pluto is in many ways the polar complement of Neptune -- together they represent the great polarities of Dionysus and Apollo , the chthonic and the transcendent , the volcanic and the oceanic , nature and spirit , instinct and imagination. And , like Neptune , Pluto is unfathomable . </lie.v.3058><lie.v.3059>ON another occasion also St. Columba prophesied in the following manner of Cormac , grandson of Lethan , a truly pious man , who not less than three times went in search of a desert in the ocean , but did not find it.

He tries to pass these texts as having equal authority to the biblical texts written closer to the time of Jesus , and gives them equal authority to the gospels. Brown uses the Gospel of Thomas , the Gospel of Philip and the Gospel of Mary , none of which were authored by those named in their titles and none of which will be found in your Bible. The Gnostics emerged as a force in the third century.

It is Guillem who appeared in many major poems of the era , including Dantes Divine Comedy , and figured as the protagonist of Willehalm composed by Wolfram Von Eschenbach , composer of Parzifal , the most important of all romances dealing with the mysteries of the Grail. Thus it was that the English King Arthur was more likely an artificial construct meant to glorify the history of the Merovingian Bloodline in , of all places , southern France where the mystery of Rennes le Chateau is still one of the great puzzles of the new world Orders powerbase yet to be solved. It utilized known French historical battles of the times , and European personages and geography to thinly disguise the true characters of its plot.

The Founding Fathers , as brilliant and courageous as they were , lied to us. Abraham Lincoln , the so-called " Great Emancipator , " lied to us. The Supreme Court of the United States , in upholding Jim Crow laws , lied to us. Thankfully , one of the great things about this country is that over time , Americans get smarter. We recognize our transgressions and work to correct them. Some of the greatest advances in human rights have come after some of the greatest assaults on them.

Women are to remain silent with respect to teaching and having the authority of a man ( such things lie in a mans realm of duties ) . Women have no authority from God to take on responsibilities required of men , especially teaching , leadership and decision making. In these areas they are to be silent. A womans input , thoughts , feelings and ideas are to be expressed through her husband , not directly to the church.

It seems as if God tells Samuel to deceive Saul by saying his purpose of going somewhere is to perform a sacrifice , when his real purpose is a divine mission Saul would not have approved of. There is potential risk of life in this case , and it 's Samuel 's own life. Some use the " tell the truth deceptively but do n't lie " defense here , claiming that Samuel does n't say anything false , but I 've already explained why that approach has no moral weight. What Samuel does here is clearly deceptive , and God commands it of him. The one response I could find in the commentaries is by H.W. Hertzberg , who claims that it 's not a subterfuge sacrfice but one of Samuel 's duties that he would do anyway. That may be so. The sacrifice does n't have to be a subterfuge for Samuel 's statement to be a subterfuge if he deliberately leaves out information in order to deceive. So it seems pretty clear here that God is commanding his prophet to deceive Saul . </lie.v.3163><lie.v.3164>There is a symbiosis of Naomi and Ruth. Both Boaz and Naomi call Ruth my daughter.

Parents should set specific rules for lying , and specific punishments when lying occurs. These rules should be discussed with children before they are enforced. It is a good idea for parents to provide separate punishments for misbehavior and lying. When children misbehave but are honest about it , they should get a lesser punishment than when they misbehave and lie about it. Parents should make sure that there is a payoff for being honest. For example , when children are honest about their misdeeds , parents can praise their children for their honesty and then provide punishment for their misdeed. When children are dishonest about their misdeeds , they should provide a punishment for the dishonesty , and a punishment for the misdeed. Parents should be careful , however , not to be too severe or too frequent in their punishment , or their children may continue to lie as a means of protecting themselves . </lie.v.3166><lie.v.3167>Christians must resist the pull to treat Scripture as relative and subject to the latest poll or study.

Low level radiation is used to preserve the life and " sterilize " produce shipped out of its state of origin. Radiation reduces food value and may in fact alter its genetic structure ( IFT 2000 ) . For that matter , such produce may also possess a resistant strain of bacteria.

I do n't necessarily disagree with McCain on this point. I just do n't trust his judgement about lots of other stuff. He supported the misguided invasion of Iraq. That has distracted us from real threats , led to tens of thousands of unnecessary injured and dead soldiers , and drained our treasury. McCain 's choice of Palin as a running mate also disturbs me. She has no experience with national issues; she has abused her power in Alaska; and she lies about her accomplishments.

There is an old proverb that says , " What parents do in moderation , children do in excess. " " Moderate " lying is thought of by many parents as harmless ( such as a " white " lie , or a " harmless excuse " ) or mistakes ( such as an unkept promise ) , or even purposeful and calculated distortions of the truth ( " I had to lie because ... " ) . Children , however , do not appreciate the nuances of a lie. Since it is difficult for parents to control the lies that children will encounter outside the home , it is more useful to start eliminating lies from within the home.

Surely , for example , it is possible to lie to a would-be murderer , whether it is impermissible ( Augustine OL; Aquinas ST ( cf. MacIntyre 1995b ); Kant GMM ( cf. Mahon 2006c ); Newman 1880; Geach 1977; Betz 1985 ) or permissible ( Constant 1964; Mill 1863; Sidgwick 1981; Bok 1978; MacIntyre 1995a ) . It has also been objected against these definitions that they are morally lax ( Kemp and Sullivan 1993 , 158-9 ) , since , by rendering certain deceptive untruthful statements to others not lies , they make it permissible to act in a way that would otherwise be open to moral censure. In general , even those philosophers who hold that all lies have an inherent negative weight , albeit such that it can be overridden , and hence , who hold that lying is defeasibly morally wrong ( Bok 1978; Kupfer 1982; cf. Wiles 1988 ) , do not incorporate moral necessary conditions into their definitions of lying . </lie.v.3187><lie.v.3188>But even to ourselves , most of our observable personalities are not created by us , but are made up of the opinions of parents , siblings , teachers , spiritual leaders , friends , business acquaintances , and even enemies , with some input from us from the experiences we have had and the viewpoints we would like others to have about us. None of this is really us. It is just what others think. It started in our infancy when we thought that parents and others were always right and we accepted their observations without question. When we were older , we had trouble telling truth from error through our having limited perspectives. Actually , most of the things people have told us about ourselves are lies from limited viewpoints , but we have accepted those views anyway , often basing our personalities on them. We also have tried to create ourselves in images that would look good to the world , which is more lying , and so it is difficult to know where any truth is in relation to who we are . </lie.v.3188><lie.v.3189>This wasn ' t really a funny lie other than I ' m sure my face looked real funny afterwards.

This does not happen to every pregnant woman. However , if it does it is because your growing baby is making your uterus heavy , and is placing pressure on one of your major blood vessels called the 'vena cava'. The vena cava lies on the right side of your body. During pregnancy your enlarged uterus also naturally leans towards your right side ( as it moves up and out of the pelvis after 12 weeks ) . This can make the vena cava blood vessel prone to becoming compressed while lying on your back . </lie.v.3190><lie.v.3191>Lying to Get a Job " One in four people lie when applying for a job , " reports London 's Financial Times.

Actually , this is not the case. Experience has shown that if one lies down to concentrate or meditate , it is all too easy to day-dream , drowse or even fall asleep. Standing positions , on the other hand , make it impossible to relax sufficiently for the mind to be completely free to devote itself to meditation. Over the centuries Yogis have found that the sitting posture is infinitely the superior one , and so have adopted it . </lie.v.3268><lie.v.3269>Anubis is shown as a jackal-headed man , or as a jackal. With the god Thoth , his duty was to weigh the heart of each dead soul against a feather , the symbol of truth. The apparatus was a sort of lie-detector for the dead man to protest his innocence of various crimes; if he lied then the balance would respond , his heavy heart would sink on the scales. Anubis was responsible for the evisceration of the dead body , which during the embalming was assumed to have the ritual identity of the god Osiris. Anubis 'the faithful ' had assisted Isis in the original embalming which became the pattern for all subsequent ones. Jackals were frequent grave-robbers , so on the principle that like can defeat like , Anubis was honoured as a protector of the dead. His cult centre was Cynopolis or modern El Kes. His father was Osiris and his mother Nephythys . </lie.v.3269><lie.v.3270>A lie is a type of deception in the form of an untruthful statement with the intention to deceive , often with the further intention to maintain a secret or reputation , or to avoid punishment.

But note well ! These desires for safety and esteem are deceitful desires. Satan is deceiving the chief priests. It is a lie that popular esteem is to be desired more than speaking the truth. It is a lie that physical safety is to be desired more than speaking the truth. Ask the martyrs ! Listen to Jesus ! Do n't run from persecution by lying or evading a testimony of truth.

If the mother is by herself , she may sit on her haunches , or on a log. If she feels there may be any difficulty at all , she may place herself with her feet against a tree. Some say they put a vine around a tree and hold onto that. Others say that if they felt there would be any difficulty , they would have a friend sit opposite them feet to feet , " like trees in the forest. " However , even minor difficulty in delivery seems to be rare. The infant emerges easily , helped only by the mother 's hands or those of a friend , and is immediately placed to the mother 's breast as she lies down. The umbilical cord is cut in anything from a few minutes to as much as an hour or more later.

How could it be otherwise , since God has created man and woman to produce seed and to multiply ? Why should one not forestall immorality by means of marriage ? For if special grace does not exempt a person , his nature must and will compel him to produce seed and to multiply. If this does not occur within marriage , how else can it occur except in fornication or secret sins ? But , they say , suppose I am neither married nor immoral , and force myself to remain continent ? Do you not hear that restraint is impossible without the special grace ? For God 's word does not admit of restraint; neither does it lie when it says , " Be fruitful and multiply " [ Gen. 1 : 28 ] .

Many socio-political studies have shown that terrorists do not regard themselves as such. Any practical application of the technique faces a fundamental problem : if the suspects do not see themselves as terrorists , how can anyone tell if they are lying or not ? In other words , what are their terms of reference and what should those of the interrogator be ? </lie.v.3305><lie.v.3306>Some instances of lying are of greater concern than others.

If Joseph didn ' t father Jesus , then why does the Bible show Joseph ' s ancestors with two different lists ?

The original story had Jesus descended from David ( thru Joseph ) , to fulfill prophesy . </lie.v.3314><lie.v.3315>To understand why so much unnecessary technology is used during pregnancy and birth , it is necessary to understand how technology comes to be used.

Sadly , the truth lies in another direction. An example of a recent birth technology now rapidly spreading in the United States will illustrate the reality . </lie.v.3315><lie.v.3316>I think many get the commandment " Thou salt not bear false witness " and substitute " Thou shalt not lie " confused in concept. I think it 's how you differentiate the honesty intended. Such as telling a joke is usually a made-up story but with the intention of honest fun for laughter. In essence it 's a lie , but is not bearing false witness to others. Unless the joke gets out of hand to harm a person then it does become false witness.

A week after the fighting , I walked around the camp without a mask , with journalists from all over the world , and there was no smell. The journalists knew this , but all of a sudden , they claimed that there was a stench in the camp from bodies that had not been evacuated. Twenty-five bodies were found altogether , and most of the bodies were those of the terrorists. There may have been one area in the entire camp in which there were a number of bodies buried under the rubble , and this would explain the smell.

Adam saw that Eve had eaten of the fruit , and he must have concluded that she was not dead and thus God must have lied to them. He most likely based his response to a false perception of what he thought the situation was. Instead of believing God , he believed what his eyes saw and what his own wisdom concluded was real. He was wrong !

They have got it exactly and diametrically wrong. The discrimination and the deprivation , the sense of alarm and of resentment , lies not with the immigrant population but with those among whom they have come and are still coming. This is why to enact legislation of the kind before parliament at this moment is to risk throwing a match on to gunpowder.

Reagan Iran-Contra player Oliver North was honest enough to admit he lied to Congress during that scandal. Today 's Bush administration not only refuses to admit its lies but spins them around as a positive course for our nation and world. John Dean , White House counsel under Nixon , wrote in 2003 that Bush 's lies " are almost never justifiable ...

The premise of exploring one or two lies that are part of a mystery every week allows you to travel a wide range of cases , a wide range of worlds every week.

To lie is to state something that one knows to be false or that one does not honestly believe to be true with the intention that a person will take it for the truth. A liar is a person who is lying , who has previously lied , or who tends by nature to lie repeatedly - even when not necessary. Lying is typically used to refer to deceptions in oral or written communication. Other forms of deception , such as disguises or forgeries , are generally not considered lies , though the underlying intent may be the same. However , even a true statement can be used to deceive. In this situation , it is the intent of being overall untruthful rather than the truthfulness of any individual ... less Read article at Wikipedia </lie.v.3350><lie.v.3351>1642 ( implied in recumbency ) , from L. recumbentem ( nom. recumbens ) , prp. of recumbere " to recline , " from re- " back " + -cumbere " to lie down , " related to cubare " be lying " ( see cubicle ) .

Your response could be yes we argue sometimes and he may raise his voice. The next question is , Does your husband drink alcohol ? Your response could be yes he has several drinks a week. Now lets translate those benign responses and see what CPS may right in her paperwork. When the father drinks , he yells at children and wife and wife is a victim of domestic violence. This is a far cry on what really took place in that conversation.

The problem was not that he kept back a part of the price , but that he lied about the portion that he gave. What was in his heart that made him lie ? Satan ! To whom did he lie ? He lied to the Holy Spirit. This deception was conceived in his heart. " Keep your heart with all diligence , For out of it spring the issues of life " ( Prov. 4 : 23 ) .

It begs the question to assume that that requires never deceiving evildoers. John 8 : 32 speaks of those who know the truth about Jesus and its setting them free. That 's fairly irrelevant. John 8 : 44 says the devil always lies and is the father of lies. It does n't say that leaving your light on when you 're not home is wrong.

Bending over to tie their shoes could result in them having to lie on the floor until the blood returned to their head. A word of caution here : A significant number of women have gotten pregnant after too much to drink , and sometimes pregnancy and a hangover are hard to tell apart. The general rule should be that a hangover that lasts for more than a couple of days could be pregnancy , and it might be a good idea to give up the partying until you know for certain.

Clinton lies knowing that you know he 's lying. It 's brutal and it subjugates the person who 's being lied to. I resent deeply being constantly lied to. " </lie.v.3407><lie.v.3408>So , now it is up to us to achieve these things. We were brought to the point of experiencing the words in these pages for a purpose. They can help us image the way we would like to be if we review them often. They can come to us when needed. We can adapt them to fit our own ways of thinking. They can help us open ourselves to reception of the intuitions that are in each spiritual Self already as part of everybody 's oneness with God while on these human pathways. They can make us aware of levels of consciousness that offer continual happiness and peace. If those things are what we want at this point in life , it is up to us to commit ourselves to act to gain them. A beautiful life lies ahead . </lie.v.3408><lie.v.3409>April ' s fiction beautifully written ( condensed ! so short and bittersweet ! ) resonated with my own ambiguous feelings about relentless aging. I don ' t lie about my age , in fact , onceuponatime I told my teen-aged students each year , as they fed my ego by telling me their disbelief. Now , my world has become very small. I am caring for my dear and clear 91 year old mom. My age seems to be toting up fast as those numbers fly by on the gas pump and jolts me with much the same dismay. These months , years are leaking away , too fast , too small. I still don ' t lie , but no one doubts my truth . </lie.v.3409><lie.v.3410>And it ' s typical for him. I guess you must have missed the debates about how fucking UNcivil it is to allow men to go on and on about women aren ' t human beings , how they lie about rape and so forth and so on. If that ' s civility , you can keep it. But it ' s not civility at all : it ' s just a pretense. It allows men to act logical while reviving the women are hysterical cliche and to keep from seriously considering the reality of sexism and their place in a sexist world. Taht ' s what all the thread derailment is about. These guys don ' t want to end sexism : they want to either ignore it at best or they want to shout women into silence so nothing gets done . </lie.v.3410><lie.v.3411>The uterus is a hollow , muscular organ that lies in the pelvis between the rectum and the urinary bladder. The cervix is the lowermost part of the uterus. A pair of Fallopian tubes extend from each of its sides. It is the main organ of the reproductive system in which a fertilized ovum gets implanted and develops into a fetus through the period of pregnancy. The mucous membrane of the body of the uterus is called the endometrium. It provides a position for implantation of the fetus. The lining of the uterus is shed every month as a menstrual period , if conception does not occur . </lie.v.3411><lie.v.3412>Once upon a time a man called Adolf Hitler wrote a book called 'Mein Kampf'. In it he developed his ideas for the future. One of these was his 'Big Lie ' theory. It goes like this , " Small people tell small lies all the time , so if you are in charge of the country and tell a small lie , then people may not believe you , as it would be the sort of thing they would lie about. But , small people are too scared to tell Big Lies , so if you tell the people a Big Lie , then they will believe you ! " . Hitler died 55 years ago , but his Big Lie theory is still practised enthusiastically by politicians everywhere. It is practised right now in New Labour 's Britain . </lie.v.3412><lie.v.3413>The city has great significance to the Christian religion as it is believed to be the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth.

On the one hand being completely outraged by the fact that this man can get up and speak to the world , not only to this country , but to the world , lie after lie after lie. And on the other hand , to be honest , a little depressed that this man is the President of the United States.

As far as I ' m concerned Palin is more honest than anyone else on either ticket. Joe Biden is an admitted plagiarist and so is an admitted liar. How that for character ? Obama claims his pastor ' s anti american rants didn ' t affect him ..bull. Palin enjoys an 80 approval rate among Alaskans. Find me another politician with that number. She must be doing something right. You want honesty ? Here it is .Palin has turned this election in favor of the Republicans and Democrats don ' t know what to do other than attack her ..and that backfires.

It is acceptable to criticize legislation because of your religious beliefs. It is your right actually. To intentionally lie and mislead everyone who takes your word for truth , simply because you do n't agree with something , is horrendous. The hypocritical nature of this example exhibits why legislation like this should be passed to spite groups like this one , using the word 'family ' in its title to increase support and claim legitimacy. It is obvious that they are not representing the truth in what they are telling their public. They are simply constructing a truth to garner opposition to laws that only ensure equality for everyone and safeguards more people from hate crimes. The Indiana Family Institute is cultivating people to oppose equality by instilling fear into them via lies. They should be ashamed . </lie.v.3427><lie.v.3428>Chilcot himself sat on the 2004 Butler inquiry into the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war , which refused to hold Blair or anyone else accountable for the dodgy dossier culled from old Internet reports or false claims such as the assertion that Iraq had weapons that it could deploy against Britain within 45 minutes. It was a report that allowed Blair to declare in parliament , No one lied , no one made up intelligence. No one inserted things into the dossier against the advice of the intelligence services. </lie.v.3428><lie.v.3429>There 's no easy answer to this classic ethical dilemma.

Striding , staring , he glared at the statue of the Duke of Cambridge. He had been sent down from Oxford true. He had been a Socialist , in some sense a failure true.

If you take a look back in history , women were on their hands and knees doing daily chores such as gardening or cleaning the floor , sitting in straight backed chairs , or leaning forward over the sink while hand washing the dishes. This forward positioning of the pelvis allowed gravity to rotate the heaviest parts of the baby ( the back of the head and the spine ) forward to align with the curve of Mom 's belly and into the best position for a normal birth. It seems that [ today ] babies are " encouraged " to lie in the woman 's pelvis in the posterior position ( the back of the baby 's head lies against Mom 's spine ) during pregnancy because of maternal posture and our lax lifestyle. What this means is that the modern pregnant woman tends to use postures in her every day life that do not assist in aligning her baby into the most effective position for the labor and birth of her baby. Any position that tilts Mom 's pelvis back ... such as a couch , computer chair , recliner , or bucket seat , may persuade her unborn baby to position himself to the back or posterior part of her pelvis . </lie.v.3439><lie.v.3440>Please , verdure , tell us some of the facts misrepresented by the media concerning the Bush Administration.

The ascending node is the intersection , from south to north , between the ecliptic and the Moon ' s path , as normally it will lie either above and below the observed ecliptic. One draconic period is given as 27.212 22 days , 0.109 44 days shorter than the sidereal period. This value means that the orbit regresses by some 193 per year , or 16 times each draconic month. The realignment of these nodes takes about nine years to complete. ( See Figure 2. ) Combining the movement of the draconic month with the time the Sun crosses the same lunar node , is the basis for the calculation of eclipses with the Saros cycle. For these two to align it takes 6585.78 just over nineteen years eleven ( 11 ) days. A repetition of solar eclipses within the Saros cycle can only occur when these two are again in alignment . </lie.v.3460><lie.v.3461>Hillary Clinton is at least honest about her campaign.

Hold your head up for 10-15 seconds , lie it back down and repeat several times. Do this morning , noon and night. Gradually reach your hands out over the knees and lift your head and shoulders as high as you can. Do n't worry about a full sit-up. You will get stronger. An easy one you can do standing is stand in front of a counter with your trunk bent forward and rest your hands on the counter. Now in that position try to lift the front of your pelvis with your tummy muscles. Make a little tuck by humping your back a little like a cat stretching. Hold the tuck for a few seconds.

If a Christian believes that lying would be wrong in a particular instance , he is not to lie in that instance. It may be that the lie itself would have been appropriate apart from the Christians conscience , but his decision to lie against his conscience is an act of rebellion against God. Otherwise , the lie can not be praiseworthy , for all acts pleasing to God must be done in faithfulness to him.96 Clearly the Father and Jesus acted with clear consciences , and Scripture gives no hint that Rahabs conscience disagreed with her lie . </lie.v.3467><lie.v.3468>I can honestly say I have NEVER lied to my therapist ( s ) and I tell them that up-front , so that they won ' t be surprised with the stuff I come out with which is often ' inappropriate ' .

" Whence with His own lips the Lord saith , " Let your communication be yea , yea; nay , nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

As birth gets closer , the area around the vagina begins to bulge out until the top of the baby 's head can be seen at the vaginal opening. The mother should be encouraged to push the baby 's head out gently in any position that is comfortable for her. She does not have to lie on her back in bed; but , you will feel safer if she is lying down or squatting so the baby can slip gently onto a soft surface . </lie.v.3476><lie.v.3477>Are you ready for this roller coaster ride ... .well the new truth about truth lies in the truth that truth can lie when the truth we speak , read or write is merely part of a greater truth . </lie.v.3477><lie.v.3478>In 2003 , Dawson underwent a rehabilitation program to avoid prosecution on a charge of prescription drug fraud.

It is more important that people are honest with themselves in the first place in order to avoid saying and doing things that are misleading in a relationship. Lack of self-understanding is the biggest cause of misrepresentation in relationships , not deliberate and malicious deceit. Lying sacks of shit exist on both sides too be sure , but they are n't the most common cause grief in romances. The mundane situation where someone likes someone so much that they convince themselves that they can be what the other person wants ( and frequently , they do n't even know what they really want ) seems to be the most common relationship lie either side engages in . </lie.v.3479><lie.v.3480>Lying , as defined by St. Thomas Aquinas , is a statement at variance with the mind. This definition is more accurate than most others which are current. Thus a recent authority defines a lie as a false statement made with the intention of deceiving. But it is possible to lie without making a false statement and without any intention of deceiving. For if a man makes a statement which he thinks is false , but which in reality is true he certainly lies inasmuch as he intends to say what is false , and although a well-known liar may have no intention of deceiving others for he knows that no one believes a word he says yet if he speaks at variance with his mind he does not cease to lie . </lie.v.3480><lie.v.3481>No , you do n't have it straight.

And since this is asserted by the texts above rehearsed , we must see that to ask , whether a man ought to tell a lie for the safety of another , is just the same as asking whether for another 's safety a man ought to commit iniquity. But if the salvation of the soul rejects this , seeing it can not be secured but by equity , and would have us prefer it not only to another 's , but even to our own temporal safety : what remains , say they , that should make us doubt that a lie ought not to be told under any circumstances whatsoever ?

Newton represented an orbiting body by a point mass , for instance , while working out the law of gravity. No scientific theory should be considered valid or complete , however , unless it can be reconciled with the real world to an acceptable degree of approximation that is both useful and falsifiable. The fallacy of reductionism lies in asserting that the subset represents the essence of the whole , and nothing else need be considered in the explanation : e.g. , Thomas Hobbes view of man as merely a machine subject to physical laws. Clearly our bodies obey the law of gravity , but can our human qualities like honesty , rationality or altruism be reduced to material substances ? In his view , yes but then , such an assumption would undermine his own rationality , and consequently , the validity of his philosophical system ( see self-referential fallacy ) . </lie.v.3513><lie.v.3514>2.

Cheney ' s command performance is indicative of the rewriting of history. According to Mr. Cheney , waterboarding isn ' t torture. We know that ' s a lie , of course , because waterboarding was declared torture ( and a war crime ) during World War II. Oddly enough , the United States tried , convicted and punished Japanese officers , like Yukio Asano , for waterboarding. He was convicted for waterboarding a US civilian and was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor for his crime . </lie.v.3538><lie.v.3539>" The Administration PRESENTED intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted or even non-existent " .They flat out lied to Congress.There 's the direct quote . </lie.v.3539><lie.v.3540>Quiet descended on her , calm , content , as her needle , drawing the silk smoothly to its gentle pause , collected the green folds together and attached them , very lightly , to the belt. So on a summer ' s day waves collect , overbalance , and fall; collect and fall; and the whole world seems to be saying that is all more and more ponderously , until even the heart in the body which lies in the sun on the beach says too , That is all. Fear no more , says the heart. Fear no more , says the heart , committing its burden to some sea , which sighs collectively for all sorrows , and renews , begins , collects , lets fall. And the body alone listens to the passing bee; the wave breaking; the dog barking , far away barking and barking . </lie.v.3540><lie.v.3541>The U.S. immigration system is based on the information provided by the immigrants themselves , and it can not work unless the government is able to collect truthful information. To protect the integrity of the system , the government has imposed severe penalties on those who lie in their applications for visas , admission into the U.S. , or any other immigration benefit . </lie.v.3541><lie.v.3542>More importantly , Scripture contains examples of times when God has lied or dealt deceivingly. Two examples should suffice. First , 1 Kings 22 : 19-2346 presents the following account of Gods complicity with deception and false prophecy : </lie.v.3542><lie.v.3543>Although we think of truthfulness as a young child ' s paramount virtue , it turns out that lying is the more advanced skill. A child who is going to lie must recognize the truth , intellectually conceive of an alternate reality , and be able to convincingly sell that new reality to someone else. Therefore , lying demands both advanced cognitive development and social skills that honesty simply doesn ' t require. It ' s a developmental milestone , Talwar has concluded . </lie.v.3543><lie.v.3544>However , there are individuals who seem to lie automatically without the intention to deceive. Jerald Jellison , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California , suggests that this may be due to momentum. A person who gets away with his first lie may be carried by the momentum of how easy it is to slip a lie past people. The second time around , it gets easier to repeat the lie with embellishments. The more you get away with it , the more you lie. And before you know it , lying has become second nature . </lie.v.3544><lie.v.3545>Genesis 47 : 30 But I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said , I will do as thou hast said. ( KJV DBY WBS NAS RSV ) </lie.v.3545><lie.v.3546>Indeed , human souls are a bit like Lie 's ceramic porcelains. The rounded surface appears smooth , calm , and undisturbed. However , on the concave side of the surface lies a complex , delicate texture , covered with reliefs and fine lines , symbolizing a tumultuous anxiety that rages within. Knowing yourself and distinguishing yourself from others require a special courage. Loneliness and emptiness come and go , but humans are n't allowed to remain stuck , like the cars trapped in the gridlock of Jakarta 's streets . </lie.v.3546><lie.v.3547>That ' s really all we get from this. We see that he wants the truth , but then he lies all the time. Either it ' s poor writing ( which I don ' t see it as ) or we ' re beginning to see that Eddie just isn ' t right in the head. I especially liked the scene when he freaks out at ESU , it shows that when his lies don ' t work , he really has nothing left to fall back on . </lie.v.3547><lie.v.3548>In the US , for example , Roe v Wade established a tripartite scheme of increasing restriction on abortion as fetal development progressed. During the first trimester , abortion is relatively unrestricted , and it is during this period that the vast bulk of abortions take place. During the second trimester abortion is much more restricted , and generally only takes place if there are health problems or indications of fetal malformation. During the third trimester abortion is strictly limited to preserving the life or health of the mother. Do you see abortion on demand , no questions asked there dipshit ? No ? What a fucking surprise , because that ' s never been the goal of the pro-choice movement , its a filthy fucking lie you so-called pro-life scumbags like to toss around and nothing else . </lie.v.3548><lie.v.3549>Ok , men lie and so do women , but why would a man lie about getting a phone call from another woman to his partner , and the partner knows the other woman ..but yet he still insists he never got the call nor talked to the other woman and yet the partner has proof he did ..why lie when the partner knows ..and yet when she confronts him in a nice way he still lies .why do men do this </lie.v.3549><lie.v.3550> The Death of American Virtue , due out in February , asserts that Clinton had yet another extramarital affair , with Susan McDougal of Whitewater fame.

Even the good doctors , even the ones I really liked , lied to me. They could n't seem to help it. It created the disconcerting feeling of being twelve in a room full of adults who all absolutely insisted the Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny were real , even though I 'd known differently for years. Even when you speak up , you get dismissed. Affably , lovingly dismissed , but dismissed none the less. I never felt like this with my midwife . </lie.v.3552><lie.v.3553>Wherefore , that man lies , who has one thing in his mind and utters another in words , or by signs of whatever kind. Whence also the heart of him who lies is said to be double; that is , there is a double thought : the one , of that thing which he either knows or thinks to be true and does not produce; the other , of that thing which he produces instead thereof , knowing or thinking it to be false . </lie.v.3553><lie.v.3554>In many cases , parents of children who lie have unusually high standards of behavior and expectations. These youngsters know right from wrong and , in what they view as a difficult situation , are trying to save face . </lie.v.3554><lie.v.3555>Dr. Simon Middleton 's research interests lie in the area of early American social and cultural history , particularly the intersection of daily life , political theory , and law in an urban setting resulted in his recent book , From Privileges to Rights : Work and Politics in Colonial New York City He is now working on a study of John Underhill , an English puritan who travelled widely in the New World in the colonial period . </lie.v.3555><lie.v.3556>Lying Defined is something said with intent to deceive. It is not always a spoken word that is a lie , for a life lived under false pretenses , a hypocritical life , may be a lie equally with a false word ( Jer 23 : 14 ) . or a false system ( Rom 3 : 7 ) . Error , as opposed to truth , is a lie ( 1 John 2 : 21 ) .

He lied , repeatedly and under oath , to a grand jury in a federal criminal investigation. And along the way he engaged his minions to lie about Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones , who accused him of sexual harassment and about Juanita Broaddrick , who accused him of rape. He brushed the rape charge aside , using his lawyer as a mouthpiece , but the charge stands uncontested on any important detail . </lie.v.3559><lie.v.3560>We find ourselves living in a society that actually conditions us to lie. Our employers ask us to lie for them on many occasions. For instance , the secretary who " covers " for the boss when he does n't want to be disturbed and the salesman who makes claims for his product which are not true are both lying. Many times our " embellishments " on job recommendations for friends and acquaintances are nothing but lies. I suppose it is possible that the Christian might try to convince himself that these little lies are not really important enough to worry about. But God makes it clear that " all liars shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone , which is the second death " ( Revelation 21 : 8 ) . </lie.v.3560><lie.v.3561>" Yeah , he was there , I must 've put it on by mistake " .

I hope that makes you feel good . </lie.v.3561><lie.v.3562>Put on your gloves and get in a place where you can see the baby come out. Remind mom to push gently even when she wants to push hard. As the baby comes out , mom will feel a lot of burning around the vagina and this is when she may make a lot of noise. After the head is born , look and feel with your fingers to find out if the cord is around the baby 's neck. If you find a cord around the neck , this is not an emergency ! Gently lift the cord over the baby 's If the head is born but the body does not come out after 3 pushes , the mom must lie down on her back , put two pillows under her bottom , bring her knees up to her chest , grab her knees and push hard with each contraction . </lie.v.3562><lie.v.3563>Not long ago , one of my formerly favorite politicians got caught with his pants down. Making the situation worse , he did n't just lie a little about it over the course of a year or so , he 'd lied a lot. My 15-year-old son listened to me rail for a few moments , then said coolly , " Oh , Mom , stop it. Everybody lies. " </lie.v.3563><lie.v.3564>When I was seven , my mom sat me and my brother and sister down and told us she had cancer and had six months to live. My mom is still alive today. My mother is the biggest liar I know. Even today , as a grandmother of twelve , she lies about almost everything . </lie.v.3564><lie.v.3565>From a landlubber 's perspective , a kelp forest hardly seems appealing. Tourists may naively regard the floating , brown mats as unsightly intrusions on their grand oceanic views. Ask any inhabitant of the kelp forest and you will undoubtedly receive a more enlightened response. It seems that every creature residing in this realm has some connection to the seaweed we call giant kelp. Indeed , the surface canopy barely hints at the diverse , bountiful world lurking beneath the gray waters. Big Sur , Point Lobos , Carmel Bay , Monterey Bay -- surely among the most magnificent coastal vistas anywhere on the planet.

What 's interesting is that we know we 've all done it at one time or another. When we think about it , there 's different ways of telling a lie , and some of us think that some of these ways are n't really lie at all. Some of us will say that they have never lied in their life. Most of us hate to admit that we do because it feels shameful and we know that we should n't do it in the first place. Then when asked why they lied , they will think of another lie right on top of that one. Anything so it sounds good and to still avoid the real truth. Sound familiar ? </lie.v.3570><lie.v.3571>it 's not lying if they make you lie ... some women will only accept what they want to hear. in a way they are lying to themselves . </lie.v.3571><lie.v.3572>Prayers are recited in Avesta and in a later form of Middle Persian basically learned by rote. Both the languages lie beyond the comprehension of the reciting priests and the listening laypersons. Only a small number of Zoroastrian scholars know what the prayers mean. No standard translation of the holy texts exist in English , Persian , or Gujarati. Most of the available translations , especially of the Gathas , are by non-Zoroastrian scholars in a scholarly language that rob the " scriptural " texts of their beauty. The sublime songs of Zarathushtra lie too philologically analyzed to inspire and deliver the divine message. The laity has only one book to be spiritually contented with : Khordeh Avesta , usually in Persian , Gujarati , or English script and without a translation. Moreover , neither the priests nor the laity know the relevance or irrelevance of the ritual to the texts recited during the performance . </lie.v.3572><lie.v.3573>Figure 1 provides a model of this hierarchy of results for the family planning and health sector. The various levels in this model are not identified as SO- or IR-level because it is for each operating unit to interpret what lies within its own manageable interest. For example , one mission may believe that it can affect fertility while another may feel that only a change in contraceptive prevalence or access is within its manageable interest. While the level chosen for the SO may differ , the hierarchy of results remains much the same . </lie.v.3573><lie.v.3574>But Sam ' s not the only one playing fast and loose with the truth this episode.

You humans , Tessa says. You lie to yourself all the time ! You say things like He ' s gone to a better place , when you ' re all scared to death of , um , death. And Dean , you know in your heart of hearts that there are no miracles , and that if you were brought back , it ' s because there ' s something nasty around the corner that you ' re going to have to deal with.

No woman ever lies , and all women are honorable and chaste . </lie.v.3575><lie.v.3576>In practice , however , we face not one simple choice , but two more complex choices : how much error to accept , and which kinds. To further complicate matters , the " which kind " choice often affects the " how much " choice. Most policy decisions must trade off the risk of " Type 1 " errors ( false positives ) , which give a legal benefit or burden to the wrong person , against the risk of " Type 2 " errors ( false negatives ) , which fail to give it to the right person. Do we care more about , say , officials giving a disability award to all who are legally eligible for it than we do about preventing ineligible people from receiving it through lies or other errors ? Among the factors affecting this trade-off are how costly it would be to reduce each type of error , and how important the benefit is to the individuals seeking it. If it is essential to their well-being , then we are more likely to accept the risk of erroneously giving it to ineligibles. The central points , however , are that the law must choose between the two kinds of errors , and that in choosing , it must often accept ( and in effect reward ) some level of lying . </lie.v.3576><lie.v.3577>The bible is a clear , logical and consistent treasure trove of prophecy which is repeated.

The conflict lies in the choice between being wholly themselves or being divided; between ejecting the oppressor within or not ejecting them; between human solidarity or alienation; between following prescriptions or having choices; between being spectators or actors; between acting or having the illusion of acting through the action of the oppressors; between speaking out or being silent , castrated in their power to create and re-create , in their power to transform the world.

So these are reasons why police have become more heavily weaponized. Plus , respect for police has gone into the crapper. Blame for this lies with the police as well as with civilians. Frustration on both sides heat up seemingly benign situations and if there is a gun within reach someone is going to suffer. This has created a very dangerous atmosphere for unarmed citizens which has lead to increased gun sales. It has become an arms race between citizens and their protectors. All of this adds up to the increased need to protect our rights to bear arms and to loudly declare our opposition to our government paving the way for martial law. No one wants to see our cities become militarized police zones.

We still maintain the bedtime ritual of bath and reading aloud , however , I do n't lie down with him.

There is some debate whether a lie told in pursuit of another virtue ( e.g. , compassion : the brother 's lie to his sister 's drunken husband is motivated by compassion for her physical safety ) is right or wrong. This apparent conflict between virtues is managed by most ethicists through a concept called the unity of the virtues. This doctrine states that the virtuous person , the ideal person we continuously strive to be , can not achieve one virtue without achieving them all. Therefore , when facing a seeming conflict between virtues , such as a compassionate lie , virtue ethics charges us to imagine what some ideal individual would do and act accordingly , thus making the ideal person 's virtues one 's own. In essence , virtue ethics finds lying immoral when it is a step away , not toward , the process of becoming the best persons we can be . </lie.v.3641><lie.v.3642>I watched the video in its entirety.

For example , if you observe a student frequently lying to classmates about her achievements , it is likely that she feels insecure and is trying to gain status with her peers. Look for ways for the child to gain peer attention by highlighting her actual accomplishments. If a student tells a classmate that she has a lot of friends in another class when you know that is n't true , the student might be conveying feelings of social isolation , suggesting another avenue for teacher intervention . </lie.v.3675><lie.v.3676> " The next clause strengthens the one we have been discussing by adding 'in sorrow [ or pain ] you will bring forth children'.

I am by no means a feminist but I am a Real Estate attorney and most Real Estate attorneys are men. I have had the other attorney ask me to photocopy something for him , I have been asked if I am the attorney 's secretary , etc. While I do not think that all women should start pretending they are men , I do think that a little bit of leeway on this one is well-deserved.

That angle demonstrated that the joint surfaces were incongruent , they did not match one against the other. I believe that you can demonstrate SIJD with plain films , but not A/P , lateral or oblique. It must be done from the back or front with the x-ray aimed at the planar surfaces. This may require two procedures for each joint , because the S1 segment is at a different angle from the S3 segment. For instance , to visualize the right SIJ from the back , I think that the x-ray should be taken from an angle of about 20 degrees medial from sagital for the S1 segment and about 5 degrees lateral from sagital to visualize the S3 segment. Simply look for incongruity in how the ilial surface of the SIJ lies against the sacral surface of the SIJ. You might be able to visualize the disruption at the posterior aspect of the S3 segment. I hope this does n't upset too many radiologists . </lie.v.3679><lie.v.3680>[ ... ] The list of rumors , innuendo , and outright lies attacking Governor Palin is astounding , imagine the outrage and umbrage the media would be taking if this dirty tricks campaign were against Nancy Pelosi.

Our social feeling constantly reminds us of the fact. This does not mean that social feeling is constantly in our conscious thoughts; but it does require a certain amount of determination to deny it and set it aside. Furthermore , social feeling is so universal that no one is able to begin any activity without first being justified by it. The need for justifying each act and thought originates in our unconscious sense of social unity. At the very least it is the reason why we seek extenuating circumstances to excuse our actions. Interestingly enough , social feeling is so fundamental and important that , even if we have not developed this ability to consider others as fully as most people have done , we still make efforts to appear as if we had done so. This means that the pretense of social feeling is sometimes used to conceal the antisocial thoughts and deeds that are the true expressions of a personality.

" Transfer factors and the immune sytem </lie.v.3744><lie.v.3745>We sometimes find ourselves in a situation where we are forced to lie for the sake of protecting somebody - say , a best friend. This may include telling a fib to corroborate the person 's story ( 'Yes , she went to the cinema with me ' ) , or , for a nobler cause , taking responsibility for something you did not do just so that the other person does not get punished. The latter is a little hard to explain , but it 's in the name of altruism. Say somebody in your lab broke a piece of equipment - a glass pipette , for instance - but did not own up. Your project leader is furious because the culprit does n't have the decency to come forward. Rather than have everybody 's position jeopardised because the boss thinks your lot untrustworthy , you step forward and say , 'I did it'. You will inevitably get some flak from the boss for being sloppy , but at least you have shown him that there is honesty amongst you ( ironic , is n't it , lying so that you 'll be called honest ) and you have let everybody else off the hook . </lie.v.3745><lie.v.3746>I don ' t understand why one should disown their own children because they dropped out of school and lied about it.

The external monitors are attached to a heavy elastic band that is strapped across the mother 's abdomen. She must lie quietly so the monitors do not slip. The baby 's heart beat is recorded on a machine that documents the moment to moment heart rate on graph paper along with the mother 's contractions. The internal monitor does the same things , but it is attached directly into the baby 's head by a metal screw. The uterine contractions are monitored by a probe that is inserted into the uterus. Some feel that this is a more accurate reading . </lie.v.3747><lie.v.3748>Then , our lying got out of control. It was almost as if we started to glorify lying. Joe Millionaire was a likeable guy despite his steady stream of lies to potential new wives. The biggest and most skilled liar won a million dollars on ' Survivor ' or earned a position working for Donald Trump. A greedy woman lied about being raped in order to sue a basketball star and escaped punishment when she was found out. Our very own president of the United States chose to perjure himself in a court of law rather than simply say , Fuck off , it ' s none of your damn business. </lie.v.3748><lie.v.3749>Hillary has distorted the facts as well. See factcheck.org. She passed around a flier in New Hampshire and Nevada stating that Obama was going to impose a 1 trillion dollar tax " on hard-working people. " Obama only said he might consider " raising the cap " from $ 97 , 000 to $ 200 , 000. ONly 6 percents make over $ 97K so no tax increase there. People who get $ 200K get SS too. SS is just funded largely by middle class. Hillary lied about Obama voting for an Energy bill that gave tax breaks to oil and gas companies. FALSE. Oil and gas taxes will gradually increase. There more and more. I do n't want a president who misleads voters to win. I WANT CHANGE. It amazes me that people on TV just shrug it off as " politics as usual. " That 's the last thing I want. Hillary also voted for that bankruptcy legislation favoring credit card companies , etc. Her health care proposal would have college kids buy their own health insurance while Obama would have them stay on their parents plan. I think it 's more accurate to state that she would have 15 million more paying for health insurance not left out . </lie.v.3749><lie.v.3750>She lies there for hours , not moving.

He ate a good diet. He ate at regular , frequent intervals and in small quantities. He was n't greedy. He took regular exercise etc. We then started to talk about his business and the problems he was having with his business partner , the fact that his partner was lying to him. The intuitive coin suddenly dropped and I understood it all. I paused him and hit him straight between the eyes ( metaphorically speaking ! ) . I said , " what about all the lies you tell ? " He now had nowhere to hide and it all came out . </lie.v.3755><lie.v.3756>Solomon too , discussed the Lord 's hatred of lying ( Proverbs 6 : 16-19 ) . And when writing of the lovingkindness of the Lord , Isaiah said , " For He said , 'Surely , they are My people , sons who will not deal falsely ' " ( Isaiah 63 : 8 ) . Nahum , in his prophesy against Nineveh , had this accusation against its inhabitants : " Woe to the bloody city , completely full of lies and pillage " ( Nahum 3 : 1 ) . </lie.v.3756><lie.v.3757>Other texts that state Gods inability to lie , however , mention no explicit promise , such as : God is not a man , that He should lie , Nor a son of man , that He should repent; 42 and He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind.43 Nevertheless , these too refer to Gods oaths and/or statements of certainty as those things of which God will not repent and about which he will not change his mind.44 Moreover , these verses place Gods repentance or change of mind on the level with his lying , so that his ability to change his mind is as limited as his ability to lie but Scripture clearly indicates many times when God repents and changes his mind , 45 implying that there may also be instances in which God lies. Thus , these verses demonstrate only that God can not or will not lie when he has given his word , not that he can not or will not do so under any circumstance. In short , there is no scriptural impediment to the possibility that God may lie . </lie.v.3757><lie.v.3758>Some adolescents discover that lying may be considered acceptable in certain situations such as not telling a boyfriend or girlfriend the real reasons for breaking up because they do n't want to hurt their feelings.

A lot of partners are dishonest , are so because of cheating and disloyal acts in relationships these days , which is the major reason why you must be able to catch and spot a lie as soon as possible. Catching dishonesty is not hard , as long as you watch for the key signals , however , it is critical to your relationship to be able to know when your partner is lying- so that you do n't get walked all over.

The position of the uterus is affected by the amount of distension in the urinary bladder and in the rectum. Enlargement of the uterus in pregnancy causes it to rise up into the abdominal cavity , so that there is closer alignment with the vagina. The nonpregnant uterus also curves gently forward; it is said to be anteflexed. The uterus is supported and held in position by the other pelvic organs , by the muscular floor or diaphragm of the pelvis , by certain fibrous ligaments , and by folds of peritoneum. Among the supporting ligaments are two double-layered broad ligaments , each of which contains a uterine tube along its upper free border and a round ligament , corresponding to the gubernaculum testis of the male , between its layers. Two ligamentssometimes called Mackenrodt 's ligamentsat each side of the cervix are also important in maintaining the position of the uterus . </lie.v.3787><lie.v.3788>Luke 13 : 29 And they shall come from east and west , and from north and south , and shall lie down at table in the kingdom of God.

The illuminating message of the Prophet is craftily avoided , or even displaced. The life of moral striving and the goal of establishing the Rule of Righteousness is utterly ignored.

Performance of information or logistical systems is presented as an element of quality of services , but elsewhere may relate more to sustainability than to quality. Community support may likewise be thought to relate more to sustainability than to demand. Indeed , Volume II of this series , which focuses on sustainability , explores measuring systems strengthening , levels of community support , and changes in personal attitudes further than the discussions found here under the headings of quality and demand.

Therefore , according to those who hold this position , lying is sometimes right because showing mercy to the innocent is a greater moral duty than telling the truth to the guilty. For instance , while listening to a religious radio station , I heard a denominational preacher teaching a lesson on the need to lie under certain circumstances.

Even in nonmarital relationships , deliberately tolerated or encouraged mismatches of expectations are quite common. If one member of a couple has communicated a wish to be exclusive , in my rulebook the other has a reciprocal responsibility to be truthful about whether or not this is agreeable. The consequences of lying are not just emotional but because of disease , may bring severe physical harm.

It needs be said at the outset of this investigation that all biblical Characters save the members of the godhead are flawed , and are to be expected to sin. It is also admitted that God often blesses his people despite their sin. Nevertheless , it is literarily apparent that in some instances God approves of lies and deceptions carried out by his people. One of the most infamous instances of a liar blessed by God is Rahab , who was blessed and praised for her protection of Joshuas spies.63 </lie.v.3891><lie.v.3892>And now ?

Here are just a few of [ Satan s ] lies : That men are smarter , have all the power , and are more important , so if we want to have influence we should be more like them; that marriage and family are confining; that motherhood is menial and a waste of any talented woman s time; that women are perpetually frazzled and failing; and that a woman s value is based on her size , shape and what she accomplishes outside the home. Too many women have bought these lies. Our culture is disintegrating at the speed of light , and unfortunately , our gender is doing a lot of the damage . </lie.v.3893><lie.v.3894>The introduction of the book raised several questions like , why do men lie ? Why do they feel they have to be right bout everything ? Why do they insist on talking a subject to death ? Why they do not initiate sex more often ? In this section the behaviours of men and women are thoroughly discussed and later the need for understanding the opposite sex to have smoothed marital and family relationships has been explained. The book is not only written not only in a great and easy to understand method but also is consists of many funny statements and lines , spreads all over the books to create more interest among the readers. The book is so interesting that it can even induce to read to the people who have not reading habits.

Be sure to tell him first that you believe he has lied and because of that , consequences will follow. For example , if your child denies drawing on his walls , you might say , " I know that you drew on your walls , as I saw you do it earlier today. Now I will help you clean it up , but it is never OK to lie to me.

The devil is a master liar. Jesus explained , " He [ Satan ] was a murderer from the beginning , not holding to the truth , for there is no truth in him.

I have watched her in action and her face does this weird creepy thing when she is lying . </lie.v.3899><lie.v.3900>There are several problems with this definition. According to it , a person who makes a statement that she believes to be true a person who makes a truthful statement with the intention to deceive another person , is lying , if , unbeknownst to her , the statement is false. For example , if A tells B that there is not a board meeting on Thursday , which A believes to be true , with the intention that B believe there is no board meeting this week , which A believes to be false ( since A believes there is a board meeting on Wednesday ) , then A is lying to B , if A is mistaken , and there is a board meeting on Thursday. Also , according to this definition , conspirators who knowingly make untruthful and false statements to each other , without the intention to deceive each other , but with the intention to deceive eavesdroppers , are lying. Both of these cases are controversial , and it is not clear that we should classify either of these cases as lies . </lie.v.3900><lie.v.3901>Most people who lie are not entirely comfortable doing so.

But the past will not be forgotten. Eve ' s shattered memory has helped Cole walk on murder charges just as a new series of killings begins. The latest murders are bizarre and baffling. The victims are killed in a ritual fashion , a series of numbers tattooed into their bodies. 212. 101. 111. 323. There is no clue to their meaning , no connection to the victims except one : Our Lady of Virtues Hospital , the crumbling old asylum that was once the scene of unspeakable madness. For Eve , it was a second home as a child. Her father was a doctor there , and she spent hours exploring its secret chambers , hidden rooms , and forbidden passageways. Somewhere in its decaying rooms lies the key to a terrible crime , a betrayal beyond imagining whose echoes are now being felt with a vengeance a crime that seems to lead to Eve herself. And the only man she can trust with the search is Cole , her former lover and , just possibly , a cold-blooded killer . </lie.v.3902><lie.v.3903>Karen has been in full time private practice in Cheshire since 1993.

God sent a spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ( Jdg. 9 : 23 ) . A distressing spirit from the LORD was sent upon Saul ( 1S. 16 : 14; 18 : 10; 19 : 9 ) . In response to Hezekiahs prayer for help , God sent a spirit upon Sennacherib , the king of Assyria , so that he would hear a rumor and return to his own land ( 2K. 19 : 7 ) .41 A lying spirit , in the mouth of Ahabs prophets persuaded Ahab to go up , that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead ( 1K. 22 : 10-23; 2Chr. 18 : 21-22 ) . Most frightening of all , Paul records that God will send strong delusion so they should believe the lie ( 2Th. 2 : 11 ) . God , who is not the author of evil , utilizes evil , turning and manipulating it so that in its rebellion it ultimately brings about that which is sovereignly His will. This fact of Scripture is both impossible to avoid and impossible to fully apprehend . </lie.v.3912><lie.v.3913>In the early days of prenatal sex selection , only two options were available to determine the sex of a fetus : amniocentesis and CVS. Amniocentesis involves the withdrawal of a small amount of the amniotic fluid , which surrounds the fetus within the amniotic sac. The CVS procedure involves taking a small biopsy from the placenta.16 Both of these methods are invasive and carry some risk for both the mother and the fetus.17 Despite these risks , many women request these procedures. Indeed , some women who have no therapeutic reason to undergo the tests lie about their medical histories in order to convince their doctors that the tests are medically necessary.18 </lie.v.3913><lie.v.3914>The difficulty in saying categorically whether lying is bad rests on the fact that the answer can really depend very much on the circumstances.

I 'm convinced that that has probably been the case since the beginning of time , and certainly it 's hard to say that there 's more now than for instance in the 1970s , and of course if we think back 100 years ago , 150 years ago , all the lying that had to go on in connection for instance with slavery and discrimination and that kind of thing. So I do n't believe that there 's necessarily more lying per capita , but one thing that is clearly true , is that people feel that they know more about more lies than they 've ever known before , and that is partly because of the media now. I think the media play an absolutely indispensible role in exposing lying and in providing accountability. Nevertheless , people now see someone like President Clinton in the United States , saying one thing and saying another , and they can see that on split screens. So they have the personal experience in the sense of being lied to in a way that was not possible 150 years ago . </lie.v.3916><lie.v.3917>I am sure I have lied to someone I am dating , no one has ever confronted me about it but I am gon na assume it probably was not worth a confrontation.

So it may come as no surprise to learn that human beings -- who , according to psychologist Gerald Jellison of the University of South California , are lied to about 200 times a day , roughly one untruth every five minutes -- often deceive for exactly the same reasons : to save their own skins or to get something they ca n't get by other means . </lie.v.3990><lie.v.3991>ACORN &amp;LEFTWING MEDIA WHO NURTURE THEM : PARASITIC INFESTATION ON THE SOUL OF THE U.S.A.

For example , when maiden Aunt Agnes asks how you like the fruitcake she gives you every year at the holidays , you don ' t tell her it is too sweet and gooey. Instead , you lie and tell her how much you like it. This fib is good lying. You don ' t need to be truthful because she is not really asking for the truth.

The police investigator is concerned with empirical truth that may be used against the suspect , and therefore almost solely with probative truth : the usefulness of the suspect 's revelations depends ultimately on their acceptance in evidence by a court of law. The psychiatrist , on the other hand , using the same " truth " drugs in diagnosis and treatment of the mentally ill , is primarily concerned with psychological truth or psychological reality rather than empirical fact. A patient 's aberrations are reality for him at the time they occur , and an accurate account of these fantasies and delusions , rather than reliable recollection of past events , can be the key to recovery . </lie.v.4082><lie.v.4083>Other times preschoolers make up stories or lies about what they 'd like to be true , especially when they feel the truth is n't very much fun.

At this point , it 's appropriate to say , " We certainly enjoyed the circus today and I know you wish we could stay longer , but the truth is that you 're a little girl , not a trapeze artist , and now it 's time to go home.

One , since delinquency was not correlated with social class or child-rearing , the conclusion can be drawn that there are other factors at work. Are these factors genetic ? Is delinquency , if not a result of environment , a result of hereditary influence ? Maybe so. And , since delinquency can be a carrier for deceit , or lying , then it follows that lying may have a genetic component to it also. In other words , if delinquency is correlated to genes and lying is a part of delinquency , then , by logic , lying and genes might be correlated too. Nevertheless , some people may find it very disturbing that genes can play a role in lying. This could quite possibly lead to the awful conclusion that those who lie persistently are doing so at the beck and call of the double helix ! Such knowledge is deep , very grave , and frightening.

The question concerned whether lying is ever justified. If the future of the nation is at stake , I would hope a political leader would consider whether a lie was necessary.

Illustrations of this position can also be found in The VBAC Companion or The Labor Progress Handbook. By putting the pelvis higher than the fundus ( top of the uterus ) and tilting the pelvis , the baby often disengages and has more space and opportunity to turn.

Hillary is an impressive liar as well she almost certainly lied about the Whitewater and Travelgate scandals , and she got away with many smaller lies as well for example , she claimed that Chelsea Clinton was jogging around the World Trade Center on 9/11 , even though Chelsea was nowhere near the towers.

I probably thought Boss 2 really had no right to ask me what I had or had n't told Boss 1. Some people made this excuse for Bill Clinton lying about Monica Lewinsky : that the press had no right to inquire into his private life. However , even if we claim a distinction ( which I rejected above ) between the moral implications of private and public behavior , this is a very weak excuse. The President could have told the truth or refused to answer. It would be refreshing to hear a public figure say , " That 's none of your damn business " once in a while. By lying , he did himself immense public damage , of which the impeachment trial was the most visible and expensive consequence . </lie.v.4156><lie.v.4157>A lie ( also called prevarication , falsehood ) is a type of deception in the form of an untruthful statement , especially with the intention to deceive others , often with the further intention to maintain a secret or reputation , protect someone 's feelings or to avoid a punishment or repercussion for one 's actions. To lie is to state something that one knows to be false or that one does not honestly believe to be true with the intention that a person will take it for the truth. A liar is a person who is lying , who has previously lied , or who tends by nature to lie repeatedly - even when not necessary . </lie.v.4157><lie.v.4158>Perjury occurs when a person takes an oath to tell the truth and then says something he knows to be false. The mere existence of error in someone ' s testimony is not enough to prove perjury. The government must prove that the person intended to lie , rather than he was simply mistaken or confused over the facts. The law requires either another witness or some other evidence that supports the accusation of lying under oath. Furthermore , not all lying under oath is perjury. The lie must be material that is , important or relevant to the case. A murder suspect who falsely testifies that he ate cereal in jail that morning can not be prosecuted for perjury over that irrelevant lie.

Meander said , " A lie is better than a hurtful truth. " Darius in Herodotus said , " When telling a lie will be profitable , let it be told.

Women who make false accusations are nutty , there 's no doubt about that , but let 's turn this articles hypothesis around : if rapists and their lawyers did not exploit the rare cases of false accusations ( about 10 of all reported rapes ) there would not be so much doubt on the whole male gender in the first place and the environment for getting away with false accusations would not exist. Men lie much more about rape than women. They just commit the crime first and use the rare cases of womens false accusations as a means to get away with it.

The problem lies in the fact that the initial P sound does n't occur anywhere else in the old Germanic language , leading to the belief that the word was imported from another language. The Old English rune poem seems to indicate that it had to do with some sort of game , leading many to interpret it as 'chess pawn ' or 'dice-cup'. The dice-cup meaning is particularly interesting as it not only fits the shape of the rune , but also hints at such an object 's original use as a container for the runes themselves. An alternate interpretation of per is derived from the Slavic 'pizda ' , meaning 'vulva'. This meaning ( although obscure and somewhat unlikely ) fits quite well into the progression of runes up until this point , symbolizing the rebirth that follows death. Viewing it as a symbol of the womb of the Goddess , it represents the same element of the mysterious and hidden as 'dice-cup ' , but taken literally as 'vulva ' , it adds a powerful , feminine , sexual counterpart to uruz that would otherwise be missing from the fu ark . </lie.v.4205><lie.v.4206>One in three female bosses are happy for their employees to lie to cover for a colleague , compared with fewer than one in five men.

On the other hand , it should be admitted that Rahabs lie was not justified simply because it worked. Nevertheless , it is true that her lie was included in the means by which Rahab saved the spies , and it may well have been indispensable. If , when the king of Jericho demanded that she turn over the spies , Rahab had simply refused to comply , is one to imagine that the king would have allowed her to harbor them ? If Rahab had not persuaded the kings men that the spies were no longer on the premises , it is hard to conceive of any means by which she could have prevented the kings men from searching her house and discovering the spies. It is reasonable to think that Rahab considered the lie to be indispensable , and not to find fault with her evaluation of the matter . </lie.v.4274><lie.v.4275>If your child isn ' t simply lying to keep out of trouble , you might have to dig a little deeper to find out what ' s going on.

The positions the babies are lying in during labor can affect the outcome. Both babies may be head down; this is the best outlook for twins. However , often the second twin is in a breech position. If this is the case , an active birth is essential , with vigilance on the part of the attendants , to avoid the use of forceps or a cesarean section. Sometimes the second twin lies sideways ( transverse ) and the doctor can manually turn it head down from the outside before birth . </lie.v.4282><lie.v.4283>By the way : WOW - World of Money with Females.

The role of women , given by Macho-religions , has always been some dictatorship of Machos.

Not only will it lift any looming sense of guilt and stress , the apology will help repair any damage done.

The polygraph is used as a lie detector by police departments , the FBI , the CIA , federal and state governments , and numerous private agencies. The underlying theory of the polygraph is that when people lie they also get measurably nervous about lying. The heartbeat increases , blood pressure goes up , breathing rhythms change , perspiration increases , etc. A baseline for these physiological characteristics is established by asking the subject questions whose answers the investigator knows. Deviation from the baseline for truthfulness is taken as sign of lying . </lie.v.4293><lie.v.4294>See the battle at Jericho in the Old Testament. A prostitute named Rahab lied to protect the two Israelite spies who were sent to gather information. At the end of the day ( or week ) , hers was the only portion of the city wall that did NOT crumble when Joshua blew his trumpet. If lying had been completely unacceptable , then she would have perished too.

This administration has proven again and again that they have no concern for the opininions , the desires , or the needs of the american people nor do they have any deference to the rule of law or to the constitution.

If " love is the sole arbiter of morality in any situation , " then to lie in order to save lives is justified , even if other lives will be lost. George W. does not love the Iraqi civilians any less than Americans , but for American lives to be protected , George truly , if we take him at his word , believes Iraqi citizens must die. Indeed , we can ignore the commandment " Thou shalt not kill " because " love " is absolute , and in order to protect the American lives he " loves , " George W. must sacrifice Iraqi lives , and the lives of American soldiers. Next , the greatest good must come to the greatest number of people because of our action. If one argues that the entire world will benefit from killing few alleged terrorists , then " Thou shalt not kill " and " love thy enemy as thyself " are moot.

When I was 9 I told my school friends I was a black belt in karate so they wouldn ' t bully me. This was a useless ( and brazen ) lie as everyone knew I was nothing of the sort. Useless lies are why we start lying at the age of 4 so that by the time we are 18 we know how to avoid making an obvious lie.

A story is typically added when the occupying family expands by the marriages of its daughters , residence for the first marriages women being uxorilocal. In some grander houses the ground floor was occupied by slaves and used as warehouses , and the family members lived above. Drainage is an important consideration : houses have flat roofs and house drains send the often heavy rainfall into the streets drains , which empty into the sea.

It 's America 's shame that these people probably will get away with these lies. We do n't deserve to be seen as world leaders if we ca n't lead by example. Condi 's admission is just one small highlight in this mess . </lie.v.4332><lie.v.4333>What is interesting about this episode is how McCain reacts when facing somewhat hostile media that challenge his master narrative. As Matt points out , he lies ( okay , exaggerates , misstates , misremembers , overcompensates , etc . ) </lie.v.4333><lie.v.4334>Children younger than age 6 often have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy. Hence , for them there is often an uncertain boundary between truth and fiction. After about age 6 , however , children clearly can differentiate truth from fantasy. As a result , when a child lies she knows she is being deceitful . </lie.v.4334><lie.v.4335>Individual lies form a system of lies when an accumulation of those lies dominates a given society. Once a specific lie is institutionalized , when it becomes the basis for policy decisions , for legislation and law enforcement , it advances the formation of a system of lies. The more lies are being elevated in this way the closer we get to a system where lies dominate. If this continues the next and final phase leads to a society , where lies rule , and that means godless totalitarian rule. Nazi and Communist societies , both socialists , were and are such societies. Lies are being enforced with the power of government and opposition becomes a criminal act. There is no free speech and no right to bear arms. Totalitarian societies are the result of lies and not of economic deprivation. The liar , however , and that title includes just about everybody , is concerned with him- or herself and does n't notice the gradual transformation of the society he lives in from freedom to slavery. He does n't do anything to reverse the trend . </lie.v.4335><lie.v.4336>When people lie for a living , as Hillary does , it can be very difficult , very stressful. Imagine if you told so many lies you could n't keep track of them all. I ca n't imagine what it must be like living like that. I write a minimum of 1 , 000 published words every day , but I never have to worry about contradicting myself because I just tell people the truth. I just tell them exactly what I think . </lie.v.4336><lie.v.4337>To test the relationship between lying and the anterior prefrontal cortex , the researchers wanted to create a realistic scenario where subjects could lie or tell the truth at their own discretion. They used a task called the Guilty Knowledge Test , where two subjects participate in a role-playing game and each is given either the role of an innocent person or a thief. The researchers leave the two subjects alone for several minutes and the thief is instructed to steal money from a room while the innocent person waits outside , and then both subjects are interrogated. To motivate the thief , he gets to keep the money if he can convince the researchers of his innocence. In fact , the innocent person is a collaborator and the subject is always assigned the role of thief . </lie.v.4337><lie.v.4338>What really ticks me off about her is her endless mantras reciting Ronald Reagan. Lady , I voted for Reagan in 1984 , but I will never vote for you. You represent the worst of America , an America that is parochial , ignorant , suspicious of education and learning , willing to lie , arrogantly proud of one 's ignorance , and lacking in humility. I hope Republicans wake up before 2012 and vote for anyone but her in the Republican primaries. She is an embarrassment to our nation . </lie.v.4338><lie.v.4339>( 1 ) When we pray , we recognize the existence of an invisible kingdom. We would never pray at all if we did not have an awareness that Someone is listening , that behind what is visible there is an invisible kingdom. It is not far off in space somewhere; it is right here. It surrounds us on every side. We are constantly in touch with it even though we do not always realize it. It lies behind the facade of life , and all through the Scripture we are exhorted to take heed of this , to reckon with it and deal with it , to acknowledge that it exists . </lie.v.4339><lie.v.4340>The question is : what is the moral dimension ? The kind of lies we find most detestable are those with a malicious intent of some kind : lies designed to swindle or hoodwink us , lies that will cause us some pain down the road. Yet many lies about feelings are motivated by the exact reverse , they are quite often pro-social lies . </lie.v.4340><lie.v.4341>: Emergency lie is a different kind of white lie , which is employed when the truth may not be told because , for example , harm to a third party would come of it. An example of such an emergency lie would be a neighbour lying to an enraged husband about the whereabouts of his unfaithful wife , because said husband might reasonably be expected to inflict physical violence should he encounter his wife in person. Although the moral integrity of the wife may certainly be put into question , the threat of violence is considered to be the more pressing issue , which could justify the lie in this case depending on the moral axioms employed . </lie.v.4341><lie.v.4342>Is it possible to defeat the lie detector test ? Double the number of volunteers and randomly tell half of them prior to testing what you expect to see in the response of their arm when they lie , and when they tell the truth. Keep track of those volunteers that you told , and those that you did not. Did you see a difference between the two groups ? Do you think it is important that the volunteers in a study know what the expected outcomes are ? Or does that skew the results ? What about the tester ? Would it be better for the person doing the testing to be " blind " to the expected outcomes as well ? </lie.v.4342><lie.v.4343>There is a difference between the socially acceptable and the unacceptable lie , Adler says , and between the person who lies when it is convenient and someone who lies only when backed against a wall. And almost always , he adds , there is an alternative to lying . </lie.v.4343><lie.v.4344>Conclusion : In your work as a Christian counselor/therapist , you will deal with unconscious behaviors. In bringing healing to these behaviors , you must establish communication with the part producing the unwanted behavior. And , at times , you must discover a part or parts that will produce alternative behaviors. These parts lie in our " mind " outside of consciousness , in our unconscious mind. Establishing communication with these unconscious parts will require trance on the part of your client. Your challenge as a therapist will therefore involve getting the person 's conscious mind out of the way so you can lead them to fix the unconscious mind. Indeed , most of your clients experience emotional illness precisely because their conscious mind has gotten out of rapport with their unconscious mind. Trance places one 's conscious mind in rapport with one 's unconscious mind. And that offers yet another reason why we enjoy trance so much . </lie.v.4344><lie.v.4345>Do you remember the first time you lied to someone you loved ? Not a small lie , but an important lie. Do you remember how hollow you felt afterwards ? </lie.v.4345><lie.v.4346>The long road from Atlanta to Tara has ended , in a black wall , the road that was to end in Ellen ' s arms ( Margaret , 409 ) . Never again can Scarlett lie down , as a child , secure beneath her father ' s roof with the protection of her mother ' s love wrapped about her like an eiderdown quilt. There was no security or heaven to which she could turn now ( Margaret , 410 ); there is no one on whose shoulders she can rest her burdens. Now Scarlett is seeing things with new eyes , for somewhere along the long road to Tara , she has left her girlhood behind her. She is a woman now and youth is gone. The O Hara ' s do not take charity. The O Haras look after themselves. Her burdens are her own and they are for shoulders strong enough to bear them. She can not desert Tara , She belonged to the red acres far more than they could ever belong to her. Her roots went deep into the blood colored soil and sucked up life , as did the cotton ( Margaret , 411 ) . </lie.v.4346><lie.v.4347>Ahha ... Now that makes sense ! Another thing that came to mind is when Foster is talking to Emily in a previous episode , she says some thing like " If he called you out every time you lied , he knows he 'd lose you " . Maybe it 's the same between Lightman and Foster. They 'd lose eachother if they called eachother out every time they lied , thus " respect the line " meaning and keep your mouth shut even when you know I 'm lying . </lie.v.4347><lie.v.4348>The ugly reality about stonewalling and lying is that , if pursued with the proper discipline , it can be an effective public-relations tool. Mainstream reporters may contrast what a White House press spokesman says with what somebody else says , but they usually hesitate to state bluntly that Person A is lying and Person B is telling the truth. ( An admirable exception is Dana Milbank of the Washington Post , who has devoted considerable energy to documenting Bush 's falsehoods. ) If a press secretary states consistently that up is down , most reporters will present this as a matter of opinion. But if he states repeatedly that up is down , then says that up is up , and then resumes saying that up is down , reporters will seize on the inconsistency and cry foul. Unlike disagreement between one person and another ( or even disagreement between one person and the rest of humanity ) , a single person 's saying one thing and then saying another is usually taken ( sometimes unfairly ) as prime facie evidence that a lie has been told . </lie.v.4348><lie.v.4349>Let us talk about the big lies , lies that change history. Two of them have to do with Vietnam , that war that so outraged Jimmy Cameron. Let me take you back to December 1963 and Tansonhut airport in Saigon. At the end of his first fact finding trip to Vietnam for the New American President Lyndon Johnson , the Defence Secretary Robert McNamara was holding a press conference. He told reporters that he was 'optimistic as to the progress that had been made and could be made during the coming year ' in the fight against the Vietcong. This was duly reported to an anxious world on that night 's television and in next day 's newspapers . </lie.v.4349><lie.v.4350>I ' ve been lied to a lot , no more than most , but I ' ve always been upfront with men and very clear about what was important to me.

No , he did not come out and say that Hillary was too deeply in bed with Washington to do more than a half-a** job reforming the system ( an act of restraint that was also part of his balanced attitude toward campaigning ) , but this is what his supporters knew. His supporters were greatly concerned that the legacy of Democrats having things thrown back in their face by Republicans to create a disingenuous , " Clinton did it too ! " underside to the high and mighty Democratic opposition would be ripe for the Republicans in a Hillary nomination , and they were right. Republicans might not have been reduced to seeing whether they could lie outright in the fall had Hillary been the ticket , because of all of the ways in which the Clintons could be shown as sampling some of the Republican party 's propensity for strange bedfellows. With Obama , 19 months into an election cycle , they 're still having to obsess over minute matters like Tony Rezko because there 's not enough real dirt on him to keep him constantly worried about what might come out about him next . </lie.v.4353><lie.v.4354>About that writing lies into a story , the real trick is how to redeem the liar. In the third book of Tessa Dare ' s summer trilogy ( yes , I ' ve read book 3 , lucky me ) the hero sort of tells some big lies , but when it came down to the black moment , I was mad at the heroine for the way she reacted.

Most children tell lies out of fear. They broke your vase and they are afraid you will be mad , so they say the vase just fell. They don ' t want to be grounded because they played a computer game instead of doing homework , so they tell you they have no homework. The thing is , kids do make mistakes and break things and forget stuff. If you are overly harsh when your children break a vase , you are encouraging them to lie next time instead of taking responsibility for their actions . </lie.v.4356><lie.v.4357>The Festival of Imbolc takes place half way between the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox and is celebrated on January 31st , Feb 1st and February 2nd.

Every living creature down to plant life wants to get laid. Among male candidates , males who have the drive , strength , leadership , and confidence to rise above the herd are usually very sexually active men. Throughout history , kings and other great men have usually had many lovers. Women are biologically attracted to men of power and authority.

( 1 Tim 4 : 1-3 ) In AD 1079 , the Catholic Church forbade priests to marry; commanded them to remain celibate throughout their lives. That order has never been rescinded; continues in force to this day , and has resulted in the kind of shocking immorality previously associated only with pagan religions of bygone days and the cults of this generation. Catholicism completed fulfillment of the prophecy in First Timothy - about the same time as the celibacy decree when Rome commanded the faithful , under penalty of serious sin , to abstain from meat on all Fridays and certain fast days throughout the year . </lie.v.4396><lie.v.4397>The clue to your sexual future may lie in your girlfriend ' s past. Have you talked to her about past relationships ? If so , has she revealed a former flame that fizzled bitterly ? If not , this may just be the reason she ' s pumping the brakes on pursuing a passionate liaison with you. Oftentimes after a bad breakup or bitter betrayal , your girl will feel a little gun shy. Not wanting to get burned again , she may need to take things slow. And that ' s okay. In fact , it ' s pretty smart. After all , sex is not just emotionally risky. If you ' re not careful , you can expose yourself to all kinds of physical dangers as well. And until you have had a very frank chat about monogamy , safe sex , birth control , and sexually transmitted diseases , you should take things slow . </lie.v.4397><lie.v.4398>Arlenearmy continues : " But , the discovery of her lying about the birth of Trig would let us know that she would lie about anything.

When you place your finger on BL 32 you can feel the small depression of the Sacral Foramen where the point lies. As labour begins you can start here and as the labour progresses move down the spine ( approximately one thumb width at a time , moving slightly closer to the spine until as you arrive at the top of the buttock crease , your knuckles will be touching ) .

Not all Republican ' ts are conservatives and not all conservatives are part of the new neo-conservative movement. It is these people , these neo-cons that are the problem. It is this group of patriots that is destroying our economy and creating an atmosphere of fear , hate and bigotry in our country.

If a child says she has returned her book to the library and we later find it in her room , it is not helpful to cross-examine the child : " Why did you lie to me ? Why ca n't I trust you to do what you say ? " There are no good answers to accusatory questions. Such questions only lead to arguing and bad feelings. We can simply say , " The book on your desk is overdue. " </lie.v.4425><lie.v.4426>2 ) There is a fundamental problem in attributing a " lie " to another person. " Lying " usually connotes consciousness that what one is saying is not the truth. Since we are always on the outside looking in and only the speaker has direct access to their own consciousness , the attribution of a lie must always be an inference. When speaking about people with great power most of us are hesitant to make that inference. Maybe the " liar " really had convinced themself of the truth of what they were saying; are they then " lying " ? Self-deception is also a very common daily occurence. I think we have to treat this almost like a court of law trying to establish reasonable grounds that a person was lying. I. F.

Instead they evaluate and classify different currents according to some external and secondary manifestation , most often according to their relation to one or another abstract principle which for the given classifier has a special professional value. Thus to the Roman pope Freemasons and Darwinists , Marxists and anarchists are twins because all of them sacrilegiously deny the immaculate conception. To Hitler , liberalism and Marxism are twins because they ignore blood and honor . To a democrat , fascism and Bolshevism are twins because they do not bow before universal suffrage.

He lied about his address , said he was not employed ( he was , at an advertising photography firm called Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall , making as much as $ 1.50 per hour for a forty-hour work week ) , and that he did not receive unemployment compensation of any kind.

Their qualification increased constantly : in 1962 they represented 1/6 of the senior management employees , in 1982 they represented a third. But we must not forget the constraints , which lie heavy on women because of the different sorts of work they have to do like professional work , parental one and domestic one. The woman remained a housewife and often she was the only one in the family in charge of domestic work ( cooking , washing-up , laying the table , shopping , housekeeping and so on ) .

No mortgage lender today can tell you what your interest rate or lendabilty is without a complete loan application. So be aware most radio and television that lay claim to lowest rates or 24 approval are simply not true. If you receive a promise , ask the promiser just how they can make that promise , and get it on paper. There are many people involved in creating a mortgage loan , with the investor ( usually represented by the underwriter ) having the final say on your loan. Ask your lender to explain the process , and about the people involved. Put your lenders toes in the fire and the beginning , and keep them there.

More than 10 , 000 real adopters who have had great experiences at Gentle Giants Rescue , including the one banned from Brenda 's message board , can attest to the fact that Brenda 's story of adoption is n't even close to the adoption process facilitated at Gentle Giants. Any true adopter could tell you that your story is not the way ANY adoption HAS EVER happened nor will it ever happen at GG.

After 42 years of attempting to justify its brutal occupation of the West Bank , Gaza and East Jerusalem , the Israeli Occupation Forces lies have become a matter of course. This week the Israeli Occupation Forces and the Israeli police once again engaged in the violent suppression of a non-violent demonstration and then lied about their actions.

Then they and their supporters play on the technicalities of the individual sentences when they try to say that Bush/PNAC did not lie.

These wise guys posit the hypothetical case of a man who sins with his wife 's mother or sister. Had this happened before the marriage it would have been a crime which would prevent and break up the proposed marriage. Since it happened subsequent to the marriage , however , for the sake of the wife , who is innocent in the matter , the marriage may not be dissolved. Nevertheless , the husband 's punishment is to be that he shall lie with his wife but have no power to demand of her the conjugal duty. See what the devil through his fools does with the estate of marriage ! He puts husband and wife together , and then says , " Be neither man nor woman. " As well put fire and straw together and bid them not to burn. If one were to impose upon the pope a command one-tenth as hard as this , how he would rage and storm , and howl about unlawful authority ! Away with the big fools.

If charged to swear whether or not you are telling the truth , could you then try and grasp for some exclusion or loop-hole. Certainly , the text does not allow for one. Getting back to our aforementioned Pharisees , they loved the technicalities. They where quick to hold up the responsibility of telling the truth if under oath , but far more readily allowed for lies given circumstances.

And a naked request for sex gets you nowhere , at least while the night is young. So maybe it is not the lie itself that is the problem , but the kind of lie one tells and perhaps also the kind of lie that one encourages , or let ' s oneself believe.

It languidly flows , deep and slow , to the Ironsea. Landings for merchant craft from the Ironsea line the banks in Celdon , and the riverside areas are known for their color , noise , and exotic wares.

To lie is to state something one knows is false with the intention that it be taken for the truth by someone else. A liar is a person who is lying or who lies repeatedly.Lying is typically used to refer to deceptions in oral or written communication. Other forms of deception , such as disguises or forgeries , are generally not considered lies , though the underlying intent may be the same; however , even a true statement can be considered a lie if the person making that statement is doing so to deceive. In this situation , it is the intent of being untruthful rather than the truthfulness of the statement itself that is considered.

At this time that Cooper and his legal team were asking for DNA testing on A-41 and other evidence that the state said proved him guilty. It was n't until after the state agreed to DNA testing that Cooper and his attorneys found out that Gregonis had removed evidence and kept it out for 24 hours without the court 's permission or the knowledge of anyone other than the District Attorney . </lie.v.4554><lie.v.4555>And so the wheel of pointing fingers goes around.

She attributes this secretiveness to societal norms which expect a woman to be honest , while a man gets away with a mere slap on the wrist.

Women are also famed for lying about their payslips and age . </lie.v.4559><lie.v.4560>It has always been admitted that the question of lying creates great difficulties for the moralist. From the dawn of ethical speculation there have been two different opinions on the question as to whether lying is ever permissible. Aristotle , in his Ethics , seems to hold that it is never allowable to tell a lie , while Plato , in his Republic , is more accommodating; he allows doctors and statesmen to lie occasionally for the good of their patients and for the common weal. Modern philosophers are divided in the same way.

Lies are often a form of self deception , but also a way of coping with the outside world.

If they had no moral right to ask the questions , you imagine him reasoning , he had no moral obligation to answer them honestly. Richard Nixon retained tape-recorded evidence of his own lies about the Watergate break-in and other scandals , so secure was he in the presidential power to dissemble. George W. Bush has only been caught uttering relatively small lies so far : asserting during the campaign that he had championed a patients ' bill of rights in Texas when he had , in fact , opposed it , and claiming more recently that he inherited his association with former Enron chief Kenneth Lay from his predecessor in the Texas governor 's office , Ann Richards.

He routinely lies about my tax plan , which will cut taxes for 95 percent of families with children. He lies about his own tax plan , which will continue the tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires he once called " irresponsible. " He lies about his support of renewable energy. He lies about his judgment on the Iraq War , a war he himself declared over five years ago , on national TV. He lies about his vetting of Sarah Palin , which was clearly reckless and inadequate. Virtually every time he opens his mouth he lies . </lie.v.4662><lie.v.4663>" The greatness of every mighty organization embodying an idea in this world lies in the religious fanaticism and intolerance with which , fanatically convinced of its own right , it intolerantly imposes its will against all others. " </lie.v.4663><lie.v.4664>It rests in the first place on Holy Scripture. In places almost innumerable Holy Scripture seems to condemn lying as absolutely and unreservedly as it condemns murder and fornication. Innocent III gives expression in one of his decretals to this interpretation , when he says that Holy Scripture forbids us to lie even to save a man 's life. If , then , we allow the lie of necessity , there seems to be no reason from the theological point of view for not allowing occasional murder and fornication when these crimes would procure great temporal advantage; the absolute character of the moral law will be undermined , it will be reduced to a matter of mere expediency . </lie.v.4664><lie.v.4665>Or you could try some more unusual movements instead of pelvic thrusts. For example , gently rocking on each other as the man lies on top of his partner rather than all-out thrusting can produce some wonderful sensations , and with a bit of trial and error it 's possible to get into a position during sex where the man 's pubic bone stimulates the woman 's clitoris. Another interesting variation is to move your hips in a circular pattern rather than to thrust in and out : this can feel wonderful ! And since the vagina is most sensitive nearest its outer edges , shallow penetration in which the man inserts his penis an inch or two and then withdraws again before re-entering to the same depth can be very teasing and enjoyable. It 's also extremely pleasurable for a man if his partner can use her vaginal muscles to squeeze his penis as it rests inside her . </lie.v.4665><lie.v.4666>Conflict , internal strife and economic crisis can also lead to or exacerbate disaster. This has been the case with the repeated famines in southern Sudan. In the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , a decline in the economy and in food production , coupled with floods and drought , has brought starvation to millions. For two winters running , the Federation has had to intervene in the republics of the former Soviet Union to counter the severe effects of economic crisis , which has placed hundreds of thousands of people in an extremely precarious situation. Indonesia has been similarly affected by structural upheaval , which has threatened to destabilize one of the world 's most populous nations. The socio-economic dislocation at the root of such disasters is hard to address because its causes lie in the political sphere. In these cases , the Movement can only respond to the immediate needs while working with others to seek longer-term solutions . </lie.v.4666><lie.v.4667>It 's not that important what the lie was about.

In this study we will be answering the question : Is it ever right to lie ? Conduct seems to indicate that many believe it is right to lie , at least on certain occasions. Professors exaggerate the excellence of their students on recommendations for employment , physicians lie to their patients , parents lie to their children about such things as adoption , social investigators use deception while trying to uncover medical and welfare fraud , the police and journalists lie and deceive in order to expose crime and corruption , and even Dr. Laura , under the pretext of offering moral advice , frequently tells people to lie in order to avoid what she considers to be more serious problems . </lie.v.4685><lie.v.4686>( Although I have to say , I lied to my mother for similar reasons that your husband lied.

The House of Commons has the power to expel or otherwise discipline Members who contravene the oath. There do not appear to be any precedents for use of this power , however; and , given the general vagueness of the concept , considerable difficulties would seem to lie in the way of establishing the validity of allegations of contravention. Ultimately , the matter would probably have to be resolved politically , although the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms might be relevant in appropriate circumstances . </lie.v.4690><lie.v.4691>The concept of weaning as used in our society is often nonexistent in organic societies. The term wean comes from the Anglo-Saxon wenian , which means " to accustom. " What is implied by this term is that someone , other than the child , must accustom the child to nourishment other than that of his or her mother 's milk. This is not the experience of children in most nonviolent societies. Instead , in organic societies the child controls the entire process beginning from the first time it tastes solid foods to the last time it is nursed. The child usually takes one to four years to complete this process. Thus , fundamental to this " organic " concept of weaning is that the power and control lies not with the adult but with the child . </lie.v.4691><lie.v.4692>In " Deus Ex Machina " , Locke is told by his mother , Emily Annabeth Locke , that he was " immaculately conceived " , although she meant that he had no father ( i.e. " virgin birth " ) , not that he was free from original sin.

The action of lighting a cigarette also provides a much needed pause for the liar to collect their thoughts and establish their composure.

" This information was based almost entirely on documents that the CIA and the White House knew were false. That makes Bush 's statement a lie. But , as Chatterbox observed yesterday , we can count at least six other lies told by or on behalf of President Bush in this calendar year alone. That does n't include two addled lies Bush uttered while trying to extricate himself from Yellowcakegate that the CIA did n't doubt the uranium story until after he gave the speech , and that the United States went to war because Saddam would n't let inspectors into Iraq. Why was the yellowcake lie treated like a major news event , when the earlier lies were not ? </lie.v.4700><lie.v.4701>Discipline also seems to play a role in encouraging or discouraging lying. Severe punishment for misdemeanours paradoxically encourage deception , as the child realises a need to get out of punishment by any means possible. Inconsistent punishments for lying or the total absence of punishment will also encourage the child to lie. And punishing a child for lying and then getting caught lying yourself will do nothing to help the situation . </lie.v.4701><lie.v.4702>Lies are extremely difficult to detect.

Take the man who cheats on his wife and later denies it. This type of lying is told as a means to preserve his family and himself. That is , if he were to admit to his wife and family that he had an affair , he would risk suffering the break-up of his marriage and family itself. By using lies to explain away this behavior , which , actually , points toward dissatisfaction with his marriage , the real problem escapes notice; namely , adultery. Is this what happened with Bill Clinton ? Was he trying to protect his wife and daughter from undue embarrassment and emotional harm ? It is doubtful. There is a stronger likelihood that Bill Clinton was seriously worried about his place in the annals of history , rather than the well-being of Hillary and Chelsea. Despicable as it sounds , Clinton s lies were more than likely used to preserve himself and his public standing. In this way , Clinton survived the accusations by means of a lie.

Detection tests are based on the fact that when people lie , they become emotionally aroused , and this causes various changes in the body such as a reduction in salivation , a rapid pulse , irregular breathing and an increase in sweating of the palms and soles. In ancient times falsehood was mainly detected by its effect in drying the mouth : an accused Bedouin was asked to lick a red hot iron bar , and if his mouth had been dried by a guilty conscience his tongue was burned and he was then convicted; any victim who managed to keep a good flow of saliva for any reason was less affected and was acquitted.

The most critical things are to keep the mother as mobile as possible so her positioning can help baby rotate , avoid closing up the sacral area ( i.e. , do n't sit or lie back on on the buttbones ! ) so baby has room to move , and avoiding breaking the waters or adding artificial labor drugs ( AROM and Pitocin ) so the problem is not exacerbated and baby still has the opportunity to turn.

Children are often bought from families or the parents are tricked into giving them up. Mothers are told that their babies died during childbirth.

These resistances are usually bound up with projections , which are not recognized as such , and their recognition is a moral achievement beyond the ordinary. While some traits peculiar to the shadow can be recognized without too much difficulty as one 's personal qualities , in this case both insight and good will are unavailing because the cause of the emotion appears to lie , beyond all possibility of doubt , in the other person. [ Ibid. , par. 16. ] The realization of the shadow is inhibited by the persona. To the degree that we identify with a bright persona , the shadow is correspondingly dark.

There are persuasive arguments indicating the mandate is unconstitutional. But the Democrats don ' t even lie about the constitutionality of their proposal. They just try to laugh off objections. When asked where in the Constitution is the authority for the coverage mandate , Speaker Nancy Pelosi replied , Are you serious; are you serious ? This shows utter ignorance of the U.S. Constitution and suggests that the Democrats don ' t even pay attention to it in drafting their radical , socialist schemes.

If he did commit perjury , he is a man without a fundamental respect for the truth. We simply ca n't trust someone who sets aside the truth when it 's convenient for him.

The mother lies flat on her back with her knees in the air. It is a most unphysiologic position for mom and baby , but it does give the physician a good view of the mother 's perineum. While in this position , the mother must push the baby out uphill. It is known to cause fetal distress due to the baby lying on the mother 's arteries and veins. Most women will not choose this position if given alternatives. Dr. Roberto Caldeyro-Barcia is considered an expert on this position for labor and delivery. He and his researchers found that this lithotomy or supine position is the worst one for laboring women because it adversely affects every facet of birth : makes labor more painful , reduces uterine activity , and can dangerously lower blood pressure. He says , " Except for being hanged by the feet , the supine position is the worst conceivable position for labor and delivery.

In his coin toss experiment , there was no sign at all that emotions factored into a subject ' s decision to lie or to tell the truth. Moral judgment is not a single thing , Greene concludes , suggesting that although we often lump them together under the heading of morality , deciding what ' s right or wrong and deciding to tell the truth or to tell a lie may , in some situations , be entirely disconnected processes . </lie.v.4807><lie.v.4808>So they lied again.

The public wanted Clinton to fix the economy , but they did n't want a president who had an open marriage. the President , after all , had to set the " moral standard " because he was on a " pedestal " . The public wanted Clinton to not be the way Clinton is. So Clinton told the voters what they wanted to hear.

Influenced by the new science of sex , these guides were still prim in their explanations of normal sexuality , but they were an improvement on the previous century ' s repressive mode : they even acknowledged the existence of the female orgasm , and gave explicit tips for achieving it. Unlike their Victorian predecessors , who might be happy to lie back and think of England or Massachusetts modern women had come to expect that erotic fulfillment was an integral part of a successful alliance. </lie.v.4864><lie.v.4865>To the north of the acropolis , in the plain stretching out below , lies the agora or civic center; on a hill to the west was the Pnyx , site for the meeting of the Athenian assembly; and on the southern slope of the acropolis was the theatre of Dionysus. From the first of these two centers of civic life women were excluded , and they may also have been restricted from the third , for women were prohibited by law from transacting business exchanges in significant amounts , and they were also barred from appearing as witnesses or litigants in the many law courts located in and around the agora. Thus , only poor women , non-citizen women , or slaves formed part of the daily hustle and bustle of the agora. Furthermore , citizen women were not voting members of the body politic , and so did not participate in the assembly deliberations about which we read so much in our ancient sources. And while women were represented freely on the dramatic stage by male actors , they may not have attended the performances of the tragedies which form such a prominent part of the ancient Athenians ' cultural legacy . </lie.v.4865><lie.v.4866>So , why do you lie ?

And she lies to herself , lies she doesn ' t even know are lies those are the sneaky ones . </lie.v.4866><lie.v.4867>( 1 ) First , the Hebrew text employs the same verb for the two renderings " she shall crush " and " thou shalt lie in wait "; the Septuagint renders the verb both times by terein , to lie in wait; Aquila , Symmachus , the Syriac and the Samaritan translators , interpret the Hebrew verb by expressions which mean to crush , to bruise; the Itala renders the terein employed in the Septuagint by the Latin " servare " , to guard; St. Jerome [ 1 ] maintains that the Hebrew verb has the meaning of " crushing " or " bruising " rather than of " lying in wait " , " guarding " . Still in his own work , which became the Latin Vulgate , the saint employs the verb " to crush " ( conterere ) in the first place , and " to lie in wait " ( insidiari ) in the second. Hence the punishment inflicted on the serpent and the serpent 's retaliation are expressed by the same verb : but the wound of the serpent is mortal , since it affects his head , while the wound inflicted by the serpent is not mortal , being inflicted on the heel . </lie.v.4867><lie.v.4868>Over the last 10 years the Magic have been in the forefront at lying.

The web of deception wove its way through not only strangers and acquaintances , but friends and loved ones as well.

Who can believe it ? Obviously , any definition of lying that would have the Lord encouraging one to do what is sinful can not be correct ( cf. James 1 : 13 ) . Therefore , from a Scriptural point of view , the creating of a false or misleading impression is not necessarily a lie. Let 's consider yet another situation. In Joshua 8 , God , who " can not lie " ( Titus 1 : 2 ) , instructed Joshua to " lay an ambush for the city [ of Ai ] behind it " ( v.2 ) . Now , it seems impossible for anyone to try and deny that an ambush , by definition , is deceptive.

Utilitarians base their reasoning on the claim that actions , including lying , are morally acceptable when the resulting consequences maximize benefit or minimize harm. A lie , therefore , is not always immoral; in fact , when lying is necessary to maximize benefit or minimize harm , it may be immoral not to lie. The challenge in applying utilitarian ethics to everyday decision making , however , is significant : one must correctly estimate the overall consequences of one 's actions before making a decision.

In so doing , it establishes the fact that one may sometimes violate the ninth commandment; there are situations in which falsehood and lies do not violate the general prohibition against lying.

( This occurs even in the insect kingdom : the female praying mantis , for example , seduces her mate without letting him know that she will eat his head in the process , which turns him into an mentally uninhibited sex machine. ) Is the thrill of seduction worth the lie ?

Now , if you want to stoop to name calling I can assert that you are a moron for calling a anyone stupid who points out a factual truth. However , I choose to deal with the facts. The facts are that the front page of my newspaper was plastered with the obscene details of Bill 's semen on Monica 's dress. The facts are that salacious and lewd sexual details on the front of a family newspaper is because of Bill Clinton 's inability to keep his penis in his pants in the oval office. The facts are that Hilliary Clinton went on national TV before the newspaper printed those vile obscene details and assert that the stories about Monica were a and I quote VASTRINGWINGCOSPIRACY ... that 's the LIE she told to cover up Bill 's semen trail . </lie.v.5006><lie.v.5007>His plays lie undisturbed in the dusty stacks of a few libraries.

This is one instance when the sword would probably have been a lot mightier than the pen , although the task was probably a bit beyond the 4 ' 6 " Pope . </lie.v.5007><lie.v.5008>Augustine of Hippo wrote two books about lying : On Lying ( De Mendacio ) and Against Lying ( Contra Mendacio ) . [ 3 ] He describes each book in his later work , Retractions. Based on the location of De Mendacio in Retractions , it appears to have been written about A.D. 395. [ 4 ] The first work , On Lying , begins : " Magna qu stio est de Mendacio " . From his text , it can be derived that St. Augustine divided lies into eight categories , listed in order of descending severity : </lie.v.5008><lie.v.5009>-- To lie over. ( a ) To remain unpaid after the time when payment is due , as a note in bank.

The problem for the poet , I think , is to determine what structure is available to accommodate the materials the poem is going to need. I came to see a huge difference between a narrative structure and a lyric structure. The lyric , of course , has always included various parts of what we think of as story. They 're sort of " back story. " They lie behind every lyric : that sense of an utterance , a character , a voice in a particular circumstance. But with the lyric structure , the arrangement of the materials is very different . </lie.v.5010><lie.v.5011>Yet I would close the books on Clinton 's sins , too. His lies affected me not at all.

How many of them were widely believed by Democrats and Republicans alike at the time , but were proven later to be less than true ?

It is just mistaken ! </lie.v.5025><lie.v.5026>Legal scholars are both interested and alarmed by fMRI ' s potential use in detecting liars. Henry Greely , a bioscience ethicist at Stanford University , thinks the technology has the potential to really screw up people ' s lives. Some companies , he says , are touting the accuracy of their tests based on unrealistic scenarios. Greely mentioned one commonly cited study in which researchers asked 26 right-handed male undergraduate volunteers to lie about holding either the five of clubs or seven of spades. How similar is that to telling the cops ' No , I wasn ' t there ' during a crime ? he asked. The study to which he refers was published in the journal Human Brain Mapping in 2005 . </lie.v.5026><lie.v.5027>The Great Goddess functions were split up. Hera became the Goddess of weddings and marriage and rulership; love and beauty and desire fell to Aphrodite; the tending of the home to Hestia and childbirth and motherhood as well as maidenhood to Artemis. You lie in the arms of Zeus became an emblem of Hera 's authority , an ambivalent source of satisfaction for one who used to be Goddess in her own right as her tales of her rage at Zeus ' freedom imply. However , although they were wedded it was Zeus ' rule that prevailed and she who belonged to him , which is true of most of the Greek Goddesses except , perhaps , Gaia and Demeter. It was by marrying or fathering the Goddesses that Zeus appropriated their powers to himself. The structuring of the world became patriarchal; Zeus the sky , Poseidon the sea and Hades the underworld like An , Enlil and Ea in Sumeria . </lie.v.5027><lie.v.5028>Communication between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary occurs through neurosecretory cells that span the short distance between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary. Hormones produced by the cell bodies of the neurosecretory cells are packaged in vesicles and transported through the axon and stored in the axon terminals that lie in the posterior pituitary. When the neurosecretory cells are stimulated , the action potential generated triggers the release of the stored hormones from the axon terminals to a capillary network within the posterior pituitary. Two hormones , oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) , are produced and released this way. Decreased ADH release or decreased renal sensitivity to ADH produces a condition known as diabetes insipidus. Diabetes insipidus is characterised by polyuria ( excess urine production ) , hypernatremia ( increased blood sodium content ) and polydipsia ( thirst ) . </lie.v.5028><lie.v.5029>This double standard is unacceptable , says River Forest ' s Laura Maychruk.

Like generations before them , they grew up celebrating holidays like Columbus Day and Thanksgiving , based on easily documented myths designed to sugarcoat genocide. Myths are lies. Docudramas present a revisionist history of the Reagan years , erasing all mention of Latin American bloodshed and the upward redistribution of income at home which resulted in a generation where homelessness and large college loans seem as natural as rainfall. The mean-hearted , babbling fool has been reborn post-mortem as a gentleman , as the great communicator. </lie.v.5032><lie.v.5033>On the other end of the treatment continuum lie community interventions , including work site cessation programs. This acknowledges the fact that only one tenth of smokers make use of formal clinical programs. In contrast , most are self-quitters who need only minimal assistance ( Cohen et al. , 1989; Curry , 1993; Orleans , Kristeller &amp;Gritz , 1993 ) . While relapse rates after professional treatment lie typically between 70 and 90 , those of self-quitters are even higher. Nevertheless , investments in the public health approach are more cost-effective because it reaches a much larger target population and , thus , results in higher overall numbers of persons quitting ( Lichtenstein &amp;Glasgow , 1992 ) . </lie.v.5033><lie.v.5034>Basically Republicans prefer torture generated lies rather than truth. The FBI Director Mueller pulled his agents out of the torture based interrogations not only because waterboarding torture is illegal but also because torture generates a lot of bogus information , including the Atta 's torture-generated claim that Iraq was connected to Al Qaeda , that claim helped cost the US government $ 3 trillion on the war against a country that did n't pose a threat to us and did n't reconstitute any weapons of mass destruction programs and did n't intend to reconstitute those programs. They accepted the phony claims by ex-Iraqis and torture based confessions and did n't do any intelligence homework except for disinformation against the American taxpayers . </lie.v.5034><lie.v.5035>We will not insist here upon the fact that the Decree of 1919 led scarcely to even one execution of relatives of those commanders whose perfidy not only caused the loss of innumerable human lives but threatened the revolution itself with direct annihilation. The question in the end does not concern that. If the revolution had displayed less superfluous generosity from the very beginning , hundreds of thousands of lives would have been saved. Thus or otherwise I carry full responsibility for the Decree of 1919. It was a necessary measure in the struggle against the oppressors. Only in the historical content of the struggle lies the justification of the decree as in general the justification of the whole civil war which , too , can be called , not without foundation , disgusting barbarism . </lie.v.5035><lie.v.5036>THe reason people lie , and ultimately the ONLY reason , is that they think they can get away with it !

They lie about everything. Barak was lying yesterday about his ridiculous 'budget cuts'. Clinton spent eight years in the White House and never told the truth once. The libs didnt even pretend that he was honest. Dittos for that sanctimonious Stalinist harlot who was lying about being his wife. The libs are lying about Global Warming , it doesnt exist and they know it. They lie when they pretend to be 'moderates ' instead of the left-wing commies that they are to fool the droolers in the electorate. They lie when they pay ACORN to create new phony voters to tip close elections. So now we 're supposed to be surprised that this botoxed , surgery-scarred , fork-tongued , daffy old broad is lying to help the other lying libs prosecute the people who interrogated the Dems ' terrorist allies using what anyone else in the world would call gentle and restrained tactics against these homicidal savages whose only dream in life is to murder as many of us as they can.

Huck using a cross in an ad , while saying it 's a book shelf without books , while he sit carefully in the position for the cross to be seen. What 's next will Mitt say his Grandfather helped Columbus Discover America. No wonder Bloomberg will run for President , right now the Republicans have no body. Now Bloomberg 's only problem is New York. He can paid the people in the city but will he paid the people of the hold State for a vote.

Fonda said , " The image of Jane Fonda , Barbarella , Henry Fonda 's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine.

Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It 's not something that I will apologize for.

People who imagine that their government is on their side may wonder why it should be endowed with the unchecked power to deceive them -- a power that may be exercised without any judicial review. But Harbury , a lawyer who argued her own case before the Supreme Court ( to the apparent discomfort of justices unaccustomed to confronting the people whom their decisions most affect ) , is likely to lose her bid to sue the government.

It serves as the transition to the lower body by its articulation with the femur bone of the leg. This articulation between pelvis and femur forms the hip joint. Because the pelvis lies between the trunk and the legs it must receive weight from the upper body and trunk , as well as absorb the stresses of the lower body from below with activities like walking , jumping , or running . </lie.v.5065><lie.v.5066>Generally , a party 's prospects a year before the election determine recruitment -- the better the outlook , the better the candidates.

The conditions for the experiment were better for the others , since they knew nothing concerning the particulars of the deed , and some not even that a crime had been committed.

So what is the proper solution ? At one end of the spectrum , we can totally privatize religion , requiring those religions that choose to venture out of their cages to operate in a world of enforced pluralism. At the other end of the spectrum , we can give religion a carte blanche exemption from complying with whichever social policies it dislikes , permitting religiously-motivated discrimination to go unchecked in the public square. As a constitutional matter , neither option is desirable or satisfying. As such , the proper answer is more nuanced than either of these positions , and it lies somewhere in between them . </lie.v.5075><lie.v.5076>If a person lies to you 10 times and you believe him the 11th time who does that make you ?

Some women find this position difficult , so if you ca n't lie this way , say so. The doctor can do the examination with you lying on your side with your knees drawn up in the foetal position. In fact , many doctors will do this anyway when looking for prolapse as it 's a good way to check the front and back walls of the vagina.

The anterior prefrontal cortex , the frontal extremity of the brain directly above the eyes , seems to be the brain 's command center for lying. Despite its unfailing activation during lies , until recently it was unclear if this region was busy suppressing the truth or if it served as a moral conflict monitor in the brain that lit up during deception. Basically , if this brain region were missing , would we lie less because we were no longer able to conceal the truth , or more because we no longer found it immoral ? </lie.v.5108><lie.v.5109>I 've done a lot of hiring in my career , and if I ever discovered that an applicant had falsified the work and resume they submitted , and then lied to me in the interview about the extent of their experience , I simply would n't hire them.

In other words when Paul says that the old nature is corrupt , he means ( among other things ) that the old nature is a liar.

Larry Lindsey reportedly lost his job as chairman of the National Economic Council for blabbing to the Wall Street Journal that the war would cost between $ 100 billion and $ 200 billion.

They blend imperceptibly but are functionally distinct : the inner two layers are shed at menstruation; the outer or basal layer remains in position against the innermost layer of the myometrium. The three layers are called , respectively , the stratum compactum , the stratum spongiosum , and the stratum basale. The stratum compactum is nearest to the uterine cavity and contains the lining cells and the necks of the uterine glands; its stroma is relatively dense. Superficial blood vessels lie beneath the lining cells. The stratum spongiosum is the large middle layer. It contains the main portions of uterine glands and accompanying blood vessels; the stromal cells are more loosely arranged and larger than in the stratum compactum. The stratum basale lies against the uterine muscle; it contains blood vessels and the bases of the uterine glands. Its stroma remains relatively unaltered during the menstrual cycle . </lie.v.5188><lie.v.5189>But useful lies of the grand sort like religious myth or blind nationalism need support by lesser lies at crucial moments.

While we know the Bible teaches this , we are often shocked by our children ' s lies . </lie.v.5190><lie.v.5191>There may be a lack of responsibility , which can be frustrating. Pisces children follow their own rules. They 're sensitive and easily stabbed to the quick by harshness. Tears may be frequent. These youngsters ordinarily prefer the company of adults to playing with other children. Even ' at a tender age , they have a deep wisdom and sympathetic understanding of situations over their heads. A child of Neptune is often accused of lying , yet they are n't lies to him. There 's no malicious or cowardly intent. His young mind swims in fluid imagination which whispers a thousand secrets , so utterly delightful and filled with such sheer beauty he ca n't help trying to make them live in the cold , real world. The fact that these lovely dreams soon die in the sterile , arid soil of a materialistic society is heartbreaking. He needs your deepest pity , or he 'll retreat into silent , moody despair . </lie.v.5191><lie.v.5192>What Mrs. Obama fails to mention in the speech is that she had a salary of just over 100 thousand dollars a year that went up to over 300 thousand a year after her hubby was elected tot he Senate. With a salary like that she could certainly afford to pay her loans back much easier than the less well connected who graduate with massive debt. Barack Obama ' s books might have provided a great deal of wealth and made their lives easier but they were not hurting in any way shape or form and could certainly pay their bills. She lied , his books were not the ONLY reason they are not saddled with debt. If they could not pay the loans on her salary then there is no way we should let them around a federal budget . </lie.v.5192><lie.v.5193> Are you saying Mr. Clueless can lie ? Jimmy Ding is not George Washington turned dull by the rigors of corporate life ? What ? </lie.v.5193><lie.v.5194>Lying is my stonghold. When something is wrong with my life , I sway reality with something that seems like something I would want to happen. It 's so messed up. Nobody knows how much I lie but it 's starting to cave in on me. My counsellor wants to call my parents because she 's concerned about me but really , it 's because I have lied. I do n't know what I am supposed to do. Please reply soon I really need some assistance or this could turn into something that I really do n't want it to . </lie.v.5194><lie.v.5195>There is nothing new in a government lying to their people to start a war. Indeed because most people prefer living in peace to bloody and horrific death in war , any government that desires to initiate a war usually lies to their people to create the illusion that support for the war is the only possible choice they can make . </lie.v.5195><lie.v.5196>The lies on the web pages referred to go all the way from the pip that somehow Aesthetic Realism is against higher education ( despite the fact that persons with graduate degrees , and persons who attend college , and college teachers study it ! ); to the disinformation about Eli Siegel ' s death; to a repulsively false picture of what it means to study Aesthetic Realism with a wide array of fabrications in between. Before we comment on them , we 're going to quote ten statements by some eminent people , where Eli Siegel and his work are described truly . </lie.v.5196><lie.v.5197>It is a poor lie that is a farrago of falsehood , whose only connections to the truth are a camouflage of verisimilitude calculated to further the deception. The art of lying lies in abundant and creative truthfulness. The victim goes to his grave asking " How did that happen ? Everything we checked was true and we thought we had checked everything. " </lie.v.5197><lie.v.5198>The sixth impediment is crime. They are not in agreement as to how many instances of this impediment they should devise. However , there are actually these three : if someone lies with a girl , he may not thereafter marry her sister or her aunt , niece , or cousin; again , whoever commits adultery with a woman may not marry her after her husband 's death; again , if a wife ( or husband ) should murder her spouse for love of another , she may not subsequently marry the loved one. Here it rains fools upon fools. Do n't you believe them , and do n't be taken in by them; they are under the devil 's whip. Sins and crimes should be punished , but with other penalties , not by forbidding marriage. Therefore , no sin or crime is an impediment to marriage. David committed adultery with Bathsheba , Uriah 's wife , and had her husband killed besides. He was guilty of both crimes; still he took her to wife and begot King Solomon by her [ II Samuel 11 ] , and without giving any money to the pope ! </lie.v.5198><lie.v.5199>I stopped listening to any and all petitioners when I realized I was duped into signing my name onto an anti-estate tax proposal. Of course the person standing on The Ave in Seattle 's University District knew precisely where he was and that no one there in their right mind would sign such a petition , so he lied right to my face about what the petition was for. This only confirms my suspicions about them , and now I know that there is n't even legal oversight on these sorts of things. Jeez . </lie.v.5199><lie.v.5200>The writer 's amorality is distressing , too. She seems to have no serious sense of what lying does over time to a human being , even a female. The internal corruption and loss of contact with reality ... that results from lying and kidding yourself about your own lies ... is a very high price to pay for " success. " The author seems not to think it matters much. The author accepts the premise of her subjects , which is that " lying is a pretty good technique for advancement " and that the corruption of one 's spirit through lying is no big deal . </lie.v.5200><lie.v.5201>The amount of misery caused by 'innocent ' lies goes beyond all comprehension -- and usually just keeping one 's mouth shut would have done the job just as well. I suspect that a lot of people 'Just ca n't handle the truth , ' and seek out liars to make them feel happy ... . Just after that moment comes the realization that they have been left abandoned in 'The Land of Rosy Scenarios ' ... . Perhaps I hate lies most of all because I see customers every day who look for folks who will lie to them , find them , and are left holding the bag afterwards ... . Sad ! </lie.v.5201><lie.v.5202>When enumerating the crimes of a criminal , the elders said : He stole , killed and even lied ! They considered lie as the gravest of all sins , because indeed it is the cause and guilty of all sins. The most ridiculous individual is he who pretends to be what he is not; this is a subtle way of lying and a behavior very common in proud people. Lie weakens the human being; the liar ' s word is false and his speech is boring and feeble . </lie.v.5202><lie.v.5203>I particularly like the guy I met recently who lied about his surname , his job , where he lived and oh yes his loving wife. Maybe the sex was good and worth all that trading in on your integrity. That double life sh*t is so yesterday. Of course google is great for the canny searcher. *censored* ... beware girls . </lie.v.5203><lie.v.5204>In this exercise , the person lies on their back on a low horizontal bench and raises and lowers a barbell with their arms. The main muscles being trained are the muscles of the front of the chest : pectoralis major and pectoralis minor ( known to bodybuilders as the ' pecs ' ) , and the muscle called triceps at the back of each upper arm that has the action of extending ( straightening ) the the upper limb at the elbow. It may seem paradoxical that the same muscles are used in both phases of the exercise , lifting and lowering. As the bar is lowered towards the chest , the pectoral muscles and triceps are ' paying out ' ( lengthening ) under control , and are still actively working against gravity and the weight. Subsidiary muscles that assist in the exercise are the anterior fibres of deltoid , the rotator cuff of muscles that stabilise the shoulder joint , the flexor muscles of the forearm that enable hands to grip the barbell , and the muscles involved in respiration. Remember , breathing while training is crucial , and must be co-ordinated with the exercise. Many other muscles will be playing a background role by stabilising the body ' s position . </lie.v.5204><lie.v.5205>Thus these words addressed to the Tempter are not a reference to the fact that snakes go around on their bellies. True , they do that , but they do not literally eat dust , as the Word here says. This is figurative language , as we have found used so many times through these accounts in Genesis. The words depict and describe humiliation and utter degradation. To this day one of the most humiliating things that anyone can be forced to do is to lie on his belly in the dirt. It means pride has been brought low; he is humiliated , shamed. This has forevermore entered into the language as an expression of humiliation . </lie.v.5205><lie.v.5206>Language is complex. People tell jokes , insult each other , gossip , and tell lies to mislead and manipulate others. Even people who do not use language to manipulate are wary of others who can and do. Nouns , verbs , pronouns , and proper names exist in all languages. Many words have several meanings. Words are used to describe size , location , motion , body parts , giving , colors and numbers. Special forms of speech are used for special occasions. Baby talk , poetry , proverbs , and sayings all have their special roles. A variety of recurring sounds , called phonemes , make up speech. Shifts in tone and timing indicate when it is time to take turns in speaking. More frequently used words are typically shorter. Onomatopoetic words , whose sound suggests their meaning , exist in all languages . </lie.v.5206><lie.v.5207>The lie detector straddles some of the deepest fault lines in modern culture : between body and soul , mind and matter , human and machine , public and private. Not surprisingly then , pundits have warred long and hard over it. Does it really detect lies ? A great deal of data have been assembled through the years in support of the proposition that it does , and an equally large amount has been arrayed suggesting that it does not. Should the lie detector be used ? Many have said yes , but only if the machine has been proved totally reliable. Many others have said no especially if it has been proved reliable ! Accurate or not , this is a formidable technology. Thus , despite having been debunked by scientists and denounced by moralists , the polygraph has been embraced by government and big business as a powerful tool of social control and surveillance. The legal system has been ambivalent : The police have routinely used the device to navigate investigations and to secure confessions , but the courts have firmly rejected lie-detector results as legitimate evidence . </lie.v.5207><lie.v.5208>You are of your father the devil , and your will is to do your father ' s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning , and has nothing to do with the truth , because there is no truth in him. When he lies , he speaks out of his own character , for he is a liar and the father of lies . </lie.v.5208><lie.v.5209>So. He lays it out proving Bush lied willingly , then tells Novak not to tell him what to think , then sticks his tail between his legs and agrees that , no , he was n't saying Bush lied. He just ca n't do it . </lie.v.5209><lie.v.5210>Many children lie to protect themselves from judgment and criticism because the believe it when adults say they are bad. Of course they want to avoid this kind of pain . </lie.v.5210><lie.v.5211>Perhaps we can find in our children the unadulterated origin of the impulse to lie. My son , now 4-years old , has just begun to lie. His reasons are transparent : He lies either to get something he wants ( usually cookies , candy , or toys ) , or to avoid something he doesn ' t want ( typically to take responsibility for a transgression ) . McCain ' s lies seem to fall squarely in the first category. As a maverick , outsider it suited him to talk straight. But as an establishment insider , it ' s much more effective for him to lie. He ' s always wanted power and success , and now that lying seems to offer the best path to victory , he ' s adopted it with the same zeal he once reserved for honesty. The tactic is all the more successful because , in Obama , he seems to be up against a candidate who has some genuine integrity a terrible handicap against smear tactics . </lie.v.5211><lie.v.5212>Another guy who stopped as soon as they had a story. What I do n't understand is why they lie , when 10 seconds on google is going to destroy their credibility. This is n't even half lies , this is just made up bull ... </lie.v.5212><lie.v.5213>This lesson and this apprenticeship must come , however , from the oppressed themselves and from those who are truly solidary with them. As individuals or as peoples , by fighting for the restoration of their humanity they will be attempting the restoration of true generosity. Who are better prepared than the oppressed to understand the terrible significance of an oppressive society ? Who suffer the effects of oppression more than the oppressed ? Who can better understand the necessity of liberation ? They will not gain this liberation by chance but through the praxis of their quest for it , through their recognition of the necessity to fight for it. And this fight , because of the purpose given it by the oppressed , will actually constitute an act of love opposing the lovelessness which lies at the heart of the oppressors ' violence , lovelessness even when clothed in false generosity . </lie.v.5213><lie.v.5214>Thus , it appears that lying is a practice that all have recourse to , and it s sad to say that a lie is never very far from leaving our mouths. When faced with a difficult situation , some people may resort to lying. There really is no complete and total method of washing lying out of our mentality , but with a resolution to do so as minimally as possible , perhaps the battle against falsehood can be won. But , more often than not , we treat our own lying in a glib way. We are more likely to pass over our small , petty lies , since to do this gives us peace of mind. It s the big lies that leave a mark on our conscience. Fear of punishment , compensation against survival anxiety , aggression , fantasy fulfillment , manipulation , building self-esteem , and finally , genetics , are all established motives for lying. With a wealth of reasons for lying , it s hard to avoid it altogether. Why fall prey to lying ? Because we are human . </lie.v.5214><lie.v.5215>After listing the litany of lies above ( only a partial listing of lies in the last six years ) , one can not help but conclude : The government of George W.

Do not let too much time lapse between the times you spend with your puppy to train him. Go back to a quiet place away from distractions. This time when you use the command , " lie down , " coax the dog down by holding a dog treat in front of him and pull your hand down and away in a forward direction enticing the dog to lie down. You may need to help with a gentle push down with your hand on his back. Once the dog is in the position , again give him the dog treat and lots of praise. Practice this over and over again every day until your dog gets the hang of it . </lie.v.5221><lie.v.5222>Similarly , parents do not want their teens smoking and drinking. So teens that engage in such behaviors might lie about them to their parents. And parents do not want their teens to be sexually active. They know that sexual activity places them at risk for a whole host of problems. It is , therefore , not uncommon for female teens to lie about sexually activity. Some teens fall into a pattern of repetitive lying. They find that it enables them to deal with the demands of their parents , teachers , and friends. Over time , lying becomes a learned pattern of behavior , a habit. They will lie without thinking twice about what they are doing . </lie.v.5222><lie.v.5223>- My guess is that it has more to do with a person ' s character.

Or does he recognize the harm being inflicted on the public , but believes so strongly in the ideological purity of unfettered corporate profiteering that he 's willing to lie ? When he votes to give tax cut after tax cut to the rich , does he really believe that those tax cuts are fair , or has he determined that rewarding his campaign contributors , and thus extending the curiosity that is John Ensign 's political career , is so important , that the ends justify the means , i.e. , it 's worth telling lies ? </lie.v.5224><lie.v.5225>God 's commandment was , " Be fruitful , and multiply , " and every specie was to bring forth after his own kind. But in Eve 's womb was a creature , cross-bred from Satan through the serpent , and not in the original creation. Whatever does not derive from His thoughts can never submit to His will , for His Will is His Word , which is His thoughts expressed. He instituted marriage and joined the first pair together. The tragedy lies in the breaking of this first marriage when Eve usurped authority over her husband , listening to one she knew to be inspired by Satan. She then instructed her husband in this secret knowledge and gave herself to Him . </lie.v.5225><lie.v.5226>At some point , every child lies. Lying has become a learned and ingrained part of humanity. Adults lie all the time and many do it in front of their kids.

In " ber einen Typus der Pseudoaffektifivit t ( 'Als ob ' ) " ( 1934 ) Helen Deutsch introduced the important notion of the " as if " personality , which is not a utilitarian lie told on a given occasion , but rather protects the " true Self " with a " false Self " ( Donald Winnicott ) . Mythomania can also be situated within this framework of a narcissistic pathology in which lies are addressed both to others and to the self. Moreover , in " The Antisocial Tendency " ( 1956/1984 ) Winnicott situated theft associated with lying at the heart of antisocial tendencies in children and adolescents , but also connected this to incontinence and anything that makes a mess.

Relax the muscles of your face forehead , eyes , cheeks , mouth , chin. Pretend you are an old piece of rope lying on the ground. When you have relaxed completely , repeat the process. You will discover a residue of tension here and there which must be gotten rid of. Do not let your mind wander and free-associate , but concentrate on some soothing image , such as clouds floating in the sky. Hold the image. Do not let yourself relax into sleep. After a few moments reverse the process by deliberately tensing the relaxed muscles one by one. Stretch hard.

Her characters are down to earth : they are coarse , fat , bald , myopic , have uneven teeth , they talk their own talk , and are , in short , human , living all they can since that ' s all they have; but she is nevertheless with Forster because she cares about religion , prophecy , philosophy. The main resemblance between the two books goes beyond the plot allusions everybody talks about. What lies behind both is an idea of the novel as what Lawrence called the one bright book of life a source of truth and otherworldliness and prophecy . </lie.v.5318><lie.v.5319>Leviticus 20 : 12 " 'If a man lies with his daughter-in-law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have committed a perversion; their blood shall be upon them.

Michael , you are just rejecting the grand Republican narrative . </lie.v.5323><lie.v.5324>In needlessly provoking the Chinese , the Obama administration is caving in to the lobbyists , both foreign and domestic , and their allies in the War Party , who would like nothing better than a new enemy to justify their profit margins and ceaseless warmongering. Our real national interests lie in maintaining peaceful trade relations with the country that has replaced us as the world ' s factory. We have no interest , not even an ideological one , in supporting the Taiwanese secessionists against the central government in Beijing : While China is an authoritarian state , Taiwan is very far from being a democracy. The form is there , but the content is sadly lacking . </lie.v.5324><lie.v.5325>Others in the administration made statements more bold than did Bush and some of those are lies. ie " We know where they are [ WMDs ] . They 're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east , west , south and north somewhat. " or " [ the aluminum tubes are ] only really suited for nuclear weapons programs. " The first of those statements is an unequivocal statement of knowledge that he did not possess. ( He could not have known they were there since they were not. ) The second statement was contradicted by the IAEA and the Dept of Energy prior to the statement. Maybe when Bush made that claim in the SOTU he had been misinformed , but someone was doing that misinforming and they were tied to the administration and they if not he were certainly lying . </lie.v.5325><lie.v.5326>The capacity to lie is noted early and nearly universally in human development. Social psychology and developmental psychology are concerned with the theory of mind , which people employ to simulate another 's reaction to their story and determine if a lie will be believable. The most commonly cited milestone , what is known as Machiavellian intelligence , is at the age of about four and a half years , when children begin to be able to lie convincingly. Before this , they seem simply unable to comprehend that anyone does n't see the same view of events that they do and seem to assume that there is only one point of view , which is their own . </lie.v.5326><lie.v.5327>If you often find yourself being deceptive with family and friends to sidestep troubling issues , you may need to strengthen your interpersonal skills.

Bush told the Associated Press that " It 's a 20-second conversation. I had no substantive conversation with the guy. Twenty seconds. That 's hardly enough time to even say hello , much less sit down and have a substantive discussion. All I know is it lasted no time. And that hardly constitutes a serious discussion.

When the pregnant woman lies on her back , the uterus falls to rest on the vertebral column and the adjacent blood vessels. As the pregnancy progresses , when the woman lies in on her back , the large pregnant uterus consistently compresses on the venous system; the system in your body that returns blood back to the heart from the lower half of the body. This in turn causes the filling of the heart to be decreased and can decrease the amount of blood that the heart is able to pump to the body . </lie.v.5334><lie.v.5335>This intimate , visceral biography was drawn directly from over 2 , 500 pages of Mary 's handwritten letters , journals and diaries , none of which , she could have imagined , would ever be read by strangers. Therein lies their power. During the Civil War , Mary and her husband , William , stood helpless as two sons were killed , another was driven insane , their slaves were freed , and the world as they knew it was swept away by a hurricane of social change. In her own words , Mary tells us about the joys , sorrows , frustrations , and terrors she and her family faced in nineteenth-century Charleston. The letters and images they left behind offer priceless insights into the anguished roots of Southern social history . </lie.v.5335><lie.v.5336>Leviticus 20 : 15-16 : " And if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast.

So I dont think it was any of his busness I used protection and I always safe and im clean so I dont think that it was wrong.

Experts say that it generally has to do with self-esteem; people lie because they are n't happy with themselves. They want to be seen as more exciting people; they want to be loved. They need more friends . </lie.v.5339><lie.v.5340>" There is a great deal of research which shows that senior people are likely to be working long hours and are , therefore , less likely to find time to indulge in hobbies and social activities. At the same time , however , businesses are extolling the virtues of the work/life balance. So , while this research at face value offers us simply an amusing insight into the habits of senior people , it does have a serious message. At a time when " having it all " - and critically " having it all in perfect balance " - is perceived to be the measure of true success , the only way overworked employees can be seen to achieve this objective is to lie about the richness of their life out of the workplace !

He , and the people working with him , tell one lie after another and keep repeating them after they ' ve been carefully exposed as lies seven ways to Sunday. It should be clear there is no connection between what people like Obama , Pelosi , Reid , Dodd , Durbin , Axelrod , and Gibbs say and reality. They seem to be all disciples of the great community organizer , Saul Alinsky , who wrote that the end justifies the means.

When it was first available , it was used only for the most high risk situations. However , it is now used for everyone regardless of risk status. A large reason why EFM is used so extensively is that staff is in short supply and this technology allows for fewer caregivers. There are two kinds of monitors : external and internal. The external monitors are attached to a heavy elastic band that is strapped across the mother 's abdomen. She must lie quietly so the monitors do not slip. The baby 's heartbeat is recorded on a machine that documents the moment-to-moment heart rate on graph paper along with the mother 's contractions. The internal monitor does the same things , but it is attached directly into the baby 's head by a metal screw. The uterine contractions are monitored by a probe that is inserted into the uterus.

Clinton may have lied to preserve his power while telling himself that he was lying to protect " the people " who benefited from his presidency. Liars -- especially liars in power -- often conflate their interest with the public interest. ( What 's good for General Motors is good for the United States. ) Or they consider their lies sanctified by the essential goodness they presume to embody , like terrorists who believe that murder is sanctified by the godliness of their aspirations.

" There are two lies : the unique worship word for the Church of Christ in the wilderness was to rest , read and rehearse the Word of God : the Campbell 's knew that " church is a school of the Bible " and " worship is reading and musing the Word. " Both Paul and Peter define that over and over. Worship would be to give heed to " that which is written " or the Word of Christ in the never-musical passages. If using the performing artists singing their own compositions is claimed to give heed to Christ and His word it is both a lie and a wonder or " show " of godliness. Such " teams " were introduced as having the power to " lead the worshipers into the presence of God " which claims the role of God in Christ standing in the holy places of church architecture . </lie.v.5389><lie.v.5390>" Oh , for goodness ' sake , " you might be thinking , " that is ridiculous -- that is just for fun -- those are n't really lies. " But folks , if you are telling your child that the Easter bunny , Santa Claus , or the Tooth Fairy are real or that they exist , then you are lying to your child. You know it is n't true and yet you are telling your child that it is. That is a lie. And it is very serious business. I can list two vital reasons why you must not lie to your child about these matters , or if you already have then why you should confess now and tell him the truth . </lie.v.5390><lie.v.5391>Introduction : We are living in an age of relativism. By using that term , I am referring to the lack of absolutes that are to govern life and conduct. In relativism , right and wrong is not determined by objective truth , but by subjective opinion and pragmatic results. Thus , many believe that there is no absolute truth , and that in certain situations it is acceptable to lie. This may be more of a dilemma than it appears to be. Even many " Christians " do not believe in firm absolutes ! It is therefore important to define and maintain truth biblically , and recognize how God views lying . </lie.v.5391><lie.v.5392>You do not need to lie so they think anything and everything they do is wonderful and deserving special merit or attention no matter how slap dash. Neither do you need to lock them into pleasing you and only producing your own way of expressing feelings. Ask them what it is for them , their meaning or value . </lie.v.5392><lie.v.5393>Because we all lie , and we Americans lie to ourselves. One lie we tell ourselves is that we dislike lying. We don ' t. Ours is a dishonest society; it ' s part of our charm. We love a con man. Otherwise all those con man movies ( think : The Sting ) would not be so popular . </lie.v.5393><lie.v.5394>The perception is that everybody hooks up all the time and loves it , but in reality people are hooking up far less than they think others are. A lot of students had one hook-up experience , but that certainly is not rampant. People lie about how much sex they ' re having and inflate what ' s going on because the social pressure to hook up is really enormous . </lie.v.5394><lie.v.5395>The biggest liars in this country are in the media. Obama lies like a dog and the media never questions it , they just repeat it. Palin says two things , both true ( that she put the plane on eBay and killed the bridge ) and the left-wing media and the Democrats say she 's lying . </lie.v.5395><lie.v.5396>The physical world is simply a place to experiment with truth. All the symbols in our life are physical creations or manifestations of our own truth. If we are driving a brand new luxury car that costs tens of thousands of dollars , that symbol says that we are rich , in debt , living past our means , egotistical , or a number of other things. The symbol is a truth about how we see ourselves and it can be judged by others , but mostly misinterpreted. The real truth lies between the judgements . </lie.v.5396><lie.v.5397>The A-plot focused on a murdered teacher and the web of lies protecting a high school principal who 'd impregnated one of his students in an affair. Believe me , we were nowhere near this when the episode began , so it was an impressive maneuver to get there. The B-plot was just as delightfully unexpected as we went from a congressman having sex with a prostitute to a man trying to reconnect with his daughter and turn her from such a dark and shameful profession. In the end , Lightman even lied to the client ( the DNC ) to protect the congressman 's daughter , allowing him to resign in potential disgrace . </lie.v.5397><lie.v.5398>But it wasn ' t just lies to get the warrant to search Kathryn Johnston ' s home that made Junnier uneasy , he said.

He said the northwest Atlanta house differed from the informant ' s description . </lie.v.5398><lie.v.5399>But , the struggle begins at precisely that point , you see , for on the other side of that thought is the thought that maybe a white lie , or at least too big of a white lie , does more harm than good. Could it be that it has the potential to enable a person or condone their behavior rather than at least planting the seed of thought that they are n't the most polite , reasonable , etc. Or , that perhaps the white lie told is too easy of an out and by relying on it , we are somehow diminishing ourselves , or not fully standing up for what we believe in or can not tolerate ? And , if that 's the case , what about the internal sense of peacefulness -- meaning , if we lie to spare feelings or to get out of a situation without any trouble , are we really creating peace or are we simply saying that making a situation with another person peaceful is more important than our own peace of mind and self-care ? </lie.v.5399><lie.v.5400>mine is pronounced like yours and often unfortunately , the lies told by when they lie deep enough to convince themselves , then it es the truth. crucially , they demonstrate this ability often enough to that - as theatre is the place for the well-told lie rather , a lonely heatr mp3 as picasso had it , a lie told often enough becomes truth writer art is a lie that tells the truth . </lie.v.5400><lie.v.5401>What sorts of things do you lie about and what do you get out of lying about these things ? Sometimes , people make up stories about themselves and their lives because they 're afraid that they 're not interesting enough to hold a conversation otherwise.

Could this be how it is for you ? </lie.v.5401><lie.v.5402>CNN is there a rule out there that says you cant say that Palin LIED. She lied to voters in her very first speech to the nation.

But lying to the one person who really needs to know the truth and is bound by doctor/patient privilege and federal law to keep that info private can be a very big deal. When you tell even a fib , your doctor ca n't diagnose you correctly , which wastes your time and money and may keep her from giving treatment that could save your life.

" </lie.v.5406><lie.v.5407>Although the word Kundalini may appear strange for many readers and the concept of it even incomprehensible to the Western mind , in fact it is closer to each person than his own heart. Kundalini is closer than the breath in the body for it is the breather and the breath. In its dormant form it is the very essence of all life. It is the basic energy of all motion and activity. The coiled Kundalini lies dormant from birth at the base of the spine in every individual until one day it is awakened , then it ascends through the spinal column and the subtle nerve channels of the subtle body cleansing and clearing blockages as it rises towards the crown ... where it merges with the energy of the higher Self. This connects the individual to the cosmic energy source so she is no longer an isolated , separated entity , but a conduit of the divine cosmic force . </lie.v.5407><lie.v.5408>Politico is definitely a left leaning media outlet , but I have to give them credit for even mentioning this story. The NY Times does n't have it anywhere on their site. This is just one reason why NY Times is falling as Politico is rising. I am fascinated by those in this post who say it is not a big deal , though. A bow is a sign of submission. World leaders do not submit to other world leaders. And even worse ( it 's not the end of the world if BO made a mistake ) his press secretary tried to lie about it. I generally trust Obama but his press guy lying will quickly erode that trust . </lie.v.5408><lie.v.5409>We 're all used to lies from politicians , so used to them that most of us barely react at all when we come across a new one. But one thing that fascinates me is someone lying boldly , that is , lying when it 's so easy to find the truth and when they know that lots of people will in fact find it. One perfect recent example of this is Jerry Falwell 's lie that his ministry had never lost their tax exempt status at any time. He said that on national television knowing full well that it was a lie and that , in fact , it was a matter of public record and that the resulting IRS fine had been announced in a letter written by Falwell himself. And to top it off , even after being caught in this lie , he proceeded to repeat the lie on another national TV show. That takes some serious chutzpah , does n't it ? Well I would submit that Vice President Dick Cheney showed similar chutzpah during the VP debate the other night. I 'll give just two examples out of many . </lie.v.5409><lie.v.5410>Why the lie ? We want to impress. Who wants to tell their date I light the boss ' s cigarettes and paint her toe nails if she asks especially if he just said I am the MD of a company . But there is a strong chance he is lying too or at the very least embellishing his position. The problem with this lie is if he phones you at work someone is bound to say Sorry she is painting the She-Devils toenails ! </lie.v.5410><lie.v.5411>Through ignorance or carelessness speakers and writers often confuse the forms of the two distinct verbs lay and lie. Lay is a transitive verb , and has for its preterit laid; as , he told me to lay it down , and I laid it down. Lie is intransitive , and has for its preterit lay; as , he told me to lie down , and I lay down. Some persons blunder by using laid for the preterit of lie; as , he told me to lie down , and I laid down. So persons often say incorrectly , the ship laid at anchor; they laid by during the storm; the book was laying on the shelf , etc. It is only necessary to remember , in all such cases , that laid is the preterit of lay , and not of lie . </lie.v.5411><lie.v.5412>He does n't lie about Iraq and he 's ready to fight to bring our troops home and end this miserable war for oil.

There was one pre-condition : the other party had to accept whatever offer was made to them. Using either e-mail or pen-and-paper communications , the MBA students reported the size of the pot , truthful or not , and how much the other party would get. More than 9 out of 10 students using email lied about the amount of money to be divided , while about 2 in 3 lied about the pot size in the pen-and-paper condition. The rate of lying was almost 50 greater between email v. pen and paper.

For feminist theology , the difficulty does not lie with the male metaphors. Men as well as women are created in the image of God. The problem lies in the fact that the specific male images reflect a patriarchal arrangement of the world , casting God into the mold of an omnipotent , even if benevolent , monarch.

' He then insisted : 'What we have left is the hard core. ' But , of course , Cheney has always insisted that those held in Guant namo were the hard core - the 'worst of the worst , ' as former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it - while ignoring evidence that many were falsely imprisoned there , and assiduously working to quash efforts to ascertain their actual guilt or innocence. Confronted with criticisms of the Bush administration 's torture policy , Cheney simply lied , saying : 'We do n't do torture. We never have. ' " However , later in the ABC News interview , " Cheney bluntly admitted that he had supported the waterboarding of al-Qaeda mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Waterboarding is , of course , torture , devised by torturers as a method of torture , an inconvenient fact ...

She could n't tell her mother because mother was the type who would " rather See her daughter in her grave " than have an abortion and she probably would try to force the man into a shotgun marriage. Katherine was sensible enough to see that the man would evade this , or if he married her , would hate her for the trick.

Yet , at this very same meeting Tendler earlier stated that he never met with women alone ! Most members of his own congregation and others plainly recognize this to be another blatant lie that requires no proof whatsoever , many having witnessed him on innumerable occasions secluded with women.

Definitely not a two handed shake ( why would they even lie about something that is clearly on video ? , definitely a bow with his left hand crossing his midsection and his right hand grasping the saudi prince 's hand. Not definite , a low bow to the saudi hand - forhead touching.

They had lied to us about everything and fed us biased information in order to be able to manipulate us. The Nazi society and state were built on lies , the most prominent being that there was no God and that therefore religion should be kept out of education and society. Translated into American , that same Nazi principle is referred to as the separation of church and state. An additional lie is that the Constitution mandates that separation. I can not find that provision in the Constitution or the amendments , after reading and rereading them. Maybe the concept actually comes from Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf , where it fits in very well. In any case , when those who push it refer to separating " church and state , " they lie. What they actually want is the separation of God , and His moral law , from society. They promote it because of their own immorality and not because of any concern for the Constitution . </lie.v.5470><lie.v.5471> Sacred Scripture , in its very first book , Genesis , points to the lie told at the very beginning of history by the animal with a forked tongue , whom the Evangelist John calls ''the father of lies'' ( Jn 8 : 44 ) . Lying is also one of the sins spoken of in the final chapter of the last book of the Bible , Revelation , which bars liars from the heavenly Jerusalem : ''outside are ... all who love falsehood'' ( 22 : 15 ) . Lying is linked to the tragedy of sin and its perverse consequences , which have had , and continue to have , devastating effects on the lives of individuals and nations. We need but think of the events of the past century , when aberrant ideological and political systems wilfully twisted the truth and brought about the exploitation and murder of an appalling number of men and women , wiping out entire families and communities. After experiences like these , how can we fail to be seriously concerned about lies in our own time , lies which are the framework for menacing scenarios of death in many parts of the world . </lie.v.5471><lie.v.5472>My problem with the lying argument is that every politician lies , but pundits and bloggers seem to only call out the other side ' s lies. I mean , how many different stories did we hear about Bush ' s questionable service during Vietnam ? Was that a prelude to the shifting justification for the Iraq War ? I ' m not sure. If you took him at his word during the campaign , then he was against nation building that was pretty unambiguous but now he has engaged in a half-dozen different reasons for it , in a pattern that , to me anyway , fits the affirmative defenses pattern that Bookworm cited. Maybe that was necessary to ease the American public into a war with controversial justification , or maybe Bush is also a compulsive liar. I ' m just not sure how fruitful that discussion ultimately is. So I leave questions of psychology to MD ' s and await a quality policy debate if and when our politicians move past b.s. rhetoric and actually start revealing those policies </lie.v.5472><lie.v.5473>The film follows Sikaine through all aspects of the process except the surgery itself.

And , remarkably , he ' s still married . </lie.v.5474><lie.v.5475>It ' s an unsettling finding that prompts a number of questions , the first of which is , if powerful people can lie without suffering consequences , are they prone to lie more ? Even a very ethical person who suddenly finds herself in a position of power is probably going to notice on a conscious or unconscious level that lying no longer feels bad , Carney says. We can ' t say empirically that power makes a person lie more , but the evidence does suggest that power would make you lie more easily and therefore more often. </lie.v.5475><lie.v.5476>" The essence of lying is in deception , not in words. A lie may be told by silence , by equivocation , by the accent on a syllable , by a glance of the eye attaching a peculiar significance to a sentence. All these kinds of lies are worse and baser by many degrees than a lie plainly worded. No form of blinded conscience is so far sunk as that which comforts itself for having deceived because the deception was by gesture or silence , instead of utterance.

Some neuroscientists ( scientists who study the nervous system ) believe that a problem with special brain nerve cells , called mirror neurons may be partly at fault. Mirror neurons are active whenever a person observes or tries to imitate another person 's actions. Imitation is an important step toward empathy and viewing the world from another person 's perspective.

Perjury is a felony. It is an offense punishable by prison time for an ordinary citizen. It is a much more serious offense for an Officer of the Court , which all lawyers are. It is even more serious for the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of America , the President , to commit perjury , because it undermines the very foundation of our entire judicial system.

Who can better understand the necessity of liberation ? They will not gain this liberation by chance but through the praxis of their quest for it , through their recognition of the necessity to fight for it.

It can cause a person ' s dreams to suffer. For example , think about the Olympics and how it is someone ' s dream to be in them someday but the thing that stops him or her is the thought that the judges might be paid off for someone else to win or one of the contestants lies about their age and makes the competition unfair. Or say someone wants to be an actor but his friend gets all the roles because he has family in the biz. We lie to ourselves to not go out in life to get what we want because we figure it isn ' t worth it anyway. If everything is laced with ugliness and life is so unfair than our dreams will be crushed or won ' t mean much when we do achieve them. It ' s no wonder the news is so horrible. Relationships suck.

What I mean is that some liars will spend a lot of time convincing themselves and others that they are not really lying at all. Clarke just told outright lies and knew it. Furthermore his arrogance didn ' t translate into confidence. Every time he screwed up he fully expected to be fired , wondered should he resign , he anxiously awaited word of his forgiveness , was openly disappointed when he would fail to be promoted and despite all his outrageous affairs and philandering ( he fancied Margaret Thatcher and his descriptions of her are hilariously at odds with one ' s normal perceptions ) its obvious he really loved his wife.

Some would say that the midwives should have boldly told Pharaoh that they disobeyed his command. In my opinion , to not lie in that situation would have been exceedingly reckless , and would have bordered on putting God to the test. To tell the Pharaoh that they purposely disobeyed him may have put the lives of other midwives in danger , and would certainly have put their own lives in danger. Someone might say , " Well , they should just tell the truth , and trust that God would save them.

When he saw Antigonus at that time coming through the Temple , Judas called out to his friends , of whom a fair number of disciples were seated with him : " Alas , now it is time for me to die since the truth has died on me and one of my foretellings has proved a lie , for Antigonus here is alive although he ought to have been killed today. The place for his decease was fixed by fate as Straton 's Tower , and that tower is a good six hundred stadia from here , while the day has reached the fourth hour. The time has rendered invalid the prophecy. " With these words the old man pondered hard with gloomy countenance , and a little later it was announced that Antigonus had been killed in the underground spot which is also called Straton 's Tower , having the same name as Caesarea by the coast.

So a subject undergoing interrogation might , in theory , only have to perform a task requiring one of these processes in order to stimulate the frontal lobe as well as other parts of the brain.

People sheltering the manipulative lie find it a very convenient way of structuring their associations with others. They recognize that lying can paint an impressive picture of themselves with minimal effort expended. By crafting lies about themselves , they can create an identity that is in tune with their private beliefs of who they are. For example , a person who plays a sport at the amateur level , but believes that he plays with professional expertise , may say , " Next year I ll be drafted into the pros , " or , " I used to play at the professional level.

When breathing from the diaphragm , clients are often told to lie down on a rug or blanket , with their legs slightly apart , arms to the sides , not touching the body , and eyes closed. Attention is brought to the client 's breathing by placing one hand on the chest and the other hand on the abdomen area. The client is then instructed to breathe through the nose and exhale out the mouth. Each time the client breathes in , he or she should try to breathe deeper. This should be practiced for a minimum of five minutes once or twice a day. Over a few weeks of practice , the time period engaged in diaphragmatic breathing should be increased to 20 minutes and the activity can be performed while lying down , sitting , or standing . </lie.v.5600><lie.v.5601>Impeachment is not a way to pick a president , and if all you 're worried about is picking a president , you have no business monkeying around with something as profoundly significant as impeachment.

Would Iran commit suicide or would it insanely nuke Israel thereby committing a holocaust against Palestinians , the very people Iran loves and defends ? Would it destroy Jerusalem , while causing massive nuclear radiation in the entire region and risking massive nuclear retaliation from Israel , a state in possession of hundreds of nuclear weapons and a non-signatory to the Non Proliferation Treaty ?

Sometimes the lies are self-serving , of course , but the tendency -- or temptation -- to lie in service of justice makes it virtually impossible to condemn all lying categorically . </lie.v.5652><lie.v.5653>You do n't want to become " that kind of parent " but you already are.

No discussion of lying in a relationship would be complete without a discussion of lie detection , especially for men , because women are naturally more adept at both lying and its detection than we are; their brain structure makes them more sensitive to " tells " ( and are VERY dangerous poker players if they have math skills ! ) and more creative. It could in fact take years with a woman to determine how her character dictates whether , when , and for what reasons she will lie to you , but chances are that if you are lying to her , you 're already busted whether you know it or not , so let 's level the playing field a bit . </lie.v.5656><lie.v.5657>This statement was a lie , and is one of many instances in which Biblical persons of good will have lied in order to protect themselves while doing good. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] At issue is whether telling a lie is ever an acceptable , much less a commendable , practice among Jews or Christians. While some commentators think that her willful misdirection of the king 's messengers was commendable , [ 10 ] others do not , and suggest that Rahab 's motive for her lie was self-protection and a failure to recognize that a God Who could capture a fortified city could also spare a single life.

Why do we do that ? What are the reasons to say lies ? Most people agree that some lying is even necessary - to avoid petty squabbles. A lie is a type of deception in the form of an untruthful statement with the intention to deceive , often with the further intention to maintain a secret or reputation , or to avoid punishment. To lie is to state something one believes is false with the intention that it be taken for the truth by someone else. A liar is a person who is lying , who has lied , or who lies repeatedly . </lie.v.5658><lie.v.5659>So these were the beginnings. Samuel Carpenter was still only six and as yet unaffected by the movement he was to join later. When this was we do not know , but it would clearly have been when he was a young man , and no doubt influenced by two other leading figures who were to make their presence felt locally. Ambrose Rigge and the Great William Penn. Ambrose Rigge suffered much persecution , and was imprisoned in Horsham gaol for seven years in 1662. William Penn , whose destiny , like Carpenter 's , was to lie in North America , was only five years older than Carpenter , so they were roughly contemporary . </lie.v.5659><lie.v.5660>As you can see the most popular category was feelings which , in this study , included lies about emotions , opinions and evaluations.

I 'm willing to bet serious money that Clinton got stoned. The think is that we in America are living a lie when it comes to Pot. It 's a harmless substance. Half the population has tried it , but it 's illegal. To admit you smoked Pot is to admit that you knowingly and deliberately broke the law. And do we want to elect a person who knowingly and deliberately take the law into their own hands and breaks it ? What kind of example does that set ? Personally , I 'm comfortable with it. People who never break the law scare me. But how can the voter justify voting for an admitted law breaker ? It 's simple. If you want to get elected , you 're expected to lie about smoking Pot . </lie.v.5663><lie.v.5664>I have also told lies to cover my butt because I didnt want to get introuble ( like lying about getting homework done or that fact I even had homework as a kid . ) </lie.v.5664><lie.v.5665>If a parent frequently punishes a child , that child is more likely to lie to avoid reprucussions.

The Fallujah of not that long ago was a symbol of rejection of the new democratic Iraq. Difficult days lie ahead to be sure , but the Fallujah today has some of the highest voter registration and turnout rates in the country , has increasingly capable and competent Iraq security forces in the streets helping to maintain order and hunting down terrorists. Fallujah is a place where the old adage about the U.S. Marines certainly fits -- no better friend , no worse enemy . </lie.v.5671><lie.v.5672>It seems our President and his advisors are clueless as to the desires , doctrines , and distinctives of Islam. While I feel a little audacious in giving advice to national leaders , it is necessary since no one else is doing it. Muslims lie not because they are liars by nature but by choice.

This is one of the stupidest lies she 's ever told , as she has a ton of stage experience. First , she toured in Les Miserables as one of the leads when she was 9. She performed at the WKRZ 20th Anniversary Show , then a series of 5 shows around the country to promote her horrible single , at a concert in 2002 for over 100 , 000 people in Dublin , even still performing as late as 2006 and 2007. And those are just the ones we can find proof of. This lie makes even less sense than the others ! </lie.v.5674><lie.v.5675>It is non-Muslim ' s common knowledge , that Muslims almost always lie to protect and glorify their Allah and Muhammad. They unashamedly state myths in public , non-Muslims would be ashamed of; without first thinking of the consequences of what they utter. But the non-Muslim responses have been ( 1 ) ' It is plain rubbish ' ( 2 ) ' who cares ' ( 3 ) to a polite , ' Is it so ? ' ( But perhaps , laughing inside at the stupidity of it all ) . </lie.v.5675><lie.v.5676>When people start going too far and insist that it means the same thing or of course fairness as a concept exists even if they don ' t have a word for it , it seems to me that what they are really doing is imposing one language and cultural system on another language and cultural system. And the result of that is just as bad as if they went too far in the other direction and made languages and cultures totally separate. It ' s just another kind of disaster. When a Russian lets a friend jump in line , Americans condemn him for being unfair. When an American won ' t let his friend jump in line , Russians condemn him for being dishonorable. Well , that ' s not a great example , but here ' s one : when the whole Clinton-Lewinski thing blew up , I tried to explain to an older Russian woman friend that it wasn ' t the sex , it was the lying. She was appalled. Of course he lied ! He had to lie ! Men shouldn ' t talk about that sort of thing ! </lie.v.5676><lie.v.5677>Hi everyone.

Women who have been told that their pelvis is " too small " , their babies " too big " , or that their cervix " just does n't dilate well " may well have had a problem with baby malposition instead. The popular mentality most doctors have been trained into is that labor problems must lie with the mother , rather than a problem that has gone unrecognized by the provider. So they often reinforce the myth of the too small pelvis or the huge baby that cant fit through. Only rarely is this true , however . </lie.v.5678><lie.v.5679>What possible sincerity could there be in an apology from someone who intentionally lied to everyone for years and did everything he could possibly do to prevent you from finding out what he 'd done ... and only decided to apologize when telling you lies was no longer an option ? </lie.v.5679><lie.v.5680>I found in general that people see their lies as being less harmful and more due to the situation and not one 's own personality.

Coupled with spectrometer readings which indicated that all three moons are covered in water ( which , this far from the sun , would certainly be frozen into extremely cold ice at the surface ) , this data strongly implied that Ganymede and Callisto have layers of H2O many hundreds of kilometers thick. The pressure from such a massive amount of H2O would create high-density ice at its base. The liquid ocean suggested by Galileo 's magnetometer would therefore lie sandwiched between an outer shell of regular ice and a base of high-density ice on these two moons , isolating the water from potential sources of nutrients . </lie.v.5681><lie.v.5682>Clinton lied while president and yet a decade later Bill Clinton is a very popular politician and his presidency is regarded by many of us as a very good one , Feldman says.

I hope they 're wrong , but it reminds me of a line that Tommy Lee Jones said in Men in Black. Will Smith said " why do n't you just tell people about the aliens , people are smart ? " Tommy Lee Jones answered " A person is smart , but people are dumb , panicky animals and you know it ! " Mccain " s hoping your too dumb to notice. If they 'll lie to get your vote , how do you think they 'll treat you once they have the power. This goes to the respect they do n't have for you.

But the contradictions go deeper than this prima-facie absurdity.

You can tell the difference between mis-speaking and lying by how often the account in question has been repeated and by evaluating what benefits , if any , were to be gained from individuals believing in this account. As the story comes as part of Mrs. Clinton ' s standard stump speech touting her national security credentials , it is clearly designed to make her look tough.

Joshua says the operation was to be done " secretly , " that is , without revealing the truth of their mission. Are not " spies " in the business of lying ? Why was Joshua right in sending men to spy out the land , while Rahab was wrong in lying about the route the spies took ? Why were the spies right in hiding and Rahab wrong in not revealing where they were hiding ? Is not that an act of deception ? Why did n't they rebuke Rahab for lying ?

More recent research , however , has found that most children learn to lie effectively between the ages of 2 and 4. The first successful lie can be pegged as a developmental achievement because it marks the child 's discovery that her mind and thinking are separate from her parents'.

The poem reaches deeper though and these two lovers ultimately stand for all the lovers in the entire world and the lies that bind them. Stephen Both describes the poem as an exercise in logically improbable , unnatural , and uncomfortable unions that are also indivisible ( 477 ) . The poem insightfully explores the role of the deluder and the deluded and how they can coexist in a single person. This leads to a warping of truth that forces both lovers to lie to themselves and thus demonstrates the complete perversion of truth. Sonnet 138 conveys the essential nature of deluded romance by mirroring the illogic of the lovers within the structure and diction of the poem . </lie.v.5742><lie.v.5743>When you draw an imaginary curved line between the bony prominence of the neck ( C7 ) , and the top of the shoulder joint ( the Acromion Process ) the point lies midway along this curved line , at the highest point of the shoulder muscle.

It has also been objected that it is not necessary for lying that the statement that is made be believed to be false; it is only necessary that the statement that is made be believed not to be true , or be believed to be probably false , or be not believed to be true ( Carson 2006 , 298 ) . </lie.v.5745><lie.v.5746>Hey , only those who voted for HilLIARy were played for suckers !

An upright torso can bring the baby 's head down to help open the cervix during the dilation phase and help the baby move down and out during the pushing phase. ( To see why you want gravity working for you , heft a gallon of milk or water -- about the weight of the average newborn -- to see how much force this exerts. ) A vertical torso can be achieved standing , sitting , kneeling , or squatting.

But as you know , this birth had not made her happy. Now , after her childbearing years are past , God comes and tells Abraham that in the coming year he will fulfill the longstanding promise of a child to him and to Sarah. Sarah ' s laugh is one of doubt and disillusionment toward God.

And they can make a woman feel she is not a respected partner in the relationship . </lie.v.5786><lie.v.5787>Of course people against Palin are going to lie and say she was for it before she was against it. The records show she considered it and had it killed. " Considering " and " being for " something are different . </lie.v.5787><lie.v.5788>By age 4 , children know the difference between telling the truth and lying and they know it 's wrong to lie. So , generally , they 're truthful , and when they 're not it 's obvious. But they also become more proficient at lying because they 're more cognitively capable of taking into account the listener 's belief of their statement . </lie.v.5788><lie.v.5789>i am currently reading the book; lies young women believe. I love it ! I am reading it with my bible study group of girls from church. I used to believe lie 3 of chapter4 " God should fix my problems " i believed it without even knowing it ! Whenever i prayed i would think up a checklist for god without realizing that i wasnt praising or thanking god , i was being really selfish and so now i pray to god about my problems but have stopped using that familier cheklist form. I have been much better off and recommend this lifestyle to anyone who isnt happy with their life ! God is enough and he deserves our gratitude ! ! ! I now pray to thank , praise , and ask for god . </lie.v.5789><lie.v.5790>In the Pyramid Texts Nehebu-Kau is called 'son of Selkis ' , the scorpion-goddess , emphasising his role in later spells of restoring the health of victims of venomous bites. Protective of royalty , Nehebu-Kau receives the monarch in the Afterlife and provides a meal. A Middle Kingdom spell identifies the deceased with this snake-god who is not subject to any magic , nor vulnerable to fire and water. One source of his power lies in the magical force of the number 'seven ' in the 'seven ' cobras which he swallowed. In a spell concerning the welfare of his heart in the Afterlife , the deceased requests other deities to give him a good recommendation to Nehebu-Kau. There is a hint in the Old Kingdom that Nehebu-Kau 's power needs to be controlled by the sun-god Atum pressing a fingernail on the snake 's spine. Another tradition makes Nehenu-Kau the son of the earth-god Geb and the harvest-goddess Renenutet. Consequently his chthonic and fecund power provides other deities with their vital strength . </lie.v.5790></lie.v.train>
