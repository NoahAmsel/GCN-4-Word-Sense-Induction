Longer delays will also be tolerated when a defendant is dilatory in asserting the right to a speedy trial. In general , defendants must assert their Sixth Amendment right in a timely motion before the trial court. If the defendant fails to assert the right in this manner or acquiesces in the face of protracted pretrial delays , she or he may not raise the issue for the first time on appeal , unless the defendant 's failure to raise the issue earlier was due to her or his attorney 's NEGLIGENCE. Defendants who delay prosecution by inundating the trial court with frivolous pretrial motions are also treated as having forfeited their rights to a speedy trial.

In its essence , Vittorio opined that it was the manner in which the civilized nations dealt with each other as it pertained to the land , that governed who had title. A European nation that discovered land occupied by aboriginal people , assumed certain rights over that land that were recognized by the other European nations. It was these " recognized " rights that were passed on to the United States when it won the War of Independence. I will not attempt to go on a further dissertation on the doctrine , except to say that , in it , Marshall found the rationale for asserting federal title power over the land versus state power. As a result , with the adoption of the " discovery doctrine , " the Court held the title to land passed to the plaintiff by the Illinois and Piankeshaw tribes was invalid because Indians held only a title of occupancy , and not full title . </assert.v.17><assert.v.18>( b ) Specific chemical identity ( 1 ) Claims applicable to period prior to commencement of manufacture.

The first clause refers to the recipient 's actual knowledge of facts , viz. , " time , place and circumstances giving rise to " the claim. The second clause invokes an objective reasonableness standard by which the meaning of what is " actual [ ly ] know [ n ] " is to be tested. It also is significant , in our view , that the foregoing provision speaks in terms of communicating an intent to assert a claim against the public entity. The use of the indefinite article ( " a " ) suggests that the notice need convey only an intent to assert some claim. That impression is bolstered by the fact that the same subsection spells out a requirement that the notice describe the " time , place and circumstances giving rise to the claim. " ( Emphasis added. ) The clear import of the contrasting choice of articles is that , although a plaintiff must provide a defendant with the facts ( i.e. , time , place , and circumstances ) that relate to the specific claim or claims that a plaintiff ultimately asserts , the plaintiff need convey an intent to assert a claim only in general terms . </assert.v.65><assert.v.66>To answer the question of why taller men other pleasant , it is not very gain.

But no pleading can be sustained when the Court ( by its own analysis and ruling ) has before it the existence of a genuine property dispute in which the alleged slanderer is simply asserting its claim to the disputed property.

Seller delivered the equipment and the equipment was accepted. Under Article 2 , Buyer is obliged to pay the price of the equipment which is represented by the note. But Buyer may have a claim against Seller for breach of warranty. If Buyer has a warranty claim , the claim may be asserted against Seller as a counterclaim or as a claim in recoupment to reduce the amount owing on the note. It is not relevant whether Seller is or is not a holder in due course of the note or whether Seller knew or had notice that Buyer had the warranty claim. It is obvious that holder-in-due-course doctrine can not be used to allow Seller to cut off a warranty claim that Buyer has against Seller.

No one questions the power of the District Court to entertain this claim , for Mrs. Kroger at the time was a citizen of Iowa , OPPD was a citizen of Nebraska , and the amount in controversy was greater than $ 10 , 000; jurisdiction therefore existed under 28 U.S.C. 1332 ( a ) .

Respondents ' aggressive pursuit of the state court judgment may have been the reason that O'Connor acted , but still the harm is to the corporation. Even if the fraudulent transfer was a specific effort to avoid Respondent 's judgment , the alter ego claim is determined by the injury directly caused by the fraudulent transfer.

Although Cretacci is distinguishable , the reasoning underlying that decision applies in full force here.5 Like the defendant in Cretacci , Castro effectively chose not to contest the forfeiture by not complying with the statutory and regulatory requirements for asserting his interest in the property. Castro 's failure to submit a claim and give a cost bond within twenty days from the first day of publication of the Notice of Seizure , as required by 19 U.S.C. 1608 and 21 C.F.R. 1316.76 , is dispositive.

The revised law precludes a party who substantially contributes to the making of a forged signature from asserting an unauthorized signature. Under the old code , a bank is generally liable for the total loss if the bank is negligent in most embezzlement cases. Under the revised law , however , if both the drawer and the bank are negligent , the court will apportion the loss between the two according to their respective fault. The comparative negligence language may also provide the drawer with a new cause of action against the drawee bank. The drawer may assert that , while it contributed to the forged endorsements , it should not be hold liable for the total loss . </assert.v.126><assert.v.127>[ 9 ] The United States applied the administrative decision for the Kandik and Nation Rivers in deciding what its position would be on the Black River.

Under the Reagan executive order , a former president could request that the incumbent president assert a claim of executive privilege and thereby stop the release of the records. If the incumbent president decided not to assert executive privilege , however , the records would be released unless the former president could persuade a court to uphold the former presidents assertion of the privilege. The Bush executive order reversed this process and required the incumbent president to sustain the executive privilege claim of the former president unless a person seeking access could persuade a court to reject the claim. In effect , the Bush order gave former presidents virtually unlimited authority to withhold presidential records through assertions of executive privilege. The legislation would restore the Reagan approach , giving the incumbent president the discretion to reject ill-founded assertions of executive privilege by former presidents . </assert.v.131><assert.v.132>On the one hand , feminist therapy advocates that power will be shared between therapists and clients and that egalitarian relationships must be achieved in order to promote healing.

Accordingly , the role of the therapist is to empower the client to develop the capacity to make such informed decisions. Some feminist scholars assert that therapy is not complete for most women until they challenge the basic structure of therapy , which essentially refers to the attribution of false power to the therapist , the hierarchical nature of it , and the fact that if it works the relationship ends . </assert.v.132><assert.v.133>( d ) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading.

It is worthwhile repeating here what was stated earlier , that many scholars who supported this myth have found support for their dogmatic stance in the fact that generally a boundary crossing ( i.e. , gifts , bartering , non-sexual touch , dual relationships ) always precedes sexual exploitation of clients. To confuse such sequential relationships with causal ones is like saying that doctors ' visits cause death because most people see a doctor before they die. To assert that hugging a child , touching a dissociated patient or visiting an elderly client are likely to lead to harm , exploitation or sex is clearly paranoid ( Lazarus &amp;Zur , 2002 ) .

The states were attempting to assert governmental authority over tribal governments. This was particularly true with states in the South. This assertion was opposed by the federal government. In direct response to state assertion of power over tribes , Chief Justice Marshall crafted opinions , usually through consensus building with other justices , that gave rise to the concept of Indian nations retaining their inherent " nations " status , such that all relations with these " nations " were solely within federal power. These cases heralded the introduction of the unique trustee/ward relationship between the tribes and the federal government . </assert.v.148><assert.v.149>Financial investor 3i , to which the Company transferred its gas engines and diesel engines business for decentralised power generation ( DEUTZ Power Systems ) in September 2007 , announced to the Company that it will assert a claim for reduction of the purchase price by way of arbitration action.

But they do not really think this; for they are as ready as any one else to say of any proposed state action that it is right or it is wrong , in which they assert some standard of action higher than the state . </assert.v.186><assert.v.187>( because a sentence appropriateness analysis under Article 66 ( c ) , UCMJ , is highly case specific , the details of a servicemember ' s post-trial situation constitute an important element of a CCA ' s analysis; likewise , a CCA ' s due process review of a claim of unreasonable delay involves a four-factor analysis in which at least two of the factors concern the personal post-trial circumstances of the servicemember - i.e. , reasons for asserting or not asserting the right to timely review , and prejudice; in such cases , the servicemember may well be the best source of information on these factors ) . </assert.v.187><assert.v.188>[ 0101 ] FIG. 9 is a flowchart outlining an exemplary operation for adjusting a timing of an assertion of an EPOW notification signal based on a measured actual holdup capacitance time of a power supply module in accordance with one illustrative embodiment.

We know that if we choose to measure momentum for a photon passing through the slit then its position becomes uncertain and , according to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics , unreal. But we will , for the present , deny this viewpoint and with clenched fists assert the right of our photon to occupy a real position within the slit , irrespective of whether or not we choose to measure it. If a single photon does occupies a real and unique position then it must pass through one discrete area of the slit but not others. To prove the reality of position for our photon - our realist position assertion - we will replace the screen that had a single wide slit with a another screen pierced by two adjacent narrow slits. We will therefore force our photon to choose a particular path through the screen , either through the left slit or the right slit . </assert.v.189><assert.v.190>Sec. 2.

In particular , the Harsco court concluded that the non-reliance clause at issue did not violate Section 29 ( a ) of the Exchange Act because the buyer did not indiscriminately waive the protections afforded by Rule 10b-5 , but instead limited to a reasonable degree the universe of statements ( i.e. , the 14 pages of representations ) in respect of which the buyer could assert a claim under Rule 10b-5. Similarly , in Rissman , the Seventh Circuit affirmed the grant of the seller 's motion for summary judgment , concluding that disregarding a non-reliance clause would allow the buyer to say in effect that it lied when it represented that it was not relying on any of the seller 's extra-contractual representations . </assert.v.191><assert.v.192>No provision has been made for a stay of the magisterial district court proceedings upon notice by the defendant of intention to commence an action in the court of common pleas on a claim against the plaintiff not within magisterial district judge jurisdiction.

In this case , they argue , the evidentiary requirements and administrative dismissal provision of H.B. 292 do not take away any substantive cause of action ( legal claim ) that could be asserted under the prior asbestos statutes , but merely change the way asbestos cases are litigated by giving priority to the claims of those who can reliably demonstrate current disease or medical impairment over those who can not . </assert.v.196><assert.v.197>Regarding the fifth Mhoon factor , i.e. whether an alternative remedy would be better or more effective , defendants assert that ERISA provides an exclusive means for settling the controversy between the parties.

As a practical matter , it appears that plaintiffs ' DJA claims are superfluous because ERISA ( not the DJA ) provides the substantive rights which plaintiffs invoke. See Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins.

These judgements are usually about relationships between concepts or between concepts and reality. Assertions are always either true or false. Oddly , assertions do not have to be asserted; they may also be merely expressed or considered. In believing something one asserts an assertion at least to oneself. The positions we hold on various topics are assertions.

This is true even if the original plaintiff is not a resident of the forum and would not have been subject to jurisdiction if the counterclaim were an original action.

For example , asserting that 53 of all U.S. registered voters will not vote in the upcoming presidential elections is more precise than claiming that U.S. registered voters will tend not to vote in the upcoming presidential elections. However , descriptive generalizations can be precise. For example , " Exactly half of our class is female " is a descriptive generalization even though it descriptive language is very precise. The term " exactly half " is a descriptive term. Similarly , " No one in our course has already taken a class from Michael Donovan " is a descriptive generalization even though it is very precise. The term " No one " is a descriptive term. So , whether a generalization is precise or imprecise does not tell us whether it is a statistical generalization or a Descriptive Generalization. To distinguish between the two look for the " general term " being used. If it is a quantitative figure then the claim is a statistical generalization. If the general term is a descriptive term or phrase then the claim is a descriptive generalization . </assert.v.244><assert.v.245>Since this is a modern process , it tends to be most advanced in those countries most firmly committed to industrialization and national power.

Certainly one reason that many Latin American countries have not developed despite 150 years of independence and a Western heritage is that they have not been countries at all , but collections of independent principalities . </assert.v.245><assert.v.246>A personal property lien is used to assert your claim in property ( other than real estate ) owned by the debtor.

For such a right to be absolute it would have to trump every other consideration whatsoever : other rights , economic efficiency , saving lives , everything. Not all would agree with Gewirth that even this very powerful right overrides every conceivable normative concern.

In their argument on appeal , appellants concede that the trial court 's ruling was correct , but claim error because the court failed to address their status as employees under an employment agreement. The short answer to appellants ' argument is that the trial court did address appellants ' claim with respect to their status as employees. In addition to the issue of standing , the court recognized from the cited authority of Smith v.

They point to two Supreme Court cases decided after Davis , State v. Deem ( 1988 ) and State v. Carter ( 2000 ) in which this Court held that theft was not a lesser included offense of robbery because it was possible to commit robbery while merely attempting to obtain control or possession of the property of another , while the mere attempt to obtain control of property without actually doing so is not sufficient to support a conviction for theft. Because it is thus possible for an offense to constitute robbery without constituting theft , they assert , Smith 's conviction for theft as a lesser included offense of robbery was in error and must be reversed . </assert.v.297><assert.v.298>The trustee ' s third claim for relief seeks damages for the conversion of certain unspecified parts and materials related to the Beaver. Assuming the trustee has standing to assert this tort claim , notwithstanding the rejection of the lease/purchase agreement , he has failed to provide evidence clearly delineating which parts or materials were missing from the Beaver. Additionally , conversion is an intentional tort , which requires a finding that the defendant intentionally interfered with the plaintiff ' s possession of the property. K &amp;K Recycling , Inc. v.

Many therapists seek their clients ' approval or appreciation of their services. Psychotherapy and counseling are not necessarily high paying jobs , and clients ' appreciation and satisfaction has been reported as a significant element for therapists ' sense of job satisfaction. Other ways for clients to assert power is by resisting therapists ' suggestions , interpretations and interventions , not improving , or not acknowledging the help they receive or progress they make. Clients may use reward power by referring friends and family to their therapists , rewarding them with professional and financial rewards. Sex is one way that some clients , using their sex appeal , reward their therapists ( however , needless to say that it is the therapist 's legal and ethical responsibility to hold the line , avoid temptation and never to sexually engage with current or recently terminated clients ) . </assert.v.299><assert.v.300>71.

Defendants ' continued withholding of the records is therefore contrary to law . </assert.v.300><assert.v.301>A person was injured in a Kmart store prior to Kmart s bankruptcy.

A woman could assert a right to control her body such that even if the fetus is a person , it has no legal claim to use it. Could an adult claim a right to being hooked up to someones body ? No it might not be ethical to refuse the use of ones body to save the life of another , but it couldnt be forced by the law . </assert.v.304><assert.v.305>Frequently claimants will assert misrepresentation or omission allegations against design professionals relating to errors or omissions in specifications , or in statements made to the contractors in the course of the bidding process or construction or administration of the contract.

The lawyer must abide by the client ' s decision whether to assert the claim or not under Rules 1.2 and 1.4 of the MRPC. Finally , a lawyer is never permitted to make false statements of fact or of law to the court or to opposing counsel under Rules 3.3 ( a ) ( 1 ) Ftn 6 and 4.1Ftn 7 of the MRPC . </assert.v.306><assert.v.307>Not surprisingly , W/M applaud minor left-wing groups that aren ' t representative at all of Jewish opinion.

Conjunctions ( here meaning any logical connective ) are terms used to join assertions into more complex ones. When 'and ' is used both the joined assertions are themselves being asserted.

The Constitution does not guarantee an accused person against the legitimate consequences of his own wrongful acts. It grants him the privilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him; but if he voluntarily keeps the witnesses away , he can not insist on his privilege. If , therefore , when absent by his procurement , their evidence is supplied in some lawful way , he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated.  . . . </assert.v.309><assert.v.310>The murdering socialist scumbag has been asserting his authority for 11 years.

" Thus , in the same way that domination represents a particular way of exercising powerover , resistance seems to represent a particular way of exercising powerto or empowerment. We can define resistance as the ability of an individual actor to attain an end or series of ends that serve to challenge and/or subvert domination. In order to accommodate the feminist interest in resistance , our conception of power must cover powerto as well . </assert.v.313><assert.v.314>After the Gulf War in 1991 , the U.S. embarked on the " dual containment " of Iran and Iraq , largely because we worried that the weakening of Iraq and the imposition of sanctions on it could give Iran an opportunity to assert its power in the region. Now , with a potential war on Iraq , which at minimum would significantly weaken it and at maximum lead to its disintegration , the ground also is laid for weakening Iran. This , Bush administration officials probably hope , also would alleviate the fears of some allies in the Gulf who have always seen Iran as a threat and worried that a diminished Iraq would increase that threat . </assert.v.314><assert.v.315>NCDOT would have this Court hold that while it is permissible for Batts , a defendant and third-party plaintiff , to assert claims against it under Rule 14 ( c ) , plaintiffs must assert identical claims in a different forum ( the Industrial Commission ) .

That is to say , if a person , for a reason such as the one stated above , is prevented from availing himself of the domestic legal remedies necessary to assert a right which the Convention guarantees , he can not be required to exhaust those remedies.

In a prior action litigated between PIPCO and Bridgestone/Firestone ( " Bridgestone " ) , PIPCO sued Bridgestone for infringement by Bridgestone 's Type-1 bladder. Bridgestone then developed a new Type-2 bladder , and sought a declaratory judgment that its Type-2 bladders did not infringe the '331 patent. PIPCO failed to assert an affirmative counterclaim that the Type-2 bladders infringed the '331 patent. The jury in that action found that both of the Type-1 and Type-2 bladders infringed the '331 patent and awarded damages for PIPCO. The damages award was later determined to be intended for the Type-1 bladder , but not for the Type-2 bladder . </assert.v.319><assert.v.320>Oregon HB 2434 , passed by the House of Representatives on May 4 , 2009 and by the Senate on June 22 , 2009 , is currently awaiting the Governor ' s approval or veto.

The language does not assert nor at all imply , any right , power , or disposition , on the part of the original parties to the agreement , to compel their posterity to live under it.

Broadly speaking , academic writing is argumentative writing , and we believe that to argue well you need to do more than assert your own ideas.

The fact that Buddhism asserts Adibuddha not to be an individual separate being , but something present in each sentient being , is just a matter of theological differences concerning the nature of God.

One type of derivative claim is a right of indemnity. Indemnity is a common-law doctrine that shifts responsibility for a loss from a party who has been compelled to pay a loss to another party who was actually at fault. The right to indemnity may be expressed or implied in law based upon the parties ' relationship. Examples of quasi-contractual relationships that give rise to a duty to indemnify include : lessor and lessee , employer and employee , owner and lessee , and master and servant . </assert.v.365><assert.v.366>2.

Parliament began to assert English independence in various ways , turning over the power of appointing Church officials within England to the king , following up over the next two centuries with a series of moves against Rome 's authority to collect taxes and decide legal matters.

[ 7.3231 ] Plaintiffs A , B , and C join in an action against D. D asserts a compulsory counterclaim against A and B. A cross-claims against B for contribution. B cross-claims against C for indemnity on the claim asserted by A against B. If it meets the transaction or occurrence requirement [ see 7.3240 ] , A 's cross-claim is proper because a counterclaim has been asserted against him. However , B 's cross-claim against C might not be proper because D 's counterclaim was only against A and B , which means that B and C were not co-parties to it. Similarly , A 's cross-claim was only against B , which means that B and C were not co-parties to it . </assert.v.375><assert.v.376>There is , of course , a relationship between the idea of assertability conditions which we get from studying the practice surrounding a certain sentence , and it ' s truth conditions. Normally , ( I don ' t know if there are any exceptions ) the truth conditions of a sentence have to be the kind of things which it ' s assertability conditions are evidence for. So , e.g. one of the ways that we know the truth conditions of ' its raining ' have to do with water falling from the sky is that the circumstances in which we consider it right to assert this sentence are all ones in which we have evidence that water is falling from the sky. So , though I ' m trying to stress here that what I want to understand is the norms governing mathematical assertion , this might shed light on truth conditions also. Though , on the other hand , there are some cases ( like saying ' checkmate ' or ' punch buggy blue ' ) where we have rules about when you can say X but we don ' t have an idea of X having anything like truth conditions , or of what it would take for X to be true or false . </assert.v.376><assert.v.377>Authority comes from inner confidence.

The controller may monitor the EPOW notification assertion in conjunction with the power supply module 's respective voltage input to the controller. The controller may store values corresponding to the elapsed time from when an EPOW notification signal is no longer asserted to when the actual power input to the controller begins to decay and may store this information in non-volatile memory prior to the power supply module losing all power. This may be done for each power supply module such that a plurality of elapsed time values , i.e. holdup capacitance times , may be stored in non-volatile memory. It should be noted that even though the power is decaying while the non-volatile memory is being updated , there is sufficient time to complete the update due to internal power regulation mechanisms maintaining stable voltages . </assert.v.380><assert.v.381>The philosophy which is implied by human rights is culturally marked and belongs to a vast elaboration of analytic thought where all the postulates are significant in the Western history of mentalities. It carries in itself stigmas of the tensions which marked its history. Moreover , this same characteristic is found in the notion of " tolerance. " It is indeed a question of a human interpretation of the relations between men. But the point of view is here reversed. By the idea of tolerance is meant a peculiar attitude ensuing from a position of strength at the level of the rapport between human beings. Human rights convey a reaction in order to assert the right of each human being. Tolerance consists of measuring its action in order not to prevent the other from being who he is. The viewpoints expressed are not identical , but the source is the same. The formulation of the principle of tolerance is linked to the formation of rationalist thought. Other cultures , and Islam in particular , do not formulate the universe of coexistence placed at the level of rational norm only.

" 257 The Federal Circuit rejected this reasoning and found that the cases relied on by IMCO did not allow the extension of the trial court 's jurisdiction to review a debarment decision occurring after the challenged procurement action.258 In Electro-Methods , Inc. v. United States , 259 one of the cases relied on by the trial court in IMCO , the court held that it had jurisdiction over claims stemming from an allegedly unfair suspension , but only over those claims related to contracts that had not yet been awarded.260 </assert.v.383><assert.v.384>Changing the way you behave in the world is a risky business , and the results are not guaranteed. When you assert yourself , it 's quite possible that others will perceive you as aggressive. This is especially likely if you belong to a group that has , traditionally , not been allowed to claim power , if you are a woman , Black , homosexual , working class , disabled or a patient in a hospital. But people who persist in asserting themselves bring about change. The Church of England now has women as priests , and the pressure is still on to allow them further power.

KAA-R predicts the truth of such sentences any time the attributor is in a skeptical context and S is in a nonskeptical one. But if you accept the knowledge norm of assertion , you should not think that sentences like that are ever true. Therefore , KAA-R does not capture the knowledge norm of assertion. A similar problem befalls sentences like S knows that p , but she is not in a strong enough epistemic position to assert that p. KAA-R2 enjoys a clear advantage here . </assert.v.385><assert.v.386>The essential ideas behind the principles of homesteading and squatter 's rights hold generally for any type of item or property of which ownership can be asserted by simple use or possession.

Courts interpreting 17200 allowed any person , whether or not harmed by the complained of conduct , to assert a claim on behalf of the people of the State of California. No requirement that the court certify any class existed. Often claims were brought alleging huge amounts of damage and demanding attorneys ' fees for " benefiting " the public interest.

China is offering economic incentives to both Philippines and Vietnam , by first persuading them to undertake joint exploration in the South China Sea and next through enhancing trade with both countries. The thumb rule is that China wants to have leverage with these countries by allowing them access to their market and link them to Chinese economic growth. The activity of China should also be seen as a check and balance mechanism to see the repercussion with regard to small steps like the claiming sovereignty over the two disputed archipelagos through the establishment of symbolic administrative region called Sansha.

Black hatred is the black man ' s strong aversion to white society. No black man living in white America can escape it But the charge of black racism can not be reconciled with the facts. While it is true that blacks do hate whites , black hatred is not racism. Racism , according to Webster , is ' the assumption that psychocultural traits and capacities are determined by biological race and that races differ decisively from one another , which is usually coupled with a belief in the inherent superiority of a particular race and its rights to dominance over others. ' Where are the examples among blacks in which they sought to assert their right to dominance over others because of a belief in black superiority ? Black Power is an affirmation of the humanity of blacks in spite of white racism. It says that only blacks really know the extent of white oppression , and thus only blacks are prepared to risk all to be free.

As a progressive , I firmly believe that the authority of legislative institutions should be defined such that while the danger of abusing individual rights is always subject to review by the courts , the legislatures ' vital role in furthering the public interest is emphasized and allowed to flourish. Of course , working toward a solution to the dilemma surrounding the legal issue of eminent domain can only scratch the surface of providing a clear vision of a legislative authority that is inoffensive , yet free and predominant.

At least one Illinois case supports that argument. Prime Leasing v. Kendig , 773 N.E.2d 84 , 97 ( Ill.

At the end of a similar dialogue , each interlocutor will most likely maintain his religious beliefs , but he may come to admit that not all ways of life have the same value.

( Emphasis added. ) In this case , plaintiff failed to provide Hoffman with written demand for the payment of her claim.

In doing so , the court noted that Texas conversion law concerns only physical property. One Texas appellate court , however , has concluded that trade secrets may be subject to conversion. See Chandler v. Mastercraft Dental Corp. of Texas , 739 S.W.2d 460 , 469 ( Tex. App. Fort Worth 1987 , writ denied ) . The XPEL court concluded , however , that Texas conversion law does not make a trade secrets exception to its physical property requirement. In reaching this determination , the court examined the elements of a conversion claim. Among other things , a plaintiff asserting conversion must show that the defendant assumed and exercised dominion and control over the property in an unlawful and unauthorized manner to the exclusion of and inconsistent with plaintiff ' s rights. According to the court , dominion and control may only be exercised over physical property. The Fifth Circuit may ultimately have to address how this decision may be reconciled with the Texas appellate decision in Chandler . </assert.v.483><assert.v.484>The Court concludes that Plaintiff does not have standing to assert such a cause of action.3 Private rights of action are limited to the special class of persons Congress sought to benefit.

Thus , not only must Plaintiff prove that the statute prohibits particular conduct , but she must also show that she is one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted. See Texas &amp;Pac. Ry. Co. v. Rigsby , 241 U.S. 33 , 39 , 36 S.Ct. 482 , 60 L.Ed. 874 ( 1916 ); see also Gonzaga University v.

Defendants , who are employees of the Utah County jail and sheriff 's office , moved for dismissal of the federal law claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) on the basis that the claims were time-barred and , alternatively , for summary judgment. Although the district court indicated there were material issues of fact that would preclude summary judgment , it agreed with defendants that the statute of limitations had run on plaintiff 's federal law claims , and it granted their motion to dismiss. It also dismissed plaintiff 's state law claims without prejudice for lack of pendant jurisdiction. Plaintiff appeals.

Its purpose is to permit a person who is not named on the writ to attempt to assert any claim he has to possession of the property. Such a person perfects the claim by giving to the Sheriff or Clerk of court a properly completed form stating generally the nature of his claim , together with a filing fee and , in some circumstances , payment for 15 days of rent. If the rent is paid into court , a hearing is set before a judge within fifteen days to determine whether a claim exists , and if it does not , the money is turned over to the landlord. If the rent is not paid into court , the hearing occurs within five days . </assert.v.487><assert.v.488>What we ' ve seen with assertiveness , is that it is often seen as a single form of behaviour : just say no , stand your ground , be a broken record - all quite difficult if you are truly unassertive , or in our jargon - simply too nice lg ga-b399 bvqa for your own good.

For example , suppose your library acquires information from a database , but in the process also reads information from the computer registry. Because developers using your library do not have access to your source , they have no way of knowing that their code requires RegistryPermission in order to use your code. In this case , if you decide that it is not reasonable or necessary to require that callers of your code have permission to access the registry , you can assert permission for reading the registry. In this situation , it is appropriate for the library to assert the permission so that callers without RegistryPermission can use the library . </assert.v.492><assert.v.493>Nonetheless , Castro contends that the government was aware of his untimely claim at the time it forfeited the currency and that it could not have reasonably believed that he did not intend to assert an interest in the currency. We reject this argument. As stated above , only the timely filing of a claim and cost bond bars the government from administratively forfeiting property. See 19 U.S.C. 1608 , 21 C.F.R. 1316.78. An intent to assert an ownership interest alone does not require a judicial adjudication of the forfeiture. There is no authority for finding that anything less than a legally sufficient claim and bond precludes the government from determining that the property is abandoned as a matter of law and the forfeiture is uncontested.6 Accordingly , absent a legally sufficient claim and cost bond , the DEA was obligated to forfeit administratively the property. 19 U.S.C. 1609 ( a ) , 21 C.F.R. 1316.77 ( a ) ( DEA " shall declare the property forfeited " where no claim and cost bond are filed within twenty days of the first day of publication of the Notice of Seizure ) . </assert.v.493><assert.v.494>The Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial in most civil suits that are heard in federal court. However , before the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial attaches , a lawsuit must satisfy four threshold requirements. First , it must assert a claim that would have triggered the right to a jury trial under the English common law of 1791 , when the Seventh Amendment was ratified. If a lawsuit asserts a claim that is sufficiently analogous to an eighteenth-century English common-law claim , a litigant may still invoke the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial even though the claim was not expressly recognized in 1791 ( Markman v. Westview Instruments , 517 U.S.370 , 116 S. Ct. 1384 , 134 L. Ed. 2d 577 [ 1996 ] ) . Claims brought under a federal statute that confer a right to trial by jury also implicate the Seventh Amendment ( Chauffeurs , Teamsters and Helpers , Local No. 391 v. Terry , 494 U.S. 558 , 110 S.

There is no right to a jury trial in civil actions involving claims that are essentially equitable in nature ( Tull v. United States , 481 U.S. 412 , 107 S. Ct. 1831 , 95 L. Ed. 2d 365 [ 1987 ] ) .

The defendants , on the other hand , attempted to limit the action to only those payments Threshermens had previously made to the employee. The defendants argued that Threshermens was not entitled to assert a claim for pain and suffering : ( 1 ) because it was not obligated to pay pain and suffering as worker 's compensation benefits to the employee; and ( 2 ) because the employee did not file her own independent action. In addition , the defendants argued that Threshermens could not assert a claim for future medical expenses because such a claim would be " too speculative " . </assert.v.504><assert.v.505>H.I.D. ballasts and fluorescent ballasts carry the same warranty as offered by the original manufacturer of these items , but in no event will any warranty claims on these items be honored later than two ( 2 ) years after the Buyer 's receipt of the goods.

Indeed , the Supreme Court of Virginia observed that Va.

It would be counterintuitive to say the least that a contractor will assert a claim that it had been overpaid by the owner prior to its default. Thus , even if the Court of Appeals relies upon Va.

Moreover , it should be noted that taxpayers have not argued that there are exceptional circumstances that have prevented them , in the exercise of due diligence , from recognizing the Koch claim in time to assert it in the administrative proceedings.

While arbitration was intended to be less formal than court , be warned : Firms take their litigation strategy seriously and will likely be represented by lawyers who aim to pummel the broker into submission. The firm 's answer may adopt a tone of righteous indignation at the broker 's audacity for having filed a claim along with hyperbole intended to frighten the broker and impress the arbitrators. In the face of a claim for unpaid compensation , firms often apply the old adage that the best defense is a good offense. Indeed , the firm may make its own claim against the broker alleging some wrongdoing that should void his claim or at least offset any money owed by the firm. Alternatively , a firm might assert that the broker was advanced monies ( a draw ) against commissions not yet earned; that termination of employment has caused acceleration of an outstanding loan; or that the broker breached some confidentiality agreement or other restriction on the solicitation of clients or employees . </assert.v.609><assert.v.610>Likewise , [ as in Holt ] in the instant case , plaintiff is seeking to collect business interruption damages arising out of a business which did not come into existence until 17 days after the wind damage , and after Family Golf , the named insured , to whom defendant had issued its policy had ceased to operate the business covered and had transferred the title , ownership and control of the premises to plaintiff. Therefore , plaintiff can not assert a claim for losses it suffered. Of course , plaintiff may maintain an action for Family Golf 's losses that accrued as of the date of the assignment. However , plaintiff is proceeding on the theory that it is also entitled to those business losses which had yet to occur at the time of the assignment. This plaintiff can not do because it would , in effect amount to an assignment of the entire policy to which defendant did not consent.

By statute , the rejection of a lease results in a breach of the lease , and terminates the bankrupt tenant 's obligation to perform under the lease. Rejection also allows the landlord to assert a claim for damages , and may also terminate the leasehold estate. Regardless of the actual date of rejection , the breach is deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the filing date , and gives rise to an unsecured claim by the landlord for damages. In a chapter 7 or 11 case , the bankrupt tenant or the bankruptcy trustee must generally assume or reject a lease of non-residential real property before the earlier of ( a ) 120 days after the filing date of a Chapter 11 proceeding or ( b ) the date of the entry of an order confirming a plan. The court may extend this 120-day period prior to its expiration for an additional 90 days on motion by the debtor or trustee for cause but may not grant any further extensions without the written consent of the affected lessor . </assert.v.664><assert.v.665>Federal Express was unsuccessful in upholding a lower court decision when the 8th Circuit concluded that perhaps it did control the operations of drivers who were working for carriers who were operating under contracts with Federal Express.

While this may make sense as potential settlement leverage in a bet the company dispute , it is usually counterproductive in a smaller case.

But since no third party could be expected to press a claim that Israel refused to press for itself , the Arab claim , by default , became the only one on the international agenda.

Human persons ( A ) who are suffering and freely choose to be killed for reasons of mercy have the right , relative to other persons ( B ) to be killed mercifully , if and only if others ( B ) have the duty intentionally to kill them for reasons of mercy ( f ) . However , as we have also seen , all human persons have an absolute obligation to forbear killing innocent persons. There can not , consequently , be any moral duty or obligation on the part of others ( B ) intentionally to kill for reasons of mercy ( f ) those ( A ) who assert their right to be killed mercifully.

Yet if the broker waits several months to file his unpaid compensation claim , Firm X will have a harder time at that late date enjoining the broker for diverting business.

Defendant notes , first , that the term " claim " appears to be used throughout the OTCA in its narrow , legal sense , i.e. , to refer to a specific cause of action or theory of recovery. ( 10 ) From that standpoint , defendant argues that the wording of ORS 30.275 ( 6 ) assumes the circumstance in which the plaintiff intends to and does assert a single " claim " or cause of action. In defendant 's view , the provision requires a responsible person to acquire " actual knowledge of the time , place and circumstances giving rise to the claim , " i.e. , the specific theory of tort liability that the claimant intends to assert , and it also requires that a potential plaintiff communicate an intent to bring a claim , i.e. , an action on that specific theory of liability. Defendant contends that the use of the phrase " a claim " merely reflects the fact that the provision is couched in terms of a single claim and " in no way suggests that , when a claimant intends to press multiple claims in the same tort action , a tort claim notice mentioning only a general intent to sue would satisfy ORS 30.275 ( 6 ) .

Since rights assertions suggest conclusive reasons , people can be tempted to assert rights when they want to conclude a discussion instead of continuing it. It may seem appealing , that is , to play a right as a trump card when one has run out of arguments for one 's position. Similarly , the ready availability of rights language may lead parties initially at odds with each other toward confrontation instead of negotiation , as each side escalates an arms-race of rights assertions that can only be resolved by a superior authority like a court. A certain strain of feminist theory has picked up on this line of criticism , identifying the peremptory and rigidifying discourse of rights with the confrontational masculine " voice " ( Gilligan 1993 ) . </assert.v.936><assert.v.937>An introductory , participatory workshop on how to change laws and assert citizen authority and power.

There are even those who argue that God 's purpose may be accomplished in them by their persistence in sin , because that will give God opportunity to display His grace more fully. They accept as true the antinomianism that Paul repudiates as a slander on his teaching. The question is deliberative. It means , Shall I deliberately resolve to persist in sin , calculating that the more I sin the more God 's grace will increase toward me ? Paul shows in his answer that no saint could deliberate the question. Such a calculation is impossible to one who has the spirit of Christ creating within him spiritual instincts and appetites.

However , the current class action plaintiffs attorneys have an ethical obligation to advise their clients of the potential adverse claim that may be asserted against their settlement proceeds by their former attorneys and what they should do if such an adverse claim is asserted.

Similarly , Congress has expressly included anti retaliation provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act , 29 U.S.C. 215 ( a ) ( 3 ) , the Americans With Disabilities Act , 42 U.S.C. 12203 , and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , 42 U.S.C. 2000e 3.

Such God-sentences really refer to one 's father , though the person who asserts them is actually confused about their reference.

It may be that it is impracticable , though not impossible , to separate the two types of claimants. But the existence of federal jurisdiction in this case can not turn on how the defendant corporations keep their records. Defendants are not asserting a defense based on ERISA , but one based on inconvenience and impracticability. Furthermore , the state court is free to consider issues of impracticability ( or impossibility ) in deciding whether to grant the plaintiffs ' motion.

In the case where a participant complains of a denial of benefits , and alternatively asserts that the denial was a " breach of fiduciary duty , " the fiduciary may be in a position to remedy the situation by providing the benefits to the participant or taking other appropriate measures on behalf of the plan. Likewise , in Curry , the claim of fiduciary breach was directed against the company itself , which provided grievance procedures under its collective bargaining agreement. Here , in contrast , the fiduciary breach claim is directed at a plan service provider that is also alleged to be an ERISA fiduciary , and the rationale for requiring exhaustion of any benefits appeals process provided by the Plan simply does not apply . </assert.v.992><assert.v.993>We have reviewed the administrative report provided by your office regarding Ms. [ xxx ] s claim for service credit for her previous employment with a non-appropriated fund instrumentality ( NAFI ) .

Thus , Hoffman was potentially liable to plaintiff solely by virtue of TriMet 's third-party complaint against Hoffman.

From , say , the fact that they are all more or less liquid to assert that there is no essential difference between grain alcohol and beer or tea and lassi is the height of intellectual abdication. It comes from the stance that the person making the assertion considers himself above the entire field of human philosophical-religious thinking.

If the person fails to comply , the CRA may apply to a court for a compliance order requiring him or her to provide the information ( ITA section 231.7 and ETA section 289.1 ) . An RFI or compliance order application is frequently served on the taxpayer being audited or investigated , but it may also be served on third parties , including lawyers and accountants. Documents protected by solicitor-client privilege need not be disclosed. But procedural issues arise on the issuance of a compliance order because a taxpayer -- the only party who can waive privilege -- is not party to the application and thus receives no immediate rights to assert a claim for privilege. In Cornfield ( 2007 FC 436 ) , the Federal Court concluded that a taxpayer need not be served with notice that a compliance order has been issued . </assert.v.996><assert.v.997>All this sounds promising , of course.

An enterprising associate in the law firm representing the plaintiff finds 28 USC 1985 ( 2 ) and declares that we should assert the claim based on this statute it fits perfectly. Theres a problem , however. The statute has run on asserting that claim. However , 15 ( c ) ( 2 ) provides the plaintiff with relief.

The problem with this argument is that it draws causal conclusions from statistical correlations. As most undergraduates are aware , sequential relationships and statistical correlations can not be equated with causal relationships. Therefore , we can not say that boundary crossing causes boundary violations just because a boundary crossing happened to precede a boundary violation. Arnold Lazarus ( 1994 ) called this slippery slope argument , " an extreme form of syllogistic reasoning " ( p. 257 ) . Zur ( 2000a , 2005 , 2007a ) argued that to assert that boundary crossings are likely to lead to harm and sex because they statistically precede them is like saying doctors ' visits cause death because most people see a doctor before they die . </assert.v.1020><assert.v.1021>A.

A common example is that currently , the FCC can fine and punish television and radio stations for broadcasting indecent materials. The trojan horse argument asserts that there is nothing to stop the FCC from later turning its eye from an " neutral " internet and applying these same restrictions online.

If such records contained notations or other information that might be privileged , the court said that although they did not satisfy the definition of non-privileged information , the statute and court procedures provided the necessary protection.

This overwhelming level of support may prove to be critical down the road since it is well above the two-thirds total that would be required to override a possible presidential veto. On March 13 , 2007 , the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) issued a Statement of Administration Policy ( SAP ) threatening a presidential veto should the legislation pass the Congress. The SAP alleges that H.R. 1255 would cause a proliferation of lawsuits from those seeking access to presidential records.

The Bush executive order reversed this process and required the incumbent president to sustain the executive privilege claim of the former president unless a person seeking access could persuade a court to reject the claim.

Prominent guest entertainers like musicians , vocalists , and comedians would likely have had contracts or releases describing the grant of rights to the radio station , although whether those contracts could be located is another matter. If commercial distribution of copies was not envisioned , the station may have acquired rights from guest performers only for broadcast ( and possibly for any incidental or archival copies ) .

Because there is no evidence that the claimants made a proper settlement demand in this case , we hold that Rocor is not entitled to recover under article 21.21. This failure of proof is similarly fatal to Rocor 's common-law negligence claim. Finally , we hold that there is no evidence to support Rocor 's recovery on a misrepresentation theory.

In negligence claims , Oregon courts have adopted a discovery rule , meaning that the claim accrues ( and the clock starts to tick ) when all the facts necessary to assert a claim become known , or should have become known , to the plaintiff.

Midway Mfg. Co. 948 F. Supp. 40 ( N.D.Ill. 1996 ) . Other courts have decided that " even the identities of non-celebrities have commercial value and that all individuals have a publicity right in their identities , and that non-celebrities may therefore assert an appropriation of publicity claim. " Fanelle v. Lojack Corp. Not Reported in F. Supp. 2d , 2000 WL 1801270 ( E.D.Pa. 2000 ) . Online fame reveals a problem with this either/or approach.

Under former Article 3 Buyer could assert rights against Holder only if Holder was not a holder in due course , and Holder 's status depended upon whether Holder had notice of a defense by Buyer. Courts have held that Holder had that notice if Holder had notice of Buyer 's warranty claim. The rationale under former Article 3 was " failure of consideration. " This rationale does not distinguish between cases in which the seller fails to perform and those in which the buyer accepts the performance of seller but makes a claim against the seller because the performance is faulty. The term " failure of consideration " is subject to varying interpretations and is not used in Article 3. The use of the term " claim in recoupment " in Section 3-305 ( a ) ( 3 ) is a more precise statement of the nature of Buyer 's right against Holder. The use of the term does not change the law because the treatment of a defense under subsection ( a ) ( 2 ) and a claim in recoupment under subsection ( a ) ( 3 ) is essentially the same . </assert.v.1239><assert.v.1240>Before we turn to defendants ' motion , there are some preliminary matters that must be addressed.

Although sureties have successfully invoked equitable subrogation to assert pre-termination overpayment claims under federal law , the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected the concept that a surety should be treated as " stepping into the shoes " of a contractor under equitable subrogation principles. The Court did so based upon its observation that a surety claiming equitable subrogation has additional rights that would not be available to its principal. One of these rights , according to the Court , was the surety ' s right to be discharged from its obligations where the obligee had previously made payments to the principal before they were due under the contract. In short , the Supreme Court of Virginia relied upon XL Specialty ' s right to assert an overpayment claim under an equitable subrogation theory under the common law to justify its decision that a surety should not be treated as a contractor for the purposes of asserting an overpayment claim against VDOT under the relevant procurement regulations . </assert.v.1247><assert.v.1248>a.

Taken together , the results show that while men and women use a range of power dimensions , men are more likely than women to use forceful forms of power such as bullying and asserting authority. The majority of couples report making most decisions together , but ( perhaps surprisingly ) when this is not the case women appear to be the ones making final decisions in many areas. Further research might explore how much of this reflects a true reversal in gender power dynamics , and how much is an extension of traditional gender roles whereby women are viewed as caretakers. Finally it appears that power may be more problematic for cohabiting and dating couples than for married ones.

The improvements which he made exceeded $ 2 , 000 in value , and the area which he reduced to cultivation exceeded 100 acres. Being continuous , his occupancy and claim covered the interim between the final rejection of the first indemnity selection and the filing of the second one , but he did not again apply at the local office to make a homestead entry until 1904 , which was after the tract had passed beyond the jurisdiction of the Land Department by the certification under the land grant.

Let us start with the instrumentalist account of legitimacy. The canonical statement of this notion of legitimate authority is provided by Joseph Raz. He calls it the Normal Justification Thesis. It asserts that the normal way to establish that a person has authority over another person involves showing that the alleged subject is likely better to comply with reasons which apply to him ( other than the alleged authoritative directives ) if he accepts the directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and tries to follow them , rather than by trying to follow the reasons which apply to him directly.

To assert a claim under the retaliation or discrimination theory , an employee must establish ( 1 ) that she attempted to assert a right under the FMLA , ( 2 ) that she was adversely affected by an employment decision and ( 3 ) that there was a causal connection between the two actions. Additionally , under this theory , an employee must show that any reason asserted by her employer for the adverse employment decision is pretextual or unworthy of belief . </assert.v.1340><assert.v.1341>The five permanent members of the U.N.

This appeal followed . </assert.v.1343><assert.v.1344>Another implication of learning to be more assertive is that this can lead to greater emotional freedom in general. People who are very non-assertive , passive and inhibited often can not freely express other emotions like tenderness and real affection. Learning to express justified annoyance and anger , and to assert one 's rights in a firm and straightforward manner , makes it easier to relate to people in a friendly and caring way. With reduced anxiety and uncertainty in interpersonal situations , a person can be less defensive and afford to risk greater openness and honesty in emotional expression . </assert.v.1344><assert.v.1345>The appeals court determined that creditor failed to offer convincing justification or explanation for its untimely filing. The court observed that the creditors problem was self inflicted. Although the creditors claim of $ 1.1 million was a small fraction of the $ 3.5 billion in claims asserted against the bankruptcy estate , the court considered that it was not deminimis. If the creditors mistake were accepted , the court reasoned , the efficient administration of the bankruptcy case would be upset. The appeals court upheld the lower courts , and the creditors claim was disallowed . </assert.v.1345><assert.v.1346>In their second issue , appellants complain that the trial court erred by denying their motion to strike Brown ' s post-verdict intervention on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.

In contrast , consequential damages are in addition to the losses caused by the calamitous event . . . and include those additional damages caused by a carrier ' s injurious conduct - in this case , the Insurer ' s failure to timely investigate , adjust , and pay the claim.

So even if the state does help each person act more on the basis of impersonal reasons that apply to them independent of the state , a person may refuse , on the basis of personal reasons , to accept the directives of the state. And so , it is argued , the state 's imposition of duties on the individual may occur only if the individual has consented to the state 's authority ( Simmons 2001 ) . </assert.v.1352><assert.v.1353>According to her results on the Assertiveness Test , Deb is doing very well in this department. She has developed the necessary skills and self-confidence to stand her ground in the everyday situations she encounters.

If you delve beneath the surface of astronomy press releases today , you will be very surprised by what you find. There are numerous anomalies with astronomy today. Nearly every week , another press release comes out where astrophysicists proclaim " surprise " at an observation and then posit a speculation about its cause. Over time , many of these speculations end up in textbooks and are oftentimes presented as facts. Making matters worse , astrophysicists have lost their ability to maintain a humble attitude about interpreting observations. Many astrophysicists refuse to admit that they might be wrong about their interpretation of observations like this one even though the mysteries of the observation disappear when they drop their assumptions that electrical plasmas do not exist in space and even though they understand very little about dark matter and dark energy , which supposedly represents something like 95 of the universe 's mass . </assert.v.1355><assert.v.1356>Now there is a difference if the API is meant for my internal consumption or is part of an external API.

A direct defendant who is sued in tort may be able to assert a claim for contribution against a third party who the plaintiff did not ( or could not ) file suit against , seeking to have a judge or jury apportion liability among the defendant and third party based upon the pro rata fault of each party.4 A claim for contribution can generally only be asserted against a third party if the defendant/third-party plaintiff and the third-party defendant are " subject to liability in tort " for the plaintiffs alleged injuries or damages.5 Consequently , where the plaintiff is seeking to recover solely economic losses , a contribution claim is unavailable.6 </assert.v.1361><assert.v.1362>China has claimed the territory of Arunachal Pradesh since the 1950s.

In the last two years , China has begun to assert its claim to Arunachal Pradesh more stridently. China considers that territory to be part of Tibet , and thus part of China.

Don ' t apologise for your existence or your right to assert yourself. Be courteous but firm in the belief that you are allowed , like anyone else , to determine how you spend your time.

" [ 7 ] This principle has often been asserted by thinkers who are opposed to individualism , and it is the basis for the doctrine of welfare rights.

Scope and Purpose. Subsection ( b ) , like former section 9-206 , generally validates an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor that the account debtor will not assert against an assignee claims and defenses that it may have against the assignor. These agreements are typical in installment sale agreements and leases. However , this section expands former section 9-206 to apply to all account debtors; it is not limited to account debtors that have bought or leased goods. This section applies only to the obligations of an " account debtor " , as defined in section 9-102. Thus , it does not determine the circumstances under which and the extent to which a person who is obligated on a negotiable instrument is disabled from asserting claims and defenses. Rather , article 3 must be consulted. See , e.g. , sections 3-305 and 3-306. Article 3 governs even when the negotiable instrument constitutes part of chattel paper.

Under 1635 ( f ) of the statute , this right of rescission " shall expire " in the usual case three years after the loan closes or upon the sale of the secured property , whichever date is earlier.

It turns out that in this particular case , conspiracy theorists may have a point : The President had chosen not to veto legislation with which he disagreed -- thus giving Congress a chance to override his veto -- but simply to assert his right to ignore the law , whether a domestic issue or a prohibition against torturing prisoners of war. Coupled with his insistence on a " unitary executive " -- the idea that Congress can not , by law , tell an executive branch agency what it may or may not do -- Bush 's signing statements amount to more than an expression of opinion designed to influence the courts; they are a de facto instruction to federal agencies to disregard Congressional mandate . </assert.v.1397><assert.v.1398>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; assert false; This technique must be used with some discretion; if a statement is unreachable ( JLS 14.20 ) , you 'll get a compile time error if you try to assert that it is unreached . </assert.v.1398><assert.v.1399>The trial court properly rejected this argument.

Waiver may be implied from the acts , omissions or conduct of one of the parties to a contract. Silence may also constitute waiver , but only when there is a duty to speak or otherwise take action.

The important imperative that must receive over-riding precedence is that India has yet to assert its regional power in South Asia. Countries in South Asia which are a fractional in size and power attributes as compared to India have been ignoring India  s strategic sensitivities and acting in a manner detrimental to India  s security interests. The main reasons seem to be that they tend to be encouraged by the Pakistani example and further that India has been timid and soft in dealing with the purveyors of proxy war and terrorism against India . </assert.v.1468><assert.v.1469>Thanks BCS for reply.

It would not matter that , in the aggregate , exercise of this right failed to increase the likelihood that reserved rights would be protected. Unlike a standard right however , the scope of an auxiliary privilege would fail to correspond with the scope of any moral right that could be legitimately exercised by all those who assert the privilege. It is simply false that all criminal defendants may justifiably engage in self-defense against punishment. Only those whose rights have been violated by the government may legitimately use silence to defend themselves.99 But because the government can not selectively provide the privilege only to those whose resistance to its laws it believes is legitimate without asserting absolute authority , rights of self-defense are provided to all criminal defendants , regardless of the merits of their resistance . </assert.v.1483><assert.v.1484>In expressly disavowing any claim against Hoffman , plaintiff explained that " Third Party Defendant is not entitled to a trial de novo as to Plaintiff who did not assert a claim against her.

If plaintiff wished to obtain attorney fees from Hoffman , she could have sent Hoffman a demand under ORS 20.080 after she learned of her identity and existence and then , 10 days later , asserted a claim under ORCP 22 C.

The situation is quite different , however , when the plaintiff commences the action after the statute of limitations on the counterclaim already has run. Although there is some authority to the effect that compulsory counterclaims may be maintained in such a situation , it is clear that permissive counterclaims cannot. In some states , special statutes provide that the defendant 's claim for money damages , even though barred when the plaintiff 's suit was filed , may be asserted as an offset to any damages awarded the plaintiff , but affirmative relief is not allowed.

Indeed , learning appropriate assertive behavior is one of the main ways by which social anxiety is now being treated . </assert.v.1522><assert.v.1523>Novell believes it owns the copyrights in UNIX , and has applied for and received copyright registrations pertaining to UNIX consistent with that position.

The well-adjusted person has fixed a clear boundary , a circle around themselves they may move freely in. They know that even if they refuse something , they are within the bounds of their own freedom and not hurting anyone. ( Fensterheim 46-47 ) . For a person who can ' t say no , this circle can be much smaller , more arbitrary and is often defined by others : the boss , co-workers , husbands , wives or friends. Because they feel trapped in the tight circle drawn by their environment and not themselves , they may become neurotic and feel they have little control over their own circumstances. They become resentful. Fensterheim points out that it ' s important to identify our rights , for then we and not the people around us draw the boundaries and define what we want or don ' t want to do . </assert.v.1524><assert.v.1525>Another version of the philosophical anarchist challenge may seem to avoid the critical edge of the above approach. This approach , defended by A. John Simmons ( Simmons 2001 ) and Leslie Green ( Green 1989 ) asserts that each person has a right not to be bound by the state 's commands. This thesis is quite different from the kind of anarchism defended by Wolff. The latter asserts that each individual has a duty to be autonomous. The present theory asserts merely that a person has a right not be subjected to another 's imposition of duties. The philosophical anarchist then argues that only if a person consents to being bound to the political authority can the person actually be bound. The final premise in the philosophical anarchist argument is that it is either practically impossible or at least actually untrue that states can be set up in such a way that they can demand the obedience of all and only those who have consented to their authority. So , the anarchist concludes , no state is legitimate and perhaps no state can ever be legitimate . </assert.v.1525><assert.v.1526>Requiring the President to Make Privilege Claims Personally.

Already before the court was the whole question of the cause of Mr. Kroger 's death. Mrs. Kroger initially contended that OPPD was responsible; OPPD , in turn , contended that Owen 's negligence had been the proximate cause of Mr. Kroger 's death. In spite of the fact that the question of Owen 's negligence was already before the District Court , the majority requires Mrs. Kroger to bring a separate action in state court in order to assert that very claim. Even if the Iowa statute of limitations will still permit such a suit , see ante at 437 U.

A permissive counterclaim is any counterclaim that does not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as does the claim originally asserted by the opposing party. In jurisdictions drawing a distinction between compulsory and permissive counterclaims , parties are required to assert any compulsory counterclaim that they may have against opposing parties; if they fail to do so the claim can not be brought as a separate action [ see 7.1700 ] .

If the incumbent president decided not to assert executive privilege , however , the records would be released unless the former president could persuade a court to uphold the former president 's assertion of the privilege. The Bush executive order reversed this process and required the incumbent president to sustain the executive privilege claim of the former president unless a person seeking access could persuade a court to reject the claim. In effect , the Bush order gave former presidents virtually unlimited authority to withhold presidential records through assertions of executive privilege. The legislation would restore the Reagan approach , giving the incumbent president the discretion to reject ill-founded assertions of executive privilege by former presidents . </assert.v.1585><assert.v.1586>This grievance alleges a violation of Article 16 of the CBA and clears the first hurdle in being preemptively arbitrable unless there is an express provision excluding it from arbitration.

The policy is one of protection of the infant even at the expense of occasional loss to an innocent purchaser. No attempt is made to state when infancy is available as a defense or the conditions under which it may be asserted. In some jurisdictions it is held that an infant can not rescind the transaction or set up the defense unless the holder is restored to the position held before the instrument was taken which , in the case of a holder in due course , is normally impossible.

Dow may assert a claim for conversion against either the depository bank that cashes the check , or the drawee bank that pays the forged endorsement. The law provides that the measure of damages in a conversation action is presumed to be the face value of the instrument. The payee , however , may only sue for conversion against the drawer if the instrument is a draft payable by the drawer , and not a check payable by the payor bank.

The right to private property is fundamental in our legal and constitutional system , but it is also conditional.

Moreover , the nonfederal claim here was asserted by the plaintiff , who voluntarily chose to sue upon a state law claim in federal court , whereas ancillary jurisdiction typically involves claims by a defending party haled into court against his will , or by another person whose rights might be irretrievably lost unless he could assert them in an ongoing action in federal court.

Fractionalization was found , but for the most part the differences were not as striking as were areas of similarity.

Sorsby contends the lower court erred by ruling that she was required , under Rule 13 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure , to assert a cause of action for wrongful death as a counterclaim , and the failure so to do operated as a waiver which barred her claims. Sorsby also argues her claim was not waived because the lower court had previously consolidated the actions for all purposes except trial.

They both allow the victim to request the assistance of the prosecuting attorney to assert the victim ' s rights , and also allow the prosecuting attorney the discretion to assert or not assert the rights of the victim. The bills define victim as any person determined by the court as well as the prosecuting attorney to have suffered direct financial , psychological or physical harm.

When P discovered the loss , P asserted a claim pursuant to subsection ( b ) . X found the check and deposited it in X 's account in Depositary Bank ( DB ) after indorsing the check. DB presented the check for payment before the end of the 90-day period after its date. OB paid the check. Because of the unrestricted blank indorsement by P , X became a holder of the check. DB also became a holder. Since the check was paid before P 's claim became enforceable and payment was made to a person entitled to enforce the check , OB is discharged of all liability with respect to the check.

The demand stated that it was asserting contractual claims stemming from the Customer Agreements on behalf of HMK , as well as claims that Shearson had breached its fiduciary duty to HMK. Detailing the alleged breach of fiduciary duty , the demand charged that Shearson " engaged in conduct intended to strip HMK of its assets and to make unsuitable investments and to improperly invest trust funds of clients of HMK and of HMK. " In particular , it alleged that Shearson knew the trading in the HMK accounts was not suitable for HMK , that Shearson manipulated Kirschner into excessively speculative trading ( thereby making Kirschner its implied agent ) by disregarding account opening rules and verification requirements and by providing Kirschner the use of the office and equipment , and that Shearson controlled Kirschner by " allowing him , through the use of Shearson facilities to trade with highly leveraged funds , " thereby gaining for itself " extraordinarily high " commissions.

( Note : the peasants were under the jurisdiction of the feudal nobles and only indirectly subject to the king. ) Thus , we will see in the first chapter of our text , the effort to assert royal authority through the use of a theory -- the divine-right of kings theory.

They are equivalent to the no-longer-happening ( ' das-pa , past ) of the karmic actions and arise from causes and conditions , namely the perishing of the karmic action , and produce effects. For example , the previously-having-perished one moment ago of a karmic action gives rise to the previously-having-perished two moments ago of that action. The stream of continuity of the previously-having-perished of a karmic action does not degenerate ( nyams ) as it continues; moreover , it has no end.

The motion was denied and Crockett appealed two issues : ( 1 ) whether the uneven sentences were new factors that justified resentencing; and ( 2 ) whether the trial court properly considered Crockett ' s gang affiliation in sentencing.

Put another way , the debt is discharged so long as it is scheduled in time for the creditor to file a proof of claim or the creditor finds out about the bankruptcy case in time to do so. Scheduling the debt enables the bankruptcy court to provide the creditor with notice. Where the creditor , through some other means , finds out about the bankruptcy in time to assert his right to a portion of the proceeds of the estate , there is no reason to except an otherwise dischargeable debt from the effect of the discharge. But where the creditor is not aware of the bankruptcy , he can not assert his right.

At the trial level , the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond ruled that the Commonwealth was immune to such claims and dismissed the surety ' s lawsuit. Although the surety ' s appeal was heard by the Supreme Court of Virginia , the unique procedural posture of the case on appeal precluded the Court from reaching the merits of the sovereign immunity question. Instead , the Court returned the surety ' s appeal to the Court of Appeals , leaving the intermediate appellate court with limited guidance on the substantive question related to the scope of the Commonwealth ' s sovereign immunity.

In addition , there are times it is necessary to inform someone of your intention to sue.

But there is no capability within the HTML itself to unambiguously assert that , say , item number X586172 is an Acme Gizmo with a retail price of 199 , or that it is a consumer product. Rather , HTML can only say that the span of text " X586172 " is something that should be positioned near " Acme Gizmo " and " 199 " , etc. There is no way to say " this is a catalog " or even to establish that " Acme Gizmo " is a kind of title or that " 199 " is a price.

If the warranty claim is more than the unpaid amount of the note , Buyer owes nothing to Holder , but Buyer can not recover the unpaid amount of the warranty claim from Holder. If Buyer had already partially paid the note , Buyer is not entitled to recover the amounts paid. The claim can be used only as an offset to amounts owing on the note.

Thus , for example , a party who fails to assert a compulsory counterclaim in a federal court action definitely will be prevented from asserting that claim affirmatively or by counterclaim in an action in the same or any other federal court. However , the defaulting litigant may be able to assert it in a subsequent state court proceeding. State court decisions have been divided on whether to give effect to the federal compulsory counterclaim rule; several have held that the failure to assert a compulsory counterclaim in a federal court action bars the subsequent assertion of that claim in a state court. To date it has not been definitively determined whether the application of one court 's compulsory counterclaim rule must be given effect by all other courts under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution . </assert.v.2007><assert.v.2008>It is for the same reason that , when I was a boy , caused nine-tenths of the good people in the United States , north as well as south , to regard abolitionists as deniers of the right of property; the same reason that made even John Wesley look on a smuggler as a kind of robber , and on a custom-house seizer of other men 's goods as a defender of law and order. Where violations of the right of property have been long sanctioned by custom and law , it is inevitable that those who really assert the right of property will at first be thought to deny it. For under such circumstances the idea of property becomes confused , and that is thought to be property which is in reality a violation of property . </assert.v.2008><assert.v.2009>This agreement is subject to German law under exclusion of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ( CISG ) .

This is important in cases of fraudulent declarations of loss. For example , if the claimant falsely alleges a loss that in fact did not occur , the bank , subject to section 1-203 , may rely on the declaration of loss. On the other hand , a claim may be asserted only by a person described in subsection ( b ) ( i ) . Thus , the bank is discharged under subsection ( a ) ( 4 ) only if it pays such a person. Although it is highly unlikely , it is possible that more than one person could assert a claim under subsection ( b ) to the amount of a check. Such a case could occur if one of the claimants makes a false declaration of loss. The obligated bank is not required to determine whether a claimant who complies with subsection ( b ) is acting wrongfully.

They contend that under the statute mailing of a notice of deficiency suspends the running of the ordinary limitations period for refund claims for the tax period in question until the Directors determination of the deficiency matter has become final. They observe that a notice of deficiency in this matter was mailed on January 27 , 1998 , within the three-year period allowed under N.J.S.A. 54A : 9-8 ( a ) for them to file a refund claim for the subject tax year. They then point to N.J.S.A. 54A : 9-10 ( e ) , which specifies that the Directors decision becomes final upon expiration of the period for filing a complaint with the Tax Court or , if a complaint is filed , upon completion of judicial proceedings. They conclude that the Directors deficiency determination for 1994 was not yet final at the time of the filing of the complaint in this action , that the limitations period continued to be suspended , and that they may therefore assert a refund claim involving a transaction occurring in the same year for the first time in their Tax Court complaint . </assert.v.2030><assert.v.2031>But of course the trouble with such assertions of identity is the context.

For it is this negligence or omission to assert a right within reasonable time that is construed that plaintiffs had abandoned their right to claim ownership under the deed of sale , or declined to assert it. Thus , when a person slept in his rights for 28 years from the time of the transaction , before filing the action amounts to laches which can not be excused even by ignorance resulting from inexcusable negligence ( Vda. de Lima vs. Tiu , 52 SCRA 516 [ 1970 ] ) . </assert.v.2161><assert.v.2162>The case arises out of a surety bond that PG &amp;E took out with Travelers assuring PG &amp;E ' s obligation to pay workers ' compensation benefits , as required by California law.

PG &amp;E filed for federal bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in 2001 , staying in operation as debtor-in-possession during the proceedings. Travelers appeared in the bankruptcy court to assert a claim against PG &amp;E for payment in the event that PG &amp;E defaulted on its workers ' compensation claims , and to seek assurance in the Plan of Reorganization that its subrogation rights were being rendered unimpaired. Although its first claim was disallowed by the bankruptcy court , Travelers obtained the language it sought in the Plan of Reorganization . </assert.v.2162><assert.v.2163>But families may present a more complex and challenging case.

Introduction This document specifies a simple assertion facility for the Java programming language. In its intended usage , an assertion is a statement containing a boolean expression that the programmer believes to be true at the time the statement is executed. For example , after unmarshalling all of the elements from a data buffer , a programmer might assert that the number of bytes of data remaining in the buffer is zero. The system executes the assertion by evaluating the boolean expression and reporting an error if the expression evaluates to false. By verifying that the boolean expression is indeed true , the system corroborates the programmer 's knowledge of the program and increases confidence that the program is free of bugs. Assertion checking may be disabled for increased performance. Typically , assertion-checking is enabled during program development and testing , and disabled for deployment . </assert.v.2165><assert.v.2166>Although Rule 13 ( g ) , of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure , provides that a party " may " state a cross-claim against a co-party , it does not require him to do so.

Consequently , Leo was free to choose , as he did , to assert his claim against Judith and Leona in a separate action rather than to assert such claim as a cross-claim in John 's action . </assert.v.2166><assert.v.2167> CLAIMS BAR DATE refers to a date set by an order of the Court by which all Proofs of Claim must be filed with the Receiver.

If anything , they are a model of equanimity. SCO began this controversy by suing IBM based , inter alia , on SCO 's claim to own UNIX. In its initial May 28 press release , Novell responded to this controversy by stating its belief that the 1995 Asset Purchase Agreement did not transfer copyrights to SCO , a point that SCO now acknowledges and that this Court has conclusively confirmed. ( Order at 8 ( " It is undisputed that the [ Asset Purchase Agreement ] did not transfer any copyrights. " ) . ) SCO replied by letter on June 6 , claiming that , " Any question of whether the UNIX copyrights were transferred under the [ Asset Purchase Agreement ] was clarified in Amendment No. 2. " ( Am. Compl. 19 ( b ); Lowry Decl. Ex. B. ) SCO demanded an immediate response and suggested that it would sue for securities fraud if Novell continued to assert its rival claim to the UNIX copyrights . </assert.v.2168><assert.v.2169>How does one decide whether and how to proceed with a particular activity in the face of legal uncertainty ? As discussed in section 4.0 , the first step is to consider the existence of possible claims , as was done above with the examples. Another important consideration in assessing risk is whether someone who has a valid legal claim is likely to assert it. Where there is considerable ambiguity about the law , the factors that go into determining whether there is a possible claim can also be relevant to whether someone is likely to assert that claim. Significant uncertainty about whether a claim exists at all , or about who holds the rights , affects the probability that someone will come forward to assert it. Similarly , the scope of library use ( a factor within the library 's control ) can affect both the existence of a claim under state law and the likelihood that someone will bring a claim . </assert.v.2169><assert.v.2170>Alternatively : Moral claims also generally seem to serve a function of regulating behavior. When I accept the claim , " x is right , " this generally has a more-than-accidental correlation with my doing x. If I accept that x is right but fail to do x when given the chance , I am guilty of some kind of inconsistency. Furthermore , when I assert that x is right , I generally want other people to do x as well. Perhaps , then , moral claims are something like a sophisticated kind of imperative. " x is right " is comparable to " Let x be done , " and " x is good " comparable to " Let x be pursued. " Now sentences like " Turn that music down " and " Do n't jump in the water " do not assert propositions. They do not assert that the addressee is going to perform a certain action; they recommend or propose that he perform it. Likewise , perhaps moral claims serve to recommend courses of action rather than to describe them , although perhaps they do so in an unusual way or under special conditions . </assert.v.2170><assert.v.2171>Plaintiff was not barred by sovereign immunity or the Tort Claims Act from directly asserting a claim against third-party defendant DOT for negligently maintaining a city street. The Tort Claims Act constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity , the provisions of the Act were modified by Rule 14 ( c ) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to allow the State to be made a third party , and Rule 14 ( a ) allows a plaintiff to assert claims directly against a third-party defendant if those claims arose from the same transaction as plaintiff 's claim against the original defendant . </assert.v.2171><assert.v.2172>Claimants ' counsel asserts that in any event , there would never be additional parties in this matter , as the State is the only proper defendant in the Court of Claims.

The contribution claimant then attempted to assert the Contribution Act 's protection of joint tortfeasors against payments in excess of their prorated share of liability by tendering only its prorated share of the unpaid damages to the plaintiff. Our supreme court held that any right to contribution had been foreclosed by the initial denial of leave to file the claim : " This serves only to support our holding that by failing to preserve their contribution rights in the original action , defendants have effectively waived those rights.

In that matter the Director was permitted to argue alternative theories of the taxpayers liability for sales tax , and here taxpayers argue that they may similarly assert an alternate theory of defense. In Telepages , however , the court expressly found that the alternative theories here arise from the same set of facts that gave rise to the additional assessment. 9 N.J. Tax at 39. The recent decision in Chemical New Jersey Holdings , Inc. v. Director , Div. of Taxation , ___ N.J. Tax ___ ( App. Div. 2004 ) , similarly allows a corporation which the Director determined had incorrectly claimed the status of an investment company to introduce in the Tax Court the argument that it was actually a financial business corporation. The new argument was regarded as an alternative legal theory addressing the same transactions at issue in the Directors assessment.

What do the states do then ? There are several reasons why the federal government will not heed these resolutions. First , the resolutions take no actual action. They are resolutions , not law. They assert a right of a state to take an action. Until the states act as described by the resolution , nothing will happen. The federal government will not show its hand to something it thinks will happen. Second , the federal government knows that so far this movement has come almost exclusively from the political right , more specifically from the conservative side of the political right. Thus , the federal government can gamble politically that at least half of the states will not join in this movement.

Given that , and assuming that the " Web 2.0 " service mark has been appropriately granted to CMP Media , they certainly have the right to assert their mark against other conferences or live events attempting to use the moniker. Nothing that CMP has done or Tim O'Reilly has said suggests that they are attempting to assert the " Web 2.0 " mark more broadly. That would undoubtedly be a different calculus.

In general , this means that there must be an adversarial relationship between the two litigants. Thus , a counterclaim usually is improper between co-parties ( e.g. , between co-plaintiffs or co-defendants ) . Moreover , if a party sues or is sued in one capacity , that litigant can not counterclaim or be counterclaimed against in another capacity because the required " opposing-party " relationship would not exist . </assert.v.2504><assert.v.2505>One realist hypothesis is that China would not face much of a confrontation in case it asserts its sovereignty and even the US might not interfere as was the case during the Chinese occupation of Paracels in 1974.Of late , China has been conducting a number of naval exercises in the region which showcase its naval might to possible adversaries like Vietnam and Taiwan. The Chinese assertion on ONGC drilling and exploration activities in South China Sea means that China wants that either the other claimant countries should work in tandem with Chinese interests or they leave the exploration to China only. China is sharpening its teeth for resource security especially in terms of energy security. One can say that China is bullying countries like India which have been too complacent on protecting their interests when China gets involved . </assert.v.2505><assert.v.2506> 1 DYKMAN , J. Andre D. Crockett appeals from an order denying his motion for postconviction relief under Wis. Stat. 974.06 ( 1997-98 ) , [ 1 ] or in the alternative , for resentencing or sentence modification under the court ' s inherent authority. Although Crockett provides no sufficient reason for failing to assert the due process claim in one of his previous postconviction motions , he contends that the claim is not waived because the State failed to argue waiver in the trial court. We conclude that the State ' s failure to argue waiver does not prohibit this court from considering it on appeal and that State v. Escalona-Naranjo , 185 Wis. 2d 168 , 517 N.W.2d 157 ( 1994 ) , precludes Crockett ' s claim under 974.06.

The issue of Chinese sovereignty in South China Sea has been disputed by the other claimant countries but the important strategic move made by China is to claim the Exclusive Economic Zone which might be extended to more than 200 nautical miles in future. In that case if China 's sovereignty through de facto occupation is accepted then it would control major energy supply sea lanes to Japan and South Korea.

Your property molecule in the figure above is a right because it contains a power to waive others ' duty not to touch your computer. Similarly a promisee has a right because he has the power to waive the promisor 's duty to keep the promise.

Under 1635 ( f ) of the statute , this right of rescission " shall expire " in the usual case three years after the loan closes or upon the sale of the secured property , whichever date is earlier. The question here is whether a borrower may assert this right to rescind as an affirmative defense in a collection action brought by the lender more than three years after the consummation of the transaction.

Under the Reagan executive order , a former president could request that the incumbent president assert a claim of executive privilege and thereby stop the release of the records. If the incumbent president decided not to assert executive privilege , however , the records would be released unless the former president could persuade a court to uphold the former president 's assertion of the privilege. The Bush executive order reversed this process and required the incumbent president to sustain the executive privilege claim of the former president unless a person seeking access could persuade a court to reject the claim. In effect , the Bush order gave former presidents virtually unlimited authority to withhold presidential records through assertions of executive privilege. The legislation would restore the Reagan approach , giving the incumbent president the discretion to reject ill-founded assertions of executive privilege by former presidents . </assert.v.2600><assert.v.2601> For the first time in our nation ' s history , the Geneva Conventions , other treaties , and US laws prohibiting torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment have been ignored and violated by order of the President and other members of his Administration.

Also , the successful recovery of such cultural property is subject to certain obligations that the claimant governments must undertake concerning their mutual treatment of cultural property claimed by the Russian Federation , as specified in the law and the summary above.

Increasingly , mental resources including precision , acuity , charm , apparent honesty , humor , sincerity , and solemnity are important. Communicating thoughts lucidly and eloquently contributes to the powerful personality. It is also important to convey a supreme certainty in your own beliefs , including the ability to assert the unknown with great conviction.

The Court , however , has never even suggested that an individual must be affiliated with a militia in order to assert a Second Amendment Claim.14 The failure of the Supreme Court to dispose of individual Second Amendment claims for lack of standing speaks volumes as to how the Court views the nature of that right.

The Court held that a generally-worded arbitration provision of a collective bargaining agreement , such as the provision to which Wright was subject , can not bar access to federal courts by employees seeking redress under the civil rights laws. The Court stated that it " will not infer from a general contractual provision that the parties intended to waive a statutorily protected right unless the undertaking is explicitly stated'. " In other words , an employee can not be required to submit his or her discrimination claim to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement where the agreement does not " clearly and unmistakably " require resort to arbitration with respect to such claims. In Wright 's case , the arbitration clause required that " matters under dispute " be arbitrated , which could be interpreted to mean only matters in dispute under the contract. Because the agreement did not contain an anti-discrimination provision , Wright 's discrimination claim arguably did not arise under the collective bargaining agreement , and the Court therefore concluded that the arbitration provision did not constitute a clear waiver of the right to assert that claim in court . </assert.v.2674><assert.v.2675>One issue before Judge Nuffer was whether Utah-based motor carrier C.R.

If Paul had said that the only way to be reckoned righteous before God was to do righteously , that the only way to profit by Christ 's death was to emulate His blamelessness and heroism , and that faith meant fidelity in conduct to the ethics of Jesus Christ , he would never have been accused of preaching a gospel of license.

The Bankruptcy Code requires a tenant to perform all of the obligations after the filing date under any unexpired nonresidential real property lease until such lease is assumed or rejected.

Some courts hold that rejection requires the entry of a court order authorizing the rejection , while others hold that rejection occurs when the tenant 's intent to reject is communicated to the landlord , even if it is not authorized by the bankruptcy court until later. The landlord should pay careful attention to the court order rejecting the lease and attempt to have the order state that rejection is effective on the date that the order is entered and not an earlier date.

The Beaches acknowledged their default but raised affirmative defenses , alleging , inter alia , that the bank 's failure to make disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act gave them the right under 15 U.

The Florida trial court rejected that defense , holding , among other things , that any right to rescind had expired in 1989 under 1635 ( f ) , which provides that the right of rescission " shall expire " three years after the loan closes. The State 's intermediate appellate court affirmed , as did the Florida Supreme Court. That court remarked that 1635 ( f ) 's plain language evidences an unconditional congressional intent to limit the right of rescission to three years and distinguished its prior cases permitting a recoupment defense by ostensibly barred claims as involving statutes of limitation , not statutes extinguishing rights defensively asserted . </assert.v.2813><assert.v.2814>In this particular instance , the article mentions mysteriously strong x-rays.

Because Louisianas direct action statute permits the assertion of claims against liability insurers1 , Louisiana lawyers often represent both the insured and the insurer in litigation. As a result , the conflicts issues that arise in Louisiana insurance defense practice are potentially more vexing than those in jurisdictions that do not permit direct actions. Joint representation of the insured and insurer typically does not present a conflict of interest. After all , both the insured and the insurer have a common interest in resolving the claim quickly and inexpensively. However , the interests of the insured and the insurer conflict when the insurer contends that there is no coverage for the claim asserted against the insured. In such a circumstance , the insurer typically provides a defense to the insured , but does so under a " reservation of rights.

Rather , HTML can only say that the span of text X586172 is something that should be positioned near Acme Gizmo and 199 , etc. There is no way to say this is a catalog or even to establish that Acme Gizmo is a kind of title or that 199 is a price.

The Magistrate Judge recommended that the 42 U.S.C. 1988 claim be dismissed because there were no claims upon which the Plaintiffs were prevailing parties.

This being so , it followed that when a sensation or idea exists , we have to choose between the alternatives that either object alone or consciousness alone or both exist; and I showed that of these alternatives one , namely that the object only exists , is excluded by the fact that what we mean to assert is certainly the existence of a mental fact.

The fact that Parchment 's conduct was addressed at trial in connection with Mission 's claim against DCI is irrelevant . </assert.v.2859><assert.v.2860>To possess standing to sue under Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act , a plaintiff must have " acquired " a security issued pursuant to a misleading registration statement , or received an offer to purchase and actually purchased a security pursuant to a misleading or improper prospectus. Similarly , to state a cause of action under Section 10 ( b ) of the Exchange Act or Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder , plaintiffs must ( among other things ) demonstrate that the defendant made misstatements or omissions of material fact in connection with plaintiff 's purchase or sale of securities.7 In essence , this " purchase " or " sale " requirement mandates that to possess standing to assert a claim pursuant to Section 10 ( b ) , a security-holder must make an affirmative investment decision which is effected by the allegedly misleading disclosures . </assert.v.2860><assert.v.2861>Creating digital copies solely for preservation purposes is extremely unlikely to be actionable under state law , civil or criminal. It is assumed that libraries are not undertaking these activities for their commercial benefit , and it is difficult to envision any commercial harm to the right holders. Preservation copying is also unlikely to be the basis of a claim for infringement based on common law copyright. Although state courts are not required to recognize federal copyright exceptions , the public policy basis for long-term preservation , particularly as the need for digital preservation becomes increasingly apparent in this country and around the world , would surely persuade a court to reject any claim based on preservation activities in the very unlikely event that such a claim was asserted . </assert.v.2861><assert.v.2862>Plaintiff argues that defendants did not timely assert a right to recover attorney fees. According to plaintiff , ORCP 68 C ( 2 ) requires a party to assert a right to recover attorney fees at the first appropriate opportunity. If a party fails to do that , the party can not recover fees. Here , defendants filed an ORCP 21 motion to dismiss the action that did not assert a right to recover fees. They thereafter filed an answer and counterclaims that did assert such a right. Relying on ORCP 68 C ( 2 ) ( b ) , plaintiff contends that the motion to dismiss constituted the first appropriate opportunity for defendants to have asserted a right to recover fees. Because they did not assert such a right in the motion , they can not recover fees. We disagree. Neither ORCP 68 C ( 2 ) nor our cases establish that a party must assert a right to recover attorney fees at the first appropriate opportunity in order to be entitled to recover fees . </assert.v.2862><assert.v.2863>Anna Deavere Smith 's Fires in the Mirror examined Crown Heights , Brooklyn , as a contested urban space in which all voices struggled to assert their identities and have an impact on those in the center ( media , government , and law ) , who , frequently in the name of tradition , tried to keep the margins at a distance. Refusing to be satisfied with a convenient black/white dichotomy , Smith enabled the characters to shed light on the " in-between " aspects of race , class , gender , and ethnicity within identity formation. The group will explore the tension of identity in motion as presented in Smith 's one-woman performance . </assert.v.2863><assert.v.2864>Applicants draw two conclusions from this information. First , they claim that , since the investigation began in 1994 , which was sixteen months before Applicants joined Monitor , " the FBI , SEC and NASD knew we had nothing to do with this manipulation from the beginning , and we were never involved as charged. " We understand Applicants to assert that , since they were not employed by Monitor in 1994 , they could not have been among the original targets of the joint investigation. By Applicants ' own reckoning , however , the investigation was conducted between 1994 and 2000 , which might reasonably encompass conduct that occurred in 1996 or later , the periods charged by the NASD . </assert.v.2864><assert.v.2865>1. ORCP 54 E provides in part that " the party against whom a claim is asserted may , at any time up to 10 days prior to trial , serve upon the party asserting the claim an offer to allow judgment to be given against the party making the offer for the sum , or the property , or to the effect therein specified. " </assert.v.2865><assert.v.2866>The more humanity is oppressed by misfortune , the more we should provide by our clemency for the evils with which it is afflicted. Wherefore , whenever any person of noble rank , or any freeman , or even a slave , is confined in prison or sent into exile , by order of the king; and should afterwards be liberated , or pardoned , and return to his country , and anyone should have claimed any of his property during his absence; the time which he passed in confinement or exile shall not be counted as a part of the thirty or fifty year limitation [ 347 ] barring a claim , or action at law; but the time during which he was imprisoned , or absent from the country , and unable to assert his rights , shall be excepted from the period of limitation aforesaid. In all other cases the laws which have already established periods of limitation relating to claims and actions at law , shall remain in force hereafter . </assert.v.2866><assert.v.2867>Senator Cooper. I do not want to get legalistic , but I think this ought to go in the record. Later on February 19 , 1957 , the Secretary of State , commenting on that aide memoire , said , as I read it , that it only applied to the United States , that it would assert that right for vessels under its own registry , but it had no right to assert it for any other country . </assert.v.2867><assert.v.2868>Setik in support of his position cites the FSM Supreme Court Trial Division case of Etpisom v Perman , 1 FSM Intrm. 405 ( Pon. 1984 ) . He asserts based on Etpisom that his right to procedural due process has been violated and the determination of the Land Commission should be set aside. There are several features of the Etpisom case that distinguish it from the case at hand . </assert.v.2868></assert.v.train>
