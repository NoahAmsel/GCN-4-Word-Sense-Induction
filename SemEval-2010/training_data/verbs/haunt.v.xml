This travel guide to haunts in several U.S. towns should be enough to convince even the hard-nosed skeptics. Believing in the supernatural adds to the enjoyment , but it is not a prerequisite. Pick an area of the country -- be it New England , the Central/Southern states , or the West -- and go exploring. Former inhabitants ( a.k.a. ghosts ) from a variety of eras are popping up in inns , libraries , gardens , theaters , churches , docks , schools , and the like. Each documented sighting includes the witnesses , personalities , and names of ghosts and the best times to visit. Some of the ghosts are friendly , some are not , and some want to go home with you. Some still do n't believe that they have really died. A truly fascinating , memorable romp and unique vacation experience , this book is fun for believers , fantasy for skeptics. - Ann E.

Since that time , the ghosts have become the least interesting part of this house. The house has always been a favorite site for anyone visiting Huntsville because of its historic significance , its beauty , and its haunted history. Many people drive by the house and photograph it. Since 2005 , however , the new owners have spent a considerable amount of time watching out for anyone lingering near the house. If you drive by slowly or stop in front of the house , a woman will emerge screaming at you. Sometimes she 'll curse and sometimes she 'll use the garden hose to spray your car. Other times she 'll shine a spotlight on you and others she 'll take pictures of you with her cell phone. No matter what the new owner does , it is always hostile and she seems to always be watching. She sits day and night waiting for those that linger to long , which might make one wonder if Mary McCormick 's mental illness might not be spreading ? Perhaps the house and its dark secrets have driven the new owner mad ? Perhaps madness is part of the curse of the house ? </haunt.v.825><haunt.v.826>The " too-horrifying-to-complete haunted house that refunds money " tale has been heard as a local legend in Oklahoma , Georgia , Oregon , Illinois , Michigan , Texas , Ohio , Wisconsin , Iowa , Tennessee , and North Carolina.

Every October in communities from coast to coast , such attractions seemingly pop up out of nowhere , complete with gory settings of horrific scenes and populated by a staff of fearsome frightmasters whose only purpose is to elicit screams from those thrill-seekers who 've paid to walk through the " house. " On a larger scale , amusement parks in large cities are routinely turned into fright-themed after-dark attractions ( e.g. , Knott 's Berry Farm , located near Anaheim , California , reinvents itself on October evenings as " Knott 's Scary Farm " ) . </haunt.v.826><haunt.v.827>Ma Barker was a notorious gangster back in the 1920 's &amp;1930's.

On January 16 , 1935 , their spree was over as they were killed in a shootout at their house with the FBI.

He said that you could often hear echoes of voices , sense movement when no one else is there , and items were constantly being moved from place to place. He said that one of the janitors often joked about the phenomenon. The janitor told him of the voices that he heard early in the morning hours.

Given our state ' s vast number of bloody revolutions and natural disasters ( an untimely end being a customary reason to linger ) , as well as our love of fantastic yarns , it ' s little wonder that Texas is rife with paranormal manifestations.

Here 's the list; the Chicagoland haunted houses are linked to their listings pages : </haunt.v.1249><haunt.v.1250>As with any other subject , there are many websites on the Internet devoted to ghostly happenings , and as with any other subject , many of these websites are unreliable. Ghost stories are picked up on one website and cut-and-pasted straight onto another. This duplication results in a story being on many diffferent websites and giving the false impression that it must be true. People will then proclaim that a particular place is one of the most haunted places in Australia , or even the world , although a hundred different sites will give you a hundred different top tens. It all depends who has been 'voting ' or putting the stats together. Even ignoring the fact that there is no hard evidence that ghosts exist in the first place , there are a few big problems with such 'most haunted ' poll claims : </haunt.v.1250><haunt.v.1251>In 2003 after our first season was over in Gainesville for our haunted house , the best actors sat around and discussed what was good , what was bad , and what we wanted to do different in 2004.

Interestingly , Haunted Overload is only open for 6 nights out of the month of October. I can only assume this is due to the sheer amount of hard work that goes into preparing the attraction for the public. Another positive side effect of this schedule is that it ensures that the staff and actors are enthusiastic and not worn out from a whole month 's worth of performances . </haunt.v.1252><haunt.v.1253>Charleston , South Carolina , may just have some of the nations most haunting ghosts.

Muahahahaha !; ) </haunt.v.1255><haunt.v.1256>These artificial elements set the stage for the actors who often achieve the most intense scare reactions. Where animatronics could short-circuit , live actors have long been the backbone of haunted houses. A prop like a fake bat flying overhead may be used to distract customers into looking up and when they turn their focus back to the maze , an actor has popped out in front of them. Actors can also invade personal space in a far creepier way than machines. The primary rule of haunted house acting is never to come in contact with customers but actors still get pretty close. According to Ricky Dick of Castle Blood , the hardest thing for a new actor to grasp is the need for speed. Once he or she jumps out and startles , it 's necessary to scramble back into the shadows to avoid diminishing the scare factor. As frightening as an actor 's costume may be , the longer he or she stands near a guest , the longer that guest has to realize that the zombie or monster is just a harmless actor . </haunt.v.1256><haunt.v.1257>Before entering the maze , Jeff Schiefelbein , the producer of the attraction had a short conversation with Theme Park Adventure about his maze.

The Queen Mary does not officially make any of these claims , but if the stories and history behind this magnificent hotel/museum are true , it would have to be one of the most haunted places in the world.

Merely being inside a dark cemetery or old building at night is enough to scare some people , and visitors to such places will generally end up scaring themselves as their own imaginations work overtime recalling camp-fire stories and movie scenes. It is easy to imagine specters lurking in the dark corners , especially if you are told they are there - and people are told that they are there. Any paranormal tour business is entirely dependant on the place of business being publicly perceived as a haunted site. If people did not think that the place was actually haunted , then the business would struggle . </haunt.v.1453><haunt.v.1454>We reluctantly left Lincoln and continued on to York , ghost capital of England , where we stayed at Hedley House Hotel.

That night we went out on a haunted pub-crawl and saw some of the local curiosities , including men without noses and some dwarfs. Somehow the weird locals were attracted to us. We stayed until the bars were closing. Of course , we had to sample the local spirits , so to speak. We looked for phantom monks , but once again they managed to elude us . </haunt.v.1454><haunt.v.1455>TheoFantastique : One more question , KathE.

Another is the haunted house Frightmare and its website www.denverhauntedhouses.com. These sites each list information for a single haunted attraction , and they are usually owned and maintained by the haunt owners themselves . </haunt.v.1466><haunt.v.1467>Actor Clifton Webb is said to haunt the mausoleum he is buried in , The Sanctuary of Peace.

One of the old hangars at the Airport itself is also haunted , presumably by a man who was killed while starting his plane though it 's a condemned hangar used for long term storage only.

The man caught the hanging lamp outside , but fell to his death from a third story window. To this day , that hanging lamp will constantly swing even when the weather is not windy. Also , some nights , mysterious walking and piano playing can be heard when no one is at the piano. The third floor of " MaWa " Hall is also haunted ! It is said that a young woman who lived there was stood up for the fall formal dance. She hanged herself from the middle shower stall in the community bathroom. Sometimes that showerhead will squirt water out of control from the hardware connected to the wall. And also the sound of high heels has been heard going up and down the hall late in the evening hours . </haunt.v.1470><haunt.v.1471>A final and often overlooked explanation is simple fraud. Poorly-conducted investigations and shoddy reporting can produce misleading reports , but deliberate exaggeration or outright fraud has always been a factor in some places developing a haunted reputation. One of the great examples of this practice was the famous British ' ghost hunter ' Harry Price , whose investigations into the supposedly haunted Borley Rectory in the 1930s were later discredited. Price himself was exposed as cynical confidence trickster and salesman who made a living by posing as an expert in psychic matters. Unfortunately , the vagaries of the paranormal still make it a fertile ground for frauds and fakes to make an easy living off the gullible . </haunt.v.1471><haunt.v.1472>Jeans and sneakers will do.

While guests of the Inn may enjoy modern amenities such as an outdoor Olympic sized pool and fitness center , the catacombs that run underneath the building heading in the direction of Mt. Rubidoux are now closed. As one current employee of the Inn remembers , an older gentleman was once given a room in one of the upper stories of the building , as there were no lower floor rooms available due to construction. The next morning , when the gentleman was asked if his accommodations were adequate , he replied , " All was fine , especially the woman singing beautifully in the next room. " He was the only tenant on that floor. This place is haunted by the Millers. The Mission Inn Hotel was originally a 12 room cottage where the pool now sits. The existing structure of the hotel was begun in 1900 and completed in approximately 1947. Owned first by C.C. Miller and sold to his son , Frank , in 1900.

Todays haunted place is from Chicago. There 's something about a great cemetery that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Oddly enough I would'nt expect a ghost to want to haunt a cemetery , yet I seem to find quite a few ghost stories that take place in cemeteries. I just do n't see the point of someone coming back and haunting a place that they really have no emotional ties to. In most cases I do n't expect that the ghost had spent a lot of time in that cemetery before it had passed on. So that brings the question of why ghosts hang out in cemeteries ? I expect that most cemetery hauntings are a case of over active imaginations.

It is the world of self and all the hopes and fears that come with trying to secure it. Our efforts to secure the self give rise to all the negative emotions. If we were not so concerned with cherishing and providing for the self , there would be no reason for attachment. Aggression , too , would have no reason to arise if there were no self to protect. And jealousy , which shows up whenever we think the self is lacking something , would have no impetus to eat away at our inner peace because we would be content with the natural richness and confidence of our own mind. If we had no need to shield all of the embarrassing things about the self that make us so insecure , we would have no cause for arrogance. Finally , if we were not so fixated on the self , we could rely on our innate intelligence rather than let our stupidity escort us through the activities that bring us so much pain time and time again . </haunt.v.1916><haunt.v.1917>'Our 'g-host ' Drew Sinton was the ultimate haunted tour guide.

Kolek , the founder of the New England Ghost Project , offers scientific explanations and observations regarding the realm of the unknown while Wood flexes her ability to channel the deceased , who appear in the form of ghosts and poltergeists. The duo turn up their fair share of spooky phenomena , including phantom infant cries , vanishing knickknacks and ghostly apparitions. More intense encounters include an apparent exorcism in which a woman and her dog are tortured by a poltergeist. Though the pair do a commendable job balancing the spooky goings-on with rational explanations and a healthy measure of doubt , it ' s difficult to believe this will convince a skeptic. Still , the partners maintain a breezy excitement throughout , and the episodic nature of each chapter makes for great serial before-bed reading . </haunt.v.1919><haunt.v.1920>i have to say that over all i dug this movie quite a bit. i like haunted house movies in general , and really love black and white thrillers more so than the current ones. i will say that this is n't as much a haunted house movie as it is a mystery. at the end , when the guy says that , " now there are nine , there coming for me , then they 'll come for you.

The haunted hayride has sets that are so incredibly impressive that it is reminiscent of another attraction- the backstage lot tour at MGM Studios in Disneyworld.

Melissa has no recollection of his murder and is terrified that he will avenge himself by taking her life. When she meets the " real " Paul at a dance , she begins to understand that his death will occur in the future , and she and the ghost Paul unsuccessfully try to change the future. Readers will identify with Melissa , who is caring and compassionate , while Paul is a typical tough guy. Still , his is a well-drawn characterization. In other titles in this series , Fear Street is described as a menacing place; the appropriate details help create and sustain that mood. That description is glossed over in this book , diminishing the suspense.

The reason for this irrational belief is that although she had been seen in the theatre on a few occasions over the years , she gained notoriety in 1969 when the play 'The Hanging Tree ' by Joan Morgan was being staged. The play is based on the story of Mary Blandy who was found guilty of poisoning her father when he refused to give her permission to marry. Admittedly the figure of the young phantom appears in clothing of the period but to seriously suggest that she , the ghost , has now moved her haunt yet again - she genuinely visits her old home and is also claimed to haunt Henley Town Hall - is difficult to accept. The ghost was seen once or twice in 1969 by members of the cast during rehearsals at the back of the stalls and lights over a mirror in a dressing room have often been mysteriously moved.

For example , a murder occuring in the house causes it to be haunted by the murder victim. Or someone who committed suicide can not move on to the other plane. Or perhaps a woman waiting for her husband to come home from a war , waiting at a window every day for years , casues people in the present to still see her. Whether these are the actual souls of the deceased or just the energy captured and played back by the earth remains to be seen. But most hauntings seem to be accompanied by some sort of highly emotional event . </haunt.v.2778><haunt.v.2779>Bedlam manor was a non-commercial seasonal haunted house located in the Santa Clarita Valley.

Roll are among those who have elaborated upon Sidgwick 's theory. Price 's theory , called " deferred telepathy , " posits that there exists a " psychic ether " that is a bridge between mind and matter and impregnates all matter and space. Certain thoughts and events are impressed upon this ether and remain on it for long periods , even years. When tragedies occur , the appropriate psychic conditions are created and lasting impressions result. Sensitive persons coming into contact with a haunted house might telepathically contact these thoughts and emotions which are then " replayed " as hauntings. " Deferred telepathy " has been criticized by others for not explaining movements of objects that are sometimes reported in hauntings . </haunt.v.2783><haunt.v.2784>The Age of Insects.

I do have a couple of negative things to say however. I am in a wheelchair. I do believe that they really over sell this event. It was overly crowded which made maneuvering for an ambulatory person difficult , never mind someone operating a wheelchair. Also , I realize that strobe lights and fog machines Add to the atmosphere but it 's really makes moving down the sidewalks and streets quite dangerous for someone in a wheelchair. I almost went off the sidewalks three times. Despite all that I did n't have a good time. I 'm glad they are moving to islands of adventure this year.

Atencio had first intended for the attraction to be narrated by a recurring cat or a raven character , but as a ride-through exhibit , the time necessary to allow each rider to hear the character recite its spiel was n't possible. Rather , the narration would have to travel with the riders , in order to allow each patron to have roughly the same experience. Hence , the Ghost Host was designed as an invisible , disembodied spirit that would follow you through the halls of the Haunted Mansion. This contrivance worked well for the attraction , as it was essentially to be a series of scenes and occurrences without an inherent storyline , as is the case with many haunted attractions. The narration offered a slice of deft humor that helped keep the scenes light and mysterious , rather than dark and ominous. This is the hallmark of the Haunted Mansion : wonderful , creepy , magical effects , delivered with a light touch . </haunt.v.3237><haunt.v.3238>The Waukesha Expo Center becomes haunted every year when Morgan Manor takes over.

When something haunts you , it resides with you; it seizes your consciousness. You turn it over and over again. You revisit it at unexpected hours in unexpected ways , in your first waking moments , at a dinner party , in quiet moments alone , when your thoughts wander , or when your lover 's look brings to mind some enduring gulf between you Being haunted is a way of being engaged , perhaps very deeply engaged , but not necessarily in a happiness making way. Losing presidential candidates , I am told , are typically haunted by memory and by doubt , for the rest of their lives. We are all from time to time haunted by thoughts of what might have been , by memories of great loves lost or of opportunities not seized. That which haunts may be inexhaustible in a way. It 's the sort of thing that drives one to the therapist 's couch for years without end. Though being haunted by a thing has a similar structure to loving a thing , that which haunts does the very opposite of offering a promise of happiness . </haunt.v.3276><haunt.v.3277>I contacted some friends who have been to both Fright Fest Frontier City and the Bricktown Haunted House &amp;3-D Ride.

The figure was wearing a fawn-coloured dress with what looked like a white blouse and small cap.

This instinctual knowledge comes from an innate intelligence that sees the dynamic , ungraspable nature of all things. It observes things arise and fall away , both happiness and suffering and the changes of birth , old age , sickness , and death. When we cling to self and other , our mind feels deeply conflicted and fearful because clinging is at odds with our inner intelligence. Of course , we are not clinging because we want to suffer; we are clinging because we want to avoid suffering. But clinging by its nature causes pain. When we let go of grasping and turn toward our innate intelligence , we begin to experience a sense of ease in our minds and we begin to develop a new relationship with that which ordinarily haunts us . </haunt.v.3632><haunt.v.3633>Haunted Colorado - The haunted Colorado megasite ! *Everything* about ghosts and hauntings in Colorado : Haunted locations , ghost tours and haunted events , murder mysteries , cemetery tours , much , much more !

It was originally built on 2 , 000 acres but now resides on the surviving 60 acres. It is open to the public and is currently owned by the Federal government as its beauty and architectural stature is unmatched. The home is haunted by Priscilla Ridgely , who was the wife of Charles Carnan Ridgely ( the original owner and governor of Maryland ) . The home was completed in 1790 and Priscilla walked it gilded halls. She suffered from an agonizing mental depression and took little care of their 11 children. She spent the majority of her life along , holed up in her bedroom. She never took visitors and did n't entertain guests and she died a very unhappy woman. She has been seen in most of the rooms in the house. It seems in death she has found the will to walk around the mansion 's halls once again. Many employees , guests and previous Ridgely family members have witnessed Priscilla manifesting physically before their eyes . </haunt.v.3782><haunt.v.3783>All aboard the London RouteMaster Bus for a trip around the darkerside of Portsmouth.

All traces of the bar have since vanished and all that remains behind is the supposedly unfinished mural of the city of Alton that has been painted on one wall.

The attraction is actually the same place where the true story occurred. So , not only is it renovated and made haunted with actors and effects , but it also has a creepy factor from the murders actually having taken place there. The Dent Schoolhouse capitalizes on the setting by working with it to create the school theme. Each section is a part of the school building with effects and monsters . </haunt.v.4130><haunt.v.4131>Crestview - Cobb Cemetery - On a normal basis , this cemetery is haunted by a ghost that walks among the grave at about 1 : 24 A.M.

For that matter , with the number of pubs that claim his living self as a regular , it ' s a miracle he was ever able to remain upright in the saddle. Turpin ' s grandfather , Mr Mott , once kept the Rose and Crown and local tradition maintains that the highwayman would often hide at the pub to evade capture. His ghost is said to haunt not only the pub , but also the road outside , where astride a jet black mount he gallops hell for leather through the night , no doubt en route to one of the many other pubs he must haunt before daybreak </haunt.v.4133><haunt.v.4134>Ideas about haunted houses often originate in movies such as The Amityville Horror , a fictional movie based on a true fraud. While it is quite common for a Catholic priest to bless a house or perform what is called a " routine exorcism , " it is not common to perform what is called a " real exorcism " on houses , despite what was depicted in the movie. In the case of Amityville , the real devils were George and Kathy Lutz , who concocted a preposterous story to help them out of a mortgage they could n't afford and a marriage on the rocks ( Schick &amp;Vaughn 1998 : 269-270 ) . Their case was helped along by the media ( New York television station Channel 5 ) , self-proclaimed demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren , and Gene Campbell , who produced an infra red time-lapse photograph of a boy ( ? ) with no eyes at the foot of a staircase. The photo was first shown on the Merv Griffin show , few years after it was allegedly taken at the Amityville house , to promote the first film of the alleged horror.* </haunt.v.4134><haunt.v.4135>As Burke gets deeper into this series , the serious themes are growing. Burning Angel is as haunted by history as the most Gothic Faulkner novel. Semi-literate Sonny Boy knows about Lafitte 's barracoon , and the excavation of those slave quarters is as important to the conclusion as race relations during the Second World War and the Iran-Contra years. This is country where your family tree grows for centuries in the same soil , and Burke has the gift for making history the bones and organs of a swiftly contemporary body of work . </haunt.v.4135><haunt.v.4136>It all depends on your criteria for deciding whether somewhere is 'haunted'. This might seem an esoteric point but it is vitally important. Many researchers are comparing haunted and not-haunted locations to identify environmental differences that may be related to the haunting phenomenon.

For the first time ever , she not only spoke at the meeting , but addressed a long-standing problem that had bothered her. In short , the post traumatic stress emotion that was locked into her nervous system , causing the symptom , generalized fear when talking to a group of people , was no longer there. She was able to address the conflict that she was actually facing , instead of being haunted by reactions to events that had long passed but still lived in here mind.

There he rested peacefully until the Civil War , when Yankee marauders searching for family valuables broke into his crypt and removed his body. After that , Baynard 's spirit never rested again. He is still seen leading a ghostly funeral procession from Braddock Point Plantation down the old road , past the ruins of Baynard Plantation , to his empty masauleum. His black-draped carriage stops at each plantation along the way.

Bringing up the rear of the procession is a line of loyal servants dressed in red velvet and silver trim. The ghost of William Baynard 's misstress haunts the Eliza tree , from which she was hanged for poisoning Baynard 's wife.

Most haunted attractions use a combination of both. Well-planned attractions play on multiple senses to build customers ' internal feelings of danger. Plunging into total darkness or being blinded by strobe lights can quickly disorient and spark fear. Often , an eerie soundtrack will play in the background as well. Ear-ringing blasts from air horns then give customers sudden jolts. Custom scent pellets release noxious odors , such as vomit , into the fog or air released from air hoses. Depending on the design of the maze , guests may also be forced to feel their way through darkened corridors or push aside heavy curtains or obstacles . </haunt.v.4185><haunt.v.4186>With 20 years of experience Mike is a respected designer and leader within the haunt industry , Mike has written several instructional articles published in Haunted Attraction and HauntWorld magazines and has taught classes at the Transworld National Halloween Show , HauntCon , Midwest Haunters and the Eastern Haunters Conventions.

A group of about ten of us were taken round and each one of us kept to ourselves , listening to the guides commentary , admiring the history and furnishings that surrounded us , but maintaining that dignified detachment from our fellow visitors that seems to pervade every historic house tour I ' ve ever taken ! But when we got to the haunted Queen Mary ' s Bedroom , something changed. The guide had just finished telling us about the room ' s resident ghost when an elderly gentleman , who seemed to me to have the bearing and tone of a magistrate , proceeded to regale us with the tale of how he had once seen a ghost. Suddenly everyone began swapping ghost stories and for the rest of the tour we were all chatting amicably about our surroundings , suggesting other haunted places that were worth a visit and genuinely enjoying each others company. And all because one of our group had felt compelled to tell us about the day he had visited a haunted house . </haunt.v.4199><haunt.v.4200>Set in the 1948 jail , scary in of its self , our visitors will walk through different zones where they will encounter our ghoulish ' prisoners ' .

Bozzano came to five conclusions in support of his belief that hauntings were spirits of the dead : phantoms of the dead can haunt sites where they did not die and had not lived; hauntings consist of telekinetic movement of objects that suggests some type of physical presence; hauntings are associated with deaths to a greater extent than other types of tragedies or emotions; hauntings are intermittent; and when such actions as exorcism and prayers for the dead are preformed , the said actual hauntings stop , recede or actually end . </haunt.v.4230><haunt.v.4231>Taking the place of SAW , but retaining the same type of theme this time around was Fear. Guests had to work their way through various " traps " and other nasty situations in order to gain passage and ultimately , their freedom from this Hell hole. Such gags included grabbing " live wires " to complete a circuit , pulling on ropes to open an exit door ( the wrong ropes caused spikes to shoot out of the walls at your group ) and an awesome hammer seat room where four people had to sit back-to-back with giant mallets suspended above them; the group had to all sit down , facing their own hammers , and push down on foot pedals at the same time. This turned the lights out in the room and released the hammers.

It is about a frustrated writer who is full of excuses for why he never gets anything written and just as full of anger about it too. His anger is the real problem. He has no control over it and it is alienating him from his wife and holding back his career. And if his career prospects are now so poor and his marriage is failing , well all of that just makes him angrier still and all of that negative energy his is producing might just come back to haunt him . </haunt.v.4234><haunt.v.4235>North of Abilene , there 's a small town named Stamford. Near that community , there 's a brushy , overgrown park on FM 1226 about five miles south of the town , which is known as Buie Park. The old park harbors two well-known ghosts of the area : the legendary spirits of the Hatchet Lady and May 's Mother. Whether they haunt the wooded park area simultaneously , or whether they take turns , I 'm not certain. But according to an article by Kathy Sanders that ran in the Abilene Reporter News on October 30 , 1985 , they are well known around Stamford . </haunt.v.4235><haunt.v.4236>Mixed with a little poltergeist activity during which time pint pots of beer have , of their own accord tipped over customers , a door handle moved and the landlord , Bert Matthews , and his wife have felt as if someone pushed them , has been the witnessing of a ghost.

These spirits may mindlessly repeat their last action such as tripping down stairs. There are reports of a number of haunted staircases in the city , often where a uneven step is accompanied by a psychic chill. This coldness pervades rooms and parts of rooms all over the historic district. The liquor room in an old cotton warehouse that now houses a seafood restaurant on River Street was both cool and depressing. Even the owner did not like to go there alone. The employees refused. Mrs. DeBolt 's psychic friend said he felt the presence of a slave dying of pneumonia or some other illness , left alone under a thin blanket . </haunt.v.4238><haunt.v.4239>Mount Carmel Hospital East - The pharmacy of this hospital is haunted by a man with light reddish hair , wearing a lab coat , looking down at piece of paper he is carrying.

We are happy family he said , my wife , children and myself , and a lady in white. The lady he referred to was the ghost seen by his daughter , Christine , sitting on a beer barrel in a corner of the bar lounge. The fact that several customers have also witnessed the lady strengthened the claim. She is seen to be wearing a demure Victorian gown , rather out of place perhaps under the circumstances , but nevertheless her appearance is fitting for , according to the local belief , she is the wife of a vicar who was keen on nipping out for a pint between sermons. But the vicar and his wife in this case must be rather eccentric characters for in the strict moral environment of Victorian prudery , a lady to be seen in a bar was really beyond the pale and to be accompanied by a clergyman must have caused a lot of embarrassment. Why the lady haunts the place is a mystery but as she did in life so in death one assumes , though what happened to the vicar , one wonders ? </haunt.v.4248><haunt.v.4249>What some people do n't know is that not only is it a commercial haunted attraction , it also has a real haunted history.

Unexplainable things have been happening in this building since the mid 1920's. Strange sounds , mysterious apparitions and other unexplainable phenomena have been observed and documented by the owner Jim Warfield. Perhaps the best-known apparition is the " Lady in White " , who has been seen by many people over the years. She most often appears in the wine cellar , the most haunted room of the Raven 's Grin Inn . </haunt.v.4249><haunt.v.4250>MOUNT KATAHDIN - The Abenaki Indians call this the Greatest Mountain , and believe it to be haunted by a spirit name Pomola.

What makes a haunt too scary for some people and not scary enough for others ? We are always being asked if the haunted house is scary. My standard reply is " It really depends on what scares you.

See gallery images of the Master Gracey tombstone , the Good Old Fred tombstone , and the super-cool animatronic Sweet Leota monument ( every few minutes , its face pushes forward , its eyes open , and it looks around , before going back to " sleep " ) . See also the tombstones that Jamie Lopez has done for his yard. Have a shape cut from plywood or MDF; paint it with primer. Get a good effect by lightly sponge-painting watered-down shades of gray and pale green acrylic paint onto a grayish ground. Work slowly , in layers , blending the colors as much as you can and letting each layer dry before you go on to the next. Let some areas be slightly more greenish than others. Paint your epitaph on in dark gray or black ( you may need to draw guidelines in pencil or chalk first , which you should erase after the epitaph is dry ) , and lightly sponge a bit more gray and green over it. If you plan to leave the tombstones outside , you will need to coat them with several layers of matte polyurethane sealant . </haunt.v.4406><haunt.v.4407>Alcoa - The Old Stone House - It is said haunted by an old man who built on the house for over 45yrs.

In 1985 a well-known parapsychologist Mrs. Lucille Warren paid a visit to the library to see if she could find out more about the Gray Lady. She saw her in the children 's library and identified her clothes and hair style as of the early 19th century. Mrs. Warren sensed and saw that the Gray lady was n't haunting the library at all , but the field on which the library was built. She saw the entity staring into a pool of water. From this information Mrs. Warren had the feeling that the Gray Lady had drowned in the water canal , that is still located near the library , a possible suicide. She also felt that the Gray Lady did n't quite understand that a building was built around the spot she was haunting and that 's why she seems to be confused . </haunt.v.4411><haunt.v.4412>Olney-Salvation Army-The building is reportedly haunted by a small boy who died when he fell out of his mothers shopping cart.

Also , consider that a holiday booking may make it harder for you to secure a room , and your stay more expensive.

Thinking that she was a member of a group participating in some sort of festival or pageant they smiled and greeted her. However , the woman gave no response. The young man , puzzled by the fact there was no sound of her walking turned round and saw the figure approaching a large terra-cotta tomb. His companion glanced back and both watched as the woman simple faded away as she reached the stonework. There was nothing frightening about the incident at all , just mysterious.

The Disneyland version is located in New Orleans Square. Tokyo Disneyland placed the Mansion in Fantasyland. The version at Disneyland Paris is in Frontierland and is named The Phantom Manor and features different music ( although it still contains the Grim Grinning Ghosts theme ) , an Old West theme , and a more cohesive storyline than the other three Mansions ( an opening narration by Vincent Price was recorded but not used , and is available on the Haunted Mansion soundtrack ) .

Fear is one of the strongest emotions a human being can experience. There are two basic types of fear good Denver haunted houses can generate; first , the boo scare. This is the cheapest but most sought after fright. In the human psyche , there are no lingering effects from this threat. It is accomplished by simply introducing a shocking element by surprise. While causing a scream and a jump in blood pressure , the effects wear off quickly when the person realizes there is no real threat. Chainsaws are typically the favorite for invoking this type of fright. Second is the lingering fear. This type of fear is actually a deep sense of dread of what is to come. Approximately 70 of the population is afraid of the dark and their imagination goes into overdrive for what they perceive might happen. The boo scare is the release of this dread. Without the release , the lingering fear can bother guests even after they have left the Denver haunted houses . </haunt.v.4565><haunt.v.4566>Maurine Drive - This road is believed to have been part of a runway at one time and is haunted by pilots who used it.

This is the address of the Coppal House Farm , which for the last few years has served as the host for Eric Lowther 's diabolical brainchild. The haunt began its life in the front yard of Lowther 's home , but over the course of a couple of years it grew much too large to be contained therein. Many of the props and costumes on display are one of a kind items that were hand crafted by Lowther , a former student at the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art. It is these skills that have made Haunted Overload one of the most elaborate and creative haunted attractions in America. These achievements have not gone unnoticed and in 2008 Haunted Overload earned the privilege of being named the number four haunt in the nation by Haunt World Magazine . </haunt.v.4606><haunt.v.4607>Great Lakes - Recruit Training Command - Recruit training command AKA boot camp for the navy is haunted my many spirits.

They do utilize a couple of fun and unexpected scares , but for the most you encounter a bunch of teenagers in masks who jump on and off the hayride in an attempt to scare people. The worst part about this is that they take you through themed areas ( such as Elm Street &amp;the Bates Motel ) but they do n't even have any of the actors match up to the themes. I 'm not a fan of using licensed characters in a haunted attraction but if all you 're going to have are people in poorly constructed masks then they might as well match their surroundings . </haunt.v.4609><haunt.v.4610>My other favorite spot was the Lincoln Cathedral built in 1072.

The Chapel and its graveyard are closed promptly at 6 p.m. to give the ghosts their respected privacy. A young woman in her twenties is seen crying over the grave of Henry Vick. In 1857 the love of Helen , Mr. Henry Vick , was killed in a duel. He killed just two days before their scheduled wedding.

The house originally had a rural American design and was intended to be at the end of a crooked path that led away from Disneyland 's Main Street area. Eventually the decision was made to place it in the New Orleans Square section of the park , and thus the attraction was themed as a haunted antebellum mansion. The Haunted Mansion 's design went through many changes before its facade was completed in 1963 , six years before it would open to the public , delayed by Disney 's involvement in the New York World 's Fair in 1964 and 1965. At one point Disney 's concept was to be entirely walk-through and empty out at a restaurant with a theme of " The Museum of the Weird.

A haunt that is lacking in scary scenes , but is 30 minutes long should n't cost $ 10 to walk through. Likewise , one that is only 10 minutes , and totally kicks butt scary style , should be more than $ 3- $ 4.

While CreepyWorld is an outdoor event , The Darkness is a 27 , 000 sq ft indoor attraction. Generally , indoor attractions have better set-design because they can be worked on and updated year around. The Darkness is one of HauntWorld ' s favorite haunted houses due to the unmatched detail , set design , animations and crazed actors. It ' s really hard to create an outdoor attraction with the same level of detail and design as a top-rated indoor attraction like The Darkness. However , there is no doubt that Creepyworld is every bit as detailed , every bit as elaborate , and in some ways better than any indoor haunted house we ' ve seen. We feel that most people looking for a good scream this October will find Creepyworld to be just what the doctor ordered.

But to have a true haunt , it should be large enough to immerse the audience in the story/theme , and by at least half way through they should believe they are really in a haunted place. If it is too short they might just get the feeling that it is real , and then bam ! , it 's over. On the other hand , if it is too large , the attractions will become spread out to fill all the space , and then all the dead time in between scares will let the guests regain their composure before being scared again. So a good haunt should be 10 to 30 min. long , and have a scare/creepy set around every corner.

Larigot , himself a writer of supernatural tales , has collected a remarkable batch of documents , fictive or real , describing the one human experience that is hardest to make good. Perhaps the very difficulty of it has rendered it more tempting to the writers who have dealt with the subject. His collection , notably varied and artfully chosen as it is , yet by no means exhausts the literature , which fills a place apart with its own recognised classics , magic masters , and dealers in the occult. Their testimony serves to show that the forms by which men and women are haunted are far more diverse and subtle than we knew. So much so , that one begins to wonder at last if every person is not liable to be " possessed. " For , lurking under the seeming identity of these visitations , the dramatic differences of their entrances and appearances , night and day , are so marked as to suggest that the experience is , given the fit temperament and occasion , inevitable . </haunt.v.4959><haunt.v.4960>Screamworld has been selected by America ' s Best Haunts ( www.americasbesthaunts.com ) as one of the best haunted attractions in the United States -- -we feel very honored , and we will continue to strive to deliver the best scares we can create . </haunt.v.4960><haunt.v.4961>Like gore haunts ?

Most of the remains were demolished in 1966 but still is surrounded by a wealth of legends and romantic tales of buried treasure , a man dying of fright and the supposed ghost of Florence Nightingale.

We were touring the haunted graveyard and watching the feature of the evening , when this HUGE , Grim Reaper-like character came through the gates ( it was so tall , I do n't know how it negotiated it ) . My daughter did n't see it until it was on top of her. She ran screaming and it chased her all around the graveyard. Then it turned on me ( I hid behind some other screaming people ) . The 3-D maze was awesome. I could n't stand up straight for about five minutes after getting out. POE is definitely one of the best haunts for the money.
