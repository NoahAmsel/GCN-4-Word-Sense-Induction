<root.v.train><root.v.1>Several currents are important to note here. First , the industrialization of Brazil coupled to its deep ties to world imperialism make it clear that this is not , as some would have it , a semi-feudal country. ( 196 ) Even though traces of feudalism remain , like remnants of property relations on plantations or mystical beliefs as organized into movements by churches , Brazil is an advanced capitalist nation and it is capitalist production , capitalist markets , the development of raw materials and the concentration of labor , the rising inequalities rooted in class and race and sex described above , that penetrates every aspect of Brazilian life. ( 197 ) Even though this process is fraught with its own internal contradictions , between the rising merchant/industrialists , the military and the old landowner class for example , as well as deep splits within and between poor and working people , and its own cultural expressions , as seen in the memories of the patron and the feudal agricultural relationships that revolve out of agricultural production , it remains that the dominant trend is social inequality based within the results of imperialism and industrial capitalism , material dominance of the an ever-increasing and marginally organized many by a narrowing few who hold state power . </root.v.1><root.v.2>Second , you need the soil that they will root in. It is best to purchase a sterilized potting soil , as this will prevent any disease from attacking the cutting , as well as providing the needed amount of aeration to the growing roots. You can re-use old potting soil from other sources , but it will need to be sterilized again , as well as any nutrients will be gone . </root.v.2><root.v.3>Some growers will have already started striking or rooting their blanch leek bulbils or pips hoping to have top quality specimens from next August onwards. Personally I like to start mine slightly later , if at all possible , for the simple reason that nothing stays in prime condition for too long. Starting them off early means that they will arrive at their optimum early and that might not always be the right thing. Once a leek has achieved it 's optimum growth , keeping it in pristine condition from that point on is difficult as it will almost certainly lose some of it 's sheen . </root.v.3><root.v.4>Though this experiment uses a tuber , tubers are not the only plants that will root in water. Many houseplants can be rooted in water. Wandering dew is particularly easy to root in water . </root.v.4><root.v.5>Insert the handle of a small shovel/spade to create a hole for your cutting. This will ensure that the cuttings rooting hormone powder does not fall off. Insert cutting into soil about five inches and place in warm sunlight or under a grow light. If placing outside , placing on a concrete deck will provide the warmth needed at the bottom of the pot. We recommend using black nursery style pots since they absorb the most heat that is good for successful rooting . </root.v.5><root.v.6>In our age -- where the TV facilitates empire , which masquerades as lending institutionBritish liberalism constitutes the ideological root of the modern capitalist political economy. The British were civilized to the point of boasting an empire upon which the sun would never set. Their philosophies were equally civil and all encompassing. Ever since the bourgeoning bourgeoisie of the thirteen colonies declared the independence of the capitalist from the colonist , these notions , rooted first in the freedom of the capitalist , second in the freedom of the individual , have dominated the discourse and praxis of the Western democracies . </root.v.6><root.v.7>Look , I 'm not God , passing judgment on who gets to enter the kingdom of heaven. I 'm just saying who I 'd like to have on the baseball team that I root for. You 're absolutely right : I 'm not close personal friends with Barry Bonds , and I 'm never going to have dinner with him. And that 's exactly why I do n't care what a good person he is deep down at the most personal level . </root.v.7><root.v.8>The most popular means of creating new plants is to take cuttings and encourage them to form roots. Two types of cuttings exist -- stem cuttings and leaf cuttings. To produce a stem cutting , remove a plant stem which has at least two or three leaf nodes ( the point where the leaf attaches to the stem ) . Strip off the lower leaves and place the cutting in a rooting medium such as water , perlite , vermiculite or sphagnum moss. In a month or so it will root , creating a whole new plant . </root.v.8><root.v.9>Place a plastic bag over the cutting , making sure that the plastic does not touch the leaves. Place the hibiscus cutting in partial shade. Make sure the rooting soil stays damp ( not wet ) until the hibiscus cuttings are rooted. The cuttings should be rooted in about 8 weeks. Once they are rooted , you can repot them in a bigger pot . </root.v.9><root.v.10>Amil Imani provides us insight into the character of Islam as it was formed during Mohammed 's lifetime. " Islam is rooted in the primitive tribal mentality of " We against Them , ... a non-Muslim is a combatant against Allah and he is fair game to be subjugated and killed. " It is not surprising that so many Muslims are willing to sacrifice themselves to the fight against evil , given that they firmly believe that " the troubles of the world are due to the evil-doings of the non-Muslims who war against Allah. " A delusion , true , but one that is easy to instill , given the Muslim belief system. Imani suggests that " [ m ] any non-Muslims are also victims of a different , yet just as deadly , delusion. They believe that Islam is a religion of peace , that only a small minority of Muslims are jihadists , and Muslims can be reasoned with to abandon the Quran-mandated elimination of the non-believers. " </root.v.10><root.v.11>About 6 weeks later , 4 cuttings were perfectly rooted in the soil and showed some signs of growth.

Pin oak , cherry bark oak , nuttal oak , willow oak and white oak are all great. There is a fruitless sweetgum tree , with good growth , and excellent fall color without the messy gumballs. Thornless honeylocust , tulip poplar , bald cypress and blackgum would all be good choices. Fall is the ideal time to plant trees , giving them a rooting season , before they have to deal with foliage . </root.v.12><root.v.13>What we don ' t need are reforms designed solely to appease the powerful , and to ward off his evil intentions. We need reform because it is the logic of life , because our societies are aspiring to it and insisting on it , as much as they insist on our national claims. Contrary to our fears , a process of reform rooted in our heritage , designed to our needs and capable of forming a new social contract between state and society will not further the attempts to establish a system of custody over us. Rather , it is the most genuine and effective response to counter such attempts . </root.v.13><root.v.14>I posted a question on the Private Backyard Growers Message Board about when it 's okay to sell cuttings after they have rooted. I received two e-mails from different board members asking to buy the rooted cuttings I mentioned. I was amazed.

This is done in early March so that they will be ready for the market when we feel that urge in early spring to get out of doors and do some gardening. Containerized roses usually are somewhat more expensive than the boxed roses because of the extra labor required for the garden center . </root.v.16><root.v.17>A player has the abitily to activate a short root aoe around himself.

These structures contain both adventitious root initials and dormant buds so that new root and shoot systems can develop. This process however is damaging to the parent tree , and will leave a large scar. Olive can also be propagated by removing suckers in spring . </root.v.24><root.v.25>Nutrient film technique ( NFT ) - A subirrigation growing system. Plants are rooted into porous cubes or containers and placed in sloped troughs where a nutrient solution continuously flows down the troughs in a thin film to supply water and nutrients.

All that is not encompassed by our knowledge , so that we are not in a position to make any statements about its total nature. Microphysics is feeling its way into the unknown side of matter , just as complex psychology is pushing forward into the unknown side of the mind. Both lines of investigation have yielded findings which can be conceived only by means of antinomies , and both have developed concepts which display remarkable analogies. If this trend should become more pronounced in the future , the hypothesis of the unity of their subject-matters would gain in probability. Of course there is little or no hope that the unitary Being can ever be conceived , since our powers of thought and language permit only of antinomian statements. But this much we do know beyond all doubt , that empirical reality has a transcendental background. - Mysterium Coniunctionis ( 1955 ) . CW 14 : P.768 </root.v.26><root.v.27>The steady decay Confucius had seen in Chou civilization became an irreversible and accelerating trend in the century after his death. So consistently did petty states fight with one another , larger states gobbling up smaller ones , that this time in Chinese history became known as the Warring States period. The ancient feudal system was disintegrating before an onslaught initiated by dukes and chieftains who sought to establish a centralized government which ruled the state through newly constituted administrative districts. Whilst this tendency freed people from some of the excesses and inefficiencies of the old system , it also fostered a political expediency rooted in Legalist ideas. Legalist philosophy presupposed that human beings are , without exception , egotistical and motivated only by rewards and punishments. The old feudal ideas of loyalty and devotion were replaced with state sanctions which could be applied to every subject , and this allegedly progressive approach led to a kind of amoral cynicism which simply denied that human beings were moral at all. Lip-service might be paid to Confucian and Mohist ideals , but the Legalist view pervaded all the states. Mencius , convinced that man is essentially a moral being , chose to stand against the tide of normless modernity . </root.v.27><root.v.28>Good for getting in position for an attack or escaping an enemy.

If you feel grounded , secure , and rooted in the present , this chakra needs little attention. However , many are not so blessed. A blocked root chakra may lead you to grasp at the physical , becoming clingy and overly possessive. Conversely , if you 're too open here you may feel estranged from your body and possessions. As a result , your generosity may be taken advantage of . </root.v.29><root.v.30>Plants can also be propagated by stem cuttings. Stems which flop over will readily root , so either stake down a stem to promote rooting , or choose one that has already rooted.

Handling and transplanting is easy when you use the Q Plug . </root.v.31><root.v.32>The Gospel of Christ and Christ himself , the living good news of the Father , is always the foundation of every life consecrated to God and the inexhaustible treasure from which , under the action of the Spirit , the founders and foundresses draw their inspiration and life. All their experiences are rooted in the words and example of the Master. The following of Christ is a commitment to be lived and proclaimed in such a way that in its totality and in the variety of vocations the Gospel of Jesus Christ shines forth in the world. In its every form the consecrated life seeks to live a message , an example and a mystery of the incarnate or glorious life as the whole in a fragment. However every charism is rooted in the following of Christ and every gift of self to him , just as every aspect of his life is inseparable from his person. The charisms of the consecrated life can not be separated from the following of Christ and the gift of consecration . </root.v.32><root.v.33>A : Never-flowering-lilacs could be a problem. Typically , lilacs set their flower buds in late July or early August for the following spring 's bloom. If they have never flowered it could be they are in too much shade or getting too much nitrogen fertilization for flower bud setting. Try to root prune them with a sharp-edged spade in a couple of places. Such trauma will often initiate the setting of flower buds for show the following year . </root.v.33><root.v.34>When planting for commercial timber or for coverage of large areas we strongly recommend planting our mixed selection of rooted cuttings. This will give you as many as 25 different clones. The U.S. Forest Service has pointed out and we have observed that the same clones thrive differently in varying climates and soils. The assortment of clones that we offer will produce good stands in any site to which the Poplars are adapted. They will thrive on sites ranging in pH from 3.5 to 8.9 . </root.v.34><root.v.35>It sounds like your plants are stretching for light. At such a young age , the best thing to do is bury them deeper. Get a bigger deeper pot and add soil up to the bottom of the seed leaves. The seedling will root from the stem. Water for a week or 2 with strong chamomile tea to avoid damping off. and put them about 12 " from the light. If it 's too hot add a fan.

It is an attitude that will quickly destroy " Body Life " , and that is the attitude of prejudice. Before we go any further , let me ask you this , " How many of you would be willing to say that you struggle with the sin of prejudice ? " This is an area of our lives that very few of us even want to acknowledge , let alone deal with. This morning we are going to look at what Jesus says about how we treat people , about our prejudices , and our biases - about playing favorites : </root.v.37><root.v.38>Certain species successfully root from very thick pieces of stem. This method is , naturally enough , known as taking trunk cuttings. The procedure is to select and cut likely shaped pieces of trunk and remove unwanted branches. Seal all cuts at the top end with wound paste and treat the bottom end with rooting hormone. Plant in sharp , gritty , well drained compost and keep moist. Full light and warmth , in a humid environment , will speed rooting . </root.v.38><root.v.39>Air layering is another way to grow roots on a branch if it can not be conveniently bent to the ground. In early summer , when the new growth has begun to firm up , choose a branch. Make a shallow cut a foot or so from the end , in year old wood , parallel to the branch and about an inch long , and sprinkle it with rooting hormone. Then wrap a handful of moist sphagnum moss around the cut , and wrap the moss in a piece of polyethylene plastic to form a water tight enclosure. Use electrician 's tape or wire to fasten the plastic tightly to the branch. Check it monthly to be sure the moss remains moist . </root.v.39><root.v.40>Peg down strawberry runners from new plants.

Snip a stem just below a node ( where the leaves are attached ) , then remove all but a few leaves at the top of the stem. If the plant has large foliage , cut the remaining leaves in half to lessen water loss through transpiration. Do n't be shy ! Just snip the leaf in half - it will grow new ones later ! You can also dip the end in rooting hormone at this point , but it 's not necessary , especially for plants like coleus that will root in water if left in a vase too long ! </root.v.44><root.v.45>Stolon ( Stolen ) A slender branch or shoot developing a bud and root at the tip or at both node and tip that roots and produces new plants.

Take the cutting immediately below a node , strip off the lower leaves , dip the cut end in a hormone rooting powder , and plant it in a 4-inch pot containing a moistened equal-parts mixture of peat moss and coarse sand or perlite. Enclose the whole in a plastic bag or heated propagating case , and keep it warm in bright indirect sunlight. When the potted cutting has rooted ( in four to six weeks ) remove it from the bag or case , water it moderately , and apply standard liquid fertiliser at two-week intervals. Move the cutting into a 5-inch pot of standard mixture and treat it as a mature plant when it begins to fill the pot with roots . </root.v.47><root.v.48>Geranium cuttings ( preferably soft stems ) will root any time of year but not in the heated propagator , whose conditions encourage them to rot. Fill a small pot with gritty rooting medium and plant three cuttings near the side. Water once and stand the pot in a window that receives constant warmth and light. Do not offer any cover and resist watering. They will root in seemingly dry compost but rot when it becomes too moist.

All you need to do is cut or break a piece of the plant off and plant it. Unfortunately , some plants are easier to propagate than others. For example , I have a huge jade plant in the living room. To propagate it is simple. A cutting is snapped off , planted in suitable soil and it grows provided it is watered and kept warm. Similarly , a Christmas cactus can be propagated by snapping off a section of the " leaf " and pushing it into potting soil. In most cases , it will root and you 'll have a new plant.

I would hazard a folkloric etymology that root is rooted in the literal sense of embedded organisms , such as teeth and nails , but especially plants. This colloquial coitus usage of root probably evolved due to the phallic imagery of literal root growth , a metaphorical allusion to an engored organ , increasing in thickness and length , and plunging into the moist depths of soil with the added implications of fertility . </root.v.60><root.v.61>Colossians 2 : 7 having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith , just as you were instructed , and overflowing with gratitude.

I especially like the concept of the three mutually perpendicular lines ( so-called x , y , and z axes ) which the author beautifully reasoned into existence for me , the reader. I 've tried purposeful meditation before , but always grew restless or uncomfortable before much good could come of it. Using Dr. Straubing 's imagery to feel the location of my root chakra and then to align these axes through it , clicks everthing else into balance and I am content to breathe quietly for 20 or 30 minutes , during which , and after which , I feel totally relaxed and deeply pleased with myself.

Many factors , including soil texture ( the average size of the rock particles in the soil ) , type and amount of organic matter , pH , and salinity , influence how these components aggregate. In turn , the resulting structure helps determine many other factors , including drainage , density , and aeration , which in their turn influence how deeply roots grow and how easily they take up nutrients. Soils with good structure are described as being " in good tilth , " a term related to " till " and " tillage , " and used to indicate soils that are ready for crops or other plantings . </root.v.63><root.v.64>God is first and foremost acknowledging that Avraham 's perceptions and understandings are correct. The loftiest of goals and the most magnificent of dreams for mankind can only be fulfilled if they are rooted in the Divine. What God is teaching Avraham , and subsequently us , is that the reality of God having a place in this world already exists; it 's not something that man is going to create - at least not from scratch. The reason it exists is that eternal dreams have to be rooted in the reality of God 's world. Says God to Avraham : " I have a place in this world. Do you have the courage to open your heart and accept it and become eternal ? Or do you wish to pursue your own ideals and wisdom knowing that they will disappear into oblivion ?

Conversely , if I say : " I am firstly Christian and only secondly African , " I could slip into a superficial internationalism , without organic roots in any community.

Rooting an enemy can , if you ' re lucky and the root doesn ' t break early , give you enough time to heal and then either escape or get some distance and start up a nice slow casting damaging spell. In group PvP , rooting a warrior or rogue can render them largely ineffective , as they are left to plink away with their ranged weapons and can ' t close with the enemy.

Using the median size of a FOSTA family ( 87 ) , we can estimate that another 1949 families will be formed if FOSTA were to cluster around non-human proteins. We propose that a future version of FOSTA will root FOSTA families around decreasingly well defined ( in terms of proteome coverage and functional annotation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ) species , until all proteins are assigned to a FOSTA family. While we intend to address this in future versions , it must be noted that human proteins are the most thoroughly annotated , and it is unclear whether proteins from other organisms will be annotated well enough to identify functional equivalencies across species . </root.v.71><root.v.72>Our range of Seedlings and Young Plants has been carefully selected to provide you with the most comprehensive collection of the best new and traditional varieties from around the world.

The " ... consequence of this guiding principle [ is ] a legacy of harsh inequality , intolerance , and injustice ... , " not the benign tolerance Muslims claim Islam extends to other religions. Andrew Bostom makes us understand how deeply rooted is the Muslim attitude of superiority by providing examples from the different caliphates and from today 's Islamic societies. He concludes , " The openly expressed desire for the restoration of a Caliphate from two-thirds of an important Muslim sample of Arab and non-Arab Islamic nations , representative of Muslims worldwide , should serve as a chilling wake-up call to those still in denial about the existential threat posed by the living , uniquely Islamic institution of jihad.

It certainly provides the needed moisture , but if the water is not changed on a weekly basis , it will become stagnant , oxygen deficient , and inhibitory to rooting. Furthermore , roots produced in 100 water are different from those produced in solid media; they may undergo greater transplant shock with a greater incidence of death.

The drying of the ground is one of the main reasons for cuttings failing to root. Be patient. The cuttings will take many weeks before they root. Even if you see growth starting , do not be tempted to remove the cutting from the ground. Using its own reserves , the cutting might start shooting before it has any roots. In spring when you can see strong growth , gently dig up the rooted cuttings and plant in their final positions. Although you might well get 100 per cent of the cuttings to root , in general you should take twice as many cuttings as you need plants to ensure that you will have enough . </root.v.81><root.v.82>26. Vinca minor 'La Grave ' L. ( Apocynaceae ) . The blue-flowered evergreen periwinkle is one of the most popular groundcovers in the landscape industry. The wild species is most commonly grown though several fine cultivars exist with other flower colors ( white , purple ) and several foliage varients ( golden , variegated gold or silver ) . This fine new European cultivar , 'La Grave ' , rated very high in recent Royal Horticultural Society trials with its large deep green glossy foliage and abundant blue flowers. It can easily be propagated year-round from cuttings , or by digging an established bed where the plant has rooted to the ground along the stems and cutting into pieces. This much superior form should be grown to gradually replace the wild species now commonly grown. Our one-year old plant is several feet in diameter now and could provide a limited quantity of cuttings - but stock can rapidly be built up. It will grow anywhee in N.C. and is best in medium shade , but can tolerate full sun ( though it will scorch in extreme cold in sun if not under asnow cover ) .

Relatively small amounts of rooting media are used , and the position on aerial parts of the plant exposes them to drying winds and sun. Many wraps have been tried , but the best seems to be clear polyethylene plastic sheeting which allows oxygen to enter and retains moisture well. Air layers are easiest to make in greenhouses where humidity is high , but they may also be used outside as long as they are kept moist and do n't freeze.

These infections result in a combination of symptoms including a wet , mushy leaf spot and stem rot.

Severe infections can result in cutting loss , since the plants often rot from the cutting end upwards. If these cuttings are carefully recut to remove the rotten portion of the stem and restuck , they will sometimes root adequately. The unfortunate fact , however , is that most of the cuttings will then develop symptoms of stem and root rot caused by Erwinia.

According to this definition , the Kabbalah investigates the hidden meaning of the Torah and other Jewish religious writings. But , when we examine the matter more closely , we discover that the facts are quite something else. These facts lead us to the conclusion that teachings rooted in pagan idolatry , that existed before the Torah , and became widespread within Judaism after the Torah was revealed , were included in the Kabbalah . </root.v.134><root.v.135>Under good growing conditions ( warm , sunny weather ) miniature rose cuttings will root under mist in about three weeks. Some kinds ' take a little longer , some less. When rooting has taken place ( cuttings will feel tight if gently tugged ) the next step is to wean them from the mist. This is done by gradually shortening the hours under mist and providing longer and longer OFF intervals during the day. With us this weaning process takes about six or seven days. Cuttings may then be removed and potted or allowed to stay in cutting bench or flat until they can be potted . </root.v.135><root.v.136>This book celebrates Aneesha s thirty years of experience , working with neo-Reichian methods of energy release , combined with meditation.

The narrator , then , exorcises the patriarchal construction of La Llorona she has internalized in favor of an empowering construction rooted in her indigenous ancestry. In so doing , she illustrates the necessity of scrutinizing the legend to flesh out the layers of meaning within La Llorona 's story. The female narrator represents the syncretism that can emerge when challenging and negotiating seemingly disparate lifeways and cultural influences. Anzald a 's privileging of La Llorona 's Aztecan antecedents presents a more complete and ultimately empowering view of the weeping woman and Chicanas outside the context of the traditional folklore . </root.v.137><root.v.138>Propagating roses by rooting and cuttings is a simple way to obtain more plants. Some varieties are usually self-rooted. Other varieties have the upper portion budded or grafted onto a root stock; these root stocks are usually propagated from cuttings.

A society that meets and provides these needs is a spiritually rooted one. This society will provide the material and spiritual needs of each member of the society. Weil finds these societies as part of the natural development of human life on earth. They are ordained by God as the creator and source of life. They are precious and should be honored and venerated for their beauty , but above for their ability to sustain human life in its material needs , if not more so with their spiritual journeys and desires . </root.v.143><root.v.144>Your mind can be described in two parts : your conscious and your subconscious. Your conscious mind is responsible for that which you deal with on a logical level , such as problem-solving at work and deciding what to make for dinner. Your subconscious is in charge of automatic duties such as your breathing and filtering all the sights and sounds around you to allow your conscious to focus on the task at hand. Both your conscious and your subconscious make observations and form ideas , and are responsible for your feelings and behaviours. The difference is that your conscious ideas are a ) based on logic and b ) easily accessible to you. Contrarily , your subconscious ideas are a ) based on emotion and b ) remain buried and unaware to your ( conscious ) mind. Whenever you find yourself following a pattern of emotions or habits that you do not understand , it is because they are instigated by thoughts dwelling in your subconscious. The reason why you can not get over the fears which are debilitating you even though you understand why it would be beneficial for you to do so is because these fears are rooted in your subconscious . </root.v.144><root.v.145>Druids are relatively easy to take down. They 're part healer and part nuker leaving them slightly lacking in both departments. The one thing you need to watch out for when fighting a druid is their root spell. A druid 's main form of damage is an instant cast nuke with a DOT attached. All of the spells that you need to concern yourself with are from the Nature line. Their root and heals are both nature spells which are easy to pick out due to the glowing green hands the druid has when using them. They 'll try to root you and throw in an occasional nuke. If you get rooted , pull out your ranged weapon and start shooting. Make sure you watch the root duration closely; the second it breaks , rush in with a hamstring. As with any healing class , the key to victory is to wait until you have them around 25 health and Pummel their heal. This shuts out all of their healing and defensive spells long enough to finish them off . </root.v.145><root.v.146>" The Cardinal question ?

Good Soil to Soil contact is needed for success. Soil preparation must be complete before you get your sod. Sod is a perishable product , which needs to be installed as soon as possible after harvesting. Heat builds up in the rolls and gasses are released and the sod starts to break down. Fescue is a cool season grass , cooler temperatures allow for a " shelf " life of a couple days. It is recommended to install the sod as soon as possible. Fescue will root at anytime above 32 . Freshly installed sod still needs to be watered but not as much during the winter months. As for preparing your area - be sure to clear all debris. Rough the grade to eliminate drainage , loosen soil to a depth of 4 inches; remove sticks , stones , clods , weeds and old grass. You must apply Lime and Starter Fertilize prior to putting the sod down; check with your area garden center on types and amounts needed . </root.v.148><root.v.149>British values have emerged from a myriad of sources which are rooted in the history and tradition of the nations concerned; no one source has a monopoly of foundational wisdom. Various broad phenomena such as the movement of peoples , the depth of particular patriotic feelings and the economic health of the nations involved interact with deeply rooted religious faiths and with developments in contemporary culture to produce a set of values which are capable of being crystallised as specific to this group of nation states organised in this supra-national structure at this point in time. Values can change but they do so slowly , sometimes imperceptibly. They represent the collective common sense of a particular generation on how it is best to behave. They can be identified by careful scrutiny of a culture ' s best habits and by examining how prevailing systems of government ( representative democracy; respect for human rights; the rule of law ) implicitly reflect agreement about a range of core ideals . </root.v.149><root.v.150>Cover the stems with soil.

When daytime temperatures drop below 55 consistently , it 's too late. Common broadleaf weeds such as dandelion , white clover , creeping Charlie and plantain are much more easily controlled in the fall than in the spring. While the actual plants may not disappear this fall , in all likelihood they will be dead and no longer visible by next spring. One or two applications between the end of September and mid-October are usually all that is needed for good control. Bluegrass sod can be laid thru mid to late October depending on weather conditions. Even though it may be cooler it is still important to water any newly laid sod. Exposed sites , especially , should be watered frequently to keep the sod from drying out and to promote rooting. The later you wait , the greater the risk of the sod drying out before it roots into the soil. When laying sod late in the season , be sure to ask your sod vendor or landscape contractor about any guarantees regarding newly laid sod and survival over the winter . </root.v.151><root.v.152>As for rooting the cutting in water , this practice is not recommended for any type of plant , as those so called 'water roots ' will just die once they are put into potting media in any case. The plant then has to concentrate on putting out brand new soil roots , if it has the strength left to do so. By the time the plant has developed those new soil roots , it could have been quite a size if it had been rooted in a proper rooting media in the first place. It is also very unlikely that a Norfolk Island pine cutting would develop roots in water . </root.v.152><root.v.153>As I look back , I realize how much teaching was rooted in my childhood , parenting experience and reporter 's training.

His reason for talking to me was to assure me that the Brotherhood was an essentially good body of men devoted to all that was best in the British social system and which promoted brotherly love and contributed to the wellbeing of the country and to the relief of suffering. He wanted this put firmly across to the public , and his group wanted pressure brought to bear on those in positions of responsibility within the Brotherhood to put Freemasonry 's house in order - to institute proper policing , to close down Lodges used for shady dealings and to root out corrupt brethren and expel them. The group - it had no name - also wanted the whole business of masonic secrecy looked into by Grand Lodge , most of them believing that secrecy was more harmful than helpful to Masonry . </root.v.156><root.v.157>Anyone with a rooted handset can set up Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tethering using this app. The ever-popular Apps2SD software lets you migrate your Android apps over to your SD card , freeing up room on your phone.

When asked about homosexuality , a Ghanaian born editor of an African affairs publication was quick to blame the existence of that kind of behavior on missionaries and its prevalence in missionary run schools. Such perception , very widespread throughout Africa , is directly related to the mixed message colonialism brought; missionaries who came to save souls alongside of armies that came to steal the land and everything on it . </root.v.167><root.v.168>The growing tip of a plant is made of thin-walled cells which can still divide. The direction of growth is normally towards light ( plants can , to that extent , 'see ' ) and upwards , away from the ground ( they can sense gravity ) . As the cells mature they lay down their cell walls. Cellulose is the typical deposit in plant cell walls , though some plants produce other substances. Lignin , for instance , is widely found in woody tissues. Structures made of silica glass are found in some cell walls , which is why a blade of grass can cut the skin like a saw. It is the wall of a plant cell which prevents such plants from moving around. They are rooted to the spot , taking in water that evaporates from the leaves. This continuous current of water passing up along the stem carries nutriment through the body of the plant. The movement of water is called transpiration , and it is vital for a plant 's growth . </root.v.168><root.v.169>What have I done wrong and how can I fix it so I can get back to cupcake.

As the Church tries to keep a central moral voice and promote inculturation at the same time , missionary institutes will have to seek a capacity to be both unified and rooted in local contexts. Many have already made efforts in this direction. Living out this kind of dialectic will be one of the challenges of 2025. The often unstable situations will create a tendency to identify unity with stability at the expense of diversity.

( 2001 ) to build a higher-level MRP supertree of eutherian ( placental ) mammals ( Beck et al. , in preparation ) . In most source trees , the taxon sampling was limited to mammals , and usually to eutherians. However , the position of the root of the eutherian tree ( and , to a lesser extent , of the mammal tree as a whole ) remains controversial. Received opinion on this topic differs greatly and has changed with time , with any of erinaceids ( e.g. , Arnason et al. , 2002 ) , xenarthrans ( e.g. , Shoshani and McKenna , 1998 ) , murid rodents ( e.g. , Asher et al. , 2003; Misawa and Janke , 2003 ) , and afrotherians ( e.g. , Murphy et al. , 2001; Amrine-Madsen et al. , 2003 ) having been championed recently as the basal placental lineage ( for a review , see Springer et al. , 2004 ) . However , the uncertainty surrounding placental phylogeny ( including the number and composition of the orders ) means that many existing placental-only trees might be rooted inappropriately according to current phylogenetic opinion . </root.v.181><root.v.182>Rhizomes. For plants with rhizomes , which include rex cultorum , one can use a piece of rhizome two to four inches in length that may or may not contain a small leaf. I use two or three pieces in a six-inch pot , just loosely laying the rhizome on the surface of the medium. The rhizomes will root in a few weeks on their lower surface , to give a large , attractive planting. With time , the shallow potting medium will fill with roots and more is needed. The best technique is to just to ( 1 ) remove the rooted stems , medium and all , ( 2 ) put more medium in the container , then ( 3 ) place the root ball back on top.

As noted above , the essential characteristic of science lies in its objectivity , and that objectivity is rooted in its lawfulness. It is this formal feature of objectivity that constitutes the philosophical interest in science , not the material content of a particular science 's theorems; in other words , the philosophical question is : How is this lawfulness possible ?

Most cuttings will root in water. However , only a very few ( such as common tropical plants like the heart-leaf philodendron ) of these rooted cuttings will grow well when they are transferred to soil or another growing medium. Cuttings rooted in water have roots orientated to water , and these often do not survive in soil. Also , plants need air at their roots as much as they need water , in order to grow.

These advantages create the opportunity for earlier fall planting dates , even as early as late August to early September in some areas. The earlier the fall planting , the greater the chance for rooting to occur before winter sets in. This rooting will be in addition to the root growth that occurs the following spring and can make the difference in whether a seedling survives the first growing season. Large containers can be planted quickly at a rate of approximately one plant per minute ( Hoag 2006 ) . The pot planter is limited by the same factors as the waterjet stinger , which include steep slope gradients , inaccessibility , high soil rock content , and poor water source availability . </root.v.227><root.v.228>To make matters worse , many cuttings are rooted under greenhouse heat.

The new plants are completely confused about when to expect winter frosts , which must be prepared for , at least two months in advance , by progressive hardening of the wood , another exhausting process. Harassed by the struggle with a makeshift crown and a disproportionate sappy top growth for which hasty root development can not adequately provide , the cutting could not prepare for winter even if it had not been upset in its measuring of the seasons.

As the heat rises in the soil it warms the plants roots , stimulating growth. In a cold frame or cool greenhouse , where air temperature are significantly cooler than the root zone ( not cooler than 40 degrees ) , healthy compact growth occurs. The top of the plant will generally respond to the cooler temperatures by limiting foliage growth , while the stimulated roots grow vigorously. This is especially true for rooted cuttings . </root.v.232><root.v.233>Hi Donna , no it ' s not too late , dormant cuttings are usually used to start fig trees but your cuttings may still root. They will be better off inserted into a pot containing a sterile growing medium such as vermiculite rather than to try to root the detached cuttings directly in the ground. Keep them cool and moist in a shaded location with high humidity levels until roots begin to form. For fig trees that have leafed out and are growing an easy way to propagate is to place a branch in contact with the ground , cover with soil , wait for roots to form , and then sever the new fig plant from the parent . </root.v.233><root.v.234>But that Rahab was understood in this way is not certain.

Like Kinsey , they try to be objective , but even if they fail they can rely on the scientific community to uncover biases and discover the imaginative and valid core of every good theory.

" Rather , as Malatesta pointed out , it " would be closer to the truth to say 'government of the majority of the people. " And even this is false , as " it is never the case that the representatives of the majority of the people are in the same mind on all questions; it is therefore necessary to have recourse again to the majority system and thus we will get closer still to the truth with 'government of the majority of the elected by the majority of the electors. ' " This , obviously , " is already beginning to bear a strong resemblance to minority government. " And so , " it is easy to understand what has already been proven by universal historical experience : even in the most democratic of democracies it is always a small minority that rules and imposes its will and interests by force.

How many other nurseryman across the country do you suppose do that ? </root.v.246><root.v.247>Does this make any difference ? Yes it does because Romano is not making the absurd claim that Heidegger 's work should not be read because Heidegger was sympathetic to Nazism; that is not the claim. The argument rather is roughly : because Heidegger 's work is rooted in his Nazism its not real philosophy but rather a type of agitprop which poses as philosophy , but it is no such thing. This is what compromises it and this is why it should not be treated seriously. I suppose the idea is that H 's philosophy is like the recent incarnation of creationism which tries to present theistic account of origin of life as science. But just like H 's Nazi propaganda which is not real philosophy so similarly creationism is not real science . </root.v.247><root.v.248>Once the weather gets colder and you have experienced at least one good hard freeze , the deciduous plants should be dormant and will have dropped their leaves , and you can now propagate them.

Jesus was not willing to : one , make the answer theological , and two , give him a false hope without a total surrender. Jesus pressed at the very heart and desire of the man , to get at the very root of his life. He could not be saved unless he confessed the root of his sin and turned from it. If we want to be free from God 's wrath and hell , we are going to have to give all to Jesus. There is no second best we can offer Him.

Others , like lilac and strawberry , grow suckers - new shoots , arising from the roots. Many plants such as hellebore and foxgloves drop seeds which grow into young plants. In all these cases , the plants can then be dug up and put into pots of soil ready for the move. A well established tree will probably not survive excavating and transplanting.

When growers receive cases of these cuttings , they assume that if the cuttings appear to be of high quality they will root rapidly and grow into a salable unit within a standard period of time. Sometimes cuttings do not root and grow as expected due to diseases , shipping conditions , or pesticide toxicity.

We call this the attacking power of root. Instead of relying on hand or arm power when you strike , you use the whole body power. And not just the whole body power; the whole body-rooted-to- the-ground power. This aspect of tai chi power is not at all mysterious if you understand the mechanics involved . </root.v.263><root.v.264>Push the prepared cuttings into the holes , and press soil against the stem.

However , for some reason , we have not harnessed it enough to effect lasting reforms in ourselves and in our country . </root.v.266><root.v.267>( 3 ) Great emphasis came to be placed on education. George Whitefield founded the school that would latter become the University of Pennsylvania , and UNC was originally a Presbyterian effort. Indeed , the first generation of faculty members there were all Presbyterian ministers. The focus on education was rooted in a concern for souls , but it also reflected the fact that if the ground is level at the foot of the cross , education should be available for all as well . </root.v.267><root.v.268>Suppose two trees , not isomorphic , lead to the same rooted tree. Take the label off the root to resurrect the original unrooted tree. Thus distinct trees always lead to distinct rooted trees . </root.v.268><root.v.269>Challenge to the assumption that human lethality is inescapably rooted in our evolutionary emergence as a species of killer ape comes from new studies of a genetically almost identical primate species the non-killing bonobo of Central Africa ( Kano 1990 ) . The Mangandu people of the Congo , who share the tropical forest with the bonobo , strictly prohibit killing them based on a legend that once their ancestors and the bonobo lived together as kin ( Kano 1990 : 62 ) . In contrast to gorillas , chimpanzees , and other apes , bonobo have not been observed to kill each other ( Wrangham and Peterson , 1990; Waal 1997 ) . Furthermore , recent studies of peacemaking and reciprocal altruism among primate species who do kill also call into question the tendency to claim only lethality but not non-killing potentiality in evolutionary human nature ( Waal 1989; 1996 ) , Sorokin ( 1954 ) , and Alfie Kohn ( 1990 ) have demonstrated , a cooperative , altruistic , and brighter side of human nature as well . </root.v.269><root.v.270>In a temperature of 50 degrees at night the cuttings will root in five weeks , but varieties differ considerably in this respect. Some cuttings ( of roses for instance ) are best potted up as soon as the roots have started out a fourth of an inch , but a carnation I would rather have roots an inch long. Some plant from the cutting beds into flats or on benches in three or four inches of soil , giving them room enough to remain till planting out time. Some pot them first into 2-inch , or perhaps 2 1/2-inch pots and later shift them into 3-inch pots. If early propagated an excellent plan is to pot into 2-inch and in six or seven weeks , or as soon as the roots are crowded , to plant them out in four inches of soil. This way they lift with a fine ball of roots and should be strong plants with several breaks from the bottom . </root.v.270><root.v.271>We have spoken a little about how it is on Terra -- how one creates anew in the moment , without reference to the past or the future. In this metaphor of surfing the wave and staying over your feet , we are talking about staying rooted where you ARE -- in the present moment -- rather than in the " past " ( where you have been ) or the " future " ( where you are going ) . If you think about it , all fear derives from past experience being projected onto the future. When things arise in your present moment that remind you of something from the past , you can easily project that the past experience will repeat itself in the moments that follow the time of remembering that past. This is when you feel fear. It 's inner talk that says , " It was like this before , so it will be like this again. " If you experienced pain in the past , you expect it will be painful again. That is where the fear comes in. You want to avoid the pain. " I 'm afraid that if this moment goes the way it went before , I 'll experience what I experienced before , and I do n't want to do that again.

I do attempt to analyze how I feel or why I feel some way , about a wide variety of things ... but , for some reason , I draw too many blanks in my analysis of emotions relating to sports fandom. And I 'm not a person who can say , " Well , if there is n't any logical reason for that feeling , I should just try harder to not feel that way " -- unless it relates to a more important decision-making process about life , family , work , etc. When it comes to innocuous entertainment , I 'm just going to like what I like for whatever reasons I like it , and I 'm going to dislike what I dislike. I do n't try to sway anyone over to my line of feeling , nor criticize those who feel ( or think ) differently ... and I do n't abandon a team that I feel mostly good about , just because they also make some decisions that I do n't like . </root.v.272><root.v.273>The vine gives out a tap-root from seeds , i.e. , a main root which descends deeply into the ground and sends out branches at different heights. Nevertheless , according to vine-growing practices , use is not made of the germination of seeds , as the vine reproduces by means of " estacas " or cuttings which are rooted in nurseries and transplanted to the vineyard. In this case , the root develops in stages from the bottom end of the cutting , although , after some years roots also come out of higher parts of the cutting . </root.v.273><root.v.274>Sure , when we were in that horrible losing streak last year , I had to turn off the radio so that my heart did n't break.

Consistently make the lower cut slanted and the upper cut straight so you can tell which is the top. Insert the cutting vertically. Roots will form fairly soon , and eventually a new plant will appear at the base of the cutting. These and other succulent cuttings will rot if kept too moist.

These leaves are important to manufacture food through photosynthesis , which will provide the energy to grow new root systems. Strip off any leaves below the node , then dip the cuttings into a rooting hormone such as Rootone. It is a powdered form of rooting hormone that is widely available at local garden centers.

This aspect of the social dynamic is particularly clear in terms of Mead 's concept of intra-group conflict and his description of the dialectic of the " me " and the " I. " As pointed out earlier , the " I " is an emergent response to the generalized other; and the " me " is that phase of the self that represents the social situation within which the individual must operate. Thus , the critical capacity of the self takes form in the " I " and has two dimensions : ( 1 ) explicit self- criticism ( aimed at the " me " ) is implicit social criticism; and ( 2 ) explicit social criticism is implicit self- criticism. For example , the criticism of one 's own moral principles is also the criticism of the morality of one 's social world , for personal morality is rooted in social morality. Conversely , the criticism of the morality of one 's society raises questions concerning one 's own moral role in the social situation . </root.v.305><root.v.306>Bury the root pieces vertically , top side up , in a big pot filled with potting soil.

When the sprouts are of a size you can handle -- 1 to 2 " long , cut them carefully from the potato with a sharp knife. Some may have already formed roots , but that 's not important at this point. simply insert the sprouts as you would any cutting in either more vermiculite , or soilless seed-starting mix.

" I then realized this is true in scripture , for Mark 4 : 30 says , " How shall we liken the kingdom of God ? Or in what parable shall we set it forth ? It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown upon the earth , though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth , yet when it is sown , groweth up , and becometh greater than all the herbs , and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.

First , He sows the Word by the preaching of the Gospel. Then , through the Word sown , He plants His Church by gathering believers around the Word. Finally through the Church planted He bears fruit in the world by calling and gathering more believers into His Church. This is the progression the propagation , if you will of God ' s Word; and nothing can stop this movement of God because His power is behind it. Thus by the movement of the Spirit , the Word of God is sown through the world. It is scattered into the hearts of people by the preaching of the Gospel , so that by hearing they may believe. The Spirit breaks through the barriers of the world and the attacks of Satan. He bears fruit when souls are saved and troubled hearts are given assurance of eternal life and hope in the kingdom of God . </root.v.317><root.v.318>But what about friendship ? Surely friendships within the Order and with the children are forbidden ? Yes and no. Private and exclusive friendships are forbidden. It may be well to explain the reason for this.

When we speak of God as the origin of every goodness and the Supreme Judge of mankind , we bring true notions of right and wrong into a child 's consciousness. We do this not with formal rules , but by helping him to perceive the Living Person Who stands over the world , and before Whom we all are accountable. This Supreme Being draws us toward good and repels us from all that is perishable. Thus a child recognizes sin as something shameful , harmful and subject to punishment. This notion of sin is not totally alien to a child because the feeling of fault , shame , and an elementary distinguishing between right and wrong is part of his nature. The Christian faith only clarifies and strengthens in him these deeply rooted notions . </root.v.322><root.v.323>But - he is developing very important qualities of experiencing single-mindedness , power and the rooting of the physical aspect of himself.

Once you understand why you crave certain types of foods , it becomes easier to control the cravings. Ultimately , all cravings are rooted in biochemistry. Your desire for certain foods rises and falls in synch with the levels of various chemicals in your body. These chemicals create a desire for a certain type of food , like fat or carbohydrate. Individual preferences then mold this urge into a craving for a specific food. This is analogous to sexual attraction in that biochemistry creates a desire for another person , but it does not cause a longing for a specific mate . </root.v.324><root.v.325>Buckhorn plantain is a slender fibrous rooted perennial.

Root cuttings can likewise be taken after flowering . </root.v.327><root.v.328>Unfortunately , scientists have failed to explore the possibility that there are essential links between physics and the study of consciousness , or even to consider the metaphysics of existence. According to a mystical perspective , this is an error of unfathomable proportions as all cosmoses embody the same metaphysical and physical principles of creation and design : As above , so below. All living cosmoses , including the microcosm of human consciousness , emerge from zero point sources and are rooted into the same subtle underlying realms. In this view , the development of a more comprehensive science demands a science of the soul and with this , a physics and metaphysics of consciousness and the Heart. In fact , the basic concepts of physics and cosmology can be applied to thinking about the origin and nature of consciousness and the heart , if we have the missing links provided by esoteric mystical doctrines . </root.v.328><root.v.329>YES ! It is possible to root a cut off branch ! While it may be more trouble than the value of such a rooted cutting , it 's a priceless experience ! Here 's how : </root.v.329><root.v.330>Because I have just spent an entire week pulling enormous clumps of this out of one area in my garden approximately 20 ' x 50 ' in diameter , Lysimachia nummularia ( Creeping Jenny ) is number one on my list of aggressive plants. It forms a very attractive mat of roundish , chartreuse-green leaves , but will root wherever it contacts the soil , eventually invading any other plantings in your garden. My Creeping Jenny started from two 4 " containers and even though I have pulled a lot of it out , it will be back. The key word here is " creeping " and I will be very suspicious in the future of any plant labeled as such . </root.v.330><root.v.331>Place one of the cut ends of each leaf section in rooting hormone following the directions for the product you are using.

Select an open space in the garden , dig one large hole and plant all your bundled bare rooted trees in it and firm down soil. Water in well. They will keep for several weeks if kept watered. Alternatively , plants can be placed into moist potting mix or potted up until a permanent place is ready for the plant. *NOTE : IT IS MOST IMPORTANT NOT TO LET THE ROOTS DRY OUT AT ANY STAGE OF PLANTING . </root.v.332><root.v.333>c. So that it spreads no further among the people : Their fear of the preaching of Jesus was rooted in their own sinful self-interest , not in any desire to protect the people . </root.v.333><root.v.334>Stumps must be removed. As our forefathers moved West , they began by logging the trees on their land and rooting out the stumps. Have you ever cut down a tree and prepared its trunk for construction or firewood ? It 's hard work. But removing stumps is even harder. You must dig down and cut each of the main roots with an axe , hatchet , or chainsaw. Then you attach a rope or chain to the stump and pull it out with a team of horses , oxen , truck , or winch. Finally , you pile all the stumps together and burn them as you clear the land . </root.v.334><root.v.335>Even pergolas , garden gates or similar garden fixtures make a beautiful sight when covered with passion-flowers. In cold regions it is well to take a few precautions to assure plants for the next year. Cuttings may be taken in August or September. Any mature piece of the vine , cut to 6 or 8 inches , will root easily in sand , vermiculite or water . </root.v.335><root.v.336>Unity : Concept and Reality is a digitally recorded compact disc of a discourse delivered by Shaykh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi on Sunday 31th June 2001 , at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara , California for the 2001 Zaytuna Institute Annual Conference.

Micro rooting should have no more than 1 , 2 or 3 hairs per follicle , should look like a real baby 's hair and should be styled like a real baby 's hair. If the artist says rooted , it means the hair is what we call hand rooted , and will be thicker with more than 2 or 3 hairs per follicle but should not look pluggy. Did the artist mention securing the hair on the inside of the head ? Rooted hair must be secured on the inside . </root.v.337><root.v.338>Leaves on evergreen cuttings and leafy cuttings of deciduous plants promote root formation through their production of growth-promoting hormones and food materials ( carbohydrates ) . Keep as large a leaf surface as possible on the cuttings. There are disadvantages to this procedure , however. One is the space required to root some broadleaved evergreen cuttings with large leaves. In such cases , commercial propagators sometimes clip off one-third to one-half of the tips of large leaves. Another problem is that leaves lose water through transpiration. Excessive loss will interfere with root formation or cause the cutting to die. Take precautions to reduce water loss. If leaves form too early on hardwood cuttings of deciduous plants , they may encourage excessive moisture loss and cause the cutting to die . </root.v.338><root.v.339>The communist revolution requires a scientific understanding of society. This science of revolution arose from , and has continued to develop in constant interaction with , all the great streams of society ' s intellectual , scientific and cultural life , as well as the class struggle , and the struggle for production itself. [ For more on the science of communism , see Appendix. ] This science did not and could not arise spontaneously from the immediate conditions of the oppressed , or even from the struggles that erupt against the imperialists; that framework is too narrow , too saturated and imbued with the outlook and ways of approaching things of the very system that dominates the masses. For this reason , along with the fact that the system denies the masses of people training in and access to theory , this science must be brought to the masses from outside their direct experience and conditions. That requires a party rooted in a scientific understanding of the system and of the kind of revolution that must replace it . </root.v.339><root.v.340>Method 2 : Roll up the leaf blade , dip the base in rooting hormone , and insert about 1/3 of the roll into the rooting mix. Place extra mix into the center of the leaf roll to hold it in place ( Figure 18 ) . Rolling should break some of the veins , so cutting is not required . </root.v.340><root.v.341>Propagating roses ( and other plants ) by rooting softwood cuttings is a simple way to obtain more plants. Some varieties are usually self-rooted. Other varieties have the upper portion budded or grafted onto a root stock; these root stocks are usually propagated from cuttings. " Old Garden Roses " , shrub roses and miniature roses may be grown on their own roots. Modern hybrid teas and floribundas are less predictable . </root.v.341><root.v.342>Mature wood , about one year old , is generally best for air layering. Old branches or immature wood often root poorly or not at all . </root.v.342><root.v.343>Pinching makes chrysanthemums compact and bushy. Pinching is just another name for pruning with your fingers , removing about an inch of stem per pinch. Start pinching the tips of rooted cuttings when they reach 6 inches. They 'll develop additional stems from the leaf nodes below the pinch. When the new stems are 6 inches long , pinch those tips and the plants will produce more stems from the leaf nodes. By late July when pinching should stop the single stem , rooted cutting planted back in May will have developed into a bushy compact plant with hundreds of stems with buds forming on their tips . </root.v.343><root.v.344>Select a baby spider plant , or 'plantlet , ' suspended from the main spider plant. A plantlet with the beginning of roots will plant faster , but any plantlet will root easily . </root.v.344><root.v.345>Some growers add Superthrive or another rooting hormone to the water and find that this helps encourage rooting. At the first sign that roots are forthcoming , I pot each cutting in its individual one-gallon container. When water rooting , the roots come from the cambium , which is the layer of meristematic tissue capable of producing new cells. Although water-rooting can be practical in some cases , I prefer to root cuttings in soil . </root.v.345><root.v.346>11Remove the stake after a year. After one year , the tree should be securely rooted , and the stake will hinder the tree 's future growth. Remove the rubber tree tie , and saw off the stake at soil level. Be careful not to injure the young tree accidentally with the saw . </root.v.346><root.v.347>Otherwise , when you are shopping and buying a plumeria in person , such as one you might find at a local nursery or Home Depot , be sure to check the plumeria ' s overall stem color and texture. Any signs of wrinkles , soft spots , dark spots , holes , or discoloration can mean trouble and can indicate that the plumeria is not healthy. You can reach into the base of the plumeria tree with your fingers and test for firmness just beneath the soil level. Rooted cuttings should be firm and healthy-looking , and the leaves should look healthy and be free of any insect damage. Be sure to inspect the growing tip as well for any problems; a shiny tip is a happy tip ! </root.v.347><root.v.348>Good luck with the surgery.

At this point , you can take the cuttings out of the greenhouse and begin gradually exposing them to direct light , starting with a short period each day. If you rooted the cuttings in a seed starter mix , you should start to feed them with a liquid fertilizer such as Miracle Grow. After another 2-3 weeks , the cuttings should be ready for transplant to their final home. However , fuchsias root so readily that you can usually avoid the need for transplant : start a window-box or hanging basket by just filling with soil , sticking in a few cuttings , covering with plastic cups , and waiting . </root.v.352><root.v.353>I can ' t believe a year after he ' s gone I ' m saying this , but I will never root for Keith Brooking again.

Maybe this year . </root.v.354><root.v.355>Straight from the river Jordan Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. You who have been baptized for service are almost certain to be led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted , just because God desires to do a mighty work in your soul. The oak , which is to live for a hundred years , must be rooted and moored to stand the storm , and God , wanting you to become a strong , sturdy oak , will most certainly lead you into temptations. Temptation is not sin if the temptation is resisted. The effect of being tempted is to root us more in Christ . </root.v.355><root.v.356>According to this theory , a celestial stem that is rooted in the month branch is stronger than the stem that is rooted in the time branch.

It was rooted in and living on " dust and roofing cinders. " Even more spectacular is a desert plant , Ibervillea sonorae a member of the gourd family that Joseph Wood Krutch describes. If you see this plant in the desert , you see only a dried chunk of loose wood. It has neither roots nor stems; it 's like an old gray knothole. But it is alive. Each year before the rainy season comes , it sends out a few roots and shoots. If the rain arrives , it grows flowers and fruits; these soon wither away , and it reverts to a state as quiet as driftwood . </root.v.358><root.v.359>Faith and trust work hand in hand. Be rooted in the Word. There is always a word applicable for the situation. Find it; dig down deep , planting yourself there. Let your roots grow deep through meditation and memorization. Growth will be abundant when planted in the Word. Be a faithful gardener; nourish the garden of your heart with My Word. Take captive all thoughts contrary to Mine. A positive outcome depends on the captivation of destructive thoughts. Your actions will be determined by your thought life. Root yourself in Me; refuse the lie , and accept the truth. Remember this : it all starts at the root . </root.v.359><root.v.360>Plant bulbs in the fall starting when nighttime temperatures stay between 40-50 F.

In fact , Yandex , which got its start in the late 1980s , long before Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page had even met , arguably has the superior search technology. Yandex 's search algorithm is rooted in the highly inflected and very peculiar Russian language. Words can take on some 20 different endings to indicate their relationship to one another , and " while this makes the language precise , " says MIT linguistics professor David Pesetsky , " it makes search extremely difficult. " Google fetches the exact word combination you enter into the search bar , leaving out the slightly different forms that mean similar things. Yandex has found a way to catch them all . </root.v.364><root.v.365>Strong roots stabilize our growth The Bible in Mark 4 : 6 narrates a story of a plant that withered. We read that it withered because it had a root problem , so it could not handle the hot rays of the sun. Now I believe it is for that reason the Apostle Paul prays for us Christians to be rooted and grounded , Ephesians 3 : 17. And he further urges us to be firmly rooted . . . built up . . . and established in our faith , Colossians 2 : 7. When we have strong roots our growth will be stabilized.

The Pharisees were those who took upon themselves to guide others in matters of religion. The Lord said of them : " Every planting ( literally ) which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up. " In other words it was just this : Everyone who dares to take the responsibility of giving guidance to others , who has not been commissioned of the Lord , with the Lord 's message , will be rooted up. They are self-planted teachers and leaders . </root.v.369><root.v.370>In this country it is curious that the radish is not often included in the early accounts of imported vegetables. " Raddish " is included in Ralph Hamor 's A true Discourse of the present State of Virginia ( 1615 ) and it was almost certainly an early introduction given its great popularity in England. By the 18th century it is represented as frequently and in greater variety than the carrot in the survey of Virginia references. The varieties listed in Virginia , in the 18th and early 19th century are very similar to those known in England. In Williamsburg , Randolph lists , in A Treatise on Gardening ( 1793 ) , the " Scarlet or Salmon , London short topped &amp;c.

In the opening lines , the speaker describes children waiting for their parents to give up , exhausted from their daily domestic duties. He presents parents as being beaten down and defeated , who have to force themselves to believe things about their lives and their futures merely to keep going. He also describes the relationship between the two as beset by miscommunication and concealment of information about how to survive in the world. In much of his poetry , Strand has sought to dismantle the myth of the family and to expose its more sinister qualities. Influenced by the writings of R. D. Laing , poems such as " The Dreadful Has Already Happened " and " My Life " show how the family acts to sap the life force from children , forcing them to conform to parental expectations. The children , in turn , become parents , who perpetuate the same acts on their offspring . </root.v.372><root.v.373>The relatively huge white blood cells can not get into a dentin tubule. Antibiotics ca n't gain access either. And the periodontal ligament access is difficult if not impossible. Debris from filling the canal spills out the end of the root , forming a good culture medium for bacteria , while providing a barrier for entrance into the canal. Anaerobic bacteria ( those living without oxygen ) , can inhibit phagocytosis of the white blood cells. Root canal bacterial waste products are the real problem. No white blood cell or antibiotic can destroy the chemicals that are produced by bacteria around the root canal treated tooth . </root.v.373><root.v.374>He says in one of his statements that man has been taught by religions to condemn sex , to renounce sex.

Those that don t can be encouraged to do so by dead-heading , watering and feeding. Many early flowering herbaceous plants produce new shoots from the base , which make ideal material for summer cuttings. Spreading types tend to produce new extension growth from existing shoots , which also can be used to make cuttings. In either case , each cutting needs to be 10-15cm long. A few mat-forming perennials , such as ajuga and low-growing campanulas [ Alan : any others ? ] , produce runners after flowering. These can be rooted in situ using a pot sunk rim-deep into the soil near the parent plant , or prepared as regular softwood cuttings. Trim the cutting just below a leaf joint and remove the lowest pair of leaves . </root.v.377><root.v.378>These are small single rooted teeth with a large root to crown ratio.

Plates of fried kingfish and cassava bread , acaraj , or bowlfuls of rich , silken textured butterbeans flavored with ham hocks and eaten with golden hunks of cornbread have all been important stops along the journey of food identity. Through my explorations of food , more than ever I feel less a motherless child and more a member of a strong , diverse , global cultural group rooted in rich , ancient tradition . </root.v.380><root.v.381>After the cuttings have produced a root system one to three inches long , transplant them from the bed or flat into a potting mixture. The time required to form an adequate root system depends upon the kind of plant and type of cutting. Most shrubs will root within three to six weeks. Leaving young plants in the rooting medium after rooting with little additional care will stunt them. If rooted plants can not be stepped up ( potted or moved to a new bed ) soon after rooting , apply a water soluble fertilizer at half the recommended rate. Water with this fertilizer solution every other week . </root.v.381><root.v.382>Development is not , as the policies of Western development agencies imply , a technocratic exercise in which poor countries import an inflexible formula devised in distant capitals. On the contrary , development is an organic process that slowly transforms how the members of a society work together. Although improvements in areas such as education and healthcare can better prepare individuals to participate in development , a country ' s ability to advance is crucially tied to its citizens ' ability to cooperate both among themselves and in partnership with the state in increasingly sophisticated ways. Development therefore needs to be firmly rooted in communities that possess strong social networks , durable shared loyalties , widely accepted institutions and deep reservoirs of social capital . </root.v.382><root.v.383>To awaken the Goddess in one 's life , one needs a form.

Cuttings that have rooted can , with a little practice , be recognized by their healthy , turgid appearance , which is quite different from the dull look of a cutting that has failed to root. Once the young plants arc fully rooted and are showing signs of new growth , they should be potted up before there is any check to growth , as this can seriously affect the future potential of the plant . </root.v.388><root.v.389>2. The pin-down or lay-down method : Before removing any shoots , separate them carefully. Choose three to six healthy , leaf-covered , bendable shoots. Remove all others and root , using the above method. Then returning to the original plant , select a shoot that is rooted near the center of the pot.

In the perspective of Deleuze and Guattari , we are being changed from " arborial " beings , rooted in time and space , to " rhizomic " nomads who daily wander at will ( whose will remains a question ) across the globe , and even beyond it through communication satellites , without necessarily moving our bodies at all.

The two houses were later joined together by a wooden passageway. The domestic premises soon became insufficient. A big house , across the street , was bought in 1906. It was the beginning of the actual Motherhouse at 314 C te Saint Catherine Road. The Foundress , a prudent and shrewd woman , also wanted to guarantee the social status of the young Congregation. On February 28 , 1907 , the legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec officially approved its incorporation under the name : Les Soeurs Missionnaires de l'Immacul e-Conception. The foundation became stronger and rooted in the Church and in civil society. The stem became evermore vigorous. At this point , the call to open up to the whole world came to the Congregation from Rome through Archbishop Bruch si : All mission countries are open to you. You are told now as once the apostles were : Go , teach all nations . </root.v.391><root.v.392>The name cloning simply stated means taking a cutting from a mature female plant in the vegetative stage and inducing it to grow roots. Clones will replicate the mother plant in every way ie : size , sex , colour , smell , taste etc. It is therefore crucial to have a mother plant of outstanding quality. The newly rooted cutting can be induced to flower immediately , or it can be put under a vegetative light cycle to attain a larger size . </root.v.392><root.v.393>They may look a little wrinkled but they are ready to grow.

In shallow soils , or with shallow rooted plants , such a schedule will distribute water well past the root zone , where it will be wasted.

In addition to the basic laws of physics , each agent follows three simple rules : ( 1 ) try to maintain a minimum distance from all other boids and objects , ( 2 ) try to match speed with neighboring boids , and ( 3 ) try to move toward the center of mass of the boids in your neighborhood. Remarkably , when the simulation is run , the boids exhibit the very life-like behavior of flying in flocks around the objects on the screen. They " flock , " a complex behavior pattern , even though there is no rule explicitly telling them to do so.9 While this does not prove that real birds use these simple rules , it does show that simple rules-minimum specifications-can lead to complex behaviors.

Other times it happens six or twelve months after sucker removal and yet before rooting. In either case , it poses a risk to the new caudex. It is generally agreed that there is a risk of desiccation and death of the caudex as the leaves lose water and the caudex has minimal ability to absorb water without roots.

Maintain the level of the water by adding additional water as needed ( do not change the water ) . As long as the water remains clear , the pit is not rotting. If the pit rots , discard it and start another pit. Small roots will initially start on the bottom side. The pit will eventually crack and the developing stem will be visible. When the stem reaches six inches , cut it back to three inches to promote growth of a bushy , leafy plant.

You can also use pots of perlite set in a shallow tray of water. If you use any of these methods , don ' t cover the container since the cuttings will usually rot with all that water if covered.

Most of the plants will root from partial leaf cuttings which is a leaf cut into sections and rooted. The draw back to this method is , if the plant is a sport ( genetic variation ) it will revert back to its parent plant. I have rooted Futura and Golden Snake plant from partial leaf cuttings and they both have reverted back to S. trifasciata. I have rooted S. trifascita and S. cylindica and they have come true from the partial leaf cutting . </root.v.489><root.v.490>Apply a two inch layer of hardwood bark mulch around the base of the plant. Azaleas and rhododendrons are shallow rooted and need a heavy mulch to conserve moisture around the roots and reduce potential winter damage. Do not disturb the root system by cultivating the soil , this will destroy the small feeder roots. Planting annual flowers in azaleas is not recommended because of the damage incurred during planting. Keep the mulch around the plants all the time. This will improve the overall quality of the plant plus it will reduce potential lawn mower damage . </root.v.490><root.v.491>Psychology is rooted in human wisdom , the teachings of the Bible are God 's wisdom. Psychology is self-centered , Biblical counseling is God-centered. Psychology is self-saving , the Bible teaches that Christ Jesus is both our eternal Saviour and our present Deliverer. Much of psychological theory places blame for our sinful behavior on past experiences , Christianity tells us we are responsible for our own sin. Psychology provides that we can be healed of our hurts working through our pasts. God urges us to put the past behind us and put our hands to the plows , relying on Him to heal the hurts and character flaws that lead to wrong behavior. Psychology stresses self-nurture and supports self-indulgence , while the Bible places emphasis on dying to ourselves , and taking up our crosses. If the root or the seed is of one kind , how can we expect the fruit of the other kind ? Can Christianity be " improved " by anything from modern psychology ? Do people pick grapes from thornbushes , or figs from thistles ? Likewise every good tree bears good fruit , but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree can not bear bad fruit , and a bad tree can not bear good fruit.

( Later , when they have grown to at least double the size of the pot , add cup Epsom salts. ) Fill with water and let stand for four or five days. For rooted cuttings attach a siphon line to the hose and water the plants as often as the soil begins to dry out. The siphon line mixes the mild fertilizer mixture with water at a 16 to 1 ratio , making it just right for the new plants. Later , when they become much larger or are planted in the ground , a coffee can could be used as a scoop ' to apply the fertilizer directly to each bush , one scoop to a bush . </root.v.492><root.v.493>For uniform quality , it is important to start with cuttings of the same length , caliper and maturity. Cuttings of different sizes and maturity will root and grow differently. Most poinsettia cultivars root best when harvested about 6 weeks after the last pinch on the stock plants. A few cultivars root best if taken a week earlier ( Eckespoint Lilo Red and colors , Jolly Red ) or a week later ( Eckespoint Jingle Bells 3 , Lemon Drop ) . A 2-3 " cutting works well for most finished products. When taking cuttings , avoid tearing or bruising cut ends. If purchasing cuttings , try to avoid re-cutting the ends as this will open fresh wounds and increase the risk of disease. Each cutting should have 2-3 mature leaves. When sticking the cuttings , only remove those leaves that would be in the rooting medium. For best results , plant no more than 12 cuttings per square foot and arrange the large leaves between the rows so that they do not cover the cutting apexes . </root.v.493><root.v.494>Community is like a trampoline. It can help shoot an artist higher as well as soften the blow of falling ( and indeed help turn that falling into rising again ) . Community indeed helps bring satisfaction to creativity. Part of the joy of creation is sharing that with others. I believe it is a lie to create art for art  s sake. Art must be rooted in people and place; it can not exist in a vacuum. In community , you  re not creating art for art  s sake , but instead for each other. If you don  t make a big splash , there is still contentment in creation that can be shared with others. Even the most insular person desires to share their art ( yes , even shut-in Emily Dickinson ) and a community is the best place to do it . </root.v.494><root.v.495>Generally the old style frame was planted with rooted succulents. In the new style , I plant cuttings and grow them in about 12 weeks. Using cuttings means that you have to plan further ahead and either plant in the prime growing season when the roots grow best , or you have to have a green house giving you an extended growing season. While the old style planted with rooted cuttings gave you a pretty instant planted frame , I have always felt the newer style looked much better in the long run . </root.v.495><root.v.496>Quicksand : Weakens the ground , sucking down those in its Area of Effect and slowing their movement speed.

Expect best results from cuttings of many deciduous plants taken from late fall to early winter before enough cold weather occurs to complete the rest requirements of the leaf buds. This allows the cutting to be rooted under warm conditions without development of leaves. After rooting has started , however , the cuttings must be subjected to cold temperatures according to individual plant requirements. Some deciduous plants only can be rooted from leafy softwood or semi-hardwood cuttings taken during the growing season. Others root readily almost any time of the year . </root.v.497><root.v.498>The only curative action to be taken is to elect anti-CFR candidate Ron Paul as president in 2008.

The virtue of mudita may be best noticed at work in the joy of parents over the success of their offspring , and in the genuine ecstasy of teachers over the success of their pupils , particularly in the latter situation when the threat of the younger eclipsing the older is always imminent. While it is easy to practice mudita within the narrow circle of one 's family and friends , to identify oneself with the joys and triumphs of outsiders requires deliberate effort. Yet the capacity for doing so is rooted in man 's nature. Smiling faces of adults make children respond readily with their own smiles. This potential in the child should be nurtured and activated by parents and educationists. For the seed of mudita planted early in a child will grow and blossom and bear fruit in his adolescence and in his adult life. To some extent , man is a product of his environment with this in mind , adults , parents , teachers and wardens who handle children should be of a cheerful disposition and an appreciative nature . </root.v.499><root.v.500>The interna ideo principle is strongly rooted in the Esperanto movement , and characterizes most Esperantist groups and gatherings.

This combination works well for plant roots , ease of vacuuming the top layer ONLY ( where plant roots are ) , and for better bio filtration. The total depth of sand , plant substrate or any combination there of should be about 3-5 inches for most rooted aquarium plants . </root.v.501><root.v.502>Another amazing thing about this variant is that it roots easily from cuttings , with an 80 to 90 success rate. The cuttings root in two to three weeks and exhibit the same traits as the parents. Live sphagnum works best as a rooting medium. When well rooted , the plants prefer to be moved into a half sand/half peat mix. They like a medium that is wet , but not oversaturated.

That " knowledge of root systems is the basis of agriculture " should be given more than casual consideration. It may be found practicable , especially in semiarid regions , to grow short-rooted and densely rooted crops alternately with those of longer and more spreading root systems. European investigators have emphasized the fact that crop rotations should be made with reference to root change. In the semiarid regions of Russia , which , in many ways , are similar to our Great Plains , definite rotations involving this principle have been worked out. For example , deeply rooted and densely rooted winter wheat or rye is followed by the more meager- and shallow-rooted potato crop , and this by barley or oats , which , in turn , is succeeded by the shallower and more poorly rooted flax. This is considered to be an effective means for contending against drought , since it averts the perennial drying up of the root-inhabited soil layer. 164 </root.v.508><root.v.509>Single eye divisions ( 1 offset ) of hosta are typically planted in the field or potted in spring and grown until fall , when they are divided. Large divisions are usually sold and small divisions replanted the following spring. This cycle usually yields relatively low plant numbers per division. Treatment of mother plants with BA can stimulate more rapid offset formation. Offsets can be removed as stem cuttings prior to root formation and rooted under intermittent mist , provided there is sufficient leaf development. This strategy should result in more rapid multiplication of hosta than the traditional system of annual division . </root.v.509><root.v.510>The Plumeria is a very hardy plant and requires but little care. If you have frosty winters , bring it indoors. Leaves will appear the first year and the blossoms should be out in the second. Each year they will shed their leaves and new healthy ones will re-appear. The size of the container will control the size of the plant. Here in Hawaii it will grow up to 20ft in height. Use Super thrive to water the cuttings , which should be kept on the dry side in light shade. Plant the cuttings in a 3-inch hole in potting mix. The roots will have to come from the bottom of the cutting , so planting too deeply is not advised. In a month your plant should be rooted. It will root better with bottom heat or warm surroundings. The pot should be about 4 - 6 inches wide and 4 - 6 inches deep with good drainage.

By contrast , roots formed in a solid medium are thick and strong , meaning that the newly-potted plant undergoes little or no transplant shock. I have found that perlite yields the best results of all rooting media , being light , sterile , moisture-retentive , and quick-draining.

Specimen baskets should be started the beginning of February. Compact baskets should be started the end of February. If three and five cuttings are used for the 10- and 12-inch pots , respectively , start plants an additional three to four weeks earlier. Alternatively , if more than the recommended cutting numbers are used , plants can be started later. If selling ivy geraniums as a 4-inch potted crop , pot rooted cuttings in mid-March and apply Florel , rather than pinching , to promote branching.

Avoid northern slopes and low ground since these will be cooler throughout the growing season , delaying ripening of the fruit. If the grower is able and willing , they can develop vines from cuttings or trench layering. Growers generally use layering if only a few plants are needed. Lay the cane flat in the trench , and cover at least two buds with soil. Cut off the tip , leaving two buds above the soil. Canes usually root well and can be cut from the parent , dug and transplanted the following spring. An alternative to trenching is to lay down a sheet of black plastic. Cut holes in the plastic where you want to plant. Push cuttings through the holes and firm the soil. The plastic heats the soil and prevents competition with weeds. You ' ll need a soaker hose beneath the plastic to water the plants . </root.v.525><root.v.526>Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were initiated when all patches of heterogeneous and homogeneous environments had been colonized by rooted ramets. Every week during the last 3 months of the experiment , chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured with a portable pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer ( MINI-PAM photosynthesis yield analyser; Walz GmbH , Effeltrich , Germany ) by the saturation pulse method ( see Schreiber et al. , 1998 ) . Measuring light and saturating light pulses ( &gt; 4000 mol photons m2 s1 , 0 8 s pulse length ) were applied through optical fibres at an angle of 60 and 12 mm distance from the leaf ( Halogen Lamp 8V/20W , Bellaphot; Osram , Munich , Germany ) . </root.v.526><root.v.527>Grow plants , such as geraniums , honeysuckle and ivy , from stem cuttings.

On the contrary , the value of this work as an interpretation of historical events is enhanced by the fact that the author 's commitments are made so clear and explicit. But I think it can be shown that Jackson 's account of the popular revolution that took place in Spain is misleading and in part quite unfair , and that the failure of objectivity it reveals is highly significant in that it is characteristic of the attitude taken by liberal ( and Communist ) intellectuals toward revolutionary movements that are largely spontaneous and only loosely organized , while rooted in deeply felt needs and ideals of dispossessed masses. It is a convention of scholarship that the use of such terms as those of the preceding phrase demonstrates naivet and muddle-headed sentimentality. The convention , however , is supported by ideological conviction rather than history or investigation of the phenomena of social life. This conviction is , I think , belied by such events as the revolution that swept over much of Spain in the summer of 1936 . </root.v.528><root.v.529>But we will root out those who committed these atrocities.

The numerous hybrids and species of achimenes comprise a race of extremely decorative plants. Neatly staked , they are charming in pots , and their semi pendant habit makes them particularly adaptable for planting in hanging baskets. Although achimenes will endure a cool greenhouse temperature during the flowering period , a minimum reading of 60 degrees. must be maintained before that time. It is advisable to start the tubers at intervals of three weeks , commencing in February , by boxing them in sandy compost and watering sparingly until the shoots are about 2 in. in height. Then they must be carefully moved to 7 inch or 8 inch pots , placing the tubers 2 to 3 inches apart each way. Baskets should first of all be lined with moss and then filled in with a good compost of equal parts fibrous loam , leaf mould , and peat with a liberal sprinkling of sharp sand. Roots should be inserted so that the growths will push through the wires in addition to trailing over the top of the basket. A moist growing atmosphere must be maintained and the plants kept close to the glass but shaded from bright sunshine . </root.v.534><root.v.535>In modern physics , singularities exist at the level of Planckian units , where measurement becomes indefinable because of the uncertainty principle of quantum theory.

Fascists reject atomism and individualism , in other words , and subscribed to an organic view of society. The individual on his or her own can accomplish nothing of great significance , they said. It is only when the individual dedicates his or her life to the nation-state , sacrificing everything to its glory , that the individual finds true fulfillment. [ Fascism in Italy 199 ] The Italian fascists also stressed the value of the state , which they saw as the legal and institutional embodiment of the power , the unity , and the majesty of the nation. To be dedicated to the service of the nation was thus to be dedicated to the state-and to its great and glorious leader , Il Duce The state was to control everything , and everyone was to serve the state.

It is helpful to note what Orlando Esp n , others and I have noted about the late application in the Spanish colonies of the Council of Trent 's standardizing norms. That fact helps explain the basically medieval , pre-Columbian and baroque spirit of Latino religion. It took root before the " modern " standardizations of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. What that means is that Latino Catholicism continues to be deeply rooted in its inspiration and somewhat intractable. This point could engage and nuance De Luna 's treatment of mestizo spirituality and its aesthetic rather than doctrinal or moral orientation. All in all , this work is an important contribution to a wider and more solid appreciation of the challenges facing religious educators in the task of forming tomorrow 's Catholic leaders , who in the majority will be Latino/Latinas. -- Allan Figueroa Deck , S.J . </root.v.545><root.v.546>Place the pots where humidity is high.

Although many cuttings will root in water , better results can be obtained by starting cuttings in moist vermiculite. Plants that are somewhat difficult to root also have a better chance in a forsythe pot. They are less likely to rot and once rooted , will make the transition to potting soil in better condition. For best results , be sure to start this project with fresh , new vermiculite and clean , new pots.

As I said , both the caudiciform twin-spined types , such as E. tortirama , and the medusa types will root from stem cuttings , but generally the cuttings just elongate instead of developing into a typical plant. In addition to chopping them off and then rooting the multi-stemmed offsets that may develop from the cut , given time the snake-like branch propagations ( particularly of the medusa types ) often produce multi-stemmed secondary heads on their own , and these can be detached , dried off and rooted , and will grow into normal adult plants. It ' s possible , though not as reliable , to do this with the caudiciforms as well ( with a bit of luck ) , and E. knuthii , which is a sort of caudiciform , will make perfectly normal plants from a stem cutting without additional effort. As always , when cutting euphorbias , be careful about the sap , wash your hands religiously after working with them , and avoid contact with your eyes , nose or mouth.

Auxins are compounds that occur naturally in plants. Some have been synthetically produced and are available to plant propagators. They increase the rooting percentage of many hard-to-root plants. They also may shorten the time for rooting and improve root quality and quantity. Cuttings of most plants will benefit from the use of auxins , although some hardwood cuttings from deciduous plants may show little effect.

Vine weight was best for the plants in the Vergro potting medium regardless of potassium treatment ( Table 1 ) . Cuttings removed at this time were rated for top grade after four weeks and showed no significant differences based on either the potting medium or potassium treatment. Vines were again trimmed on 23 October and at this time the vine weight showed an interactive effect of the potting medium and the potassium treatment with a dramatic growth reduction for the plants in the 1 : 1 medium which were not receiving potassium.

The creation and fall of Adam comes in chapter 2 and essentially describes the creation of the Hebrew tribe. The old testament is a chronology of the development of the Hebrew nation and the new testament is a continuation of this. Therefore Christians are , in a sense , subscribers to the Semitic lineage. ) The Pagan Gods and Goddesses were really made in our image which is the other way round. Pagan deities are images or symbols of deep rooted memories which Jung called archetypes.

The medium in which the cuttings were rooted will be almost inert. Leave using small pots until later in the season and use seed trays , large 36cm X 22cm or small 22cm X 18cm. depending on the number of cuttings to be boxed up. Prepare the seed trays by filling them with fresh soil-less potting compost that is damp but not wet and add a liberal amount of perlite , shap granite or sharp sand to aid root deflection.

Rows of holes are made in the rooting medium with a tapered stick , slightly larger in diameter than the cutting , leaving at least 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) between each hole. The cuttings are removed from the water , the end to be rooted treated with growth regulators and fungicides ( such as Rootone F or Hormex ) , and each cutting placed in its hole. The cut end of the shoot is kept at least 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) from the bottom of the medium. The rooting medium is lightly tamped around the cutting , taking care not to scrape off the growth regulators. During the first few days the cuttings are checked frequently to make sure every thing is working properly. The cuttings are then watered with a mild nutrient solution once a day . </root.v.587><root.v.588>For you , this can well be the first time that learning about a technology will not only be useful , it will be used.

Tillich would have considered it a compliment to say that he succeeded in making the deepest thoughts and feelings accessible to understanding. Of course , Hannah 's comment was not meant to be complimentary. She was referring to the tragedy of Midas , suggesting exactly what many of Tillich 's theological opponents have charged : that he transformed life itself into an abstraction; that he turned the reality of God into the deadly gold of fanciful theory . </root.v.590><root.v.591>Proverbs 30 : 17 The eye which makes sport of a father , and sees no value in a mother when she is old will be rooted out by the ravens of the valley , and be food for the young eagles.

The sutra says further : " The one who sees me by the form and seeks me by the sound can not perceive the Tathagata because of deluded views. " It is to be understood as saying that the one who perceives the form ( or body ) and the sound or voice as the Buddha is grasping merely the form. Missing the true meaning of reality he/she is unable to perceive that all dharmas are voidness. Says the sutra further : " A bodhisattva that ( still ) clings to the false notion of an ego , a personality , a being and a life , is not a bodhisattva " . Bodhisattvas , same as the buddhas , establish themselves in Emptiness , apprehending their ego , personality , being and life as false views rooted in duality. " The one who hears this pure teaching with a clear and faithful mind can attain the really real , the reality that is formless; those freed from all forms are called buddhas " continues the sutra . </root.v.592><root.v.593>There is no better brief introduction to the theology of Martin Luther than the preface to his translation of Paul 's Epistle to the Romans.

Further , with light and humidity and warm temperatures , the shoot ripens , induces new buds , which eventually convert into flower buds. However , be aware : This all can happen without any root formation ! Thus it is very difficult to judge whether or not the cutting is rooted and can be taken out of the propagator box. With Sphagnum moss as the substrate , you can lift the plant , and rooting is easily recognized. With more denser substrates , you should wait until root tips occur at the bottom holes of the pot. If they do not show up within 6 to 9 months , or if the buds turn brown , discard the cutting . </root.v.595><root.v.596>Usually Passiflora caerulea gets through the winter without much harm.

The Meiji government was initially involved in economic modernization , providing a number of " model factories " to facilitate the transition to the modern period. After the first two decades of the Meiji period , the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. Stimulated by wars and through cautious economic planning , Japan emerged from World War I as a major industrial nation. Its mercantilist path led it to the quest of empire in the British fashion. After World War II , General Douglas MacArthur turned Japan into an export dynamo in the service of the United States in the context of the Cold War. This role became obsolete after the end of the Cold War. The current economic crisis in Japan is rooted in issues much deeper than Western economists have identified . </root.v.604><root.v.605>I rooted mine erect with no problems but many do root lying down.

As a person or nation more fully applies the principles of Christianity , there will be increasing freedom in every realm of life. Sanctification for a person , or nation , is a gradual process. The fruit of changed thinking and action , which comes from rooting sin out of our lives , may take time to see.

As such , the Bolshevik aim for party power helped undermine the real power of working class people during the Russian revolution. Rooted in a deeply anti-democratic political tradition , it was ideologically predisposed to substitute party power for soviet power and , finally , to create -- and justify -- the dictatorship over the proletariat. The civil war may have shaped certain aspects of these authoritarian tendencies but it did not create them . </root.v.608><root.v.609>The rooting of eucalyptus selections is practiced commercially on a large scale in forestry. The basic techniques are well understood. The majority of selections are from hybrids of certain sub-tropical and tropical species , though selections of temperate species such as E. globulus are also propagated by cuttings. It is very apparent from all this work that there is great variation in rooting ability between selections within species or hybrid taxa , and between different species. This is genetically determined. The speed with which cuttings initiate roots also influences rooting success; this is influenced both by genetics and by the procedures used . </root.v.609><root.v.610>1.

Religion and spirituality are firmly rooted in the minds of the Indian people. Some countries are well known for their political institutions , others for their economic prosperity while some others for their social advancement. India is well known for her philosophy and religion. According to Max Muller the study of religion is incomplete unless it is studied with reference to India. To quote him , " Take religion and where can you study its true origin , its natural growth , and its inevitable decay better than in India , the home of Brahmanism , the birth place of Buddhism and the refuge of zoroastrianism even now the matter of new superstitions - and why not , in the future the regenerate child of the purest faith , if only purified from the dust of nineteen centuries ? " ( 1 ) . To others , Religion is one condition among so many other countries , but to the Indian people it is one great sustaining force , pertaining to all the spheres of their lives.

Pinch a length of stem from a plant and remove any leaves that would be under water ( to keep them from rotting ) . The pinched end will be the rooting end. Keep the cutting covered with water and , over time , roots will begin to developusually where leaves were present. After roots grow to two or three inches , the new plant can be placed in a pot ready for a new start . </root.v.616><root.v.617>Tip cuttings come from the end of a stem and have growing points at their tips. They can come from the top of a plant or from vigorous side shoots and should be 5-6 inches long. Tip cuttings will generally have a single stem when rooted unless the top is pinched out. Sectional cuttings are taken from the middle of the stem and therefore have a cut at each end. Sectional cuttings should have one or more nodes and will produce a bushy plant with growth occurring as side shoots. A basal cutting is a whole side shoot up to 6 inches long that is cut close to where it branches from the main stem. Because a basal cutting is usually younger than the main stem , it usually roots more readily. The growth habit is the same as a tip cutting. A heel cutting is a basal cutting with some of the main stem attached. It frequently roots more readily than even a basal cutting because of the presence of cambial tissue from the main stem. You may have a heel cutting from the stripping of side shoots at the bottom of a tip or sectional cutting . </root.v.617><root.v.618>If a man is not rooted and grounded in the knowledge of self , he never can be rooted and grounded in a knowledge of Christ as a Savior : " The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost " ( Luke 19 : 10 ) . Therefore if a person does not know himself lost , nor groan , nor sigh on account of being lost , all that Jesus is , and all that Jesus has for poor lost sinners is hidden from his eyes.

They will grow from leaves. Make sure to start cuttings early because they have to have enough time to form a new bulb before they go dormant in the fall. You can try rooting them under lights later in the year and growing them through the winter indoors. This will work with some varieties. Semi tuberous do not have to form a bulb and do n't go dormant so you do n't have to worry about starting them so early. These are usually only started from stem cuttings because they have so many stems that leaf cuttings are n't neccessary . </root.v.620><root.v.621>Now thankfully , the annual weeds such as Shepard ' s Purse and Chickweed are relatively shallow rooted which makes them easy to pull up , hoe off , or dig out.

Under standard aquarium lighting it will grow so well that you will have to thin it out every couple of weeks. Najas Grass works well in taller aquaria as you can still have other plants growing under it. Keep in mind , though , that rooted or bunch plants in the same aquarium will have to have lower light requirements than the Najas Grass because it will block some of the light from getting to the submerged plants in the aquarium.

John 15 reflects this need to have strong roots : in our case , strong roots in Christ. Christ describes himself as the vine : " Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit , because apart from me you can do nothing " ( John 15 : 5 ) . We can do nothing , we can bear no fruit , unless we are strongly rooted in Christ. The reciprocity implied in our acceptance of the word ( as noted above ) is reflected in this verse : the need for us to actively accept the word is as vital as the need for God to communicate his creative force , his word , to us. He does this through Christ , the manifestation of this word in our world. Being rooted in Christ is our means of becoming able to accept the creative force of God.

Yin and yang means that you are able to move forward , backward , yielding accordingly. If you do n't have that kind of ability , " if you do n't know how to yield beautifully , turning on the waist , shifting the weight " you just freeze.

The young plants may be planted in the open after 6 months. It may be propagated easily by cuttings of half-ripened growth. These should be about 6 inches long; they will root easily in sand and do not require bottom heat. The vines may eventually overgrow and tangle themselves.

They will begin to form roots at very cool temperatures , as long as moisture is adequate.When it is warmer , you can move the pots outside or transplant the rooted mass ( with its emerging shoot ) like a big " seedling plug " right into the garden . </root.v.647><root.v.648>Growth Habit : Gooseberries are deciduous shrubs , fast growing under optimum conditions to 3 feet tall and 6 feet wide. The plant is suitable for training as a standard. American types have weeping stems that will root wherever they touch the ground and can be invasive. Annual growth is in a single flush in spring. The roots are superficial , fine and easily damaged by frequent cultivation . </root.v.648><root.v.649>Plant cuttings will root much faster and with more success if they are kept warm. I use a heating mat that maintains a constant and even temperature of 70F. When the pot or propagation unit sits on this mat , the soil in the container heats up to 70F and rooting is fairly quick and easy for softwood cuttings . </root.v.649><root.v.650>A closeup view of developed nodes show carrot-like tap roots and rootlets ( bottom ) , knobby crown ( center ) , and green or brown vines ( top ) .

Sphagnum moss , sand , and vermic-ulite are ideal for rooting cuttings. As they contain no nutrients , material rooted in them should be shifted as soon as possible to regular growing soil. If you can not shift plants right away , feed them with a weak solution of liquid fertilizer , to prevent spindly growth . </root.v.651><root.v.652>Rooting MediaThe potting soil , or medium in which a plant grows , must be of good quality. It should be porous for root aeration and drainage , but also capable of water and nutrient retention. In order for a plant to form a new root system , it must have a ready moisture supply at the cut surface. Oxygen , of course , is required for all living cells. The coarse-textured media choices often meet these requirements. Most commercially prepared mixes are termed artificial , which means they contain no soil. The basic ingredients of such a mix are sphagnum peat moss and vermiculite , both of which are generally free of diseases , weed seeds , and insects . </root.v.652><root.v.653>Whilst on the subject of propagating , I always carry on a test programme , testing all manner of things , from plant foods , insecticides , fungicides , to light and its effect on cuttings etc. The testing of these items will be explained later , but relevant at this time is the use of rooting aids. All the literature I read and nearly all the specialist speakers I listened to , advocated the use of rooting aids which I faithfully used. In an effort to understand more fully the benefit of using these aids , I decided to run a test programme to test their effectiveness on fuchsias.

It allows for propagation of new plants with minimal disruption to the mother plant. Layering also gives you a larger new plant than you might get from a rooted cutting , because the stem being rooted can be allowed to hold onto more leaves than it could support if it were severed from its parent. Best of all , you don ' t need a greenhouse to expect close to 100 percent success with layering . </root.v.656><root.v.657>And yet , this has not happened.

You can purchase plantpak 40 's which are 40 thin plastic disposable cells to fit one full sized seed tray. I also use the commercial types which are usually 84 cells in each free standing re-usable unit. Be aware however when using cells that the watering technique has to be correct , every cell is effectively it 's own little pot and the roots therefore are incapable of gaining moisture or nutrients from an adjoining cell . </root.v.662><root.v.663>The reading from John ' s Gospel for the Sixth Sunday of Easter is the continuation of and a commentary on the allegory of the vine in John 15 : 1-8.

It would indeed be strange to believe that sin , so hateful to God , caused death , and yet believe that sin should be permitted to continue. It would be very strange that what was previously the object of destroying vengeance should now become the object of toleration. Now that the penalty is removed , do you think it is possible that the unchangeable God has given up His aversion to sin so that ruined and redeemed man may now indulge , under the new arrangement , in that which under the old destroyed him ? Does not the God who loved righteousness and hated iniquity six thousand years ago still love righteousness and hate iniquity ? </root.v.666><root.v.667>Recently , in this area , some people have begun to think that the traditional method of planting encourages root growth downward when the natural tendency for root growth is generally outward , closer to the ground surface. The January , 1990 , issue of the Potomac Rose Society Newsletter carries an article on the point as well as an earlier article in the August , 1989 , Colonial Courier. The limited experimentations suggests that placing the roots of bare rooted plants more horizontally , nearer the ground surface , rather than encouraging them downward around the center-mound , results in more vigorous plant growth and bloom production. I have thought , primarily because of the way roses are planted in England , that we put too much emphasis on depth of planting , knowing all the while that feeder roots are found near the surface. It is interest to note the following from the handbook , How To Grow Roses , </root.v.667><root.v.668>The child remains in the heart only up to the moment that thoughts crystalize , that thoughts start floating in his mind.

Jing has a direct relationship with reproduction , and thus with sexuality. Jing is regarded as being the root of our existence and is the root of the existence of the species as well. Strong Jing will generate strong sexual function , while a deficiency of Jing will result in a weakening of the sexual functions and in the weakening of the body and mind , leading eventually to aging and to death. Thus sexuality and longevity are intimately connected from the Chinese philosophical point of view and in the Chinese way of life. In the Chinese view , it is the goal of all healthful activities to preserve the Original Jing , to replace the Jing that is spent , and to increase the Jing that is stored within the body whenever possible. That is the secret to longevity and to radiant health . </root.v.675><root.v.676>In our time , the number of wars between States has diminished.

Al Qaeda 's war against 'the Zionist-Crusader Alliance ' and the anti-Zionist rants of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran also display a blend of anti-Semitic themes rooted in Nazi and fascist , as well as Islamist , traditions.

As you approach the top with layers of soil and circling rope its time to put your rooted cutting or small plant in now. Once its in , keep spiraling the rope up to the top of the soil. Once the soil is level with the soil you transplanted in with the plant take the rope and circle it around the stem of the plant so it is flat with the top of the soil.

Not the theory of the socialists ( labor versus capital ) or of the liberals and conservatives ( ad hoc identity politics adjusted to appeal to society ' s phobias du jour ) , but rather the theory of the productive class ( those who make their living through work and voluntary exchange and cooperation ) versus the political class ( those who siphon off as much of that productive activity as they can get away with , using the coercive apparatus of the state , for their own ends ) . </root.v.713><root.v.714>Forget trying to preserve the bridal bouquet -- braid your blood lines together with a live family tree.

Crabgrass leaves are rolled in the bud; the first leaf appears short , wide and blunt-tipped. The ligule is tall and membranous with jagged edges , and the auricles are absent. The collar is broad with long hairs. Crabgrass is light green in color , coarse bladed and will root at the nodes when they touch the ground. A single crabgrass plant can produce up to 700 tillers. It is a bunch type grass. The inflorescence is a panicle of branches , with spikelets in two rows. A crabgrass plant can produce 150 , 000 seeds.

In the biblical account the " jealous " deities ( elohim ) -- usually translated " the Lord God " -- when the humans had eaten of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , feared " lest he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever.

Spring temperatures are usually moderate , and spring showers are great for sod. It is nice to install sod in the spring before the heat of the summer , but just be aware that if the summer gets dry ( as it has the last few years ) you will need to water your lawn even after it has gotten established to keep it healthy. Winter is a good time to install sod since there are no stresses on the sod due to heat and we usually receive precipitation throughout the season. The sod will root more slowly in the winter , but it should be well established by spring . </root.v.729><root.v.730>A : It is very doubtful that your carefully carried cuttings will root properly , but you could try. Re-cut the ends , strip the lower foliage and dip them in a rooting hormone. Plant them in individual pots of sterile soil , and place the pots in a plastic bag to retain humidity.

The plant takes root from the stolons at nodes along the stems when they come in contact with the soil. The white clover plant has compound leaves divided into three leaflets which are all joined at a central point and originate at the nodes along the stems. Leaves may contain a white 'watermark'. White clover is adapted to many soils but tends to grow best in soils that are moist and low in nitrogen. The flowers are an aggregate of 20 - 40 individual flowers. They are white in color , although some have a slight pink tint.

Sustainable development must be socially responsible , economically viable , and ecologically sound. Many rural communities have become so preoccupied with raising economic capital that they have allowed the social and ecological capital of their communities to become depleted. Economic development is rooted in social and ecological resources. Thus , economic development can not be sustainable without social and ecological development. Our fourth principle was : Building community while creating wealth and caring for the land. </root.v.734><root.v.735>If you plant your trees in a larger pot , you must wait until the trees are fully rooted in the pot before removing them. If you were to attempt to remove the trees from the pots prematurely the root balls might crumble and the tender roots would crumble away as well damaging the tree. The root ball must stay intact upon removal to prevent damage to the root system. If you plant trees in a larger pot in fall they will probably not be sufficiently rooted to remove from the pots by spring . </root.v.735><root.v.736>14. Juniperus sabina 'Broadmoor ' L.

Then we stick the cutting into the rockwool plug. The growing tray for the cuttings must then be saturated for 3 or 4 days with nutrient solution. Good hygiene is very important when getting cannabis cuttings to root. Work as clean as possible. Always clean your scissors , knife and growing trays with a medical disinfectant ( i.e. Dettol ) after you 've used them. Check the clones daily for possible rotting parts. Rotting leaves or stems must always be removed , so that moulds wo n't get a chance. It 's also important not to put the clone tray in a bed of water. That makes rooting more troublesome , and the roots will be of less quality. Also , a too wet clone tray causes root rots such as pythium afungus on the roots . </root.v.739><root.v.740>Celery may be harvested and stored directly in trenches that are dug for that purpose.

Less attention has been given to breeding for tolerance against pests such as nematodes , arthropods or weeds that likely involve multigenic traits. Could strawberry plants , for example , be bred to resist weeds ? Matted row plantings are established with few plants per hectare , relying on stolon formation to generate the appropriate density during the establishment year. However , such a system leaves a high percentage of soil exposed to sunlight and an opportunity for weeds to establish early. Strawberry roots typically are shallow , and plants do not compete well with weeds. A strawberry plant resistant to weeds might have rapid and deep rooting , rapid leaf expansion , and few stolons to facilitate a higher density planting. Weeds might have a more difficult time establishing themselves in such a planting , relative to the standard perennial matted row. Similarly , plants with vigorous root systems may be more tolerant to sublethal levels of root pathogens. Methods of identifying weed-tolerant or vigorously rooting genotypes must be developed before breeders can be expected to broaden their breeding objectives . </root.v.746><root.v.747>I will also carry fully rooted cuttings.

This Pauline church joined in the general anti-Jewish attitudes of the Empire following the Jewish Revolts of 66 CE and 135 CE. The anti-Jewish tone of much of the New Testament can be traced to this disassociation of the Pauline Christians from Judaism and the desire to appease the Roman authorities as to the loyalty of the Christians to the State.

There was a certain human race thousands of years ago when there was no intellectual development , no mental development , no evolution , leave alone spiritual development. These beings therefore lived in a state of one hundred per cent body consciousness only , just as the animals live. The animal level of consciousness is totally identified with the body. And if man 's consciousness is predominantly on the level of the animal consciousness , he is far from spiritual evolution , and all tall talk about Yoga , sadhana , samadhi , Super-consciousness or Ecstasy is only talk. It is so much of ideasso much of words. If you have a good command of words you can talk about these ideas , you can give expression to them. But , if you are always rooted and caught in the net and coils of a gross physical awareness only , and your whole reaction to the outer world of physical things is also upon the physical biological level , then there is a great deal of spade-work to do . </root.v.780><root.v.781>The Lord must have something which can not be carried away , which can not be removed , can not be shaken , and certainly something which can not be rooted up. That is His remnant. That , He must have for His own glory , and , that being so , He will take every measure with His remnant to have them after that kind , with roots downward. Of course , unto fruit upward. We speak much about the upward side of things , life in the heavenlies , sitting in the heavenlies , and our warfare and work the fruitfulness of our life in union with the Lord. That is only possible as our roots are downward. In order that that might be so , we have to get into a place of unshakeableness where the roots have got such a grip that nothing can overthrow. And I believe that explains a very great deal of what the Lord is doing with His own spiritual people in these days . </root.v.781><root.v.782>This chapter explains the very important task of how to water un-rooted and freshly rooted cuttings and seeds; this in itself is one of the most important things in plant propagation.

These seedlings are from our 1985 Korean expedition - a population growing on the beach at high tide line - so will be very salt and drought tolerant. The plant forms a procumbent shrub reaching 1-2 ' in height with time with semi-evergreen foliage ( evergreen on the coast , deciduous in the mountains ) . An excellent groundcover plant for large areas like highway banks , soil erosion control , et. as it roots from the stems as it grows - also very disease resistant.

I used to believe that myself. But there is a problem with this way of thinking , too. The traditional governments and laws we hold out as the pure good alternatives to the imposed colonial systems were developed at a time when people were different than we are now; they were people who were confidently rooted in their culture , bodily and spiritually strong , and capable of surviving independently in their natural environments. We should ask ourselves if it makes any sense to try to bring back these forms of government and social organization without first regenerating our people so that we can support traditional government models. Regretfully , the levels of participation in social and political life , the physical fitness , and the cultural skills these models require are far beyond our weakened and dispirited people right now . </root.v.785><root.v.786>It ' s very common in Italian cooking to either grill radicchio or saute it in olive oil.

Not the new craze for sous vide , which requires vacuum packing and slow cooking ( it ' s not a new idea I grew up with boil-in-the-bag meals , it ' s just a lower temperature and longer cooking of the same thing , to produce a more tender and flavorful result ) .

The " freedom " language we used to craft the positions of the campaign were based not only upon Abraham Lincoln , ( for whom I shared the candidates deep admiration ) , but upon the truth about life and authentic human freedom. I encouraged the candidate to consider using the phrase " freedom to be born " and to call it the " first freedom " and to call the " right to life " the " first right.

It is propagated by seeds which are sown in early spring in pots of sandy soil indoors. It may also be propagated by cuttings of the semi-woody shoots from the current year 's growth and rooted in light moist soil in a sheltered place. These cuttings are best taken in July. It can also be propagated by layering the ends of the trailing branches. Give ample water and sturdy supports when well-established. Vines can be guided and tied . </root.v.799><root.v.800>Along with all the natural modifications , people have developed many ways to propagate plants more efficiently and ways that meet the needs of both the agricultural communities and the horticultural trade. Seeds can be treated in various ways to achieve better and more uniform germination rates. Cuttings of various plants can be rooted in greenhouses when the parent plants are under three feet of snow. The highly specialized techniques involved in micropropagation allow growers to produce thousands of genetically identical plants , tissues ( thus the term tissue culture ) , or cells. Learning about these procedures and many others makes plant propagaton a tremendous way to expand one 's knowledge of plants and gardening , and can lead to an interesting and rewarding profession . </root.v.800><root.v.801>Many houseplants , perennials and some shrubs fall into the softwood cuttings category. These should usually be taken in spring and summer. Cuttings taken between March and October for houseplants and perennials , and between June and July for shrubs produce the best results. These cuttings should root between one to eight weeks. Any plants that are susceptible to frost should be rooted indoors or in greenhouses. When selecting softwood cuttings you should look for : young sections from the current growth , firm but flexible shoots and no flowers , fruit or seedheads. Always remove any diseased or damaged parts and make sure your cuttings are at least two to four inches long with at least two leaf joints attached . </root.v.801><root.v.802>But although rooted in Minoan and Mycen an elements , Archaic Greek religion is not to be equated with it.

Nurse crops of oats for clover are common; pumpkins or soy beans are often grown with corn; and the use of cow peas with corn is an old practice , especially over the southern part of the corn-growing region. Growing mixed cultures is a common practice in India , where they usually outyield pure ones. 153 The selection , breeding , and adaptation of crops for and and semiarid regions should logically center about their efficiency as absorbers and conservers of water. Plasticity of root systems as to depth , lateral spread , degree of branching , etc. , goes far towards determining the ability of a crop to make sufficient growth and yield to warrant its cultivation in dry lands. Moreover , under these conditions , root competition is an important factor in determining the rate of seeding . </root.v.807><root.v.808>This method is frequently used with snake plant and fibrous rooted begonias. Cut begonia leaves into wedges with at least one vein. Lay leaves flat on the medium. A new plant will arise at the vein. Cut snake plant leaves into 2-inch sections. Consistently make the lower cut slanted and the upper cut straight so you can tell which is the top. Insert the cutting vertically. Roots will form fairly soon , and eventually a new plant will appear at the base of the cutting. These and other succulent cuttings will rot if kept too moist . </root.v.808><root.v.809>Usually the biggest problem I get is if merc runs over to tag add , the other mob will follow , putting the merc too close to rooted mob when he turns to beat on primary target.

By extending some of the roots out into the planting hole you begin to break the former root habits. For fine rooted plants , gently loosening the outside layer of roots should be sufficient. When roots are coarse , loosen them or cut them with a sharp knife or pruners - particularly if they are severely coiled on the sides or bottom. Bad kinks and coils should be eliminated. If a lot of roots need to be cut away in the process , offset by pruning back or thinning out the top of the plant. While undertaking these steps , do not allow the roots to dry. When backfilling the hole , create a circular ridge or dam to form a water basin located so water that collects will go directly into the root ball rather than into the surrounding prepared soil . </root.v.810><root.v.811>All these examples of autonomy challenge the basic tenets of state power and the continuance of government in anything like its present form. In a similar way to the Kuna , the Zapatista revolution in thinking and practice did not taken place in a vacuum , but is rooted in an analysis of the national and international context within which they find themselves. Consequently , while negotiating for indigenous autonomy and civil rights during peace talks in San Andr s Sakamch  n , the Zapatistas were simultaneously pushing for profound constitutional reforms that would have in effect begun the process of dismantling the existent power structure of Mexican society. This was only realized by the government after their representatives and negotiators had reached the final stage of the peace accords and it is a major reason why the Mexican government failed to implement those accords . </root.v.811><root.v.812>With controlled growth and a respect for our heritage and deep rooted love of natural beauty , we have succeeded in maintaining one of the most sought after communtites and areas to live on the east coast.

The reasons for this are not simply rooted in self-interest or a desire to hold on to a maximum degree of power. Their resistance is also rooted in the dearth of persuasive alternative models for participation that might honestly change their minds. In the absence of concrete alternatives , radically democratic fantasies will prevail.

Softwood cuttings of actively growing fig shoots can be propagated under intermittent mist. Treatment of the base of the cutting with a rooting hormone is not necessary. However , two nodes should be placed in the medium. The base cut should be inch below a node. Rooting should begin in three to four weeks , at which time the misting interval is widened to encourage further root growth. If these rooted cuttings are to be dug and potted , they should be placed under mist or in a shade house after potting until the roots recover from the transplanting operation . </root.v.819><root.v.820>The ridicule that Romano argues for ( and this is HIS pathetic contribution , as I do not understand Faye 's book to be calling for childish ridicule ) is premised on Romano 's obvious inability or unwillingness to engage with even the most elementary thinking in Being and Time ( Dasein as " Yeti " ?

But if we ignore the Anglo-American academy 's dyspeptic rejection of Heidegger ( we can fondly recall early attempts to put Being and Time into logical form. Failing that , Being and Time was therefore nonsense ) and read the work on its own terms , we learn a lot. It 's not even unreadable.

This also refers to Christ. He grew up like a tender shoot and bore fruit. The fruit he bore are the things the rest of ch. 11 speak of.

It is not possible to take up Freire only on the basis of his texts -- which only examines internal contradictions -- and expect to use his ideas to further the course of social justice. Only a unitary examination of theory and practice rooted in history can make that possible. It is only viable to appraise Freire , whose words clash into one another , through his own practice and the unchallenged work of those who have , say , religiously , applied his beliefs and techniques. On the other hand , if we grasp his philosophical base , we should be able to broadly predict future outcomes. It is Freire 's own position that methodological errors have ideological foundations.

Semi-hardwood cuttings , up to a half inch ( 1.75cm ) in diameter and 4-6in ( 10cm-15cm ) long with root the most easily. Remove all leaves but 2-4 sets at the top of the cutting. Use rooting hormone to increase chances. Greenwood cuttings are not always mature enough to root. Try using a mix of 90 sand or perlite and 10 peat moss. Keep misted , but not soaking. Addition of bottom heat is helpful , and will increase cutting viability dramatically. Rooting of hardwood cuttings can be done , though can take several months. Semi-hardwood cuttings can also be rooted sometimes in straight water . </root.v.823><root.v.824>I suggest taking some leaf petiole cuttings from your favorite plants and rooting them ( see enclosed NCR publication 274 , " Home Propagation Techniques " ) .

May through October , water by hand every day thoroughly for the first 2 to 3 weeks while maintaining your same automatic sprinkler system settings. Taper to twice weekly thereafter or once a week in the winter until plant has rooted out. For November through April , hand watering twice a week initially may be enough. Remember plant and soil requirements vary , so water needs and application may need adjusting. In general , plants planted in shade do not need nor can they tolerate as much water as plants planted in the sun. Much more watering by hand is needed for new plants in the warm and hot months compared to the cool months . </root.v.825><root.v.826>To get started you will need : a clean razor blade , a water mister , a tray with a clear plastic lid , a planting medium , and perhaps a jar of rooting hormone. marijuana clones can be effectively rooted using nothing more than water , however most growers choose to dip their freshly cut stem into either a rooting powder or a gel . </root.v.826><root.v.827>That is the tree we have been drawn to and what continues to allow us to thrive , not any party loyalty or dedication to a personality.

In its biblical definition , sin can not be limited to isolated instances or patterns of wrongdoing; it is something much more akin to the psychological term complex : an organic network of compulsive attitudes , beliefs , and behavior deeply rooted in alienation from God. Sin originated in the darkening of the human mind and heart as man turned from the truth about God to embrace a lie about him and consequently a whole universe of lies about his creation.

Fresh , green willow cuttings and rooted plants are layered on 1-1.5 m wide berms on the face of the slope. The berms should have an angle of inclination ( sloping up ) of 10-20 percent to the outside and are dug out by hand or machine. Wherever there is a risk of slope failure , ditches should only be dug in short segments. The plants are placed close together and the tips or the leafy ends should be allowed to protrude slightly beyond the face of the slope. Rooted and unrooted plants should be used as vegetation and these should be resistant to rock fall and rubble and have the ability to produce adventitious root systems. The plants are buried with the material from the next , above berm , so that 15-20 cm of the tips protrude. Vertical spacing between layers is dictated by the erosion potential of the slope and may be between 1 and 2 m . </root.v.831><root.v.832>Weak nutrients ( 50-200ppm ) should be started on the rooted clones , and watered more frequently to avoid drying the exposed root tips out.

The capitalist system is an elaborate construction , centuries old , adaptable and invading all walks of life. It will only be thrown off the historical stage by another social order capable of defeating and replacing it on all the fronts. For the second lesson is that all the struggles for the control over the work process , for greater equality , for real powers to the people begin within existing society and drive us beyond its borders. This is why the book 's conclusion calls for " realistic utopia. " Realistic since it must be rooted in current conflicts and in the potentialities of existing society.

The assumption that the demand curve for labour is always downward sloping with respect to aggregate employment is rooted in the notion that industry operates , at least in the short run , under conditions of diminishing returns. However , diminishing returns are not a feature of industries in the real world. Thus the assumption that the downward slopping marginal product of labour curve is identical to the aggregate demand curve for labour is not true as it is inconsistent with empirical evidence. " In a system at increasing returns , " noted one economist , " the direct relation between real wages and employment tends to render the ordinary mechanism of wage adjustment ineffective and unstable. " [ Ferdinando Targetti , Nicholas Kaldor , p. 344 ] In fact , as discussed in section C.1.2 , without this assumption mainstream economics can not show that unemployment is , in fact , caused by real wages being too high ( along with many other things ) . </root.v.840><root.v.841>This is a Ladino song , which is deeply rooted in the Ladino singing tradition.

The sun is high in the sky; day temperatures can be extremely high even in well ventilated greenhouses , and the atmosphere can be very dry. The cuttings to be rooted no longer have a plumbing system to keep them going and because of the rapid growth they are likely to be on the soft side. In these circumstances there is always the risk of loss of moisture in the cutting material due to transpiration and if they are left flagging for too long they will be difficult to root. Even if they recover you may find that they will only have rooted on one side of the stem . </root.v.843><root.v.844>That needs to be out of there. That needs to be rooted out by the scriptures.

The consecutive effect of the use of coconut fibre on the rooting is that the plants are bigger and flower more abundantly. The positive consecutive effect was also observed by Hetman and Szot [ 9 ] after adding hydrogels for the rooting of the pelargonium cuttings.

In either case , there is a marked tendency towards the production of an abundance of roots so superficially placed that cultivation results in more or less serious root pruning. Moreover , under such conditions , plants are more sensitive to drought , temperature changes , etc. 89 They require heavier irrigation and greater amounts of fertilizers than those more deeply rooted . </root.v.854><root.v.855>Drawn by the charm of mystery and seized by a vague intoxication , the king went forward into the hell-born labyrinth.

In this process , a section of the long stem of the plant is simply pinned to the soil , without separating it from the original plant , until it grows roots. Using a U-shaped or hairpin-like wire , pin one or more nodes of the original vine to the surface of the potting soil , which is kept constantly moist but not soggy. You can pin the vine back into the original pot or onto the moist soil in a new , nearby separate pot. Once the layered stems have taken root , simply cut the stem behind the freshly rooted nodes and pot the cuttings separately. If you have enough vines and they 're long enough , you may be able to pin several stems together into a new pot and create a whole new plant all at once . </root.v.865><root.v.866>Spinifex hirsutus.

He added that by rooting out crime and corruption , the new recruits would be building a peoples contract for a better South Africa. The department has been dogged by corruption in recent months , prompting Minister Ben Skosana to request President Thabo Mbeki to institute a commission of inquiry into prisons in the country after it was alleged that some warders accepted bribes from prisoners and organised escapes.

A branch or twig pushed into the ground will root in a matter of weeks , but there are certain processes which help to provide ideal conditions for the cutting to root. First , to ensure that the leaves do not lose too much moisture the cutting should be kept in a closed environment such as a clear plastic bag or a propagating frame. Of course professional bonsai growers go to great lengths to provide these ideal conditions. They use polythene tunnels and propagating benches with sophisticated automatic misting equipment. For most amateurs this is not within reach , nor really necessary. All that is needed is a plastic seed tray or flowerpot , some peat and sharp sand and a clear plastic bag. A heated propagator with soil warming cables to provide 'bottom heat ' can be a great help as this can speed up the rooting process , but you can still achieve a fairly high success rate without such equipment. Not all plants like bottom heat. In fact conifer cuttings are best propagated without since the heat can dry up the cuttings too rapidly . </root.v.871><root.v.872>B : You 're giving me , really , a modern contract theory of democracy and I would root democracy in part in the classic republican tradition and in an Aristotelian understanding that citizens of a free republic govern and are governed in turn , but are citizens only so far as they are capable of leading a virtuous life , which means a life in community.

" For Jesus tells us in Matthew 8 : 11 that every plant which is not planted by His Father shall be rooted up. He made this reference to the institution of Pharisaism , but when He said , " Every plant , " it is evident that He included every false religious institution. Therefore the statement embraces Rome , her harlot daughters , and all apostate religious organization. It is made clear , however , that Jesus will root up the institution as such , but He will not lose one sheep ( John 10 : 16 , 28 ) . This fact is also made clear again when the great whore and her harlot daughters come to doom. It is there that God will call His people out of them.

In 1987 , a group of Lubavitcher Jews , among the most orthodox and zealous of Jewish sects , opened a kosher slaughterhouse just outside tiny Postville , Iowa ( pop. 1 , 432 ) . When it became a worldwide success , Postville found itself both revived and riven , as the town 's initial welcome of the Jews turned to confusion , dismay , and even disgust. By 1997 , the town voted on what was essentially a referendum : yes or no on whether these Jews should stay. A laboratory of ethnic strife , Postville is at the leading edge of the new wave of immigration in the heartland. Its story digs deeply into the questions that haunt America nationwide : how to build community , how to accommodate diverse but equally powerful traditions , how small towns can compete with big money.

The Middle East is an important place to consider when looking at some deep rooted social constructs because it has successfully maintained a rather rigid social structure over the past few hundred years. These social structures have a strong sense of patriarchy. I used to credit this to the religion of the region , Islam. Indeed , religion is used as a means to perpetuate a patriarchal society , especially in countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran. But we must consider the following : 1 ) It is extremely incorrect to say Islam is THE religion that perpetuates patriarchy , because it is not. Judaism , Hinduism , etc all should be given that credit as well. 2 ) Many , MANY , can argue that patriarchy is a misinterpretation and mis-practice of each of these religions. 3 ) My main point : Patriarchy is Beyond religion.

The best leaf cuttings are young leaves but any leaf will work such as damaged leaves you have to remove anyway. If the leaf is small you can just cut the petiole and insert it into the rooting medium. Larger or damaged leaves you should cut down as in the illustration leaving a round center of the leaf with the petiole. The remaining part of the leaf can be discarded or used for wedges. The reasons for cutting the leaf down is that it takes up less space in the tray and because the petiole will have less leaf to support. The cut down leaf will have less leaf surface to transpire from so the petiole won ' t have to provide so much water. Even if making wedges or cone cuttings , save that middle portion as an extra cutting.

A sound heart can not commit such acts. Every murderer , every rapist , every idolater , every fowl person , every person showing an act of cruelty has a diseased heart because these actions emanate from diseased hearts. If the hearts were sound , none of these actions would be a reality.

This is a historical legacy of the fact that the U.S. was conceived as a " white man 's country " with the intent of protecting the interests of a propertied white male settler elite. The feared excesses of popular democracy had to be pre-empted through embedded minority-rule devises. These constitutionally structured inequalities have become increasingly pronounced as predominantly white small-town , small-state and/or suburban and up-state electoral constituencies out-vote major urban areas in election after election - albeit by close margins which are increasingly subject to vote-rigging . </root.v.900><root.v.901>I don ' t know how other Notre Dame fans will root.

Dialectical materialism seeks to locate the causes behind symptomatic effects , and properly applied , looks for causes in the material world. But Freire finds causes first in the ideological realm , culture especially , and then converts effects to causes. This lies , too , at the base of his sense that literacy and voice are the indicators of the understanding of oppression and resistance. Literacy may rise up as a response to oppression , but literacy is only a secondary cause of oppression . </root.v.903><root.v.904>[ 1 ] Castells himself despairs of any positive interaction between local and global cultures , and he proposes a quite different architectural strategy than Frampton , namely " the architecture of nudity whose forms are so pure , so diaphanous , that they do n't pretend to say anything. And by not saying anything they confront the experience with the solitude of the space of flows. Its message is silence " ( Castells 1996 , 420 ) . For Castells , architects have a difficult choice to make. " Either the new architecture builds the palaces of the new masters , thus exposing their deformity hidden behind the abstraction of the space of flows; or it roots itself into places , thus into culture , and into people. In both cases , under different forms , architecture may be digging the trenches of resistance for the preservation of meaning in the generation of knowledge. Or , what is the same , for the reconciliation of culture and technology " ( Castells 1996 , 423 ) . There is no middle or interactive road between the poles of Castells ' duality , because he defines places as closed rather than relational unities . </root.v.904><root.v.905>You have many available methods for rooting your cuttings , perhaps the easiest way is to leave them to a glass of water and have some light for them.

And they are embellished by the recovery and restoration of pre-Columbian monuments , as well as strong popular traditions of arts , crafts , and music.

In the experiments by Gabryszewska and Warabieda [ 6 ] , the dry weight of roots of common lilac shoots rooted in vitro on the substrate with auxins was significantly smaller than the root dry weight of plants rooted in vivo.

It comes from the same Arabic root from which the word aghlal originates , which is used in the Quran to mean yokes around the neck ( Quran 36 : 8 ) , as if to say that rancour dwells in a heart bound to rancour and treachery. Rancour is pungent emotion that is rooted in being extremely angry at a person to the point that one wishes harm to come to him.

It is also suitable for shrubs that are bushy in growth habit and produce a mass of shoots at the base. In late winter , when dormant , the shrub should be cut back to 5 cm ( 2 in ) above the soil surface. In the spring , the remaining stem ( s ) will produce new shoots. When the shoots are 16cm ( 6 in ) long , begin to mound the soil up around the young stems as they grow , making sure never to completely cover the shoots. Continue this process until there is 20cm ( 8 in ) of stem covered with soil. Keep the mound of soil moist during dry periods. The following spring , the soil may be carefully pulled away from the base of the mother plant and the rooted stems severed below the root system.

Occasionally the ends of stems will spiral a little or dramatically in a right or left hand manner Such top cuttings are much prized by Californian enthusiasts , fetching high prices. A spiny tip taken into cultivation will root satisfactorily , but will not grow , throwing out a single juvenile offset in time. On mature plants the flowers are greenish white on the underside and pinkish white inside and emit an unpleasant odour. One or several flowers are produced from each areole.

On some subjects it is helpful to dust the area around the wire with rooting hormone. Wrap some moist sphagnum moss , ( soaked and squeezed out to a damp sponge stage ) around this area. Secure in place loosely with another piece of wire. This helps prevent the next process from becoming very fiddly and requiring three pairs of hands or great dexterity. Split the bag open fully into a long rectangle and wrap it around the whole area until it has encircled it two or three times.

It is helpful to lower light levels to limit transpiration and keep the cuttings turgid. The use of sharp sand ( crushed quartz ) without any amendments has its pros and cons. Without any amendments the propensity for the cutting material to rot is greatly diminished. Sharp sand alone does not provide any nutrients , however , and cuttings need to be planted up immediately after roots emerge or there is a danger of stunting the growth of the plantlet. Cuttings can be rooted directly into growing medium in small pots to eliminate transplanting later. This practice is complicated in that the growing medium does not drain as well as a sharp sand rooting medium and the stems have a tendency to rot when kept wet enough to prevent the leaves from wilting . </root.v.934><root.v.935>This was the first time that a World Alliance Executive Committee had been held in Africa , although a World Council had gathered in 1973 in Kampala , Uganda , where the Kampala Principles were adopted.

Light is necessary for these types so the plant can continue to photosynthesize and produce carbohydrates needed for the development of roots. Too much sunlight , however is to be avoided as this can cause the cuttings to dry out too quickly. The temperature can also have an effect on root formation. Good success can be achieved with an air temperature of around 65 F for a wide range of cuttings. Often , roots will form even more quickly if bottom heat maintains the rooting media about 10 F warmer . </root.v.937><root.v.938>86. Rational reflection and daily experience demonstrate the weakness which marks man 's freedom. That freedom is real but limited : its absolute and unconditional origin is not in itself , but in the life within which it is situated and which represents for it , at one and the same time , both a limitation and a possibility. Human freedom belongs to us as creatures; it is a freedom which is given as a gift , one to be received like a seed and to be cultivated responsibly. It is an essential part of that creaturely image which is the basis of the dignity of the person. Within that freedom there is an echo of the primordial vocation whereby the Creator calls man to the true Good , and even more , through Christ 's Revelation , to become his friend and to share his own divine life. It is at once inalienable self-possession and openness to all that exists , in passing beyond self to knowledge and love of the other.

As Sommers explains , " The reasons are rooted in the worldview of the women who shape the concerns and activities of contemporary American feminism.

Sprigging refers to the planting of individual centipedegrass stolons , or " runners , " which are basically stems of the centipedegrass plants. Sprigging generally requires more irrigation or watering than plugging does since the sprigs have no soil attached. Sprigging can be done by hand or using mechanical sprigging machines. Sprigs are usually broadcast-applied to the soil surface. Hand-shake approximately 10 bushels of sprigs per 1 , 000 square feet of lawn area. If possible , " cut-in " the sprigs , using a small disc harrow , to place the sprigs in a furrow in the soil. Next , apply a light topdressing of soil and/or sand over the top of the sprigs , and roll it to ensure good soil-to-sprig contact.

Such control manifests as desire and aversion , it results in a lack of both inner peace and outer harmony. It is this Ego that seeks to acquire possessions , manipulate others and exploit the environment. Its aim is its own happiness but it invariably produces suffering.

The targeted player along with any other players within 10 yards become rooted for 10 seconds. Dispel this as quickly as possible. Priest Mass Dispel works well for this. Paladins can help free players with Hand of Freedom and Mages can Blink to free themselves. Gnome characters can also use Escape Artist , so gnome mages have two escapes from this root effect. Humans can use Every Man For Himself and Rogues have Cloak of Shadows and Vanish. For Druids , the fastest and easiest method ( assuming standard stance bar ) is simply double-click the form button that you 're currently in - it will instantly drop the form and shift back , removing the freeze. The major problem with Freeze is if it prevents players from moving out from under an Icicle , or to safety from Flash Freeze.

Similarly , patients who have tooth sensitivity to hot or cold , and have tried other ways to control their symptoms , may have to resort to root canal treatments. Removing the pulp has the effect of removing the nerves which conduct cold/hot sensation from the tooth.

The academic argument pays considerable attention to the way things are stated -- it aims not necessarily to " be " art but to state its points in a creative manner , a manner that has the artist 's or craftsperson 's sensitivity to form , precision , image. It also must convey some information , some facts; it roots itself in the actual.

In order to prevent this from happening in America , some of the Founding Fathers advocated for a system of public education so that citizens who are electing public officials would be able to make good choices when it came time to cast their votes. Benjamin Rush , one of the Founding Fathers , and the father of American psychiatry , was a chief architect of public schools in America. He maintained public schools should have two objectives.

As part of a radical socio-ecological Jewish renewal movement , Jesus is an itinerant who calls for separation from pagan cities and espouses an ambivalence towards Jerusalem. Thiessen argues that Jesus was thoroughly rooted in the margins of society , and in opposition to the rulers. Within Jesus ' ministry economic distress , religious unrest , and political resistance are all interconnected. Thus , through actions like healing the lower classes and the outcasts , Jesus comes into direct conflict with the authorities. Through this conflict Jesus was hoping to bring about the kingdom of God , which would result in the poor coming " into their own " . Jesus was hoping to bring about a " revolution in values , a takeover of upper-class attitudes by the lower class " .

The new shoots that come from this root stock , when 4-6 inches in length , are pegged against the ground. They are then covered with a thin layer of sand.

However , this was because the " Bastard Keynesianism " of the post-war period was rooted in the same neo-classical assumptions used by Friedman. Moreover , they had forgotten the warnings of left-wing Keynesians in the 1940s that full unemployment would cause inflation as bosses would pass on wage rises onto consumers. This class based analysis , obviously , did not fit in well with the panglossian assumptions of neo-classical economics. Yet basing an analysis on individual expectations does not answer the question whether these expectations are meet. With strong organisation and a willingness to act , workers can increase their wages to counteract inflation. This means that there are two main options within capitalism. The first option is to use price controls to stop capitalists increasing their prices. However , this contradicts the scared laws of supply and demand and violates private property. Which brings us to the second option , namely to break unions and raise unemployment to such levels that workers think twice about standing up for themselves. In this case , workers can not increase their money wages and so their real wages drop . </root.v.1081><root.v.1082>Softwood cuttings generally root quickly in summer , but by their nature are more susceptible to damage from flagging ( wilting ) . It is important to secure material that is young , healthy , firm growth. For most trees and shrubs , a piece that is 5 to 10cm ( 2 " to 4 " ) long is removed from the parent plant and the lower leaves carefully removed , up to about half way along the cutting. It may then be inserted immediately into the compost , but for most species a dip into rooting hormone will improve the strike rate ( numbers rooting ) . If you use the convenient , general purpose , powdered rooting hormone , follow this procedure : - Wet the bottom end of the cutting , shake excess drops off and then dip it into the rooting hormone.

He sees culture as " a basic , central theme " , above production and indeed sees the fruits of labor being culture , " Culture is the result of man 's labor " . ( 414 ) Culture is rooted in national consciousness ( as Freire describes in his initially unpublished " Letter to Guinea-Bissau " , he contends language , a key cultural indicator , is national in content ) . ( 415 ) Hence , what is the appropriate subject of examination is not commodity production nor surplus value , but language. Again , this is not to say Freire does not examine work. He does. In his early Education for Critical Consciousness , he notes the importance of labor.

The ones that we are focusing on are : rockwool cubes , Rapid Rooter plugs , Oasis cubes and aeroponic cloning systems. For aeroponic cloning systems ( e.g. EZ Clone , Power Cloner and Clone Machine ) , see Water Quality . Rockwool cubes need to be pre-soaked at a pH of 5 prior to placing the cuttings into them ( or use Rockwool Soak ) . Keep the cubes moist but not saturated with water. Once you pour the water onto the cubes and have allowed the excess to drain off , gently squeeze each cube thus making it release more water. If the cutting stays too moist it will have a higher chance of rotting. Rapid Rooters and Oasis cubes are ideal products to clone in as both of these mediums hold less water and allow more oxygen in than the rockwool cubes. Also , neither medium needs to be pre-soaked before being used. The Rapid Rooter plugs also have Trichoderma which is an aggressive fungi that feeds off of other fungi , especially the bad root/stem rot causing fungi . </root.v.1089><root.v.1090>( A note from Mike : Tammy had only been at this a year when she sent me this note.

The micronutrients in the coating will improve the health of cuttings supporting a stronger initial flush when transplanted. Improving root development in the propagation phase will greatly reduce the development of girdling roots as the plant ages. Seedlings and cuttings started in treated containers or cell packs , develop fine , fibrous roots with many root tips. This prepares a new plant for better growth compared to plants with sparse , unbranched roots. Cuttings rooted in MicroKote treated pots will also initiate more roots directly from the callus on cuttings.

Grafted crabs suffer from unattractive and often mismatched unions making an imperfect trunk line. You can try burying the understock an inch at a time by making vertical slices in the bark and applying hormone , then covering the area with good bonsai soil to try to move the root zone upward.

Judas " repented " for betraying Jesus , and even tried to make amends by returning the money; but it was n't genuine repentance. Obviously , forsaking sins is not Biblical repentance. If it was , then Judas would have been justified; but he went to Hell. Biblical repentance must be rooted in the Law of God. There are criminals in prison who are sorry they got caught , and likely would n't commit the same crime again if released; but they have never repented TOWARD God for their sins.

If the cut has become soft and slimy , toss it out along with its rooting medium. If the cut isn ' t soft and slimy but has white bumps just above the cut then it is about to root. This is the time when Rhizotonic should be added at a rate of 15 ml per gallon of water. This gets the root system kick started and helps produce lush healthy white roots ( it ' s an amazing product ) . If you find a cutting that does not come out of its medium , it has rooted - do not tug it out ! For those with cloning systems this process is much easier. Discard all cuttings that are beginning to rot; harmful organisms will spread easier in the machines. Add HydroGuard to the cloning system reservoir at a rate of 15ml per gallon of water.

Weather and soil conditions conductive to planting occur in both late spring and early fall. The spring is generally the best time to plant bare-root seedlings especially if planting in heavy loam or clay soils. Trees planted in heavy soils in the fall are more susceptible to frost heaving and winterkill from dry winter winds. Winter damage from rodents and other wildlife is also greater in fall planted seedlings. Keep the tree roots moist and protected from the sun and wind while handling. It is not recommended to soak the tree roots in water before planting because this will wash away protective soil particles from the roots , making the roots more susceptible to drying.

Although Milkman grows up , finds friendship with Guitar Bains , meets his mysterious aunt Pilate , and falls in love with his cousin Hagar , these human connections are curiously stilted. Milkman 's loss of " interest in himself " does not constitute selflessness , for he becomes astoundingly selfish , but rather indicates a lack of real involvement in life and an ignorance of his true personal and racial identity. As Elizabeth Schultz observes , it is only " when an individual . . . can establish a specific connection with his people 's origins [ that ] he becomes rooted " ( 129 ) . Milkman wants to fly , but his wish for flight is a selfish escapism that can never give him true freedom. Milkman is " struggling toward an acceptance of the fact that an active commitment to others is paradoxically the best of all possible means for fulfilling oneself and one 's personal freedom " ( 136 ) .

The deeper portion of the taproot system is better developed , however , and the shallower part almost as extensive as the coarse , widely spreading vines. Plants with a spread of tops of only a foot are rooted 2.5 feet deep and are supplied with numerous , much branched , horizontal laterals 16 to 30 inches in length. Thus an efficient absorbing system is developed early. Within a period of 2 weeks and when blossoming has just begun , the vines have grown to a length of 6.5 feet. The taproots have increased only a foot in length but the horizontal laterals 2.5 feet , thus spreading somewhat less widely than the vines.

Husserl had advocated the epoche , the suspension of belief in the real-world-reality of the self and its objects of consciousness; this amounts to a modification of consciousness : instead of positing things as reality , we shift into neutrality about their reality ( so as to be able the better to study the structures of consciousness and its correlates ) ( do you recall Heidegger ' s talk about stepping back ? ) .

Although not a part of this study , untreated plants similarly maintained formed no offsets. This agrees with previous research ( 1 ) . Offset stem cuttings removed at a more advanced SOD rooted in higher percentages and formed more primary and secondary roots of a greater biomass than did cuttings at SOD 1 or 2. This suggests at least 2 alternatives to enhance rooting. First , cuttings were removed only 32 weeks after treatment. If cuttings had not been removed so soon , it is likely that a higher percentage of cuttings would be at a more advanced SOD which should enhance rooting. A potential limitation to this strategy would be the decrease in offset counts over time reported earlier ( 1 ); however , this decrease did not generally occur until at least 60 days after treatment. A second approach would be to remove only cuttings at SOD 3 or greater; these cuttings should root readily , and removal may stimulate remaining offsets to develop more quickly. However , this option may not lend itself to some commercial hosta growers because of the need to remove offsets more than once during a season . </root.v.1198><root.v.1199>Rooting Powder : A powder containing rooting hormones to help promote the growth of roots on leaf cuttings.

At first sight no specific , recognizable method seems to be imparted here - rather , any such method seems to be undermined. But on closer study the authentic Advaita appears to be there , as bright as a diamond. Only a truly original transmittance , not based on memory , can be a help in the realisation of the Authentic within ourselves. The present book 'Consciousness ' contains a selection from the numerous talks in which the oral transmission of this Authentic or Original in man takes a central place.

That is why Edwards urges us to consider the Buddhist conviction that compassion is the basis of all happiness. He puts forward a convincing argument that the only lasting antidote to exploitative social systems is rational awareness rooted in unconditional kindness and compassion for all. He shows how we can instigate a compassionate revolution , in which the only enemies and causalities are greewd , hatred and ignorance. 228pp , softback , 1998 , RRP £ 9.95 , Cygnus price £ 7 : 00 , </root.v.1251><root.v.1252>Much like an avocado pit , a sweet potato tuber will root when suspended in water using toothpicks. Stick toothpicks around the center of a sweet potato. Place the sweet potato in a glass of water ( preferably clear so your children can see the root development ) so half of the sweet potato is submerged in water. Place the sweet potato and glass in a sunny location. Roots will begin to develop from the base of the sweet potato. When stems sprout from the top of the potato , the plant can be given a home in a pot with a good potting soil. Sweet potato vines are an attractive ornamental plant.

Many people who start a garden these days know someone who will give them a few clones for the simple pleasure of sharing a good thing. Some people sell clones , often growing an exclusively vegetative garden without ever flowering. These clonemeisters keep a variety of select mothers from high-quality strains , and grow them on a continuous eighteen hour light cycle. They can make good money selling trays of cuttings , either rooted or simply fresh cut. Rooted clones are more expensive than fresh cuttings . </root.v.1255><root.v.1256>Easy to root species such as Euonymus and Sambucus will root about as easy in one stage as the next. Some species , such as native azaleas and redbuds will only root in the softwood stage and loose the ability to root once the wood makes the transition into the semiharwood stage. Some plants such as Aesculus and Rhododendron only make one flush of growth in the spring and then set a resting bud for next season. With these kinds of plants there is only a short period of time when cuttings can be taken for successful rooting. Other plants , such as pines and oaks , make multiple flushes of growth and have several times during the year when softwood cuttings would be available ( note - neither pines or oaks are easy to root from cuttings ) . A third group of plants , such as sweetgum , red maple and redbud make more or less continuous growth through the summer , provided the environment is suitable for such growth . </root.v.1256><root.v.1257>Well grown plants will produce suckers or offsets with comparative freedom.

Then , all weeding and trimming must be done by hand. Grass is the lowest maintenance covering of bare ground that we have. Of course , there are times when groundcovers may be preferable. In heavy shade , where grass thins and dies , choose from liriope , mondograss , the various ivies and even Asian jasmine and purple wintercreeper ( both outstanding full-sun groundcovers as well ) .

In rural areas , they felt the pinch along with their farmer customers when weather affected crops and livestock. These grocers were pioneers in creating value. They experienced and shared in the joys and hardships of each customer. They knew each and every adult and child by name , not because some training manual told them to but because they believed it was just how people wanted to be treated.

Higher ranking community members exercise dominance in discourse and establish hegemony when they are able to convince those with less power to interpret the world from their perspective ( Mumby and Clair , 1997; Diamond , 1996 ) . Once hegemonic power and its accompanying ideologies are established , it makes people act as if it were natural , normal , or simply a consensus ( Van Dijk , 1997 : 19 ) . Thus , hegemonic ideologies influence how people experience and interpret their everyday life , identity , and roles within society. Shared ideologies contribute to solidarity and the accomplishment of cooperative tasks by ensuring that group members will generally act in similar ways in similar situations ( Van Dijk , 1997 : 26 ) . Consequently , dominant ideologies rooted in class , race , and gender disparities define the limits of acceptable behavior , thought , and speech. Thus , the use of power to maintain social benefits for one group over another often happens subtly , rather than by force . </root.v.1271><root.v.1272>This paper provides tight bounds for the moments of the width of rooted labeled ...

Cuttings with fairly slender stems will root easily in plain water. Use tap water that has been left to sit out for 24 hours or more to allow chlorine and fluorine gasses to dissipate. Place the fresh cuttings into a glass or jar of the water , submerging the exposed nodes but not allowing any foliage to be in the water. It can be helpful to drop a clear plastic bag over the cuttings and the glass to increase humidity while the stems are rooting. Do n't seal the bag , however , as air circulation must be present to avoid rotting. The bag can be supported over the cuttings with wood plant stakes or dowels , so air can circulate from underneath. Place the cuttings in bright , indirect light away from full sun while they are rooting. Change the water as necessary to keep it clear and oxygenated , and add water to replace any that has evaporated or been used by the plants.

U.S. and Canadian democracy have been uniquely successful in creating political institutions , laws , and economic institutions that are effective in promoting scientific and technical creativity and the creation and accumulation of wealth. The political agnosticism of the founding fathers established principles of freedom of expression and freedom of religion that have allowed groups with varying cultural histories , worldviews , and identities to play important roles in the political process and to claim a share of developing prosperity. However , this has come at the cost of a deeply rooted sense of national cultural identity . </root.v.1281><root.v.1282>Dip them in rooting gel and plant away or root them in tissue culture and continue feeding them in sugar in larger jars.

Rooted tissue culture clones are ready to plant just like clones from a professional cloning machine. The remaining small plants are replanted into new multiplying jars to grow and fill all over again. The system takes on a two shelf operation. The jars on the top shelf multiply a few plants into many plants.

Children of God , they have given themselves to him in imitation of the attitude of the chaste , poor and obedient Son of the virgin mother. Both women and men disciples have taken the imitation of Christ according to the counsels and made it the form of their adherence to Christ as the absolute Lord and master of their existence , pouring themselves out for his service. Consecrated by the Spirit through the church , they have received a gift which enables them to fulfill the demands of imitating Christ and of mission. Sharing in a charism , they are called to express in their life a specific aspect of the mystery of Christ and of the church.

Most turfgrass roots are shallow , fibrous , and absorb water more quickly than the trees. This leaves the poor trees with the table scraps , instead of the main course. To prevent this from happening , a separate irrigation system should be designed for the trees to provide the water to their deeper rootzones . </root.v.1310><root.v.1311>A successful Leaf cutting will result in growing a new plant ( sometimes several plants ) from a single leaf. The trick here is to get a bit of the stem tissue when you remove the leaf. If you just break a leaf from the plant and get none of the stem , the leaf will not root. The best way to get started is to un-pot the plant and wash the soil from its roots. Remove any old or dying leaves and choose a vigorous healthy leaf or more. Remove this leaf with a sharp knife making sure to cut off a bit of stem tissue with the leaf. Dip the cut end into rooting hormone powder and allow to dry in a shady area for a couple of days. Next place the leaf in a warm shady area in a pot who 's soil that is kept slightly moist.

A crowded plant can be removed from its pot and cut into two or more sections. Each section is potted up separately. Division involving separating small plants may be more complicated. The best divisions will be those with good root development. When there are enough of these to furnish the desired number of plants , there is no problem. If more plants are wanted , it may be necessary to save small , poorly , rooted divisions. The rootless divisions are potted up and treated as cuttings.

The technique is usually limited to plants with flexible stems such as vining plants. Layering is similar to cuttage except that the " cutting " is rooted on the mother plant before it is detached. The stem is simply bent over to the surface of the rooting medium and held there by pinning or weighing ( Figure 9 ) . Wounding the stem at the point of contact with the soil will often encourage rooting. When sufficiently rooted , the new plant is severed and repotted. Layering is often successful when other methods are not since it eliminates moisture stress during rooting . </root.v.1334><root.v.1335>Leaves of species such as the jade plant ( Crassula argentea ) , and India rubber plant ( Ficus elastica ) can be rooted but no new shoots will ever develop unless an axillary bud is included as found in a leaf-bud cutting. A leaf-bud cutting consists of a leaf blade and petiole , and a short section of the stem with the attached axillary bud. This method allows you to take many cuttings from a limited supply of cutting material.

As they dueled , Palpatine silently rooted for Anakin. While Obi-Wan was rendered unconscious while confronting Dooku , Anakin continued to fight. When Anakin sliced off Dooku 's hands and had him down on his knees , Palpatine was ecstatic and broke his silence , urging the young Jedi to kill Dooku. The Count realized he had been nothing more than a pawn in Sidious 's schemes , while Anakin argued that Dooku had to be judged by the courts. However , after Palpatine 's warnings that Dooku was too dangerous to be allowed to live , Anakin finally sliced off Dooku 's head , and his body fell to the floor. This was another victory for Palpatine. The only event he had not expected was that Dooku failed to kill Kenobi and that Anakin refused to leave him behind. It was of little concern , however. By defeating Tyranus in combat Anakin had proven that he was now powerful enough to take his place at Palpatine 's side ... something that the Sith Lord felt he would have little trouble in orchestrating . </root.v.1347><root.v.1348>The quickest way to propagate a trailing African violet to get a good-looking plant is by cutting off a short branch -which is actually an elongated sucker -just above a leaf node and rooting it down in a pot of compost and vermiculite as for a sucker.

As far as your remarks about Rawls go , I am surprised that you discuss the suggestion I made -- which was that H stands to Nazism the way Rawls stands to liberalism -- in the section which deals with the claim Romano makes which was that H 's philosophy is rooted in his Nazism. This seems back to front because I did not suggest that Rawls work on meta ethics is rooted in his liberalism; this would be wrong way around. This is important because if you concede that H 's Nazism is indeed an extension of his philosophy then the comparison with Rawls is apt and so my point stands . </root.v.1350><root.v.1351>Bertrand Russell , one of the most prolific and long-lived philosophers of the 20th century , pointed out that : " Many people would sooner die than think. In fact they do. " Russell 's barbed observation continues to be all too true. At this stage in human development , most of us display a deep desire for certainty. Is this due to culture or our biological nature ? Given the cross-cultural persistence of the need for certainty , I suspect it is partly rooted in our evolutionary past. Back in our hunter-gatherer days , those who were uncertain about whether to run , how to throw a spear or stone , or whether to mate , were likely to die , their genes being forever taken out of the gene pool. The choices then were relatively simple. Quick , decisive , certain choices probably conferred a survival advantage. If a tendency toward certainty and the dogmatic thinking that results really is built into our brain , advanced genetic technology may be the only effective way to remedy it. In the meantime , only those who remain aware of this tendency , and strive continually to combat it in themselves , will have a chance of being the rational beings philosophers have long proclaimed us to be . </root.v.1351><root.v.1352>Plant bulbs in the fall starting when nighttime temperatures stay between 40-50 F.

Deep rooted plants such as mesquite in Southwest arid climates may have roots going 40 feet deep to find water , but these are seeker roots , not a traditional taproot that is thought of for anchorage and a pipeline for bringing water up to the top. More important for anchorage and stability are brace roots. These are high scaffold-type major roots that flare at the crown of the plant , and become the main anchor roots. On mature trees , most of the major roots for stability and feeding are found in the top 12 of soil . </root.v.1357><root.v.1358>Light is important in rooting leafy cuttings. It is necessary for production of plant hormones or auxins , which stimulate rooting , and for photosynthesis , which provides the energy to form the new tissues that become shoots and roots. However , unless leafy cuttings are misted or the surrounding air is cooled , keep them out of direct sunlight. Hardwood cuttings of deciduous plants often root best in the dark , unless they require a long time to root , allowing leaves to develop from dormant buds . </root.v.1358><root.v.1359>Other flowers that root well from cuttings include bedding begonias , blue marguerites , fuchsia , gaillardia , gazania , gardenia , hibiscus , jasmine , lantana and mums.

Wet the soil thoroughly using clean , pH-balanced water and allow it to drain. Now , with tip of a pencil or wooden match , poke a hole in the surface of the soil roughly half a centimeter deep. Gently place the germinated seed in the hole -- root tip down -- and sprinkle a small amount of soil on top.

Yes and No. Roses with own roots come from rooting cuttings. As such , the roots and shoots belong to one and the same variety. The roots and shoots have the same genetic make up. If the cuttings were from plants free from viral disease , the roses developed from these cutting will also be free from viral contamination. You will have no sucker problem. At times , some of these roses may take a year to reach their full potential , especially when you root your own cuttings. However , when you buy roses with own roots from nurseries , these roses are already well established roses and will produces flowers in a couple of months.

As a technique , it works on quite a lot of plants such as geraniums , fuchsia , hydrangea , and wisteria to name a few. There are a variety of ways to go about this task. It can be as simple as placing some stems of basil or mint from the grocery store into a container of water. Remove the lower leaves and snip the ends off with a sharp pair of pruning shears for a clean cut before you put the stems in water. After a time the stems will root and you can easily plant them in some soil indoors or out.

This is the way Ralph Snodsmith on the Garden Hotline ( Sunday mornings 8-10 a.m. on radio station 56AM ) tells to propagate cuttings. Some people just do it anytime , put a cutting in the ground under the mother bush , with a jar over it , and when it roots leave it there till the following spring etc. and plant it where you want it to grow.

In this sense , dialogue is the pathway to love among peoples and the major source of social bonds and solidarity , because dialogue is an appeal to recognition of difference. Dialogue is a great source of inspiration for a truly loveinspired interchange among human beings , and thus is a response to misunderstanding and mistrust among different cultural identities.

A useful tip is to mix a fungicide and weak foliar feed to the spraying mixture this will assist in preventing damping off and offer the cutting some sustenance until it has rooted . </root.v.1407><root.v.1408>Rooting for Tomatoes ! by Virginia your plants with a layer of straw , leaves , dried grass clippings or pine needles and it will keep the plants ' roots ... planting trick. For the square foot method , plant the tomato root at the corner of one square and bury the stem </root.v.1408><root.v.1409>The world most people lived in was limited in stimulus and void of novelty. So most of the ways cultures developed for opening to consciousness beyond space-time was rooted in that stable low stimulus culture . </root.v.1409><root.v.1410>Can be inherited , breast-feeding of newborns helps prevent cancer ( God 's natural way of prevention ) , exposure to radiation ( mammograms ) . Most breast cancer is a result of a spiritual problem. 10 of all breast cancer is caused by mammograms. National statistic ! Why ? Because 10 of all women have a genetic code defect. Women should take a test before this test to be sure their unconogens are in each cell. We need 2 , if there is only one , it will be destroyed by the x-ray and is guaranteed that individual will get breast cancer. If the two unconogens are present , you will NEVER get breast cancer. ( See anti-unconogen for more details ) Deep rooted bitterness and resentment either with a mother or one or more sisters results in breast cancer. We need to get right with our family members ! Especially if our husbands are un-nurturing because cancer attacks the nurturing part of the woman 's body ( breasts , etc. ) . </root.v.1410><root.v.1411>Roots. For Bonatti , an astrological chart is a " root " if it either ( a ) is timed so as to describe the nature of something new , or ( b ) forms the basis for other charts. For example , the natal figure is a root in both senses. It describes the nature of the native when he is separated from the womb and becomes a discrete individual; and it is also the basis for other charts ( like solar revolutions ) . I believe a mundane solar revolution is a root , because the nature of the world is in some sense renewed when the Sun enters the first degree of Aries. But other charts are not roots , and need to be rooted in one that is . </root.v.1411><root.v.1412>It depends on the plant. You can take cuttings from stems , roots or leaves - I 'll explain stem and leaf propagation. These cuttings can be rooted in growing medium , sand , artificial soil mixes , or water . </root.v.1412><root.v.1413>The idea of cuttings is to make a root as quickly as possible and to keep it moving once you 've achieved the root. Within two weeks the new shoots ( Cutting material ) should appear. This new growth will root easier and quicker than the old growth. The sooner cuttings of large and medium exhibition are taken the better. This is followed by singles , incurves , intermediates and reflex needing two stops. All cutting should ideally be of the same vigour and about an inch and a half in length . </root.v.1413><root.v.1414>Rooted in Pygmalion Easter Parade , like that other favourite of mine Pretty Woman , seems to have it 's roots in Pygmalion. It 's Easter 1911 and dancer Don Hughes ( Fred Astaire ) , piqued because his partner Nadine ( Ann Miller ) has dumped him to pursue a solo career , declares that he can turn any chorus girl into a star. The girl he chooses to mould into his new " Nadine " is Hannah Brown ( Judy Garland ) . Song , dance , and romance of course , follow - with the usual misunderstandings along the way . </root.v.1414><root.v.1415>I usually put my dome under my skylight , placed out of direct sunlight because they will dry out then , especially in the early stage. Naturally if you use a hot sun instead of a light bulb , you will need to give them a bit more moisture. Actually , I like to let them sweat it out a bit , as it were , but that also ensures that only the fittest survive and will root rapidly under the intense light . </root.v.1415><root.v.1416>When you are taking the cuttings , make sure you know which way is up. A cutting will only root on the " bottom end " . You can mark the top with a felt tip pen if it 's difficult to tell top from bottom. Remove any soft tips and leftover leaves. Evergreens should have the needles or leaves removed from the bottom half of the cutting . </root.v.1416><root.v.1417>Some shrubby plants such as periwinkles form clumps which can be dug up and cut into several rooted sections. Others , like lilac and snowberry , grow suckers </root.v.1417><root.v.1418>Paul 's words send me to my knees with an awareness of how poor my love has been. I 'm willing to love the church until it hurts , offends , or annoys me. I 'm willing to love it until I decide it 's gone too far. But Paul 's words send me back to the cross. They remind me that Jesus loves me despite my weaknesses , my failures , and my most disgusting sins. My entire life should be rooted and grounded in that love. Love makes us holy. God wants to see it in us , and so I will ask God for it  " not for myself only , but for all the church . </root.v.1418><root.v.1419>The other factor determining root growth is soil moisture. Roots grow where the conditions for growth are favorable. The old adage that roots grow to water is WRONG. Roots grow where the water is. Roots in dry soil show very little growth. In the spring , when the soil is moist and the surface is warm , roots near the surface show the most growth. As the soil dries out , roots near the surface die and new roots grow deeper in the soil. As the season progresses , the depth of active root growth moves progressively deeper and deeper in the soil. With each rain or irrigation new roots appear near the surface. These new roots absorb water and nutrients and then die . </root.v.1419><root.v.1420>Tim , you had a question on how to braid the trunk , the above website states : You could propagate pachiras from cuttings/side shoots. Often you will notice new shoots coming out of the trunks. Carefully remove these shoots and transplant it. It will take some time but if you are lucky it will root and you will be blessed with another pachira plant. </root.v.1420><root.v.1421>1. Most roses will root without it , but using a rooting hormone -- such as Dip-n-Gro , Rootone , Hormonex II , among others -- increases the percentage of cuttings that will root . </root.v.1421><root.v.1422>The situation in which a plant finds itself when it is apart from its natural home is much like that of an orphan that is in need of special attention in order to feel rooted again. The treatment of p lants needs to consider this , so that efforts that are made at importing plants and creating hybrids , as well as more modest efforts to alter the growth patterns and habitats of plants , are aware of the potentially harmful effect on the native plants in the area to which they are imported , and also the difficulty to the plants themselves which , once orphaned , must struggle more intently in order to live . </root.v.1422><root.v.1423>There are no rules about how many should go in a pot. I feel its as many as looks comfortable , as tip cuttings will vary in size from cultivar to cultivar. Fuchsias do not need any sort of rooting powder but if you feel it is necessary then go ahead . </root.v.1423><root.v.1424>Simple layering is used to propagate filberts ( hazelnuts ) . In early spring a long shoot is bent to the ground , placed in a hole several inches deep , and bent back so that the tip of the shoot is exposed above ground. The hole is then filled with soil. The curved section is usually cut or nicked which promotes rooting. After one season ' s growth the rooted layer is cut from the parent plant , dug and transplanted . </root.v.1424><root.v.1425>After 8 years I 'm still trying to figure out how to get real tanks to leave my rooted mobs alone. I have little hope for the mercs . </root.v.1425><root.v.1426>Cuttings can also be inserted in other materials such as vermiculite or perlite , which can either he used alone or mixed with an equal volume of moss peat. These materials contain no fertilizer at all , and it is vital that cuttings rooted in this way are moved into a normal potting compost as soon as possible to avoid a check in growth . </root.v.1426><root.v.1427>THE fuchsia is indeed quite easy to propagate from home cuttings. Although they will root very easily from April to August , the ideal time is from April to May and it ' s best carried out on a cloudy day . </root.v.1427><root.v.1428>It ' s getting a little easier at this point to find a more direct corollary. I selected Education. A good trainer would appeal to one ' s sense of self-esteem in the education process. Education , particularly regarding ethical behavior , should be rooted in appealing to the student ' s sense of self-worth and doing the right thing. Education is difficult , if not impossible , without policies. It is an inexact science. Education does not test or prove anything. Education is a preventative measure. I tended to put preventive elements toward the top of the Hierarchy of Compliance/Ethics Needs and the scientific or rule-based oriented elements toward the bottom . </root.v.1428><root.v.1429>At this point throw hatchlings and re mez the pet , re apply debuffs , and keep pew pewing him. If he is getting the upper hand on you , throw venemous haze , and root him and move about 30 meters out. If you need some time to chill to regain yourself , hit smothering web and back off. This is probably one of the toughest fights you will have due to all the stuns. you will have to blow everything you have to keep a fight going. try not to get frustrated with all the CC. Power drains and disables on the pet can make a good difference. But if you try to spend your time kiting or gaining distance you will just die faster. You will be stunned , mezed , or rooted. If you get rooted , turn and fire on him. Dont wait for the next move. If he rooted you , re mez the pet every time and keep hitting him. As soon as he hits you it breaks. Timing is a large factor in this fight . </root.v.1429><root.v.1430>Fibrous roots are the most common. Fibrous rooted plants have a root system that branches and rebranches ( no single main root ) and tends to lie closer to the soil surface. Plants with this type of root system are n't as drought-hardy but are much easier to transplant even when mature. Examples include peppers , maples and Black-eyed Susans . </root.v.1430><root.v.1431>Half-hardy bulbs for winter-flowering and forcing should be treated the same as hardy bulbs , except that after potting they should be placed for rooting where they will not freeze. Yet they can go fairly close to it and be all the better for it. In northern states , a coldframe or pit or cold greenhouse to root them in is. therefore , almost indispensable. For tender winter- and summer-flowering greenhouse bulbs , the culture varies with almost every species , and as no general instructions would suit all kinds , the reader may refer to their individual cultures given under their respective headings in this Cyclopedia. ( See list of species at the end of this article . ) </root.v.1431><root.v.1432>Some have criticised the film for not inspecting the " interesting flaws and foibles which made [ Milk ] human " ( 1 ) , pointing to the four of his ex-lovers that committed suicide. In fact , the film does not flinch from such relationship troubles , though it roots them in Milk 's overriding commitment to politics and the alleged emotional instability of his partners , rather than a lack of effort or concern on Milk 's part. Besides , the film 's focus is on the political , and even here , Milk is not made out as a saint. His political will to succeed is not tempered by keeping promises , and he is prepared to use other issues , such as clearing up dogs ' mess , to gain public trust. True , possible contradictions between Milk 's Republicanism and radical gay politics could have been explored , but his party-political preferences are at least mentioned . </root.v.1432><root.v.1433>Zoysia pungens , a creeping rooted grass , but with herbage rarely exceeding two inches in height , might be sown or planted amongst the larger kinds; its herbage is succulent , and it is eaten with avidity by sheep and horses , while it forms a remarkably dense , compact sward. Poa breviglumis , a grass more common on sandy shores in the South Island than in the North , affords a larger yield of herbage , and may be either sown or planted. Other suitable plants for this purpose are mentioned in the appended list . </root.v.1433><root.v.1434>We do n't know for sure why the shift occurred , but it seems likely that people were terrified by both the anarchy that followed the dissolution of the Iraqi state and by the brutal tactics of Al-Qaida in Iraq under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , who has since been killed by U.S. forces. Fellow Muslims may have rooted for Zarqawi to defeat the United States , but they probably could not envision his ruling over their children . </root.v.1434><root.v.1435>Our failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical , though. Our fear of getting " preachy " may also lead us to discount the role that values and culture play in addressing some of our most urgent social problems. After all , the problems of poverty and racism , the uninsured and the unemployed , are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect 10-point plan. They are also rooted in societal indifference and individual callousnessthe desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost , as well as the despair and self-destructiveness among those at the bottom . </root.v.1435><root.v.1436>Ren Girard says about this weakness of Western societies : " The gradual loosening of various centers of cultural isolation began in the Middle Ages and has now led into what we call 'globalization , ' which in my view is only secondarily an economic phenomenon. The true engine of progress is the slow decomposition of the closed worlds rooted in victim mechanisms. This is the force that destroyed archaic societies and henceforth dismantles the ones replacing them , the nations we call 'modern. ' " ( 62 ) " The knowledge we have acquired about our violence , thanks to our religious tradition , does not put an end to scapegoating but weakens it enough to reduce its effectiveness more and more. This is the true reason why apocalyptic destruction threatens us. " ( 63 ) </root.v.1436><root.v.1437>I 've rooted salvias , lilac , hydrangia , streptocarpus , basil , ivy pelargonums , mexican oregano and fushias in water. it 's not laziness so much as time management , putting the days garden clippings in water , vice trying to find pots and planting medium last minute. it is also easier to monitor the glass jars parked right by the kitchen sink window daily for progress . </root.v.1437><root.v.1438>To propagate Acasias seeds sown as soon as ripe in pans of sandy peat offer an easy means of increase and will germinate rapidly in a close tem perature of 60 degrees. Cuttings can also be made during spring from the tips of the shoots about 3 inches in length. In a propa gating box where a temperature of 60 degrees to 65 degrees can be maintained they will root in six to eight weeks , when they can be trans ferred to 3 inch. pots. Half ripened shoots taken with a heel will also root readily in pots of sandy peat in a shady cold frame . </root.v.1438><root.v.1439>All the leaves should be removed except those on the very tip of the cuttings. The cuttings are pushed into a soil mixture of equal parts of perlite and peatmoss so that one-third of the bottom of the cutting is inserted into the soil. You can use rooting hormone but it is n't necessary . </root.v.1439><root.v.1440>Stryker ' s history is rooted in innovation. When Dr. Homer Stryker , an orthopedic surgeon from Kalamazoo , Michigan , found that certain medical products were not meeting his patients ' needs , he invented new ones. As interest in these products grew , Dr. Stryker started a company in 1941 to produce them. Stryker is well-positioned to continue serving the worldwide medical community for generations to come . </root.v.1440><root.v.1441>Washington 's difficulties in raising and maintaining the army are well known. His problem , as Ward 's had been , was rooted in the militia system. A town institution , it reflected both the strengths and weaknesses of the town mentality , and men with farms , families , responsibilities , and long-standing grudges against regular armies were reluctant to leave their militia companies. Chart 2 shows that only 12 percent of the officers in the sample ever joined the Continental Army. The town militia continued as a major institution throughout the Revolution . </root.v.1441><root.v.1442>The 10 trees of treatment No. 3 ( rooted cuttings ) while of average height and trunk circumference , had the lowest resistance to lateral pressure. On the average , only 39 pound pressure was required to deflect them an average of 18 from the vertical at which point the root systems were breaking. None could withstand the 100 pound maximum. The reason is clearly shown in figure l-b , which illustrate the typical root system . </root.v.1442><root.v.1443>We dip the cuttings in a rooting compound to induce root growth. It 's a five second dip , but we dip twenty of more cuttings at time , so the actual time per cutting is less than one second . </root.v.1443><root.v.1444>Black Hawthorn Crataegus douglasii - Large shrub or small tree to 10 meters. Full sun to partial shade. Ample to moderate water. Occurs frequently on Vancouver Island usually in moist , open places , streamside areas , forest edges , and thickets. Small black fruits are a valuable food source for wildlife and dense foliage provides refuge. Extremely sharp spines up to three centimeters long have a human buffering value. Black Hawthorn is a valuable restoration species for stream areas because it is deep rooted and highly resistant to beaver damage . </root.v.1444><root.v.1445>Does it really happen this way. Yes it does. I was recently talking to a friend who grows and sells all kinds of plants and he told me that he has been buying Dwarf Alberta Spruce cuttings and growing them on and selling them. He doesn ' t even root any himself , he just buys 5 , 000 every year , pots them up and sells them wholesale. How many other nurseryman across the country do you suppose do that ? </root.v.1445><root.v.1446>Care should be taken when planting the division into the finished container. Pay particular attention to ensure the potting substrate comes into good contact with the propagule , and do not let the medium dry out until the division is well rooted. If the proper conditions exist , Boulder Blue will root easily after the division . </root.v.1446><root.v.1447>We ' ve inverted the traditional critical path leading with finalised covers , ending with delivered content. In this respect we are a book publisher more akin to magazines/newspapers. This may work from a financial perspective because a publisher that aims to be rooted in the present , not in memory , nor anticipation may have a chance of succeeding in a terrible economic climate. Indeed , I expect many twists and turns in 2010 , but know that the company is small enough to avoid obstacles . </root.v.1447><root.v.1448>Verizon ' s Motorola Droid is a brand-new phone today. Like many smartphones before it , the Droid has been rooted so that owners of the Android 2.0-based smartphone can install multitouch support ( including pinch-to-zoom gestures ) , enhanced themes and other previously forbidden goodies . </root.v.1448><root.v.1449>Propagation : Green wandering Jew does not commonly reproduce from seed , but it roots readily from stem fragments , so long as each piece of stem includes at least one node. It is easily propagated from cuttings at any time of the year and can be rooted in soil or water. If kept well watered for the first week or two , cuttings will readily establish a groundcover when planted directly into mulched organic soil in a shady area of the garden. It is easy to transplant successfully. To encourage wandering Jew to spread as a groundcover , plant the rootball in good soil , then spread out the trailing stems , partially cover them with organic mulch , and keep the area moist . </root.v.1449><root.v.1450>Going against the mainstream in such a harsh fashion requires harsh values. Consequently , alternative has it roots in the ideals and emotions of anger , political unrest , and aggressiveness. Fairchild goes so far as to liken alternative with the " politics of the underground. " He goes on to say that alternative deals with issues of anger , confrontation , and ideology , and these ideals have been discarded by the mainstream ( 28 ) . One band demonstrated these values in their early career . </root.v.1450><root.v.1451>These plants grow flat to the ground , or almost flat. Sometimes the flower stems may be more upright but the foliage is essentially flat and ground-hugging. Also known as a mat. Many carpeting plants are evergreen. Most types will root themselves into the soil along their horizontal stems. After a couple of seasons it ' s usually possible to sneak small pieces that have already rooted themselves , and to move these to a new location to start another patch . </root.v.1451><root.v.1452>You can propagate or grow many plants by taking cuttings from mature plants and rooting them. A cutting is a piece of plant material that you cut off a mature plant and use to grow a new plant. In a few plants like begonias you can grow new plants from leaf cuttings , but we usually make cuttings from the stems of plants . </root.v.1452><root.v.1453>After a few days , check the status of your cuttings to see if they have rooted. One sure sign that the plants are rooting is new growth. Roots are a sure sign of success. ( Moldy or squishy cuttings clearly did n't work. They probably need less humidity , so next time try an aquarium with a lid for better air circulation. ) If you can pick the whole pot up by the plant stem , your cuttings have rooted. At this point they 're ready to be hardened off. " These plants are rooted , but they 're not ready to go in the garden yet , " says Silk. " They need to acclimate to wind , sunlight and that sort of thing , so I 'll put them in a protected location outside for maybe three days to a week. Let them rest in that location and get accustomed to being in an outdoor environment. " And the most gratifying part of tip cuttings is a lush garden that did n't cost an arm and a leg . </root.v.1453><root.v.1454>We have been hearing a lot about platforms and APIs recently. But not all platforms are made equal. First compare this offering with what Microsoft offered for Windows a while back. Redmond 's convoluted APIs , COM , OLE , and ActiveX still make developers shake their heads. Instead of cultivating elegance and simplicity , Microsoft pushed for complexity. Why ? Because it kept exclusivity , kept people learning new weird stuff , kept people getting new certifications. But Apple 's culture and code is rooted in elegance and extreme simplicity . </root.v.1454><root.v.1455>When the pot or tray has the required number of cuttings water them in and label them with the name of the variety ( picture 7 ) . Cover the pot or tray with a polythene or plasic top to keep in the moisture and thereby promote rooting ( picture 8 ) . During the summer the cuttings will root in a warm place. At other times of the year bottom heat of 18 degrees Centigrade should be given to the cuttings to ensure quick rooting . </root.v.1455><root.v.1456>Before my mom passed , her and I have been rooting plants in water , and then planting them in dirt for years and years , and habe never lost a single one. I have pots upon pots of gorgeous lusious plants that started out little clippings rooting in water. If it 's not broke , do n't fix it ! Rooting in water , and then planting in soil WORKS ! ! ! </root.v.1456><root.v.1457>Many native woody plants should not receive summer watering. Once they are established , they are drought tolerant in the summer , and some may be damaged by moisture at this time. It is especially important to keep water away from the crowns and larger roots of madronas and western dogwood in western Washington. They often succumb to root rot problems with summer watering. Avoid planting moisture demanding plants underneath them . </root.v.1457><root.v.1458>Keep the medium moist but not saturated with water. An air temperature of about 70 degrees F. by day and 60 degrees F. by night is best for rooting. Cuttings should root in about 3-4 weeks. Further treatment of the rooted cuttings is the same as for plants bought from commercial sources . </root.v.1458><root.v.1459>Once the weather gets colder and you have experienced at least one good hard freeze , the deciduous plants should be dormant and will have dropped their leaves , and you can now propagate them. Just make cuttings about 4 long , dip them in a rooting compound and stick them in the bed of sand. Not everything will root this way , but a lot of things will , and it takes little effort to find out what will work and what won ' t . </root.v.1459><root.v.1460> 63 : " And Zdenekv 's repeated allusions to Heidegger 's " volk " as somehow rooted in Nazism bends both Heidegger 's thought ...

The philosophy of the company is rooted deeply in community. Over the past two years , and even before that , many people , businesses and organizations have contributed to the embryonic growth of Deep Rooted. The people of a community provide the root system and collectively , whether it is individually or as a group , they all contribute to how the community branches out.

Covering with fleece or gradually increasing the ventilation of plastic bags or propagators will allow the soft leaves to develop a robust water-proof cuticle so that they can survive in lower humidity environments . </root.v.1464><root.v.1465>Within one to four weeks the cuttings should root and begin to push buds. It may take longer if the weather is cool. When shoots are at least six inches tall , the vines can be watered and fertilized with something mild like fish fertilizer , and then again on a regular basis after that . </root.v.1465><root.v.1466>Each of these assumptions are demonstrably false and have been criticized countless times by philosophers from Hume to Hegel and beyond for centuries. They have also been decisively rejected by the Catholic Church , which I think is pretty obviously rooted in Aristotelian political theory , which begins with the observation that we are social animals who live in society by our nature , not by choice . </root.v.1466><root.v.1467>48. Through their vows or other sacred bonds , religious and members of institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life intend to observe the many counsels in the Gospel , which the Lord gives his disciples to observe. Foremost among these is " that precious gift of divine grace given to some by the Father ( cf. Mt. 19 : 11; 1 Cor. 7 : 7 ) to bind themselves to God alone more easily with an undivided heart ( cf. 1 Cor. 7 : 32-34 ) in virginity or celibacy. " [ 95 ] This counsel and charism involves a genuine covenant with God , rooted in baptism , from which the profession of the evangelical counsels originates. [ 96 ] </root.v.1467><root.v.1468>It makes no difference what particular circumstances negative people blame for their negative outlook. Ultimately it ' s still a choice rooted in free will. No matter how unconscious the person was when making the decision to sink into negativity , in this moment that person still has the power to choose otherwise. So if you decide to help such a person , your primary role is to help guide him to make a more conscious choice , one that will likely be much more empowering . </root.v.1468><root.v.1469>I just do n't get these people. Maybe it is different where you are at but where I am in Central Jersey we argue and bad mouth the other local teams ( Eagles &amp;Jets ) we do n't root for them. I know this is the Northeast and there are alot of bleeding hearts but get a clue if you area Giants fan root for the Giants and wish the Jets nothing but heartbreak. I guess your rational is if you root for every team you can never lose . </root.v.1469><root.v.1470>This means that anarchists also root our arguments for socialism in a scientific analysis of tendencies within capitalism. However , in opposition to the analysis of mainstream Marxism which focuses on the objective tendencies within capitalist development , anarchists emphasis the oppositional nature of socialism to capitalism. Both the " law of value " and the " law of planning " are tendencies within capitalism , that is aspects of capitalism. Anarchists encourage class struggle , the direct conflict of working class people against the workings of all capitalism 's " laws " . This struggle produces mutual aid and the awareness that we can care best for our own welfare if we unite with others -- what we can loosely term the " law of co-operation " . This law , in contrast to the Marxian " law of planning " is based on working class subjectively and develops within society only in opposition to capitalism. As such , it provides the necessary understanding of where socialism will come from , from below , in the spontaneous self-activity of the oppressed fighting for their freedom . </root.v.1470><root.v.1471>If you are rooting cuttings in the house , place the container in a plastic bag and set it in bright light but not direct sun. Remove the plastic bag for a few minutes each day to circulate the air and prevent disease. After several weeks test the cutting for signs of root growth by tugging lightly at the stem. If it offers resistance , the cutting has rooted. Remove both the plastic bag and the source of heat. If the cutting pulls out freely , replace the bag and wait several weeks before testing the cutting again. If you have access to a greenhouse , so much the better. Its moist environment is exactly what young cuttings need. You do not need to place them in plastic bags , but frequent misting helps them root more quickly . </root.v.1471><root.v.1472>I think , for a couple weeks at least , we can forget that these guys are on teams we hate. I want USA Hockey to take it to Canada so bad and prove we belong.

I had about 60 of cuttings going last season in my green house. I had about 15 of them rooting nicely. I planted them all in the garden last fall. Most of them did not make the first winter in my garden. I should have them grow bigger before planting them in the garden. I think the one that you could just stick it in the ground is the best way to go. In addition , Kay also have the same experience that I have . </root.v.1473><root.v.1474>The next step , after cleaning the dirt off of the roots , is to pull any easily removable stems or " eyes " from the crown. After you have removed the easy divisions , wash the clump again repeat the process. Then try to pull the clump in half. To separate a single plant from the crown , use a back and forth pulling motion , working the stem back and forth until it comes loose or breaks from the crown. Keep pulling the different sections in half until you get to the number of stems you want. Sometimes it is easier to work on the plant in the bucket because the water keeps washing the soil away and provides a lubricant to allow the roots to be pulled out of the clump. If you separate the clump into nice well rooted single stem divisions , each one will produce a nice plant with one to four stems next year , all with very large leaves . </root.v.1474><root.v.1475>In his book , You 'll See It When You 'll Believe It , Dr Wayne Dyer warns against this anomalous attitude : ''If we have a scarcity mentality , " he argues , " it means that we believe in scarcity , that we evaluate our life in terms of its lacks. The theme of so many people 's life is 'I simply do not have enough ' , or 'I would be a lot happier if I had ... ' People believe that they live a life of lack because they are unlucky , instead of recognizing that their belief system is rooted in scarcity thinking. Yet as long as they live with a scarcity mentality , that is what they will attract to their lives.

There must be a spiritual foundation where the power of the Holy Ghost has anchored us deeply and firmly. The Lord has clearly seen your day. While it might be a day unlike any other in the history of the world , it is not unforseen by Him who knows all. As evil increases in the world , there is a compensating power of revelation for the righteous. The Lord said of the last days that " the whole earth shall be in commotion , " ( D &amp;C 45 : 26 ) but he has assured us that He will not leave us helpless in these conditions. If we desire it , and if we will live worthy , He will testify to us; he will burn and emblazon upon our hearts those things that are true and eternal so that we may remain grounded , rooted , established and settled in spiritual matters . </root.v.1478><root.v.1479>The blues mean different things to many people ranging from musical styles to a way of life or philosophy.

This powerful religio-political arrangement has been the prevailing context of church in Europe since the eleventh century , but it roots go back to the fourth century , when Christianity won recognition as the religion of the state with the conversion of Emperor Constantine. The church was fundamentally redefined by its new role. It changed from being a minority , prophetic community whose primary allegiance was to Christ and the Kingdom of God to a pastoral presence within the Empire. The emphasis moved from discipleship to citizenship . </root.v.1485><root.v.1486>In this method , a leaf blade or leaf with petiole is used to propagate new plants. The same steps are followed as for stem cuttings. Choose a healthy leaf from a vigorously growing plant. Cut it close to the stem with a sharp , disinfested razor or knife. Trim off 1/4 of the leaf and dip into rooting hormone , if desired. Insert the leaf into rooting medium so that 1/3 of the leaf is below the surface . </root.v.1486><root.v.1487>I said , Your new briefcase is under the table by your feet.

Measure the width and height of the rootball. You will need to dig a hole three times the width of the rootball and exactly as deep. Examine the tree : Is the trunk straight ? Are there signs of cracking , bore holes , sunken or swollen areas ? Was it recently pruned ? Are there any wounds ? Ask questions. Examine the rootball. Balled and burlapped trees should have a firm solid rootball. Container trees that are rootbound may need their roots trimmed before planting. Avoid planting bare rooted stock until spring . </root.v.1489><root.v.1490>You should plan these types of interventions carefully to address the root cause of the problem. Then implement the intervention and assess the results. If you first do not succeed , continue to assess if the root cause was identified properly. In the case study with Jennifer , the supervisor attempted to intervene , but his assessment of the root cause of the problem was incorrect. He assumed that Jennifer needed support with the analytical part of cross-selling ( knowing what to say when ) . In fact , her obstacle was much more deeply rooted in a psychological barrier. It took a different type of intervention ( the shock of not allowing her to participate in a new work activity ) to remove this mental block . </root.v.1490><root.v.1491>Note that some Passiflora cuttings will root very easily &amp;others will rot very easily. Some cuttings will even take just in water without heat or rooting powder or gel. If you lose them you have not necessarily done anything wrong. Some are reluctant either to root or to grow once rooted. For example , P. racemosa will root but not grow unless the growing tip is left on the cutting. Everyone has their own technique &amp;thanks to Jane Lindsay of UK Collection , Charlie Pridham of Roseland House UK and Ian Webb ( PSI member ) for their advice in helping me acquire mine. The best times to take cuttings for most species are in the spring or autumn. The phases of the moon are also thought by some to be important. In order they are Waxing from New Moon through First Quarter to Full Moon , &amp;Waning from Full Moon through Last Quarter to New Moon. Cuttings are thought to do better when taken when the moon is Waning , particularly in the Last Quarter . </root.v.1491><root.v.1492>Timing -- In May or early June , some varieties will have good roots in as little as two weeks. Nearly any variety can be rooted in three to four weeks at that time of year. At other times the process takes longer -- up to seven or eight weeks. There are several ways to tell whether a cutting is rooted. You can tug lightly on it , and if it resists being pulled out of the pot , it likely has roots. Also , roots growing out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot are a sure indication of success. Cuttings that are actively growing new leaves usually have roots , whereas unrooted cuttings tend not to produce much new top growth . </root.v.1492><root.v.1493>The many aspects of Hermetic Kabbalah are too detailed for the scope of this paper , so a short outline will be given. In Judaic Kabbalah , the 10 Sephiroth are understood to describe the 10 attributes of the Deity. In Hermetic Kabbalah the 10 Sephiroth also pertain to the attributes of Deity , but they utilize different symbols to describe them. The Hermetic system relates the 22 paths between the sephira to the 22 Hebrew letters , a color , a musical note ( vibration ) , an odor and a Tarot card [ 10 ] . The Golden Dawn Hermetic system assigns astrological signs in the form of planets and specific meanings to each of the Sephiroth on the " body " . The concept of the Tree of Life is long rooted in Alchemy; an early Alchemistical tree of life is shown in Figure 1 . </root.v.1493><root.v.1494>If you do n't have containers , you can fill a plastic bag such as those that wrap our newspapers with medium , wet it well , close the bag , and cut x shaped holed in which to stick the cuttings.

In spring when new sprouts appear , divide the clumps so that each has at least one sprout. Plant outdoors after frost periods have passed. Dahlias also root from softwood or leaf-bud cuttings . </root.v.1495><root.v.1496>William Barclay goes right to the very core of this shallow ground , by writing : " The Christian offer is not only a privilege , it is also a responsibility. A sudden enthusiasm can always so quickly become a dying fire. " [ 4 ] Paul warned the Colossians : " So then , just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord , continue to live in him , 7 rooted and built up in him , strengthened in the faith as you were taught , and overflowing with thankfulness " ( Colossians 2 : 7-8 ) . One 's reflection upon " rooted and built up in him " causes one to think of a tree with its deep roots in the soil. Just as a tree is deep-rooted in the soil , so Christians are to be deep-rooted in Christ. If one is deep-rooted in the faith , he or she serves God out of gratitude for what God has done for humanity in and through Jesusa life " overflowing with thankfulness. " . Every believer will always praise God from whom all blessings flow. James Montgomery Boice 's words are well worth reflecting upon : </root.v.1496><root.v.1497>Further research on strengthening the root systems of nursery stock developed from rooted stem cuttings holds much interest and promise. It would seem that a greater distance than 4 to 6 inches between whorls of roots developed from the base of the cutting and from the ring would offer great advantages , particularly if the roots could be initiated before transplanting to the orchard , thus removing the uncertainty that the lower scaffold of roots might die because of the ringing. Perhaps ringing or notching above ground followed by deep mounding , or even a form of marcottage , while the trees are in the nursery , row might be practical . </root.v.1497><root.v.1498>Life is first dumb inconscient will rooted in the physical energy; inconscient , and subject to mechanical forces. This is reflected in the necessity of the separative ego , and to survive. ( 2 ) Then there is a movement to break the bounds of one 's self toward interaction with others. This reflects the compulsion of Nature to fuse our individual selves with others. At this second poise of life there is death , mutual devouring , desire , and the need to expand , conquer , and possess. This is a movement to the vital proper , away from the physical. ( 3 ) The third poise of life is a movement towards conscious mind in life. In this stage there is the conscious movement towards commonality , mutuality , harmony , etc. In its higher aspects it is vitally reflected as the ability to be self giving towards others , and to feel love. ( Paraphrase of Sri Aurobindo ) </root.v.1498><root.v.1499>Now , the trick is patience. Depending on the plant you ' ve taken the cutting from , rooting can take from two weeks to months , but your coleus should root in a couple of weeks. Mist the cuttings at least once a day as mist on the foliage reduces transpiration and wilting. The soil should remain moist , but not wet and you should never pull the cutting to see if it ' s rooted. Control yourself. In time you ' ll learn how long any given plant will take to root at certain times of the year , then you ' ll know when to give that testing tug . </root.v.1499><root.v.1500>( Note that , contrary to a common misconception , rooting is not synonymous with an extremely low stance. You can be rooted in a very low stance or in a moderately low stance.

Some may have their leaf growth collapse because there are not enough roots to support the plant. Do not pull these out ! They may still root. The others will develop roots as they leaf out. Keep the nursery bed well weeded ! Competition from weeds will slow rooting and delay good results. Keep the rooting bed moist , but not soaking wet. Light shade in the summer may be necessary in areas with high summer temperatures. Fertilizer is not necessary. Should you desire to give a light feeding , use a fertilizer that is LOW in nitrogen. Nitrogen can cause lush top growth at the expense of roots. We want roots the first year , not lush growth. 5-10-5 at strength is adequate. We do not fertilize ours at all the first year . </root.v.1502><root.v.1503>Music was thus essentially the great mediator between heaven and earth , or the cosmos and the State. It bound the one to the other. As an emanation of the celestial it fecundated the social. As a symbol of human perfection it forced , by the law of sympathetic resonance ( the basis of magic ) , the celestial energies to embody themselves into the guardians and organizers of the State. It transfigured manmade laws into cosmic harmony. It balanced all forces into a perfect " syntony " wherein every tone was fulfilling its cosmic function , each restrained by all , all fortified by the individual strength of each. On such a music rooted in the fundamental tone of Nature itself , was erected the wonderful structure of the old Chinese civilization and culture , which , though being outwardly disrupted now , will be transferred to the patrimony of the new race , perhaps on other shores , perhaps on a new continent . </root.v.1503><root.v.1504>We recommend waiting until the sod is completely rooted before you mow your sod for the first time. Depending on the weather and time of year , sod may be well-rooted within 3 weeks. Spring and fall installations may even be rooted before 10 days ! We suggest testing the sod before mowing. Go into the yard and try to pull various pieces of sod from the ground. If the sod comes up easily , wait until another day to mow it. If the sod throughout the yard is well-anchored and does n't come off the ground with a strong tug , go ahead and start your mower ! We recommend that the first mowing is done at the highest blade height of your mower ( and a walk-behind mower is best for this first mowing ) . Also , plan to lower the blade height gradually if you want to mow the lawn lower than the highest blade height of your mower. ( Do n't scalp the grass at subsequent mowings ! ) We suggest never cutting more than one quarter of the total plant 's blade height off in one mowing . </root.v.1504><root.v.1505>Cactus are so easily rooted , and such survivors.

One is rooted , stubbornly and perversely , in the very origins of the American experience itself. None of the 17th-century adventurers who made the appalling transit of the north Atlantic to the New World did so because they were happy , contented , and at peace with the world. They were a general sampling of Europe 's unwanted riff-raff precisely the sort who had every reason to look on the world darkly , as a place full of vast evil powers ( the slavers , the shanghiers , the landlords , the pope ) who had suppressed the truth in unrighteousness. This is what Richard Hofstadter delighted in calling " the paranoid style , " and its devotees are as varied as the detectives of the Popish Plot and the hawkers of conspiracy magazines on Dealey Plaza.

In contrast to the Yucatec ceremony , baptism took place soon after birth. However , the Aztec rite was also associated with purification , to remove any pollution acquired from the parents. During the ritual bathing , the infant was named and presented with the tools necessary for adult life. These practices are consistent with Book of Mormon teachings. These Mesoamerican practices could have been rooted anciently in true baptism by immersion for cleansing and purification , later corrupted by man-made doctrines that evolved toward baptism of infants to wash away the sins of parents. The Priesthood ceremony of blessing and naming infants could have been combined with corrupted infant baptism to yield the practice of the Aztecs. Or these practices could have developed independently of what the Nephites and Lamanites did. But it 's absolutely incorrect to assert that baptism was unknown to Native Americans. Forms of it were known that are at least consistent with the Book of Mormon . </root.v.1514><root.v.1515>Making rooted cuttings is very simple.

From work in eucalyptus species and selections important in forestry , it is known that certain ones will root very readily and confer this ability to hybrid progenies , while others can not be rooted at all. But rooting of less vigorous ornamental species has hardly been studied.

With our research centers , horticultural institutions and foundations continuing their momentous advances in chemistry , it may be that in years to come we will root even the most fastidious cultivars almost instantaneously or at the most , in a few days.

Don t be put off by books that say that a particular plant is difficult to root  you ve got nothing to lose , so give it a go ! </root.v.1535><root.v.1536>Layer ramblers and other roses to make new plants. Ramblers have long , limber canes that can be tied to a fence or trellis like a climbing rose. These flexible canes make them perfect for layering. Notch the bark beneath the stem , remove nearby leaves , pin the stem to the ground , and mound over it with soil.Once rooted and cut free from the mother plant , you 'll have a new plant growing on its own roots. It will have no need for graft protection ! </root.v.1536><root.v.1537>Rooting hormones speed the rate of rooting , increase root number on the cuttings and , in many cases spell the difference between success and failure in rooting. The softer the tissue ( softwood to hardwood ) , the lower the concentration that should be used. If liquid quick dip materials are being used , a concentration of 500 to 1000 ppm IBA is usually adequate. For difficult to root species a concentration of 3000 to 5000 ppm is often used. On some really difficult species hormones as high as 15 , 000 ppm are sometimes used . </root.v.1537><root.v.1538>Adopting certain habits and practices can help guard against letting our dynamically optimistic thinking deteriorate into the more common passive form. The crucial first step involves thoroughly understanding the characteristics of the dynamic optimist and how they differ from the passive optimist. Once that understanding has been absorbed deep down , we will find it easier to detect and prevent the infiltration of passive thinking. As part of regular daily and weekly meditation and life-review habits , we can check our recent thinking and behavior. Regular sessions for setting personal goals and priorities provide an opportunity for a reality check. These sessions give us a quiet time in which to reassess short-term and long-term goals and the effectiveness of the means being used. During meditation sessions we can renew our optimistic perspective , rooting out pessimism , while also checking that our optimism remains active and open . </root.v.1538><root.v.1539>I know this sounds crazy , but rooting cuttings this way does work. To increase your chances of success you can cover the butt ends of the cuttings with moist peat moss before filling in the hole. Make sure you wet the peat moss thoroughly , then just pack it on the butt ends of the cuttings . </root.v.1539><root.v.1540>Once the rooted cuttings are all potted up , water them well using one teaspoon of Vitamin B1 to one gallon of water. I use Hi-Yield Vitamin B1 with Alpha-Naphthalene Acetic Acid which is a vitamin-hormone formulation designed to stop transplant shock and promote plant growth. It stimulates root development of bedding plants , potted , plants , bare root roses , rooted cuttings , shrubs and trees. Thoroughly saturate the soil around the plants. Re-apply weekly until the plants are well established and then apply on a monthly basis . </root.v.1540><root.v.1541>Easy to grow floater that travels along the surface.

Like Caribbean Voodoo , it places the responsibility for the evil intent in a criminals heart in the gun , an object of metal , wood and plastic. This belief relieves them of focusing on accountability and responsibility of the miscreant. The liberals think evil and crime would not exist if there were no guns. Of course , they completely ignore that fact that violent crime happens with a plethora of weapons other than firearms and did long before firearms existed. Voodoo is the belief that inanimate objects have power to force humans to behave in a certain way against their will. To liberals , no one is responsible for what they do. The Liberals may not be sticking pins in dolls , but they believe in Voodoo. The Liberal gun control agenda is not rooted in social and community improvement. Simply stated : it is that they know they can not impose their marxist/socialist rule upon armed citizens without a fight. It 's really that simple. Their concern about crime is quite limited , in that all they want is to disarm the populace for their own agenda. It 's not going to happen here . </root.v.1542><root.v.1543>How about all those skillful means , as well as the teachings of perfect liberation and enlightenment within a single life-time , as taught by Vajrayana ? These are usually all the main " attractions " of Vajrayana , and so what should we do about this ? Particularly , when we are at the moment of death , the " single thought " will determine whether we will be liberated or to continue on with samsara. To be or not to be , that is the question ? Thus , this set of lectures is the first of a series entitled " Series on the Practice of Tibetan Buddhism " , the contents of which touch upon the interplay and the interface of the Dharma practice with our everyday life. " All Dharma practices are rooted in life itself " , and so how to practice the Dharma , how to maintain our pure intention as well as our pure awareness , in our everyday life experiences will be the main focus of these lectures . </root.v.1543><root.v.1544>Modern psychology is rooted in a false pretense. This pretense is that man can find the solutions to his problems within himself. Many who are connected with psychology ( both Christians and non-Christians ) are taught to have the counselee determine the answers for themselves , to remain aloof from the counselee and turn all questions that are asked them back to questions for the one being counseled to answer from within their own being. Man can solve his own problems if given the right tools. This , however , is an anti-biblical line of thought . </root.v.1544><root.v.1545>One good thing about this year 's SuperBowl match-up is that we do n't have to hear those pesky Patriots and Steelers fans running off at the mouth.

Finding them sweet and blessed , it would be indifferent to all else , with no taste for anything else; and even moreit would find anything else revolting. All of man 's spiritual activity centers in the heart. The truths are impressed in it , and good dispositions are rooted into it. But its main work is developing a taste for the spiritual , as we have shown. When the mind sees the whole spiritual world and its different components , various good beginnings ripen in the will. The heart , under their influence , should taste sweetness in all of this and radiate warmth. This delight in the spiritual is the first sign of the regeneration of a soul deadened by sin. Therefore the heart 's development is a very important point even in the early stages . </root.v.1554><root.v.1555>Further , while all T'ai Chi literature acknowledges the significance of the root , conventional wisdom states that one should root in the " bubbling-well " point , which lies just lateral and to the back of the ball of the foot. The bubbling-well is the beginning of the kidney meridian in Chinese medicine. It is important for health and energy circulation , but not as useful as the root of dynamic physical action as are the three nails. Energy coming from the bubbling-well , for example , is not capable of producing the movements of T'ai Chi Ch'uan or other physical activities. You want this point to be open for health , but play your movements from the nails . </root.v.1555><root.v.1556> Their root systems are no good - only true if the cuttings were poorly rooted or had their roots badly restricted in a container. When rooting is stimulated with auxins ( A 40 ) , the root systems can be even better developed than those of seedlings. ( Note that main vertical roots are seldom necessary for either ( Manual 3 ) . ) </root.v.1556><root.v.1557>Removal of the support ropes or cables should be done as soon as the tree is well rooted usually in the second season. Stronger trunks develop in trees allowed to sway with the breezes , but firm root establishment is the priority concern . </root.v.1557><root.v.1558>Every plant has different watering requirements , so you must keep a close watch while you determine an irrigation schedule. For example , shallow rooted annuals may require more frequent watering of shorter duration. Plants pick up water and minerals through tiny root structures called root hairs. These structures are sensitive to water loss , so they should not be allowed to completely dry out. Check the soil moisture by digging test holes in the area in question. If dry soil is invading the root zone , it 's time to apply more water. After a few test holes , you will probably have familiarized yourself with the state of your soil moisture , so you will be able to guess more accurately in the future. A general rule of thumb is when the first two to three inches of soil begin to dry out , it 's time to irrigate again; particularly with the least drought tolerant plants . </root.v.1558><root.v.1559>4. The major benefit of an adjustable misting program is its flexibility in the growing stages of the plant. When propagated in an aeroponic chamber , newly clipped clones need to be constantly misted until rooted with a dome on top to trap humidity to the plant leaves. Once rooted , the root system needs nutrients. The nutrient interval cycles are determined in vegetative and flowering stages by root temperature. As the plant matures , the plant leaves will begin to shadow the growing chamber , reducing temperature , allowing decreasing misting time. By utilizing this procedure , the plant is allowed more oxygen intake to the root hair between feedings , achieving faster and bushier growth. In flowering , the importance of oxygen intake to the root system is staggering. Plants will go from looking beautiful to looking sick and death is inevitable from oxygen starvation . </root.v.1559><root.v.1560>But the achievement of such ideals seems to be about as far away as it ever was. Recognition has not led to realization. Indeed , one wonders sometimes whether even the ideal may not yet be abandoned entirely as totally unrealistic , as unrealistic as the ideals which gave birth to the League of Nations. And in any case , such ideals are not the result of cultural evolution but are rooted ultimately within the Judeo-Christian religious philosophy : they originated as the result of divinely inspired thinking. Without the sustaining inspiration there seems little hope of their remaining viable. It seems highly unlikely that they would ever have arisen merely by the process of historic development , because they are manifestly so unrealistic and unworkable as human nature is presently constituted . </root.v.1560><root.v.1561>" There can be no truly moral choice unless that choice is made in freedom; similarly , there can be no really firmly grounded and consistent defense of freedom unless that defense is rooted in moral principle.

It has not yet been deter mined whether this trait is genetically controlled ( dominant or recessive ) , but efforts to develop a true-breeding strain of creepers are meeting with partial success. This phenotype appears when the main stalk of the seedling has grown to about 1 meter ( 3 feet ) in height. It then begins to bend at approximately the middle of the stalk , up to 700 from the vertical , usually in the direction of the sun. Sub sequently , the first limbs sag until they touch the ground and begin to grow back up. In extremely loose mulch and humid conditions the limbs will occasionally root along the bottom surface. Possibly as a result of increased light exposure , the primary limbs continue to branch once or twice , creating wide frond-like limbs of buds resembling South Indian strains. This phenotype usually produces very high flower yields. The leaves of these creeper phenotype plants are nearly always of medium size with 7-11 long , narrow , highly serrated leaflets . </root.v.1570><root.v.1571>Great guide , but I do have a question or two.

First I slice into the block a few times to help get rid of the excess water and then I carefully push the cutting into a hole at the top. Be care that no powder falls off the cutting tip and make sure it fits snugly into the hole otherwise you will need to squeeze it closed a bit. Thereafter I place the blocks of rock wool with the cuttings under a clear plastic dome in which the cuttings will be able to take root.

Starting out with an undialectical appreciation of the Communist Manifesto , they assume that because Marx wrote , " The bourgeoisie can not exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production , and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society , " it is necessary to stand with the bourgeoisie against every local initiative that would impede this process.

Place the fresh cuttings into a glass or jar of the water , submerging the exposed nodes but not allowing any foliage to be in the water. It can be helpful to drop a clear plastic bag over the cuttings and the glass to increase humidity while the stems are rooting. Do n't seal the bag , however , as air circulation must be present to avoid rotting. The bag can be supported over the cuttings with wood plant stakes or dowels , so air can circulate from underneath. Place the cuttings in bright , indirect light away from full sun while they are rooting.

I set it in the window over the sink and rinse it a couple times a week. Even though it is scrubbed good it will need the water changed regularly or it will get smelly and will attract fruit flies. When the seed opens and starts showing signs of growth I move it to another container and start adding potting soil until it is growing in full soil like any other plant . As it grows it increase the size of the container. I have rooted and grown several but I can not keep them living through the winter. When I bring them in they go into shock and no matter how hard I try they are compost by the next spring. I have two very pretty ones now but I need help to keep them living. Gloria </root.v.1601><root.v.1602>Hydrangea anomala ssp. petiolaris is more difficult to root especially after the wood has ripened. Two methods ( 4 ) have proven successful in propagating this species. Non-flowering shoots of soft wood have root initials along the stem that serve as aerial roots to enable the vine to cling to a vertical support. These shoots are placed in a well-drained rooting medium and roots will develop at the site of the initials. A second method imitates French or continuous layering in which the stock plant is planted in open ground and the stems are pegged down onto sandy soil. H. anomala ssp. petiolaris does not require any trenching or mounding-up and will produce vertical shoots with roots from the pegged stem . </root.v.1602><root.v.1603>All of creation is rooted in the four basic elements.

But what are the real needs that must be satisfied to live rich , fulfilling lives ? This is the question David Suzuki explores in this wide-ranging study. Suzuki begins by presenting the concept of people as creatures of the Earth who depend on its gifts of air , water , soil , and sun energy. He shows how people are genetically programmed for the company of other species , and suffer enormously when we fail to live in harmony with them. And he analyzes those deep spiritual needs , rooted in nature , that are also a crucial component of a loving world.

Truth , long hidden , is being brought into the light , and with it entire people groups are being liberated from the chains of traditions.

Revenge is rooted in a sense of real or perceived injustice towards the perpetrator of the shooting and injustice is the feeling that ' I should have something that I don ' t'. Many school shootings are fomented by a desire for revenge against society and a simmering anger over being denied an entitlement such as respect or personal recognition . </root.v.1618><root.v.1619>Different plants have different methods in which rooting cuttings should be done. Houseplants usually need water and a jam jar like container. Outdoor plants and perennials such as fuchsias and geraniums usually need compost or mixtures of peat , sand or grit.

The late , great Imam Khomeini announced that we would forget all that happened in the past. The Imam said that we would like to have friendly relationships with all the world countries , except for the apartheid regime in South Africa at that time and the Zionist regime. But unfortunately , the government of the United States and some European countries , instead of using this historic opportunity to make friends with the Iranian nation , chose to stand up against it. Everyday people were confronted with a new conspiracy shaped against their demands , the revolution and their popular leader. When our nation , looked into these , it saw that many of these are rooted in the U.S. Embassy. [ We were a ] lonely nation , a nation which had no mass media in its possession [ because ] all the mass media were connected with the U.S. and the Zionists were against this nation.

I am going to try it again , but in smaller containers . </root.v.1621><root.v.1622>African violet leaves may also be rooted in water using a dark-colored container such as a tablet bottle or a film cassette box of an appropriate size. Clear containers should be avoided , as the cut end of a leaf petiole will curl towards the brightest side of such a container. A small square of aluminum foil is secured over the top of the container after it is about three quarters filled with water. The trimmed base of the petiole is pushed thorough a central hole in the foil , and should be positioned so it is barely touching the water; it is therefore essential to top up the water level if evaporation occurs. It is not advisable to allow roots to grow longer than 0.5in ( 1cm ) before potting the leaf into a small pot of compost , as longer roots are water roots and do not convert easily to compost roots. Leaves with water roots when potted into compost do not proceed quickly to plantlet production , in fact not until compost roots have grown; so the time spent producing those long water roots has in effect been wasted . </root.v.1622><root.v.1623>Although we obtained rather fair results with winter cuttings it is not going to stop us from continuing work on including other factors which have large impact on rooting of cuttings. We choose vegetative reproduction using cuttings , although there are other methods. The main reason is that by rooting of cuttings using standard methods of individual selection for choosing matter trees we could provide initial basis for mass production of rooted cuttings with a final objective to establish plantations . </root.v.1623><root.v.1624>You can either use the medium directly in the tray or use individual pots of medium for each cutting then set in the tray. Both have advantages and disadvantages. Just filling the tray with medium is easier and can be refilled over and over. However , in my experience if you root this way you end up with parts of the tray and different varieties of begonias growing at different rates. You usually end up with half of the tray potted up already and the rest still waiting. If you propagate continuous and keep refilling the tray as you take things out , it will work fine though. Another disadvantage is getting or keeping the medium to the correct dampness without being too wet. It ' s also hard to keep the cuttings separated by variety as they grow unless you ' re careful to make clear separations and labeling . </root.v.1624><root.v.1625>Feeling a strong connection to trees in my spiritual work , my sadness is immense. The tree spirit felt quite invisible in light of being used repeatedly as a weapon without consent. Often when the same traumas are inflicted repeatedly , patterns that were once external become internalized unconsciously. That is what I am seeing , in threads of your sister-in-laws ' erratic life force and that of this tree. Despite its own victimization , the tree communicated deep guilt around being used for harm , though as Nature spirits often do , she released her anxiety and was well healed by your sister-in-law ' s High Self. The entire area around the tree became enlivened and warmer , considering it was the middle of winter in a continuously cold climate. I saw the tree ' s life force move well above it into Source , and recommit to rooting itself deep into Earth ' s energy. I feel this reconnection with Universal life force will be reflected somewhat in your sister-in-law ' s life force . </root.v.1625><root.v.1626>The wonderment also , is that did you ever notice , that the top of the trees are usually so perfectly shaped.

He found them all corrupt trees , but to those who believed in His Name , He gave power to become the sons of God. Whosoever then now is a good man , that is , a good tree , was found corrupt , and made good. And if when He came He had chosen to root up the corrupt trees , what tree would have remained which did not deserve to be rooted up ? But He came first to impart mercy , that He might afterwards exercise judgment , to whom it is said , I will sing unto You O Lord , of mercy and judgment. He gave then remission of sins to those who believed in Him , He would not even take account with them of past reckonings. He gave remission of sins , He made them good trees. He delayed the ax , He gave security . </root.v.1628><root.v.1629>Ornamental sweet potatoes , Ipomoea batatas , make a lovely ground cover or do well cascading over hanging baskets or the edges of large containers. There are several different varieties , including 'Blackie ' with deeply cut leaves of darkest burgundy , 'Marguerite ' with heart-shaped leaves of bright chartreuse , a new 'Vardaman ' with plum covered heart-shaped leaves , and a 'Pink Frost ' which is tricolored with green , pink , and cream. The latter is less vigorous , as all variegated plants tend to be. The foliage has the deepest color in full sun but it also does well in partial shade. Cuttings root so easily you can root them in water. Now and then there are a few little pink flowers , but not often. If you dig around them , you will find some tubers underneath which are edible. The one serious problem this plant can have is its attraction for slugs and snails. I find watering with soaping water fairly often will help immensely , but even in the best gardens there are some holey leaves. ( I could n't help the pun . ) </root.v.1629><root.v.1630>Of course , plants are rooted in one spot. Where animals can range far and wide seeking water , food , and companionship , plants cannot. Yet , in their own way , plants are every bit as dynamic as animals , maybe more so. They respond to their environment rapidly and reversibly in ways that could be termed behavior . This is seen not only in plants ' ability to sense up and down or where light comes from but also in their capacity to manipulate their environment chemically. Plants use an astonishing array of chemicals to influence their world , from defense against enemy plant pathogens and herbivores to acquisition of nutrients. What we call allelopathy is just one facet of this. Our conception of allelopathy as discrete and unconnected with the numerous other chemical interactions that plants engage in is artificial and limits our ability to model and clearly understand allelopathy . </root.v.1630><root.v.1631>A.

With a clean knife cut the rhizome in pieces with one or more Isaves , dip in rooting hormone and place the pieces at a slant in the medium.

It ca n't be separated from tai chi training. A good root depends on a subtle appreciation of the same tai chi qualities as the rest of the art : tuck-in , head suspended , loose , round , connected , and relaxed. The horse stance and other exercises in nei kung are the frame for rooting and flexibility , the tai chi form is the movement , and pushhands is the yielding , responding power. Our practice in cotton slippers on a smooth wood floor teaches good rooting because there 's so little traction to rely on. Without the traction , you 'll slip if you 're not rooted , whereas you can cheat if you have better footing.

We are rooted in love from the moment that we know Jesus , He being our Root who is the Lord of love. The Lamb who is the Root of David , is the Tree of life to our souls. On that Root the Church already grew in God 's purposes before the worlds. But our Foundation is likewise Christ , God 's elect and precious Stone.

Carefully place the stem in the hole and firm the potting mix around it. The cuttings will root best with temperatures between 60 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Put them in a bright area , but out of direct sunlight. Grow-lights indoors are fine , or on a sheltered porch. The cuttings should form roots in 3 to 4 weeks. When they start to put on new growth , they have rooted , and can be hardened off for planting in the garden.

Indeed , he believes in the 'splendor of common morality ' ( Paul Ramsay ) , which is the main way God restrains evil in the world. He does call it virtue and not sham. Nevertheless , there is a profound tension at the heart of common virtue. We just said that the main reason people are honest is due to fear and pride. But what is the main reason we are dishonest ? Why do we lie ? Almost always -- it is out of fear or pride. So in common virtue , you have not done anything to root out the fundamental causes of evil. In 'common honesty ' you have restrained the heart , but not changed the heart. You are doing an ingenious form of judo on yourself. ( Judo depends on using the enemy 's forward motion against him. ) You have 'jury-rigged ' the heart so that the basic causes of dishonesty are being used to make yourself honest. But this is quite a fragile condition. At some point you will find that honesty is not practical or humiliating and you will lie. Then you will be shocked.

' </root.v.1641><root.v.1642>Remember that the medium you use contains no nutrients , so as soon as the plants are solidly rooted , you should either pot them up to a good soil or add a little food to the medium. Keep in mind that the plants are tender , having grown under protective cover , and will need hardening off to the elements before planting out. You can do this by putting them in a cold frame , with the cover ( the British term for cover here is lights ) off during the day , or by planting them in a nursery row with a protective row cover on during the night and stormy or windy days. If you inserted your cuttings directly on the ground , you can of course just leave them there until you are ready to put them in the garden , but remember that the plants are only a few inches apart , and will soon become overcrowded. Also when you move plants rooted directly in the ground , remember that each little piece of root you leave behind when you move them is potentially a new plant. This can result in a real mess for your next bunch of cuttings if you are n't careful . </root.v.1642><root.v.1643>When you receive your cuttings , make sure that there is no rot on them. The young leaves and new green shoots are the most likely to rot , especially if they 've spent several weeks in the mail system on overseas trips. The sphagnum moss your cuttings are packed in contains natural fungicides and a lot of moisture , both of which prolong the storage life considerably. Cuttings will easily survive 2-3 weeks in these condition , but even after 5 weeks they have come out alright. If you are not ready to strike your cuttings straight away , please maintain them in the closed bag they came in.

However , it was not until just over 100 years ago that public administration became a formal field of study in North America. This movement was lead by thinkers known as the Progressives -namely men like Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , and Frederick Taylor. The Progressives view of public administration was that there was one best way to govern the people. Their works focussed on setting up a system of administration that was rooted in this one best way of thinking . </root.v.1648><root.v.1649>If the plant is large and out of shape , severe pruning will not always bring it back to its original beauty. If this is the case , it is best to take cuttings and start new plants which can be controlled and shaped into specimen plants. After the cuttings are rooted , plant them in a 3- to 5-inch pot , using a sterilized potting mixture. With good care , in a few months ' time , you will have a plant that is much more desirable than the plant you started with. Also , you will find that the smaller plants , besides looking more attractive , will take less space and need less care.

Nevertheless , this definition includes : ( i ) the concept that time is a natural element ( entity ); ( ii ) that itself-replicates; ( iii ) that it is matter-dependent; and ( iv ) that the change in the dimensional time of matter depends on it. In order to eliminate the tautology , we need to differentiate between naturally replicating time ( time-element; the replicating entity ) and dimensional time , in which the time-element is converted ( to a certain extent , expressed ) . </root.v.1652><root.v.1653>Phones are coming out from different manufacturers , from different carriers , and with different levels of support by Google.

The more I become acquainted with Christians , the more I am struck with their weakness in love. Their religion is not rooted and grounded in love. Many professed Christians are , to say the least , much of their time away from the spirit of love. There is a want of that universal love to God and man which gives to religion an unction , and makes it grateful both to God and man. If they had this unction of love at their first conversion , they seem to lose it and become legal. Then some of the forms of religious duty remain and some of the forms of humanity and human sympathy; but the spirit of genuine love is lacking. It is infinitely important to be rooted and grounded in love.

Thus , it would appear that whatever is for me , is now; and , needless to say , whatever is of importance or whatever is meaningful for me , is of importance or is meaningful now. This is true even if that which is important and meaningful for me is located in the " past " or in the " future. " Existential time is time lived in the now. My existence is rooted in a " living present , " and it is within this " living present " that my life unfolds and discloses itself.

How can we say we have faith , when we demonstrates no change in our life and we continue to willfully give our lives over to sin. Today we have totally cheapened the responsibility to the obedience of the Lordship of Jesus Christ. We have stripped Him of His rank and authority over the recipients of His salvation. Our whole plan of salvation has become a theological fiasco , it is rooted in the numbers game of the success-oriented church. Do n't let the crowds fool you , the majority is almost always wrong.

Based on Principles of mathematics and physics , three points determine a plane , and three basic colors combine to make all others.

On the left , there have been a few recurring themes that define the way many look at the universities and students. These themes have received much agreement between a diverse array of theorists and activists who may agree upon little else. The first seems to be a vulgar idea that students are " privileged " because of their location in the university or because of their parent 's income level. Such labels as " petit bourgeois " or " middle class " often explicitly or implicitly resound in discussions of students. This one-dimensional thinking has great parlance among students themselves as well who have come to believe that their roles as students are insignificant because of a presumed privilege and thereby prefer to identify with other groups ( waged workers , " minorities , " black South Africans etc. ) who are perceived to be more exploited or less privileged.

Nevertheless , Freire 's belief that there is data demonstrating that people have learned to read and learned to read in a problem-posing way itself poses its own series of questions , that is , what drives the program beneath its politics , what transcends the interests of instructors and students , what is the particular method of application , and why does it work </root.v.1716><root.v.1717>Sometimes , the plastic bag will lose its air and collapse. When this happens , remove the twist tie and blow it up again. When the cuttings start to root , you will be able to see roots through the plastic bag.

Bristly mallow will root at nodes along the under side of the stems which appear as knobs. The leaves are similar to Venice mallow , but have more lobes on the leaf : six to seven versus three to five on Venice mallow. The margin of the leaves is toothed. Bristly mallow has a deep strong tap root. The flower of bristly mallow is an orange-red in color and appears in late spring to early summer. The flower is cup shaped and is located in the junction of the stem and leaf. Bristly mallow spreads by seed and by stoloniferous stems. Bristly mallow is found in the lower Piedmont and coastal plain region of the Southeast , from Virginia to Florida. It can also be found in the gulf states west to Texas . </root.v.1718><root.v.1719>Some people try to rationalize sin by convincing themselves that a particular sin might be the loving thing to do in a certain situation. However , they are only deceiving themselves , for God ' s commandments are in perfect accord with love , and can be summarized as love for both God and man. God ' s law forbids all sexual activity outside of marriage because all such sexual activity outside of marriage is selfish self-gratification that is rooted in contempt for both God and the other person. Our sinful heart would like to convince us otherwise , but that is the word of Satan and Satan is a liar , and those who excuse and encourage sin are enemies of God and apostles of hate.

A runner is a slender stem that originates in a leaf axil and grows along the ground or downward from a hanging basket , producing a new plant at its tip. Plants that produce stolons or runners are propagated by severing the new plants from their parent stems. Plantlets at the tips of runners may be rooted while still attached to the parent , or detached and placed in a rooting medium. Examples : strawberry , spider plant . </root.v.1720><root.v.1721>Rooting entails the use of the ground as a lever , not only when clashing with an opponent but even in the simple act of walking. One should have spring energy ( potential or kinetic ) in the feet at all times. The bend in the legs , in addition to providing a low center of gravity for stability , creates a coiled spring effect. Upon uncoiling , the energy is generally forward , not upward. A rooted boxer is ready to explode forward ( in a variety of directions ) at any instant. The angle between the pushing foot and the tan tien determines the potential for this " spring " . </root.v.1721><root.v.1722>MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE MULCHER VULTURE INVENTION !

Remove the wig by rolling the edge of the wig backwards on to a pencil. This method gives a better grip and leverage as the glue that the wig is put on with makes it really hard to take the wig off. When the wig is removed , there will be a mold line and a hole. The mold line can be sanded off and the hole is either filled with sculpey and rooted into or glue a piece of felt in the inside of the head where the hole is and root through the felt. Lee Middletons can be either wigged or rooted , they are darling no matter what you do . </root.v.1725><root.v.1726>So , go forth and propagate.

Begin to propagate greenhouse plants by cuttings; also coleuses by cuttings in heat , potting them off as soon as rooted . </root.v.1728><root.v.1729>Rose cuttings can also be rooted outdoors in beds of well-prepared soil , as long as the beds are not in full sun. Prepare the cuttings as you would for rooting in containers , and keep the air around them moist until they take root. You can do this by daily misting or by covering plants with plastic film stretched over a frame or glass jars. The plastic or glass will retain much of the soil moisture , but check for dryness and add water as soon as the ground starts to dry out. Test the cuttings for rooting , and remove the plastic or glass when rooting is complete. Apply extra winter protection to get the plants through the first winter , because young rooted cuttings are more vulnerable to the cold than mature plants. Cuttings can be moved to their permanent positions the following spring . </root.v.1729><root.v.1730>IQ-challenged though I am , I am forever a Steelers fan , being Pennsylvania born and bred.

Clump-forming perennial plants can be divided into several pieces. Stems of some kinds of plants can be rooted while still attached to the mother plant. This is called layering. Some plants can be propagated equally well in several ways. For example , lantana can be grown from seed ( flower color will vary ); started from cuttings , either in soil or in water; or propogated via layering . </root.v.1741><root.v.1742>Needless to say , I strongly support the Senate 's giving President Bush the authority to root out and destroy the heinous terrorists responsible for such brutality and also , of course , the governments harboring them.

After rooting was well underway , they were transplanted to 6 inch standard plastic pots containing Vergro or a mixture of Canadian peat and pine bark ( 1 : 1 by volume ) . Each potting medium was amended with dolomitic lime and Micromax at the recommended rate. All plants received nitrogen ( from NH4NO3 ) and phosphorous ( from H3PO4 ) in the irrigation water once a week. Potassium treatments were also added to the irrigation water ( from KC1 ) for those treatments receiving potassium. Treatments were set up in a factorial experiment with two potting media ( Vergro and 1 : 1 ) and two potassium treatments ( none and recommended level ) . Ten replicate pots were used for each of the four treatments. The first test was conducted between May and December 1990 and the second test between December 1990 and May 1991.

Transplanting stresses trees and shrubs. Such stress may cause plants to die or to become unattractive. Plants which are already in advanced stages of decline are especially likely to succumb to transplantation stress. Often a young nursery-grown plant will resume growth sooner than an older transplanted tree or shrub and will provide more long-term benefits in the new planting location. Shrubs have better transplant tolerance than trees , deciduous plants better than evergreens , shallow rooted species better than deep rooted species , and younger plants better than older plants. Some species tend to withstand transplanting better than others ( Table ) . When deciding whether or not to transplant a tree or shrub , or to start over with a young plant , consider the species transplant tolerance , condition of the plant , season to transplant , new planting site conditions , the equipment needed , and follow-up care . </root.v.1748><root.v.1749>When you root your self in something permanent , then your sense of self is effectively untouchable.

" But the toast had become a meaningless , empty ritual , and success in the world had blinded the Jews to the words of their own prophets. It was not so much the fact that they had denied their own Jewishness as it was the fact that they wanted to have the best of both worlds - the wealth that their success in Europe had brought them , as well as their own Jewish heritage.

Sangye menla , the " Medicine Buddha " is viewed as the source of medical teachings and the inspiration for correct practice as a physician. The three mental poisons - attachment , anger , and closed-mindedness - are produced by ignorance along with the power of karma ( the idea that the course of our lives is the result of our own past actions and our own present doings ) .

All of man 's spiritual activity centers in the heart. The truths are impressed in it , and good dispositions are rooted into it. But its main work is developing a taste for the spiritual , as we have shown. When the mind sees the whole spiritual world and its different components , various good beginnings ripen in the will. The heart , under their influence , should taste sweetness in all of this and radiate warmth. This delight in the spiritual is the first sign of the regeneration of a soul deadened by sin.

It 's easy to do , too. The upright types form suckers up to 10 feet from the parent so you can just dig up the well-rooted young shoots in the spring and move them. Trailing blackberries will root where the tip of a cane touches the ground , making a new plant in no time. But do n't accept donated plants unless you 're sure your neighbor 's patch is healthy . </root.v.1778><root.v.1779>If you order from a catalog , be prepared to receive your plants bare rooted in a plastic bag with minimal material to keep the rose plant/s moist. If you have never purchased bare rooted roses , there is nothing to fear because handling and planting is not difficult. ( See Planting below ) By ordering bare rooted plants your selection is infinitely better and the price will be significantly less than you would pay for garden center varieties of like quality . </root.v.1779><root.v.1780>This is has to be the best kept home-based business secret there is.

Humility is accepting that others are more important than you. Humility is based out of love and care for others. Humility believes that you don ' t deserve what you have , but you are grateful for all of it. Humility honors others , rejoices in their success and creates unity around you when you embrace it fully. Humility breeds perseverance in the face of adversity because it is rooted in truth . </root.v.1781><root.v.1782>Potted plants need to be placed and sealed inside a clear plastic bag to maintain high humidity and kept in a slightly cool and shaded location. The offset will root in about eight weeks in which watering wouldn ' t be necessary. Once rooted , the offset can be taken out of the plastic bag and gradually trained to adjust to a sunnier environment. At this point , the plant can now be watered moderately to keep the potting mixture moist. The crown of the pineapple fruit can also be cut off and planted in a pot similar to the offset . </root.v.1782><root.v.1783>Late July , through September , when new growth is 80 or more hardened off , is probably the best time to start rooting cuttings. The sticking process should be completed by mid October. After that , climate , local conditions and plant pathology begins to rapidly decelerate the rooting process. We are located in East Texas , so our rooting season may be longer than those at higher latitudes . </root.v.1783><root.v.1784>There is so much hope for us. I believe that we as adults actually have what it takes to live out a life of genuine faith because I believe we can establish our lives in such a way that when the complicated and distracting pressures , when those adulterating winds blow and threaten to toss us about , no matter how hard or how often , when we are rooted in Jesus Christ we can stand firmly. Even if all else around us falls , we will survive any storm and stand as a symbol of strength and love for the generations that follow us as we grow down into Jesus . </root.v.1784><root.v.1785>The evolution in rooting really took hold in 2008 , with majority of established Artists coming into their own , and producing the most lifelike heads of hair using micro rooting techniques. There was a greater emphasis on the crown of the head and the direction in which this was being rooted. 2008 also saw an increased interest in using hair painting either solitary , or as a combination with rooted hair , binging the ultimate in realism to the table . </root.v.1785><root.v.1786>If you intend to bud or graft plants the rootstock plants are produced from cuttings. First root the rootstocks from cuttings then perform the budding or grafting operations.

" In practice , as Joel J. Sprayregen writes , this amounts to rooting out Islamophobia. Islamophobia is not , as you might think , an irrational fear of Islam. It is , as the Muslims see it , anything verbal or written that links Islam to " 9/11 , terror attacks , honor killings , suicide bombings , beheadings , executions by stoning , persecution of homosexuals , fatwas against authors , death threats to cartoonists , etc. The Organization of the Islamic Conference has decreed that even 'hostile glances ' are Islamophobic. " It should have little impact on how some of the major news and TV media do business. They have long refused to call an Islamic terrorist a terrorist and routinely omit material that might raise Muslim ire. This self-censorship was highlighted in Mumbai , where the New York Times , was the last to recognize that the massacre was committed by Muslims and that the slaughter at the Chabad House was deliberate , not random . </root.v.1788><root.v.1789>This tale illustrates the power of the most basic tai chi technique , being rooted. The idea is as simple as it sounds. Just as a tree is connected to the ground through its roots , rooting in tai chi means that your body , your mass , is linked to the ground. To see how powerful this connection can be , imagine bumping into a chair. You get hurt but not that much because the chair moves. But if you bump into a tree , you get hurt because the tree does n't move. In fact the harder you bump into the tree , the more you will bounce away , like a tennis ball thrown against a wall. Just as the tai chi master in the story must have had some kind of ability to attach himself to the ground , even when walking , the attacker in the story must have been a kung fu master , able to attack real fast and real powerfully , to be bounced so far away . </root.v.1789><root.v.1790>The first time you root your phone , all data will be wiped. Any data you want to keep must first be backed up before you begin. Most of the important information on your phone is synced with Google , but there are other things you might want to backup.

A poor and illiterate peasant , he claimed to have realized the nature of human emotions and their disease-causing consequences during a three-year vigil over his father 's grave. He concluded that emotions are stirred up through social interaction , especially that within the family. Inspired , he began traveling from village to village , spreading neo-Confucian spirituality , giving ad hoc seminars which became legendary for the number of listeners who would cry , faint , or vomit after triggered into cognizance of their emotional hindrances by Master Wang . </root.v.1792><root.v.1793>The training factors embedded in these components of the Noble Eightfold Path simultaneously inhibit the base , ignoble and destructive impulses of the human mind and promote the performance of whatever is noble and pure. Though worded negatively , in terms of the types of conduct they are intended to shut out , they are positive in effect , for when adopted as guidelines to action , they stimulate the growth of healthy mental attitudes which come to expression as beneficient courses of conduct. Intensively , these training rules reach into the recesses of the mind , blunt the force of unwholesome volition , and redirect the will to the attainment of the good. Extensively , they reach into the commotion of man 's social existence , and arrest the tide of competition , exploitation , grasping , violence and war. In their psychological dimension they confer mental health , in their social dimension they promote peace , in their spiritual dimension they serve as the irreplaceable foundation for all higher progress along the path to emancipation. Regularly undertaken and put into practice , they check all mental states rooted in greed , hatred and delusion , promote actions rooted in non-greed , non-hatred and non-delusion , and lead to a life of charity , love and wisdom . </root.v.1793><root.v.1794>On the whole most species will root but pines are pigs and may take up to five years to root.

So instead of doing by the book hardwood cuttings youre actually working with semi-hardwood cuttings. The down side to starting your cuttings early is that they will have to be watered daily unless you experience rain showers. The up side is that they will start rooting sooner , and therefore are better rooted when you pull them out to transplant them . </root.v.1799><root.v.1800>Deeper , rooted woody vegetation helps to prevent shallow mass movements. Therefore , after a first slope stabilization with seeding , some stump sprout deciduous trees are transplanted as naked rooted , container or root ball plants. It is advisable to use stump sprout deciduous trees , because if they are cut down by hand or are damaged as a result of an avalanche , or by windthrows or snowfall , they have sprouting capacity and can still grow. Transplanting must be carried out carefully , otherwise root regeneration is slow. As a general rule , the younger a plant is transplanted , the more successful is its root system . </root.v.1800><root.v.1801>2.

New artists have continued to revolutionise tango , developing an urban folk style for their own times and lives. Nuevo ' ( or New ' ) tango moves through dark-hued dub tango , tango electronica , tango with a sassy salsa twist , and even grungy tango for the rock generation. Today , contemporary tango , though still firmly rooted in the mordant , melancholy soul of the urban Argentinean , adds newly imported sounds and ideas into the mix , and the results are as stirring as they were a century ago. Artists featured here include Daniel Melingo , Lidia Borda , Bri n Chambouleyron &amp;Esteban Morgado , La Chicana , Roberto Polaco Goyeneche feat.

Here is where we need to break with the cushioning of society 's pain through spectacle. If transformation is to take place , one must pass through the equation feel pain-know-want-be able-do. ' " Without pain in response to the social reality , why would anyone have a reason to change ? When pain is conceptualized it becomes knowledge and is no longer considered natural and necessary. Once it becomes knowledge and understanding , it is seen as the enemy of a decent life , and with that the will and the desire to end the pain at its source is born. But desire is not enough. That 's when the political moment emerges : that of being able to and doing it. Changing the logic of the repetitive pain rooted in the social institutions requires " being able " to change those institutions. Once that power , that sense of enablement comes , transformation follows . </root.v.1803><root.v.1804>As Americans , we are generous and loving . . . when we know what is going on.

Do n't trust your memory - after you have done a bunch and when they have finally rooted , your memory is history ! If using plastic labels , make sure you write the names on the rough side of the label , if you write them on the smooth side they will fade with sun and rain and you will never know what you have. Check the label , they have a rough and smooth side , the rough side you can hear the scratching of the marker when you write. Another way to detect the rough and smooth side is to tip it , the smooth side is shinier in sunlight. Popsicle sticks can be used as well. I have a friend that cuts labels out of sour cream and yogurt containers. If you do this , rough up the unprinted side of the container with a piece of sandpaper so the name stays legible longer . </root.v.1805><root.v.1806>In the vegetative propagation of begonias there are several elements at work; some good , some bad. The good news is that selected parts of begonia plants really want to root and make new plantlets. The bad news is there are lots of fungi that want to destroy the newly formed plantlets before they develop to maturity. Antoon Hoefnagle recently covered the subject of Powdery Mildew fungus attack on begonias , The Begonian , page 9 , Jan/Feb 2005. The presence and attack by other fungi has also been well covered in past Begonian articles. For now , we will only deal with techniques to minimize this " rotting " and instead promote the " rooting " . Below are a four of the techniques that I have evolved over the past few years which are both effective and efficient . </root.v.1806><root.v.1807>Understanding of human nature leads to understanding of so-called 'dilemmas of the human condition ' ...

He ' d done this by pulling heel cuttings off the stem. After tidying up the heel ( as a clean edge will root more quickly ) he dipped it in hormone treatment and planted. These cuttings will be put in the greenhouse or a cold frame to protect from the frost and probably wouldn ' t do much until Spring time now . </root.v.1808><root.v.1809>Soil Bioengineering is an established method of stabilizing or protecting eroded soils. It is unique in that plants and plant parts ( roots , stems ) are used as the main structural components to reinforce the soil and to provide protection. Soil bioengineered structures rely on living or dead plant materials and can act as drains and prevent earth movement. The techniques outlined in this manual use woody plants that root from dormant cuttings. There are effective methods of using wetland or herbacious plants , coir logs , and pre-grown plant mats in soil bioengineering for lake shores and river banks. These methods are not listed in this manual because they can be more complex and costly , making them unsuitable for the active volunteer . </root.v.1809><root.v.1810>Cuttings need to be kept moist until they have rooted. For large numbers of plants , automatic mist nozzles can be installed over the cuttings and set to mist the cuttings every hour during the day , more often in hot weather. Cuttings can also be misted by hand several times a day. For a few cuttings , a plastic bag can be put over a pot of rooting medium with sticks to keep the bag clear of the cuttings. Do not let sun shine on the bag. If condensation forms inside the bag , open it a little until the condensation disappears . </root.v.1810><root.v.1811>I ca n't tell how excited and grateful I am about Rooted in the Infinite it is an amazing book !

We are diverted by the praise of the world; we are buffeted by the trials of the world , drawn by the appetites and tempt-ations of the world , and bruised by the hardness of the world. But when we are grounded , rooted , established , and settled , we can have a precious perspective which puts other things in their proper place. This is no small blessing , for it lifts us above our immediate circumstances and concerns , giving us a larger view of things , as this secular episode illustrates : </root.v.1812><root.v.1813>Plugging refers to the planting of pieces of centipedegrass sod. In plugging , centipedegrass sod is cut into circular or rectangular pieces that are 2 to 4 inches in diameter. These " plugs " are typically set or planted in rows that are spaced 12 to 24 inches apart. The distance between plugs can vary , but remember that the distance between the plugs will affect the length of time required for grow-in and establishment of the turfgrass. As with sprigging , water as soon as the plugs have been planted , and keep the soil moist until the centipedegrass has become well rooted and established . </root.v.1813><root.v.1814>An 88-foot-tall American chestnut thrives in Olympic Memorial Park in Tumwater , Washington. The tree , the largest healthy American chestnut in the United States , was planted by settlers who brought chestnut seed with them from the East Coast.But Powell and Maynard have struggled to get past the test-tube stage. Many commercially grown trees fruit trees as well as timber trees such as pine , poplar , and willow can be maintained as tissue cultures , transferred to soil , and then grown into whole plantations. For the chestnut , it turned out to be very , very difficult , says Maynard , who ' s been working on the problem since the late 1980s. He found that the only chestnut tissue that can be cultured and replanted comes from developing nuts , and wrestling the nuts out of a thorny chestnut burr is like taking apart a porcupine. The SUNY scientists have harvested more than 10 , 000 of them , but less than one-tenth of a percent form culture growths that can then be coaxed into whole plants. Once a whole plant is established in culture with a stem and leaves  it ' s very difficult to root , and once it ' s rooted , it ' s very difficult to get it growing in soil , says Maynard . </root.v.1814><root.v.1815>For the Church , the Body of Christ , the People of God , our vision is of course that of being rooted in all. things in Jesus Christ , in his desire ... ... </root.v.1815><root.v.1816>a ) Drip irrigation.

Activities such as thinking , feeling and moving are rooted in energetic processes which shape and structure the activity , and which therefore tell us something about the 'how ' rather than the 'what'- they reveal the inner experience beyond the outward behaviour. On an energetic level the body is constantly in rhythmic movement : expansion and contraction; inward and outward; charge and discharge. Many of these movements occur outside of awareness - they are generally spontaneous and involuntary movements. They originate on a vegetative level and are linked to the autonomous nervous system. Body Psychotherapy attends to and follows these movements as they connect with the breath and with consciousness. Breathing forms the bridge between involuntary and voluntary systems - it is semi-conscious and fuels movement , self-expression and the quality of contact with the world . </root.v.1817><root.v.1818>1.

If heritage is about living people who produce and transmit this knowledge , than these people need to be accorded full subjecthood and not be treated as objects ( i.e. Feld 's " A Sweet Lullaby for World Music " ) Developed countries need to engage in a soul-searching to root out deep-seated entitlement that allows them to unreflexively appropriate and commodify living heritage. Only if this occurs in there the potential for a positive public sphere. ( Kirshenblatt-Gimblett ) Otherwise , the " paradox of heritage " ( Kirshenblatt-Gimblett ) will end up perpetuating an unequal relationship between the producers of heritage and those who consume it. Moreover , the " humanity " to whom heritage belongs will only include those in developed countries who have the luxury to sample from the smorgosboard of difference. Legal protections must be put into place that protect communally produced products such as heritage so there will be legal recourse against the financial profitable appropriation Feld and Shand describe . </root.v.1822><root.v.1823>Back to ring sour , the horse goes from bad to worse until you reach the limit - which is complete refusal to comply to anything the rider requires of him , by going behind the bit , behind the leg , stepping backwards , rearing or standing rooted to the ground and bucking if urged to move on.

Cuttings from lower branches will make better clones , because of low levels of nitrogen and higher sugar ratio. You can either plant cuttings right in the soil or put them in the water. Plant clones in the mix of Scott 's Seed Starter soil and some perlite. Dip the end of the cuttings in a little bit of root powder , Rootone B is very common root powder , optainable at any nursery store or HomeDepot. Soil should be moist all the time , but not to wet , because water stress will keep clones from growing roots. Clones will root in 2-3 weeks , they going to grow very slow during first couple weeks , but after they establish roots they 'll grow fast again. Feed cuttings with very small doses of high phosphate plant food , such as Peter 's Professional. Putting clones in the water makes them root a little faster. I prefer it a lot more. After clones root , I plant them in the soil , and they do great. When you plant clones put them in light right away , give about 16-18 hours . </root.v.1824><root.v.1825>Some herbs , too , can be rooted in water : basil , catnip , mint , pineapple sage and watercress.

The other fist which threatens him is , that God holds up His terrible judgments before him , so that the man feels that his only rightful place is in the lowest depths of hell.

Probably because they always have played us hard and there never really was any bad blood that I can remember.

You will want to try to stay in melee range and behind them most of the time in this fight. Do n't chain-CC if you do n't have to. Save the mezz and knockdown for when they root or hinder you and are getting away.

Layering is the easiest way to propagate carnations and the plant will do this themselves once mature. Observing a mature clump of carnations , seek out sturdy stems pointing away from the centre of the clump. If you look at the bottoms of these stems they will often be rooted , and if they are not yet , you can promote rooting by bending them down to touch the soil. Keep them pinned down with a rock , a stick , or whatever else. Cut off any flowers that are growing on that particular stem. Within a few weeks you will see your new plant rooting. Once the roots seem 4 to 5 inches long , cut this new plant away from the mother plant and repot in well-drained soil . </root.v.1834><root.v.1835>Thank-you for sharing your thoughts about the Pope. How will the Pope pastor to Christians in America who come from traditions rooted in the believe that Rome was hypocritical in raising money to gold guild St.Peter 's Cathederal saying believers can essentially buy their way to heaven ? Many Protestants in America consider Rome the source of false teachings and false promises. Mary Magdalene fulfills all the Biblical definitions for an apostle , one who first witnessed the Resurection of Jesus and told others about it; and yet the testimony and leadership of women is considered seconary in Rome 's eyes. Love , power , and justice convey more of God 's vitality in this world than the static labels of Aristotle , the good , the true , and the beautiful. I hope Pope Benedict 's visit is more beneficial to all than I anticipate. Craig </root.v.1835><root.v.1836>There are many levels of rooting.

The reasoning goes : pay attention to yourself , demonstrate love to yourself , build up your self-esteem so your sense of shame and unworthiness will be lessened -- then you will have much less motivation to turn to sexual sin.

As mentioned above , you 'll want to use a high phosphate fertilizer such as Schultz Plus 10-54-10. Regardless of what you use , make sure it 's the middle number that 's high as that will help encourage stronger blooming. Also another supplent that we highly recommend for all your plants and not just your plumeria is SuperThrive. It can be found online or at your local nursery or bib box home supply store.

Another method is air layering. You will need some clear plastic and sphagnum moss. You take a thick stem and cut slightly in the side and cover the cut with moist sphagnum wrapped with plastic. The moisture will allow rooting and the partial stem keeps it alive until it roots. This is the same method that they use for rubber trees. When you see roots forming in the plastic you know that you can sever the stem and pot up the cutting . </root.v.1860><root.v.1861>That 's what my next novel is about , and Publishers Weekly says Sandy is a smart , funny heroine that y'all will root for.

As mentioned above , building can be done for multiple operating systems using the same source tree. ( This is how the NSPR API is currently built using their configure script. ) In addition to building for multiple operating systems , it is possible to easily build multiple configurations from the same source tree. This is extremely useful for building different threading models and different ABI/ISA combinations to test changes in a single source tree. Also mentioned above , the entire build environment can be removed from the root. This is because all aspects of the build are separated from the source tree so that object files , makefiles , dependency files , etc. do not pollute the source tree. On the other hand , this is not a typical use of a configure script ( though it is a documented method of configuration in the Autoconf documentation ) and is thus not familiar to users. It can also result in complicated paths depending on where the build environment is rooted and how the path to configure is specified . </root.v.1864><root.v.1865>a man dressing up from head to toe in a costume made entirely from straw.

With a few exceptions , they like very bright light , and most do best with a somewhat richer soil than most succulents , water once a week ( or even a bit more frequently ) in warm weather , and water about every two weeks in winter. E. milii itself is marginally outdoor hardy in our area , but most of the others are both slow growing and somewhat rare , not good subjects to put at risk for experiments in frost-hardiness. A few of these species are more difficult. E didiereoides should be kept a bit drier during the winter , as should E. pedilanthoides and similar tuberous rooted species such as E. kondoi. In my experience E. rossii will suffer and possibly rot if watered too frequently in winter , and E. guillauminiana in particular requires very dry treatment after it drops its leaves; leaving it completely dry for a few months until it makes its new growth won ' t hurt it , although water every six weeks or so is probably all right also.

I take cuttings from new rose stems in the spring right after the first bloom cycle. Then in early to late fall ( in Southern California ) I prefer to use more mature or old wood. When using old wood in the fall , I will remove the cuttings from the Mason jar , baggie , or mister , after only several weeks since it is cool enough then for them to root on their own as long as I water them daily . </root.v.1873><root.v.1874>It seems that such misunderstandings were commonplace in Charlemagne 's day , largely because Augustine 's City of God became more and more the grand manipulator of both Church and State hierarchies.

The question of whether the pope or emperor was to be the dominating and controlling authority grew in intensity. Eventually the fruits of such debates were represented in Gratian 's ecclesiastical Decretals and Pope Gregory IX 's implementation of them ( with the purpose of forever liquidating heretics within their midst ) , beginning in 1234.

The larger the caudex , the better the success rate. This is because a larger caudex has more stored energy and might also have started rooting out on it 's own.

The words of Jesus just quoted also represent a call to " form our conscience , " to make it the object of a continuous conversion to what is true and to what is good. In the same vein , Saint Paul exhorts us not to be conformed to the mentality of this world , but to be transformed by the renewal of our mind ( cf. Rom 12 : 2 ) . It is the " heart " converted to the Lord and to the love of what is good which is really the source of " true " judgments of conscience. Indeed , in order to " prove what is the will of God , what is good and acceptable and perfect " ( Rom 12 : 2 ) , knowledge of God 's law in general is certainly necessary , but it is not sufficient : what is essential is a sort of " 'connaturality ' between man and the true good. " [ 110 ] Such a connaturality is rooted in and develops through the virtuous attitudes of the individual himself : prudence and the other cardinal virtues , and even before these the theological virtues of faith , hope and charity.

The main reason is the incidence of fungal diseases in the wet conditions. Prima Bio has therefore invested in propagation facilities based on 'dry fog ' - a humid environment in which there is very little deposition of water onto surfaces because the very small water droplets evaporate before they deposit. It is already clear that this type of propagation environment can work exceptionally well , but for optimal results associated procedures need to be modified also. A further benefit is that the incidence of fungal diseases is very low , even though no fungicides are used; this allows the majority of cuttings set to survive in good condition for many weeks , even if they do not root.

If a drill is used for planting , a seeding of from three to four pecks to the acre should give a good stand.

Tap the pot several times to settle the mix. Do not press down on the roots. Withhold water the first week as some of the roots may have been damaged and will rot if they get wet before healing. The second week , start watering sparingly.

In the globalizing world of networks cultural issues and more importantly questions of identity turns into a rooted cosmopolitan mode indicating the emergence a new globally rooted demos. That is to say that by virtue of networking and a high level of awareness an unprecedented opportunity has provided for new forces of change to challenge the taken-for-granted foundations of political discourse , the oppressive frameworks , and social exclusion. If not critically analyzed and understood , such situation gives rise to cultural and identity collisions , and false hostility and widespread violence among nations . </root.v.1905><root.v.1906>Rooted cuttings have traditionally been used to bulk up material for which seed was in short supply or of very poor quality. An example is Yc. More recently , the process has been employed to bulk up material of superior genetic quality. Examples are black cottonwood ( Act ) , Sx , and Ss. Because the technique starts with a sizable portion of plant material , it usually yields a robust product that easily meets minimum root collar diameter specifications. A proportion of rooted cuttings may exhibit plagiotropic growththese are culled before shipping. Plantation trials have shown growth and form of rooted cuttings to be equivalent to seedlings . </root.v.1906><root.v.1907>Cuttings can be taken off any carnation , but the best shoot come from cuttings off a year-old plant after it has bloomed. In fact , the flower stem is often the only place where a carnation will form a stalk long enough to take a cutting from. It is best to take carnation cuttings in early Fall. They will root at the swollen node hidden beneath each leaf. Cut at an angle just below a node , and trim off the top , leaving 1 node for roots at the bottom and one at the top for the growth to come out of.

One of the surprising omissions from Google 's own Nexus One handset , for example , is the ability to use more than one finger at a time to operate the device. Although available on iPhone from the start , the Nexus One excludes this valuable feature from its mobile operating system. Why ? No one knows for sure , but it might have something to do with some patents Apple owns. But that 's no matter to the hacker community. Thanks again to cyanogen , Nexus One owners can enable the feature by copying some files over to their device. Other Android owners can perform similar procedures to enable multi-touch Web browsing.

No special , expensive equipment is involved , just a little attention to detail. May be rooted in-place or in a nursery bed and then transplanted out to the final location the second year. The cuttings in this shipment are considered prepared . They have already been cut to proper length , treated , and have been in cold storage since late November. Hardwood cuttings must have at least 90 days of cold treatment before rooting. This time in cold allows the base of the cutting to callus . This is the early formation of the root structure and may look like a ' tumor ' growing around the outer diameter of the cutting base. Do not cut this off ! !

The Foxes started off with a gospel-style tune that was heavy on harmony at first and evolved into upbeat country rock. The set continued on in the same fashion , with songs that seems rooted in ' 70s easy rock , except with more teeth. This band might draw some comparisons to My Morning Jacket , but the vocal work pushes past such comparisons , giving them their own unique , enjoyable sound . </root.v.1926><root.v.1927>Community does several things. First , it roots the creation of art to a place in time; it associates it with a group of people. It helps avoid the danger of creating art in a vacuum , free from a social awareness of any sort. Of course , creating in an especially inbred community of artists could do the same thing , hence the importance of diversity in creativity. With the input of such creative diversity , the complexity of the art being created in such a community can only increase. This is the second thing community does : allow for alternative creative input. That is , one does not create in a vacuum of craft , but rather , amongst a community of ( hopefully diverse ) peers whose differences help challenge and bring new perspective. A good community allows for a safe environment in which one can share work. It creatively supports risk taking , helping spur it on , as well as absorb the blows if such a risk fails. Additionally , if there is success , there is the simple human joy of sharing that with others . </root.v.1927><root.v.1928>My name is Erin Wurtemberg and I started this site as a way to help light the path for other professionals who desire to grow their business in a way that goes a little deeper.

The tips , so far , were still green as the plant resides in a 55 degree Florida room awaiting spring. Will this cutting root ? There is a landscape company that will help me move the entire tree ( the new homeowner agreed to allow me to do so ) once the land has thawed and conditions are right. Previously I have not rooted a fig cutting although I think this is working out fine thus far. If it is green , it is happy , right ? I hope so. I will definitely pass your advice to the business here that will do the big move.

One strategy is to rake it out of your lawn with a stiff rake such as a bow rake , or use a small metal kid 's rake. Rake in two directions and remove the bits of stems. Some people use a hammer-type dethatching rake. Others use a garden hand " fork " to hook the runners and pull it up . </root.v.1933><root.v.1934>13.

The victim does n't know what the issues are , so the therapist uses the back-door approach to let the victim learn about themselves. The therapist asks , " What do you think about trees ? Would you spend the next week ( s ) drawing trees , talking to me about trees , and going out and talking to trees. Please journal what you talk to the trees about. " The client may come back and say , " Trees are very important to me. I do n't want to talk to anyone about trees. Trees are very sacred to me , and they are deeply rooted in my mind , I am their caretaker ? " Then the therapist continues the backdoor exploration , " What do you mean you are their caretaker ?

At this time you should fertilize the cuttings with a one-quarter strength solution of 20-20-20 fertilizer or fish oil emulsion. Plants in individual containers can be left exposed to air for short periods of time at this point but should be covered again if they show signs of wilting. Plants rooted in multiples will have to be transplanted to individual 4-inch pots. Care should be taken to retain the soil mix around the fragile roots during transplanting. Watch these plants for signs of wilting or lack of water for several weeks while they are growing additional roots. Transplant to the garden when the root balls are adequate . </root.v.1941><root.v.1942>How to root your cuttings : These can be rooted in a glass jar with about 2 " of water or in a small pot with good draining soil or vermiculite. Depending on the size of the cutting you want to keep it in a small pot till it roots to avoid rotting the cutting. A 2 " pot is good unless you have a thick cutting. Keep your cutting in a light room but out of direct sunlight and water only enough to keep it moist but not wet. Over watering cuttings is the main cause of them rotting. Keeping it warm or on a heat mat will hasten the rooting process. More info here : Cuttings </root.v.1942><root.v.1943>1. It 's perfectly okay to root cuttings using forked canes.

No cause is worth dying lot since death is the end. The only time we unite is to preserve our individual selves.

The existence of the Catholic Forensics League is obvious evidence of the dominance of those institutions in high school debate. The early creation of the Philodemic Debate Society in 1848 at Georgetown is also strong evidence of the priority Jesuits placed on debate. Regardless of historical accident and influence , there are clear and persuasive reasons for Jesuit institutions to support and nurture a competitive debate program. It is difficult for me to point to a program or educational activity more rooted in the Jesuit ideal . </root.v.1948><root.v.1949>Staking the tree may be necessary if excess soil was removed from the top and sides of the rootball. Make sure the support material on the tree is a wide band of lawn chair webbing or soft cloth. Ideally , this staking will only be on for one year , but may be two or more years until the rootball is set. This would be the time to see if the tree you planted last year has rooted in. If there is still some rocking motion to the rootball , it may be in too deep , the soil may be poor or the roots are not developing well. This tree may need to be staked longer than one year.If the tree has rooted well , you can loosen the band or webbing but leave them tied to the stakes. When you remove the ties , you may want to leave the stakes as a barrier if the tree is in a high traffic site . </root.v.1949><root.v.1950>As your faith is rooted in Christ Jesus , all the blessings which Jesus won for you come flowing to your soul through the roots.

( I 've included a partial list below ) In addition , there is no need to purchase expensive equipment and most subjects can be rooted without even having the benefit of a cold frame. There are , however , some guidelines to follow to ensure a better success rate.

When a full root has formed and leaves begin to sprout anew , the clone is a self-sufficient plant , genetically identical to the mother plant. Examples are cutting from the stems of blackberries ( Rubus occidentalis ) , cutting from leaves of African violets ( Saintpaulia ) , and cutting the stems of verbenas ( Verbena ) to create new plants. A related form of regeneration is that of grafting. This is a process of taking a bud and grafting onto a plants stem. Many nurseries now sell trees that can produce four or more varieties of apples ( Malus spp. ) from stems grafted to a common rootstock . </root.v.1953><root.v.1954>Grapevines can be readily rooted using hardwood cuttings and have long been propagated this way. This is one reason that some of our grape cultivars are so ancient. Some olive cultivars are also readily propagated by stem cuttings. Fig and pomegranate can be propagated this way. Most other fruit and nut tree species will not form roots from hardwood stem cuttings , or will only do so with great difficulty. Some of these can be induced to produce roots by treatment with plant hormones and/or heating the cutting beds; others can not be induced to form roots under any circumstances . </root.v.1954><root.v.1955>The main reason for rooting failure is rot. This is caused by too much water , especially in cool or humid months when soil does not dry out quickly. In cool weather , it may not be necessary to water the plant after the initial watering until the weather begins to turn warm . </root.v.1955><root.v.1956>Keep the cuttings warm and moist and in bright light until they form roots. It usually helps if you cover them with clear plastic such as dry cleaners ' bags to keep the humidity up. It will help greatly if you have a greenhouse with a mist system to maintain 100 percent humidity. Cuttings will root in 2 to 8 weeks , depending on the species , at which point you can dig them carefully and pot them individually . </root.v.1956><root.v.1957>g ) Deeply rooted vines. The vines must periodically experience significant water deficit to induce deep rooting. There are still a very , very few fanatical terroirist growers who will actually practice root pruning to encourage deeper rooting . </root.v.1957><root.v.1958>First job is to make sure you have enough record sheets available for all cultivars you wish to grow next year. The sheets should contain spaces for the following information : - Name of cultivar , rooting date , all potting dates , all stopping dates , dates and type of feed , Date bud secured , colour show , quality of blooms and quantity to be grown . </root.v.1958><root.v.1959>This sense is rooted in man 's moral conscience and is as it were its thermometer. It is linked to the sense of God , since it derives from man 's conscious relationship with God as his creator , Lord and Father. Hence , just as it is impossible to eradicate completely the sense of God or to silence the conscience completely , so the sense of sin is never completely eliminated . </root.v.1959><root.v.1960>iv. We are like a deeply rooted tree not tumbleweed carried about with every wind and blown around at the mercy of the wind . </root.v.1960><root.v.1961>Important as rooting is , there are occasions in combat when you should not root. Yielding takes priority over rooting. Normally , rooting and yielding work together , but if a projection is aimed below your tan tien ( such as an opponent diving in for a low tackle ) , you give down low , possibly bending over to maintain balance. You can ride out the force , attempting to drive it into the ground. This is called riding the waves temporarily , until the force is dissipated or neutralized. But such situations are anomalous. The odds are that a projection will come in above your tan tien. You never know what will happen in an encounter , but chances are strong that you will need to root most of the time in the average encounter . </root.v.1961><root.v.1962>Bigger isn ' t better. Larger cuttings may wilt before rooting or become impossible to transplant successfully after roots form. It ' s better to make several smaller cuttings and combine the rooted plants together down the road . </root.v.1962><root.v.1963>Live wooden cribwalls are one of the best methods to securing immediately endangered parts of slopes and toes of slopes. They can be erected as single or double cribwalls and are built from logs and anchor logs held together with nails or bolts. The anchor logs should not be above each other but should be placed alternately. For higher stability against sliding , cribwalls should not be placed horizontally on the slope but at an angle of 10-15 percent towards the slope. Additionally , the whole construction is secured with 2-2.5 m long iron poles , which are hammered into the ground. The space between the logs is filled with soil material and plants , which should not stick out of the wall more than a quarter of their length. To reach vegetation quickly it is advantageous to use green willow branches and strong rooted pioneer plants as mentioned for the construction of the hedge brush layer. In order to achieve good plant development the face wall should be 50 percent. If this is not the case the plants will not receive enough light . </root.v.1963><root.v.1964>When ready to pot the cutting , strip the leaves from the bottom two inches ( do n't ever stick existing leaves under the soil mix where they will rot. ) Using a clean , sharp knife , scrape the bottom inch of the cutting. The wounded tissue will be stimulated to produce roots. A rooting hormone can help. Dip the end of the cutting in water , and then in a rooting hormone , which is a synthetic plant hormone. Pour a small amount of rooting hormone into a cup and dip into the cup , rather than directly into the jar. Discard the used material at the end of the working session. ( Dipping into the jar itself can cause contamination. ) Buy a very small quantity and replace it each year so that you are starting with fresh material for rooting . </root.v.1964><root.v.1965>If you live in an area where you can not make retail sales from your home , or if you do n't care to deal with that many people , you can grow plants and sell them wholesale. Wholesale buyers are always looking for good plants they can buy at fair prices. There is also a good market for rooted cuttings or seedlings. Dogwoods are actually quite easy to grow from seed , and those seedlings can be sold by the thousands. They can be packed and shipped to just about anywhere in the country quite easily . </root.v.1965><root.v.1966>As mentioned above , with basil you do n't even need to plant the rooted part. Just take any old stem , root it , &amp;plant it. I like to put the stem in a cup of water until it roots out , then plant it. But you can try just planting it straight into soil as well ( keep damp until it starts to take off ) . </root.v.1966><root.v.1967>I agree with Dr. Schmalhausen when he says : " The ego is more pervasive as a human reality than sex. Human natures that harmonize on the ego level can contrive to put up with sex disharmony; but sex harmony can not cope with the problem of disharmony rooted in a maladjustment of egos. The Adlerian theme runs deeper in human life than the Freudian , though the latter , because of its dramatic and sensational components , gives the impression of being more fundamental. " </root.v.1967><root.v.1968>Wild strawberry is a low trailing winter perennial , spreading by stolons. The leaves of wild strawberry are similar to cultivated strawberries. The leaves are trifoliolate on long hairy petioles. The leaves have toothed margins. The flowers which are produced from April to June are white with yellow stamens and pistils , and contain five petals. The fruit is a red strawberry with many small seeds in pits on the surface. Wild strawberries reproduce from seed and from runners. Each plant forms multiple runners which root at the nodes and form new plants. Wild strawberries are found throughout most of the United States and Canada . </root.v.1968><root.v.1969>Most cuttings should be rooted in a well-drained soil , though you may have success rooting various plants in a cup of well-aerated water. You will probably find that the plants rooted in soil are hardier and easier to transplant than those rooted in water. The most important thing to think about when choosing your rooting medium is that it is a medium weight mixture that is well drained so the plant does not rot before the roots begin to form . </root.v.1969><root.v.1970>Successful propagation implies more than the mere striking of roots. There must also be a uniformity in rooting and continuity of rooting , but of far greater importance is the continued health and progress of the young plants in the ensuing months. This is a major problem in many firms today particularly with the more difficult cultivars to which critical amounts of hormones and heat are applied in order to root a practical percentage of them. Cuttings do then root but a considerable proportion succumb after a few months and even up to two years. This then is not successful propagation which literally does not go beyond the propagating bench . </root.v.1970><root.v.1971>As musics become rooted in pop culture a process of 'sanitation ' occurs slowly removing the personality and individuality from them -rounding off the edges , dumbing down , commercializing , seeking the common denominator. A lot of eastern music has learned to sound well tempered , a lot of blues now is n't any more challenging from a tonal perspective than advertising jingles. It falls to us to decide what we want to root in our lives , the generality of 'styles ' or the oddness of individual expression . </root.v.1971><root.v.1972>Among evergreen plants , false cypress , arborvitae , and low-growing juniper generally root readily. Yew roots fairly well. The upright junipers , spruces , and hemlocks are difficult to root. Cuttings of firs and pines usually are very difficult to root . </root.v.1972><root.v.1973>Basically , rivers , streams , bayous , etc. with sparse vegetation. All freshwater wetlands contained within a channel. Subject to the nature of the channel ( bottom type , slope , source of water , etc. ) . Includes rivers , creeks , bayous , canals , and the like.

Chamaecyparis obtusa 'Filicoides ' Endl. ( Cupressaceae ) . The 'fern-spray cypress ' is again not new or rare with origin in 1868 and commonly produced by conifer specialists. It will make a small tree with irregular branches and pendulous limbs of fern-spray green foliage. It will grow throughout N.C. and in Raleigh grows about 1 ' per year. Best in full sun or very light shade. A yellow foliaged cultivar is also available. It roots easily in good percentages when taken from December through March and stuck under mist with 3 Hormodin. Production of a one gallon plant would take two years from a good liner plant. ( Note - parent plant east of row of dwarf Loblolly pines toward south end of the conifer planting ) . </root.v.1974><root.v.1975>Take a green-wood stem cutting that does n't have a flower , in the morning when it is cool. ( Cuttings can be kept in water if you ca n't root them in soil right away . ) </root.v.1975><root.v.1976>The problem is that it is difficult to know in advance which cuttings will root on their own and which require the boost of a rooting hormone. And , since rooting hormones are cheap and easily applied , the best approach is simply not to guess but to make sure by using a rooting hormone. This is the practice of commercial nurseries and is my recommended practice for those seeking to root rose cuttings at home . </root.v.1976><root.v.1977>Stolons and runners differ in that stolons run under the soil and produce new plants at their tips , whereas , runners run on top of the ground and produce new plants at joints along the runner. Cornus stolonifera ( Red-Osier Dogwood ); Spiraeas and Sorbaria sorbifolia ( Falsespirea ) are examples of plants that produce new plants by means of stolons. The familiar and well known Fragaria ( Strawberry ) is a plant that produces new plants by means of runners. New plants from stolons can be severed from the parent plant , dug up and transplanted once top growth is of sufficient size. Runners will root themselves , or they can be set into the soil and pegged down to speed up the rooting process. Once they develop a good root system , they can be severed from the parent plant and transplanted.

At the end of the last five-hundred-year period following the passing of the Tathagata , thete will be self-controlled men , rooted in merit , coming to hear these teachings , who will be inspired with belief. But you should realize that such men have mot strengthened their root of merit undet just one Buddha , or two Buddhas , or three , or four , or five Buddhas , but under countless Buddhas; and their merit is of every kind. Such men , coming to hear these teachings , will have an immediate uprising of pure faith , Subhuti; and the Tathagata will recognize them. Yes , He will clearly perceive all these of pure heart , and the magnitude of their moral excellences. Wherefore ? It is because such men will not fall back to cherishing the idea of an ego-entity , a personality , a being , or a separated individuality. They will neither fall back to cherishing the idea of things as having intrinsic qualitics , nor even of things as devoid of intrinsic quatities . </root.v.1978><root.v.1979>Security is based on God 's faithfulness not on our circumstances.

The first thing you have to do is find the best stems to use for your cutting. Most rose varieties will root well at any age , but it is best to use firm but young stems. You should use stems where the flower petals have just fallen off or are fading. You always want to be sure to leave at least three to five leaves on the stem you are trying to propagate. The leaves on the stem help to produce root-promoting hormones for better success . </root.v.1980><root.v.1981>I tried gardenias but not rooting in water I tried with rooting hormone and had a tent for it but they ended up dying.

Keep the lid on the bottle and cover the cutting with the soda bottle. You may want to use a flat tray and cover it with plastic wrap but ensure the plastic wrap does not touch the cuttings. You can also plant the rose cuttings in individual containers and cover the cuttings with glass jars until they are rooted . </root.v.1983><root.v.1984>Stuart and Denise do not use the job titles Psychotherapist or Counsellor since these titles reflect a different working modality where practice is rooted in one or more theoretical disciplines and is counselling based.

New spring shoots are vigorous but soft and succulent. They may wilt before they root. But if the shoots are allowed to mature for a month or two , they firm up slightly and are ideal for rooting . </root.v.1988><root.v.1989>Cuttings taken from near the base of the plant may exhibit rooting characteristics similar to the real age of the cuttings; months old rather than years old. One reason may be the position of the shoots on the plant. Current years shoots may root different from second year shoots. Shoots from the lower part of the plant may have less sunlight than the upper shoots. The upper shoots may be a few weeks older than the lower shoots. Younger shoots need less stimulation , to root than older shoots; use a lower Rhizopon AA or Hortus IBA Water Soluble Salts concentration. The younger shoots require a more stable propagation environment . </root.v.1989><root.v.1990>For wedges , conditions must be as sterile as possible. As stated earlier in this chapter , a razor blade is the best utensil to use for cutting. Perlite is the best medium for rooting wedges. Add a very slight amount of fertilizer so the plantlets have some food when they start to grow. You can fill a tray with perlite and premoisten. When perlite is wet it becomes very solid. I use a knife or plant label to make rows of small slits in the perlite the right size to fit my wedges. The wedges can be touching or overlapping so don ' t be afraid to pack them closely. Usually about half an inch to and inch apart works well. Try to insert the wedge as upright as possible. Also make sure to label carefully and keep different varieties separated. Try to mix the tray up so that varieties that aren ' t a similar color aren ' t next to each other so they don ' t get confused later. They do require a covered container . </root.v.1990><root.v.1991>The next thing you 'll need is a pair of scissors or clean , sharp , pruning shears to trim the cuttings. The idea behind trimming the leaves is to reduce the demands for water while the plant is rooting and to avoid overcrowding in the propagating tray. I like to leave about 2 square inches per leaf to assist the plant in photosynthesis. I 've rooted plants without any leaves which takes longer and increases the chance of bacterial and fungal infection. You may want to wash your scissors off in a 5 bleach solution ( straight Clorox ) , the only time I bother is when doing hundreds of cuttings of different cultivars.

As adults , these tubeworms have no mouth , gut , or anus , obtaining all their energy and food from intracellular symbiotic bacteria that live in the highly vascularized tissue filling the bulk of their body cavity. The worms have a unique hemoglobin in their blood that binds oxygen and sulfide and transports both from the surrounding seawater to the bacteria , which number a billion cells per gram of worm tissue. Carbon isotope data show that the tubeworms depend on carbon compounds synthesized by the bacteria as the main source of their nutrition ( 6 ) . </root.v.1993><root.v.1994>Knowledge is a commodity to sell and possess in the construction of the West.

First of all , a tax system on capital gains ( interest and dividend income ) which is now schduled to be enforced from 1996 should be introduced as soon as possible so that it will root out borrowed name accounts. Most pseudonym accounts converted to real name but a huge number of borrowed name accounts still exist. Second , money in the curb market should be absorbed into financial institutions so that it can ease the credit crunch in samll and medium sized firms. Third , government should trace out the existing non-receipt transactions in the traditional market. The final but not the least issue to be solved is that every possibel efforts should be made to settle down the credit society which payment and settlement of account should be carried out through personal checks and credit cards . </root.v.1995><root.v.1996>Tip cuttings 2 to 3 inches long root easily. I use powdered rooting hormone on mine , though it may not be necessary , and stick them in a blend of soilless potting mix and sand. I ' ve also heard of cuttings being rooted in water , but I haven ' t tried it myself. I ' ve found that A. ficoidea selections root fairly well even if they ' re in flower , but it ' s best to take cuttings of A. dentata ' Rubiginosa ' before it enters its winter bloom cycle in late autumn. Seeds of ' Rubiginosa ' are ready to collect by late winter , and they germinate easily , offering another method of producing plants that are true to color . </root.v.1996><root.v.1997>Proverbs 12 : 3 A man shall not be established by wickedness : but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.  Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts , they can not by such arts settle and secure themselves , [ M. Henry ] . Many people live their whole lives out by wickedness and gather much material possessions , but in the end , they must die and face the judge of all and give an answer for their deeds. For any person to try to live by his own wits is an admission that he does not trust in the benevolence of God. The following texts suggest the importance of being rooted in righteousness , ( Matthew 3 : 10; 13 : 6 , 21; 15 : 13; Eph. 3 : 7; Col. 3 : 7 ) .

However , they point to the obvious fact that the politics of the Bolsheviks played a key role in how the revolution developed. While the terrible objective conditions may have shaped certain aspects of the actions of the Bolsheviks it can not be denied that the impulse for them were rooted in Bolshevik theory.

Considering the development of ability to discriminate internal states with age , and the likely better ability of novelists or psychologists to discriminate internal states than many other professions , it appears that self-consciousness is both learned and has different degrees. The learned aspect of inner perception accords with observation of the learned aspect of other perception. As with other perception , there needs to be some means of perception , but in this case it can be identified with a general ability to make judgments. Self-consciousness , then , has it roots in signals of inner physical events , or useful introspective discriminations , and in ability to make predictively useful judgments . </root.v.2011><root.v.2012>The Connecting Communities Fellowship Program is really a synthesis of the intensive hands-on experience of Hope in the Cities.

Subjects that may be rooted in this manner are generally easy and root successfully when inserted in garden soil in the open. The spot chosen should be sheltered from winds , weed free and well drained. In autumn take a piece of stem from the current year 's growth between 10 to 30cm long , depending upon the plant. They are taken with a heel of older wood if possible. The cutting may be trimmed to remove the long triangle of bark which often comes away with a hardwood heel and any sappy growth at the top. It will be planted to about three quarters of its length . </root.v.2019><root.v.2020>It is best to plant trees as soon as possible after they are received.

Could it be we ' re hung up on the same things ? After all , our society still divides things up in very similar ways : rewarding good and punishing evil. In fact , that model is so deeply rooted in our cultural psyche , our world-view , which determines how we understand the created order , that its almost impossible to imagine another vision of reality. We just assume its natural . </root.v.2021><root.v.2022>Larger plants with heavier stems , such as dieffenbachias , Chinese evergreens , larger philodendrons , some dracaenas , etc. , may also be propagated by stem cuttings. In this case , cut the stem with about 6 or 7 leaves from the top of the plant. You can also cut similar sections of stem from further down. As before , remove 2 or 3 leaves from the bottom of the cutting , exposing the nodes. Cut the upper half away from each remaining leaf blade so as to reduce moisture loss during propagation. Dip the bottom end of the cutting into rooting powder. Then set the cutting aside for a week or so , in a bright but shaded spot , allowing the cut end to callus ( similar to forming a scab ) to keep the cutting from drying out too much and from rotting as it takes root. Once the callus has formed , insert the stem cuttings into a sterile potting medium as mentioned before until they 've rooted . </root.v.2022><root.v.2023>You can try to put a positive spin on this until your head falls off , but the fact remains that if you have to root the Droid , clearly it is not as open and as functional as Verizon and Droid fanboys want everybody to believe.

Professional growers and nurseries use mist or fog systems to maintain ideal moisture and humidity levels. These systems are controlled by a humidistat , timer , or a unit called an electronic leaf . </root.v.2024><root.v.2025>My plants had so many blooms last fall that I picked some for a bouquet.

Remove only the bark between these two rings and apply a thin layer of rooting hormone to open wound. Just below the cut , secure a sheet of plastic around the open wound area , in a funnel-like shape. Fill the funnel with moistened sphagnum moss ( this should be coarse sphagnum moss as it will hold moisture better than the fine processed peat moss which is used as a soil amendment ) . Tie the top of the plastic funnel to fully contain the moistened sphagnum. This will reduce evaporation of the moisture and hasten the rooting process. Eventually , new roots will appear at the face of the plastic. When this happens , cut just below the newly rooted section and transplant into its own container . </root.v.2026><root.v.2027>Too often , the requirement to attend Mass on Sunday is seen as a rule or precept that is imposed on the faithful by the Catholic Church. We should strive to understand this requirement in the fuller , evangelical sense. The Eucharistic liturgy is the source and summit of our lives as Catholics , where we personally encounter Christ and abide in Him ( cf. Jn. 15 : 1-10 ) . The minimum requirement of the Church to participate in sacred liturgy is nothing other than a recipe for a life centered in Christthe essence of growing in holiness. Assuredly , living the sacramental lifewhich includes ( at least ) weekly Mass , regular Confession , and daily prayerwill help us with God 's grace to root out the other moral difficulties in our lives and keep us oriented toward our true good : God Himself and eternal life with Him . </root.v.2027><root.v.2028>The single varieties may be grown from seed , but the double sorts should be grown from cuttings of young stems or from division of the roots. If cuttings are to be made , it will be necessary to start the roots early , either in a hotbed or house. When the growths have reached 4 or 5 inches , they may be cut from the plant and rooted in sand. Care should be taken to cut just below a joint , as a cutting made between two joints will not form tubers. The most rapid method of propagation of named varieties is to grow from cuttings in this way . </root.v.2028><root.v.2029>But second , is Romano being incoherent in glossing Faye 's claim about the H ' relationship to Nazism ( as you suggest ) ? I can not see why because he is saying that through Heidegger 's Nazi teaching , stuff which is not really philosophy , but rather a type of propaganda ( Romano makes this point a bit earlier ) , Nazism enters philosophy because Heidegger dresses it up as philosophy in his public teaching and in this sense Nazism underwrites his philosophy. In other words what Romano is perfectly consistently saying is that Nazism is the sort of motivator for H 's philosophy and hence his philosophy is rooted in Nazism ( The metaphor just makes the point that H 's Nazism is both prior and shapes H ' philosophy ) . True , the point might have been made a bit more perspicuously but there is no incoherence , as far as I can see , in what Romano is saying at this point . </root.v.2029><root.v.2030>Like Edmund Husserl , Mead conceives of human consciousness as intentional in its structure and orientation : the world of conscious experience is " intended , " " meant , " " constituted , " " constructed " by consciousness. Thus , objectivity can have meaning only within the domain of the subject , the realm of consciousness. It is not that the existence of the objective world is constituted by consciousness , but that the meaning of that world is so constituted. In Husserlian language , the existence of the objective world is transcendent , i.e. , independent of consciousness; but the meaning of the objective world is immanent , i.e. , dependent on consciousness. In Mead 's " phenomenology " of historical experience , then , the past may be said to possess an objective existence , but the meaning of the past is constituted or constructed according to the intentional concerns of historical thought. The meaning of the past ( " what has happened " ) is defined by an historical consciousness that is rooted in a present and that is opening upon a newly emergent future . </root.v.2030><root.v.2031>Another method of propagating leaf cuttings is used for plants with fleshy-veined leaves , such as African violets , begonias and kalanchoes. Remove a leaf and make slits in the heavy primary veins from the underside. Lay the leaf face upwards on moist rooting medium. To ensure the bottom of the leaf is in contact with the soil , anchor it with small pebbles. Place the pot in a warm , humid location with diffused daylight. New plantlets will develop from each slit. When each has established a good system , replant them individually in potting soil. Sansevieria can be propagated by cutting a leaf horizontally into 8 cm sections. Each section is inserted 2.5 cm deep in rooting medium. Variegated varieties propagated in this manner will usually develop as solid green plants . </root.v.2031><root.v.2032>Observe , first of all , that there is nothing in the authors ' idea of self-esteem that would allow one to distinguish between an individual whose self-esteem is rooted in the practices of living consciously , self-responsibility , and personal integrity that is , one whose self-esteem is rooted in reality and one whose self-esteem consists of grandiosity , fantasies of superiority , exaggerated notions of one ' s accomplishments , megalomania , and favorable global self-evaluations induced by drugs and alcohol. No definition of self-esteem or piece of research that obliterates a distinction of this fundamentality can make any claim to scientific legitimacy. It leaves reality out of its analysis . </root.v.2032><root.v.2033>The author of the Letter to the Ephesians sees no contradiction between an exhortation formulated in this way and the words : " Wives , be subject to your husbands , as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife " ( 5 : 22-23 ) . The author knows that this way of speaking , so profoundly rooted in the customs and religious tradition of the time , is to be understood and carried out in a new way : as a " mutual subjection out of reverence for Christ " ( cf. Eph 5 : 21 ) . This is especially true because the husband is called the " head " of the wife as Christ is the head of the Church; he is so in order to give " himself up for her " ( Eph 5 : 25 ) , and giving himself up for her means giving up even his own life. However , whereas in the relationship between Christ and the Church the subjection is only on the part of the Church , in the relationship between husband and wife the " subjection " is not one-sided but mutual . </root.v.2033><root.v.2034>Each aspect of this wondrous reality relates to others as to a dancing partner , but God longs not only for dancers but for conscious dancers and so begins the paradoxical journey of man , called not only to the dance but to be an image of divine consciousness , an image of the Eternal Logos. This journey is paradoxical because consciousness ' and dance ' are , it would seem , inimical - the one rooted in individuality , the other an expression of pure community . </root.v.2034><root.v.2035>Keep the leaves moist with automatic mist or with a poly tent or put them in an area that stays cool and moist. The greatest danger is drying out. Some will root in a few weeks , but it is more likely the majority will root over he winter. Your can tell when they are rooted when they throw a vigorous new shoot. You may have to remove the rooted cuttings from the flat as they root or they roots will completely colonize the flat or pot and restrict the root growth of the laggards . </root.v.2035><root.v.2036>Every truth in the Word of God is like a seed. When we hear the Word it is very important that it goes deep into our hearts and becomes rooted in our lives. The depth of the planting is based on the openness of our heart. If our heart is not fully open , then there is only a shallow planting , which is easily rooted out by the Enemy , Satan ( Matthew 13 : 19 ) . </root.v.2036><root.v.2037>Spotted spurge is a summer annual. While similar to prostate spurge , there are several subtle differences in the two varieties. Spotted spurge has a more erect growth habit than prostrate spurge. They have similar leaves , which are small and oblong shaped with an irregular red to purple spot , but the leaf of spotted spurge is slightly larger than that of prostrate spurge. Both spurges will have leaves that grow opposite on the stem , but spotted spurge has fewer leaves per stem. Both spurges contain a milky sap in the stem. Prostrate spurge roots at the nodes , spotted spurge does not. The flower of spotted spurge is small and green in color. It germinates in mid spring and flowers from June to September. Both spotted and prostrate spurge reproduce from seed , although prostrate spurge also roots at the nodes . </root.v.2037><root.v.2038>have reproductive structures- seeds , roots , rhizomes , etc.- that can not be fully ...

All other tooth extraction techniques are derived from this . </root.v.2040><root.v.2041>We note , however , that some source trees could probably be retained as rooted even when their taxon sets are restricted to the ingroup of the overall analysis. These include source trees that have been rooted using any of a number of rare genomic changes such as gene duplications or the presence absence of large indels ( see Rokas and Holland , 2000 ) . Such changes are held to be less susceptible to homoplasy and therefore might provide more robust evidence for the placement of the root of the tree , even in the absence of outgroup information. However , as the gene duplication examples mentioned above ( Donoghue and Mathews , 1998; Mathews and Donoghue , 1999 , 2000 ) illustrate , even the placement of roots determined using rare genomic changes can be subject to revision. Moreover , such assessments are also dependent upon implicit assumptions. For example , the use of the phytochrome gene duplication evidence to root the angiosperms rests on the assumption that the relevant genes ( PHYA and PHYC ) diverged just before the root of the angiosperms ( Donoghue and Mathews , 1998 ) , something that has recently been called into question ( Sharrock and Mathews , in press ) . </root.v.2041><root.v.2042>Here is an overview : Take a one-gallon pot , fill it with perlite or sand and wet thoroughly. Make your cuttings about the length of a pencil and cut off all but one or two leaves at the top; cut through an eye ( a leaf node ) on a slant; dip this end in Rootone; poke a hole in the potting medium with a pencil so as not to wipe off the hormone and stick in the cuttings. ( Many growers will scrape some of the bark from the bottom 1 " of the cutting. ) You can put many cuttings in one pot as they tend to root better with company. Keep the cuttings moist and in partial sun. They should root in about 6 - 8 weeks with temperatures in the roughly 70-85 F range. ( Some varieties will root without using rooting hormones . ) </root.v.2042><root.v.2043>6 Just as you have personally received Christ Jesus the Lord , keep walking in the sphere of Him. 7 Having been firmly rooted and constantly being built up in Him ( Christ ) , and being established by faith ( Bible Doctrine ) , even as you have been taught , overflowing with thanksgiving. The Christian life begins at Salvation ( Col 2 : 6 ) , as symbolized by the color red , for the blood of Christ. When the seed of the Gospel is believed , it germinates. Roots go down and the shoot goes up , per the tree analogy of Colossians 2 : 7. " Having been firmly rooted in Him ( Christ ) " means the roots , which go down into the earth , symbolize the anchor of Jesus Christ in Salvation. The believer is entered into union with Christ at Salvation and becomes a member of the body of Christ. The roots going down into the earth and the shoot going up from the earth symbolizes separation from the world. The roots are symbolized by the color orange . </root.v.2043><root.v.2044>11.

If the tree is rooted inside some cluster , the results of the clustering will be affected by the root position; moreover , the undesirable split inside a cluster containing the root could occur. For example , if the root divides a cluster so that one of the resulting branches will contain more than MANY species , this branch will be wrongly reported as a cluster. However , if a tree is rooted somewhere in between the clusters , the results will not be affected by the root position because a branch with a cluster acts as a stopper in the algorithm , and no split inside a cluster will occur . </root.v.2045><root.v.2046>If you are not planting your balled or bundled tree for a week or two , place your bundle in a cool moist spot ie. Against a southern wall of the house , under your carport or under a shady tree. Keep your trees out of the sun. If you are going to store your plants for several weeks or months heal them in , ( bury their roots with sawdust or soil ) . This involves digging a trough in a well-drained garden bed or a heap of builders sand and burying healing in bed by the 15th of September.

They must not be allowed to dry out during flowering and fruiting. In spring , shorten the canes to 3 feet , forcing the growth into lateral side branches which are trained along support wires.. After they produce fruit , the spent canes are cut back to the ground. With ever bearing varieties the second crop is produced on canes which sprout in the spring , these canes should n't be cut back until they produce fruit the following spring. Never cut off the new canes which have n't produced yet , they will produce the next years crop.

Executive Information Systems have the potential to drastically alter the prevailing patterns of organizational communication and thus will typically be met with resistance. Some of this resistance is simply a matter of a lack of knowledge. Training on how to use statistics and performance measures can help. However , resistance can also be rooted in the feelings of fear , insecurity and cynicism experienced by individuals throughout the organization. These attitudes can only be influenced by a strong and vocal executive champion who consistently reinforces the purpose of the system and directs the attention of the executive group away from unproductive and punitive behaviours . </root.v.2055><root.v.2056>Anti-Semitic acts , be they " minor " or " major , " rhetorical or physical , violate the fundamental covenant we all share as citizens of a democracy.

The simplest and easiest method of propagating figs is by stem cuttings from an older bush. Make cuttings in late February. The cutting should be 8 to 10 inches long from 1-year-old wood. The upper end should be cut just above a node. Tips and soft growth do not root satisfactorily. Set the cuttings directly in the nursery row in well-drained and well-prepared soil. The cutting length governs the planting depth. Cuttings should be planted so only one bud is exposed and spaced 10 inches apart in the row ( see Figure 1 ) . In case of dry weather , watering will aid the growth of the cuttings. These cuttings root early , grow rapidly and make good trees for permanent planting in the fall . </root.v.2060><root.v.2061>A number of times in Scripture the word healing has specific reference to spiritual healing.

If you want a highly centralised state and consider a state as simply being an " instrument of class rule " then you will see little to worry about in the concentration of power into the hands of a few party leaders.

The use of soil can cause the cutting to rot before it roots. This is because soil contains high levels of bacteria. If you are attempting to root cuttings in cool weather , vermiculite ( also called rock wool ) is the best medium. It holds warmth , which increases biological activity. Cuttings can root within four weeks during the winter using vermiculite , provided they 're placed in a warm sunny window. Most Trichocereus cacti are cold hardy to 20 F , and cuttings to 30 F. If rooting is to begin when weather is hot , sand is best because it will keep the cuttings cool.

In fact , if you teach ethics and let unethical behavior go undetected and unpunished , you may have just the opposite effect. People may become resentful and potentially less ethical. If you educate , audit , monitor , make policies , and discipline , it creates an environment supportive of ethical behavior. It roots out unethical behavior and demonstrates support for those who will only believe the environment is ethical if they see action. Extolling the virtues of ethical behavior to solve all of our problems and downplaying the basic elements of compliance as onerous and unnecessary is easier and more desirable.

The appeal of autonomy spans the entire political spectrum. Originally coming from the Greek and meaning " self " plus " law , " it is at the core of the liberal democratic theory of justice and values such as freedom of speech and movement. Understood radically , however , it has been the terrain upon which revolutionary social movements have encountered each other throughout Europe; " autonomy at the base , " from the grassroots , is the core organizational principle of the influential social movement known as Autonomia in Italy. Globally it has been a refrain of countless uprisings , struggles , rebellions , and resistance movements from the Zapatistas in Chiapas to the Organisasi Papua Merdeka ( the Free Papua Movement ) in West Papua , a colony of Indonesia. From the Cauca people of Colombia to the communities of Kerala in southwestern India and on to creating spaces for freedom the asamblistas and piqueteros of the Argentinean uprisings , people worldwide are developing political and social forms rooted in differing concepts of autonomy . </root.v.2090><root.v.2091>Lavender is pretty easy to start from cuttings , takes longer than some others though.

Tai chi students should be aware that we want to avoid compressing the leg joints as well as the spine , to increase the circulation of chi and the ability to connect , or root. This connection is strong and supple , but is not achieved by tightly holding on with the legs. If a student stands in a way that uses a lot of muscle strength , they are most likely , compressing leg joints. Strong and rooted should be due to the internal connection throughout the body , and knowing how to drop your weight , or anyone else 's force , to your root.

If either is too limited or too great in extent , the other will not thrive. The root must be sufficiently widespread to absorb enough water and nutrients for the stem and leaves , which , in turn , must manufacture sufficient food for the maintenance of the root system. It is a well established fact that grasses develop a better root system when they are mowed once or twice a year than when they are closely and frequently grazed. In fact , one of the most important factors in the various systems of range and pasture management is to permit the seedling grasses to become well rooted before the tops are removed by grazing. 175 </root.v.2095><root.v.2096>With specimens that are already rooted ( usually shipped " bare root " ) , it helps to have one person hold the cactus with the roots hanging in the pot , fill with crumbled soil mix and gently tamp , taking care not to clump the roots up together.

At an early age children become lazy , are prone to slyness and deceit , and manifest greed and cruelty toward other children. At five years of age one can already see hints of his future character. If the parents do not teach him to overcome his bad inclinations , these may grow into passions and vices. Sometimes parents occasionally lament about their children : " Where does he get such stubbornness , capriciousness , and inclinations toward the forbidden ? He does not see any of this in us. " Actually , there is no need to teach a child evil - it is already rooted in him. A mother observing her child said , " He clearly manifests the negative characteristics of his father.

When growers receive cases of these cuttings they assume that if the cuttings appear to be of high quality , they will root rapidly and grow into a salable product within a standard period of time. However , sometimes cuttings do not respond as expected. Diseases , shipping conditions , or pesticide toxicity are blamed for poor rooting or plant growth , yet it is not uncommon to find that none of these factors can be identified as the cause of the problem.

In some cases , defective soil aeration causes disease. The wilt disease of Java indigo and other monsoon crops of India is due to damage of the root system resulting from defective aeration. This is brought about by the rise of the water table , combined with the decrease of the porosity of the surface soil by heavy rains. Wilted plants possess few fine roots and nodules in an active condition , most of them being dead or discolored. Deeply rooted varieties of crops are especially subject to wilt , while shallow-rooted ones are little affected. The root tips often show marked aerotropism and grow upwards towards the air. In some cases , they abandon the soil and grow over the surface of the ground. Sometimes , insects and fungi attack the crops and cause disease , the actual attack following the operation of some factor such as poor soil aeration or soil temperatures unfavorable for good growth and other functions of the root system. This is thought to be due to change in cell sap , arising from root damage , which prepares the way for the parasite. 101a </root.v.2122><root.v.2123>Next , strip off some of the lower leaves , exposing up to about an inch of the base of the crown ( the stalk will root but the leaves will rot - see photo ) .

First , every New Testament doctrine is rooted in and grounded in something in the Old Testament. And by looking at what the Old Testament says about something , we can get a more accurate viewpoint about what the New Testament teaches about it. Second , I think a lot of things we understand or think we understand about the resurrection are things that we have assumed. In other words , if you ask someone off the street what they think resurrection means; immediately they think of a bunch of bodies flying out of the graves , and tombs flying open and bodies going up in the air. The question is : Does Scripture support such a view , and to what extent does it support this view. If we are going to be Bereans and search the Scriptures to see whether these things are so , I think it is appropriate for us to be able to defend our beliefs and to know why we believe them.

Hostas that had been divided early and put into pots will be somewhat poorly rooted by fall , but ones that had been put into the ground will be very well rooted.

A pliant branch is gently staked to the ground and covered with a little loosened , amended soil , leaving the last 6 " to 12 " above ground and staked straight up. Remove leaves from the area to be underground and gently wound this area by twisting or slightly nicking. Dust on a little rooting hormone and keep the area well watered. This method has the advantage of allowing rooting while still attached to the mother plant. Several weeks later when rooted , the plant can be cut off below the new roots and planted on its own. Rhododendron , honeysuckle , Wisteria , grape , pothos , heart-leaf Philodendron and Clematis lend themselves to this method . </root.v.2144><root.v.2145>All plants I tried had already rather large new white asparagus-like shoots.

Perhaps this acceptance of rebellion is so rooted in our culture because of our notion that America owes it independence to that " spirit of rebellion " . </root.v.2161><root.v.2162>Avoid feeding softwood shrub cuttings any additional nitrogen after rooting. A little nitrogen , which is available in nutrient-enriched planting mixes , can help the rooting process proceed.

However , in assessing these differences , it is important to distinguish between those that arise because of questionable decisions ( e.g. , the choice of what in hindsight is an inappropriate outgroup ) versus those that arise because of the error inherent to any phylogenetic analysis. For example , because the choice of outgroup in each of the Messenger and McGuire ( 1998 ) and Lin et al. ( 2002 ) examples is apparently robust , the incongruences found probably represent real incongruence and not an artifact of a questionable rooting decision. We would argue that only the latter is sufficient cause to actively deroot trees . </root.v.2163><root.v.2164>20.2.1 The human body is rooted in primate desires , urges and volitions.

Still , the plants must not be planted any deeper than the original soil depth. To prevent settling of the plant , build a crown of soil for fibrous rooted plants. Roses are a good example of such plants. Leave the center of the bottom portion of the planting hole higher than the edges to allow the plant to rest firmly. This mound at the bottom of the hole prevents the plant from settling and helps to spread the roots in their natural position . </root.v.2178><root.v.2179>Although " subordination " primarily describes a way of relating to another person , it also involves a character trait , a disposition to respond in a certain way. Subordination extends beyond obedience to commands to also include respectfulness and receptiveness to direction. " Submissiveness " is probably the best English term in such contexts. " Submissiveness , " in this sense , is an overall character trait related to humility which all Christians should possess. The Christian character is portrayed in scripture as respectful of authority , not rebellious. ( 38 ) Men as well as women should be submissive in their sub ordinate relationships. However , 1 Peter 3 especially urges wives to be submissive in their relationship with their husbands. They are to have a respectful and quiet spirit , qualities which derive from their fear of and trust in the Lord. The passage says that a wife 's quietness and peacefulness are rooted in her acceptance of God 's order for her life and a trust in him. The wife can be submissive because she knows that God stands behind Christian order , and he cares for her , either through her husband or sometimes in spite of her husband . </root.v.2179><root.v.2180>For those that are having problems , I suggest you verify the spelling of all files.

In a striking contrast to all myths , the Bible ( essentially the accounts of the Passion , but also passages from the Old Testament ) on the one hand reveals the innocence of the victim and on the other hand denounces and explains the victim mechanism. It can not be over-emphasised that the Bible does explain -- in terms which have proved anthropologically significant -- the mechanism of human societal violence. The Bible states -- as a revolutionary theory of man -- that human societies release their inner tensions by accusing and killing victims that in reality are innocent. Through this new perspective , the Bible ( Old and New Testaments ) has caused a modification in the relationship between human society and its victims.

Aloes grow readily from cuttings or truncheons and should be removed from the parent plant by means of a clean , sharp knife or secateurs. Cuttings should be placed in a shady position and be allowed to dry out for a day or two , after which they can be rooted in a damp , sandy mixture.

Jesus enters into the concrete and historical situation of women , a situation which is weighed down by the inheritance of sin. One of the ways in which this inheritance is expressed is habitual discrimination against women in favor of men. This inheritance is rooted within women too. From this point of view the episode of the woman " caught in adultery " ( cf. Jn 8 : 3-11 ) is particularly eloquent. In the end Jesus says to her : " Do not sin again , " but first he evokes an awareness of sin in the men who accuse her in order to stone her , thereby revealing his profound capacity to see human consciences and actions in their true light.

Islam , like all religions , is not only a theological affirmation but also a living historical process with multiple syntheses and expressions that must be taken into account. Though in principle we may speak of Islam as an integral tradition , from a practical , realistic standpoint there are many Islams , each of which reflects a different approach to perennial challenges of integrating precept and practice.

This approach , which was accepted by Paul and popularized by writers such as Aldous Huxley and Ninian Smart , set the stage for a tradition which could borrow from any religion but claimed independence from all religions. Since Eckankar was not rooted in any particular religion , it could drift in any direction on the sea of culture. Without any counterforce such as a leader with a commitment to continuity or fidelity to the original tradition defined by Paul , it was only a matter of time before Eckankar drifted away from Hinduism and towards Christianity . </root.v.2281><root.v.2282>Please note that with this new file you will need to manually reboot your nook once again after it fully boots up after successful rooted 1.2 update . </root.v.2282><root.v.2283>One of the most magical things about gardening is taking a cutting and watching it suddenly start to grow into a whole new plant.

By using a word as graphic as scorched to describe the heat which believers will feel , the Lord , who is not given to hyperbole , tells us something about the heat that will come , not alone in the rigors of individual life , but also in the special summer of circumstances which Jesus said would come when the leaves of the fig tree sprouted ( see Matthew 24 : 32 ) .

The method in which this is done , through what is called waypoint mapping , when generalised and so abstracted is transformed into the feeling of 'right ' from 'wrong ' and that is tied in to syntax processing. ( This feeling has been sourced in the left hemisphere of humans , note how EITHER/OR this feeling is. This either/or emphasis reflects the distinction of square-wave from fourier transform where the latter sums waves to approach the 'pure ' square-wave; in other words fourier tranforms are like summing aspects , harmonics , of a whole but despite the level of precision possible you can never absolutely assert 'the whole ' since the list of harmonics is infinite . ) </root.v.2290><root.v.2291>2.

First , the moral position of the Judeo-Christian tradition is far from clear. Although all believers root their morality in scripture , there are wide differences in how sacred texts are understood. While some Christians maintain using alcohol is a sin , others serve wine in church. Similar differences exist with respect to the Christian positions on gambling , divorce and homosexuality. Liberals point to the fact that people of faith can be found on both sides of abortion , capital punishment , and assisted suicide to demonstrate that religiously based moral reasoning is incapable of effectively dealing with the major moral controversies of our time . </root.v.2298><root.v.2299>Temperatures must be kept warm , around 75 degrees Fahrenheit , so bottom heat from a warming mat ( or heating pad ) is especially beneficial.

" If ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish " ( James 3 : 14 , 15 ) .

I want patients forums for acute trusts and mental health trusts to be just as attractive as those for the PCTs. We want to ensure that the system is rooted in patients forumsthat people see them as the driver in the system. There are genuine reasons for PCT patients forums to have a wider role , because PCTs do not merely provide primary care but also commission secondary services. Instead of seeing the system as a hierarchywhere one patients forum is better than anotherI should prefer the PCT patients forums to be seen as having a broader remit. They should be seen not as reporting upwards in a hierarchy of organisations , but as having extended responsibilities . </root.v.2306><root.v.2307>2.

When we change the form " that he might destroy " into the present , we have , namely , " I loose or I destroy , " in this case " I destroy.

It 's best to use a mature leaf , but not one that 's old and tough. Using a sharp knife or razor , trim away the top of the leaf blade.

This does n't hold much water for long , but it is fine for rooting cuttings of cactus-type plants which would ordinarily rot in higher moisture media. Coarse vermiculite alone has excellent water-holding capacity and aeration , but may dry out rapidly via evaporation if not covered in some way. A mix of 50 peat moss and 50 perlite favors good aeration.

If we loose sight of our core issues for secondary ones. which may be good in themselves e.g. building maintenance , then we will undermine our identity as a church.

After the collapse , hundreds of fighters streamed out of the cities and headed for the mountains.

Water your bulbs after planting to help them start the rooting process . </root.v.2316><root.v.2317>Going back to the earliest days of the church , Christians have refused to compromise their proclamation of the gospel. In Acts 4 , Peter and John were ordered to stop preaching. Their answer was , Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God ' s sight to obey you rather than God. For we can not help speaking about what we have seen and heard. Through the centuries , Christianity has taught that civil disobedience is not only permitted , but sometimes required. There is no more eloquent defense of the rights and duties of religious conscience than the one offered by Martin Luther King , Jr. , in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail. Writing from an explicitly Christian perspective , and citing Christian writers such as Augustine and Aquinas , King taught that just laws elevate and ennoble human beings because they are rooted in the moral law whose ultimate source is God Himself. Unjust laws degrade human beings. Inasmuch as they can claim no authority beyond sheer human will , they lack any power to bind in conscience.

Most of these have undertones of other foods such as apple , lemon , orange , pineapple , and even chocolate. Fresh mint is often used in Mediterranean , Middle Eastern , and Southeast Asian cooking , and can also be used to make teas and infusions.

Arrangements of the same flower color are also more breathtaking than a checker board of colors . </root.v.2321><root.v.2322>Containerized hostas can be planted with a minimum of shock throughout the spring , summer and into fall. They should be completely bare rooted before planting and their roots untangled. If your hostas arrive bare root they will probably appreciate being soaked in a bucket of water for several hours to rehydrate them before planting. Pinching a leaf or two will also reduce desiccation shock and usually stimulate another flush of leaves. Hostas usually acclimate completely to their new homes in 1-2 weeks and should be kept moist during that period. A topdressing of fertilizer will also encourage rapid new growth . </root.v.2322><root.v.2323>You see the emotional problem in resistance to gay marriage in the faulty logic in arguments against it.

In all cases , the crowns of 2 and 3 rooted teeth need to be sectioned to produce single root pieces prior to extraction. The roots of multi-rooted teeth are usually divergent and therefore have different paths of withdrawal. Using a dental drill to section the crown enables cutting that is accurate , quick , and causes minimum trauma to adjacent tissues . </root.v.2329><root.v.2330>Use cutting wood approximately 1/4 inch ( lead pencil thickness ) in diameter. A small head or top should already be formed at top of cutting. After the cutting has been selected and removed from the parent plant , trim and shape the head , leaving as much foliage on as possible. ( See Figure 19. ) Measure down from where the head starts to branch , then make a new cut for the base of the cutting. To make a finished miniature on a 10 inch trunk , the stem or trunk should measure 12 inches. This allows for two inches of the trunk which will go into the soil. Carefully remove all eyes below the head as suggested in the first method. Immerse cuttings in a Captan ( Orthocide ) solution. Dust the base of each cutting with Rootone ( hormone ) powder before sticking it into the rooting bench or container. We mist the cuttings as needed until rooting occurs. Then they are transplanted as suggested for budded cuttings . </root.v.2330><root.v.2331>A number of passages portray the characteristics of the reign of the Messianic King. One major characteristic , stemming from the absolute monarchy that will exist , is that He will rule with a rod of iron. This iron-handed rule is rooted in Psalm 2 : 9 and will be a necessity due to the fact that nations will exist and the people populating them will still have their sin nature. It has already been pointed out in the previous chapter that , after the first generation , there will be unbelievers present in the Kingdom. The natural outworking of this sin nature will have to be restrained. The Kingdom will not be a democracy , but an absolute monarchy. The reign of the Messianic King will be a strict one , and the righteous and just laws emanating from Jerusalem will have to be obeyed . </root.v.2331><root.v.2332>Here 's the general framework for courts to apply in deciding whether to strike down marriage restrictions. Under the Constitution , there are certain " fundamental " rights , like the right to travel , the right to privacy , the right to raise your children as you see fit and the right to marry. The language we usually see in these court rulings is that a fundamental right is something that is " deeply rooted in our tradition. " In 1967 , the Supreme Court held that it was illegal for the State of Virginia to prohibit interrracial marriage. A few years later , the Court said flat out that " the right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individuals. " For this reason , even inmates can get married.

In the end , family vendettas , rooted in the tungsten deal , have caused much of what has happened. This book is kind of a mess. The plot is all over. The connection between the two storylines is something closer to seven degrees of separation than a direct cause and effect. Many of the characters are downright depraved.

It is true that in many cases contraception and even abortion are practised under the pressure of reallife difficulties , which nonetheless can never exonerate from striving to observe God 's law fully. Still , in very many other instances such practices are rooted in a hedonistic mentality unwilling to accept responsibility in matters of sexuality , and they imply a self-centered concept of freedom , which regards procreation as an obstacle to personal fulfilment. The life which could result from a sexual encounter thus becomes an enemy to be avoided at all costs , and abortion becomes the only possible decisive response to failed contraception . </root.v.2335><root.v.2336>And that largely explains my own political leanings.

It is not possible to build such relationships when you are rooted in the level of the conditioned mind. Try as hard as you want but you can not unconditionally love anyone until you start loving yourself unconditionally. It is not something you do , but something which happens on its own. Never try to love someone unconditionally because you will fail miserably. You will not only bring suffering to yourself but will also scare the other person into thinking that you are some kind of a lunatic. Your mind can never understand unconditional love , so don ' t bother attempting it. When you start living naturally , rooted effortlessly in your being , there arises unconditional love. You will not be afraid of anything when you are deeply seated in your being , your very true essence and nature. In this lack of fear you will find unconditional love welling inside you and it will naturally flow outside you. Any relationship you enter into from this state of being will be rich and full of love . </root.v.2338><root.v.2339>Well , yes. Although people have been rooting plants in water for decadessometimes with great successthis is not the best way to root your plants. The roots that form in water are not the same as roots that form in soil. They are fragile and brittle , adapted to growing in water as opposed to soil. Once your transfer a water-rooted plant to soil , many of these roots will break off immediately and the rest will shrivel and die up as they 're replaced by the more robust roots adapted to soil . </root.v.2339><root.v.2340>In an era of change such as ours it seems that many people are still uncertain about what concrete , renewed forms will give meaning to life and will have the capacity to survive. A whole generation can pass during the time of uncertainty and searching. However , as many responses affirm , today the consecrated life has the courage to give itself still to the profession of the evangelical counsels as a great plan of God offering Christ 's faithfulthe women and men of our agea fullness of meaning and joy rooted in the word and example of Christ himself . </root.v.2340><root.v.2341>The Jacks pot the cuttings starting 3 to 4 weeks after they take them. They recommend leaving the trays of rooted cuttings up to a week without water ( depending on growing conditions ) before potting them. Let the mix almost dry out but keep an eye on the cuttings and mist them lightly periodically to keep the leaves healthy. The harsh treatment forces the rooted cuttings to put out lots of new growth as the plant looks for moisture. By drying out the rooting medium , you keep root damage to a minimum , because dry potting mix breaks away from the young , tender roots more readily than does heavy , wet potting mix . </root.v.2341><root.v.2342>Fibrous rooted begonias ( semperflorens ) can be confined to the compost heap but if you think there 's going to be a shortage of colour indoors they can also be trimmed back , potted up and will start flowering all over again. The only proviso is that the roots are checked for small white grubs ( vine weevil ) during the transfer from border to pot . </root.v.2342><root.v.2343>" Your soul is your mind , your will and your emotions.

Points out Haridas , " Vetiver grass grows so densely that it can block the spread of other grasses including some of the world 's worst creeping grasses. In Zimbabwe tobacco farmers reportedly plant vetiver around their fields to prevent invasion of other tough grasses. In Mauritius sugar cane growers rely on vetiver to prevent Bermuda grass from penetrating their fields from adjacent road-sides. In High Range , for example , a vetiver plot established at Kundaly in the early 1990s kept Kikyu grass ( Pennisetum clandestinum ) from creeping in. Obviously establishing vetiver hedges along the periphery of tea fields could prevent invasion of deep rooted tough grass weeds.

Hung Gar , characterized by its rooted stance , also stresses the use of animal movements , the Tiger and the Crane. The Tiger embodies Hard Power , while the Crane embodies Soft Power. Earthbending also expresses the aspect of neutral jing , which involves listening and waiting. Finally , Earthbending requires decisiveness; when the time come to strike , it must be done without hesitation or uncertainty. If an Earthbender lacks determination , the earth will not respond to their will. Being connected to the earth is also a very important aspect of Earthbenders ' spirituality . </root.v.2346><root.v.2347>Here 's James ' tip on making a " lazy mans garden " . In the fall , construct some raised beds in the garden. Cover these beds with 8 inches of hay or straw. In the spring , when time is of the essence , just pull the mulch to the sides of the bed to plant. If planting warm weather crops , make sure the soil is warm before planting. As the plants start to grow , pull the mulch back around the plants. The mulch will choke out weeds and keep the soil moist ( you will not have to water as often ) . As an added bonus , James states that the earthworm population in his garden has greatly increased since using this method. This has worked for just about everything in his garden except for corn and sunflowers ( makes them too shallow rooted , thus suffering from wind damage ) . So if you are always rushed to get your garden planted in the spring , get out in the garden now and give James ' " lazy mans garden " a try ! From James Lee M. in Mexico , Missouri . </root.v.2347><root.v.2348>Deep-water and marginal water plants are best planted in special aquatic planting baskets rather than directly into the soil at the bottom of a pond. This enables you to plant up on land and lower the baskets down into the water rather than having to get wet. More importantly , it allows you to control the spread of plants many water plants are vigorous and can take over a small pond. Oxygenating plants with roots can be planted in containers too but they can also be tied to a stone or piece of tile and dropped in the water where they will root on the bottom. These are plants that survive fully submerged. They recycle oxygen back into the water . </root.v.2348><root.v.2349>Brad it worked perfect for me .

It is easily transplanted , even from a cutting off a larger plant. I picked up one in the desert which had been uprooted completely by an ATV. It was lying on its side and had already started rooting itself where it laid on the ground. I planted it in its upright position and it now looks strange due to the dead roots coming out of its side like little arms . </root.v.2350><root.v.2351>Under Glass Renew shading on glass and damp down during hot weather.

Action which has the bondage of karma comes from the ego. It 's based on beliefs and expectations and interpretations and fears and judgments and past memories , whereas non-binding action , which is non-Karmic , is called kriya action rooted in pure awareness and creativity. So you 've gone beyond the being the bundle of conditioned reflexes that 's either in a fight or flight mode. You 're in the intuitive , in the creative , in the visionary and the sacred mode. And that 's an expression of Shakti ) . And finally , of course , there is the expression of desire , the fifth female quality. Desire is pure potentiality seeking manifestation . </root.v.2353><root.v.2354>The American ideal of sexuality appears to be rooted in the American ideal of masculinity. This idea has created cowboys and Indians , good guys and bad guys , punks and studs , tough guys and softies , butch and faggot , black and white. It is an ideal so paralytically infantile that it is virtually forbidden -- as an unpatriotic act -- that the American boy evolve into the complexity of manhood . </root.v.2354><root.v.2355>There are many secondary gains of the male heart wound. Power and wealth are two great anesthetics for the wounded male heart. Power and wealth get men the social trappings , including pretty women and all the toys , that allow men to avoid the emptiness in their own hearts. " When I am feeling powerful , I have no pain , " commented a man I interviewed. Men have built externally functional selves with worldly rewards. However , these rewards are not rooted in a core sense of self or soul which is inaccessible and undesirable , having been lost , broken , underdeveloped or never defined. This lack of sense of self , fragile self , undeveloped self results in an elaborately built psychic/emotional defense system that draws power and attention towards the person and keeps pain at bay . </root.v.2355><root.v.2356>WATER newly installed sod frequently ! Sod should receive 1 " of water daily. ( You can measure this by putting a small can such as a tuna fish can where the water hits from the sprinkler. When there is an inch of water in the can , you know you have an inch on the lawn. ) When the sod has rooted into the soil ( usually 10-14 days ) sod should receive at least 1 " of water per week . </root.v.2356><root.v.2357>Plants like Swedish ivy ( Pothos ) and spider plants are usually done by putting the stem cuttings in water. For other stem cuttings , cut off a 4 to 5 inch end of a healthy stem and remove all but the top leaves. ( Make sure this cutting has lots of nodes , that is , the place where the leaf attaches to the stem ) . You may wish to dip this cutting into some rooting hormone prior to inserting it into the growing mix. Have your growing mix prepared prior to starting and then make a hole in it with a pencil , place the cutting in the hole , firm up the soil around the stem , water lightly. Cover the cutting and pot with a plastic bag and put it in a well-lit area until roots have formed. Geraniums and other soft cuttings do not benefit from being covered , in fact , they often rot before rooting. Cuttings do best when the soil is almost dry so do n't water them until they are rooted . </root.v.2357><root.v.2358>Entangling roots is one of our two crowd control ( CC ) spells.

The optimum base temperature has to be worked out together with the air temperature of each variety. For example , Bramley Seedling roots well if cuttings are taken at leaf fall and placed in a propagating bin with base heat of 25  C and in an air temperature of 20  C. Many other varieties rooted with an air temperature around 5  C. There was also marked seasonal variation in rooting. The use of a rooting hormone ( IBA ) was essential with most varieties. The method is only used for easy rooting subjects commercially , such as rootstocks. New simpler techniques are being evaluated by F.P.

In more subtle examples like EPA emission credits , US Treasuries , or Federal Reserve Open Market Operations , economists need to realize the roots of these creations and how they affect the market economy.

I can take a cutting from the same plant starting in March and it will root quickly. It appears that at least for some plants time of year is a factor. If it 's not showing signs of rotting or wilting I would give it some more time. On another note , to high a concentration of rooting hormone can actually delay or prevent rooting . </root.v.2371><root.v.2372>Nature 's Grasp is a self buff that causes things that hit you to become rooted.

Burying them too deep will cause the stems to rot. If the plant is mature and has a good root system , you can trim off a third of the roots , including the old brownish ones because these are , in effect , dead roots . </root.v.2377><root.v.2378>However , sins of the flesh are not the only ones that impair spiritual vision. The deepest rooted and most subtle of the weaknesses of our fallen nature is pride , and it is that weakness that so often becomes an obstacle to the action of the Holy Spirit and the divine light He brings to perfect the gift of faith. For that reason , another basic requisite for that purity of heart that enables one to see God is humility. We call to mind again St. Thomas 's reminder that " humility removes pride , whereby a man refuses to submit himself to the truth of faith. " The divine truth that is God is expressed in His revealed word and handed down by the Church. If one is so attached to his own judgments that he refuses to accept the official teaching of the Church , he places an obstacle to the enlightening and liberating action of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit who safeguards the deposit of faith in the Church down through the centuries , and it is that same divine Person who " creates a clean heart " ( Ps.51 : 10 ) in those open to His action . </root.v.2378><root.v.2379>July and August are two of the best summer months for taking cuttings of evergreens. Among the most popular plants to take cuttings of are Rhododendrons , Azaleas , Camellias and Heather , just to name a few. Take the cuttings from mature tip growth. The cuttings should only be three to six inches in length , remove the lower foliage and dip the cut-end into a rooting hormone solution.

Some growers root the cuttings directly in the finishing container while others use rooting cubes , plugs or wedges. Regardless of the choice , the media should be free of insects , disease causing organisms , weeds , or toxic elements. It is also important for the media to have good pore space ( about 20 ) and water holding capacity ( about 50 ) and provide physical support for the cutting. Avoid saturating the media as this will delay rooting and increase the risk of fungus gnat and disease problems. Placing the rooting media on sand or other porous surfaces can help wick excess water from the media . </root.v.2381><root.v.2382>What might those criteria be ?

Unfortunately when a tree is removed from a garden , more often than not , it is sawn off across the base rather than pulled over which sprags up the lateral roots - the roots left being the food supply for the pathogen. Once you have this situation , where you have inoculated roots underground there is often very little you can do about it , as removal of these roots may be extremely difficult , expensive and if they are cross rooted with other lateral roots form surrounding health woody subjects , removal would cause abrasive damage to these latter. If nothing is done then there is a risk that the disease by means of its very efficient rhizomorphs travelling through the feeding soil ( from the surface down to clay ) may now claim new victims. Our philosophy is to stop this by persuading you to treat prophylactically all your favourite and valuable subjects in the area of risk and continue every year until the Honey Fungus in the source is starved out . </root.v.2383><root.v.2384>Hi unlockr , I tried this process and think I have totally messed up my phone.

Cover at least a few inches of the branch in the trench with good soil , and hold the branch firmly in the trench with wooden pegs , U-shaped wires , or heavy things such as bricks or stones. It can help to wound part of the branch that will be underground by making a shallow cut or by scraping off some of the bark , and putting rooting hormone on the wound. Some people carefully twist and bend the branch upright at the point it is buried , tearing it a little as it is twisted , to form a sideways 'T ' with the right hand side of the T pointing down. Although this works if the branch stays connected , the damage gives more opportunity for disease to enter the wound.

I call these points " the three active nails. " When the foot is rooted , these three points grip like three nails penetrating the ground. In the movements of Tai Chi Chuan , these three points are aligned with the weight-bearing centerline of the upper body. They are very active and play a crucial role in our everyday movements.

To address such problems , the paper recommends that transcendental realist research questions , which are rooted in the principle of sustainable development , need to feature in our research projects on the topic. What role must the informal sector play in order for it to contribute to the sustainable development of our cities ?

Moreover , each religious tradition interprets culture in particular ways. In the Judaic-Christian tradition we may assert that media images , like all human endeavors , are subject to self-aggrandizement. Yet even as we corrupt cultural forms , we see also that they are open to transformation and renewal. For Jews and Christians , the search for redemptive aspects of culture is ultimately rooted in an irreducible confidence in the goodness of creation and the continuing activity of a Creator throughout time . </root.v.2403><root.v.2404>1.Parsley : yes , parsley is readily available in the supermarket year-round. However , there ' s a world of difference between freshly picked parsley , both in taste and nutrition , from a bunch that ' s traveled hundreds or thousands of miles before reaching your store. If your garden parsley has already gone to seed , it ' s not too late ! Buy a bunch and snip off the freshest tips , leaving as much stem as you can. Dip the cutting in a rooting hormone powder ( available at any nursery ) and set the cutting in a small pot of sandy soil. It will root within a week or two and begin sprouting new leaves. During this rooting period , spray the cutting , in its pot , with a fine mist to keep it moist. Allow the plant to grow to a sufficient size before you start snipping. Snipping will then encourage new branches . </root.v.2404><root.v.2405>Then , it continues , " Our family ... pledges to perfect the world based on the culture of heart , which is rooted in the original lineage ...

Stem cuttings of many favorite shrubs are quite easy to root but stem cuttings of tree species are more difficult. Cuttings from such trees as crape myrtles , some elms , and birches can be rooted without much difficulty. The good news is that a greenhouse is not necessary for successful evergreen propagation is not necessary as long as you are able to provide high humidity around the cutting. This can be done by covering the pot containing the evergreen cutting with a bottomless milk jug or by placing the pot in a clear plastic bag . </root.v.2409><root.v.2410>Author Real faces head-on the reality that many women are frustrated and angry with the struggle to achieve true emotional intimacy with their man. In recent decades , many women 's responsibilities and aspirations have grown dramatically while many men 's roles and expectations have not. Much marital dissatisfaction is rooted in men 's silence and disengagement , and women 's increasingly vocal attempts to attain meaningful closeness and cooperation. Real points out that men are often driven by their desire to avoid feelings of shame , while women are often driven by fear. The New Rules coaches couples through techniques to address the resulting anguish and deadlock , gently but deftly leading both women and men toward a more comfortable and collaborative relationship . </root.v.2410><root.v.2411>Utilizing your Roots on casters can sometimes be just as effective as using it on melee. Examples here would be to Root a Mage after he blinks. Often times if you have a Warrior or Rogue going after the Mage , it will force him to Ice Block , or he ' ll take significant amounts of damage. Furthermore , a caster who is rooted in place can be much more easily LoSed ( just move 40 yards away ) , or you can even potentially root them and leave them behind a pillar . </root.v.2411><root.v.2412>In mid-summer , soil is mounded up about a foot high around a young tree or a shrub. A plastic pot with the bottom cut out can be placed over the plant or a wooden frame can be built around the plant to keep the soil neatly in place. Roots will grow out of the stems where it is covered by soil. When the plant is dormant , the soil is removed and the rooted stems are cut off a couple inches above the original ground level. In the spring , new shoots will grow from the cut off stems. In mid-summer , the new shoots are covered with soil and the process repeats . </root.v.2412><root.v.2413>In this budget , we will end education programs that don ' t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don ' t need them.

There is no question about the tree 's " openness " to such nourishment ! </root.v.2415><root.v.2416>Theophrastus von Hohenheim was a latter day genius. It was his task to investigate nature in the totality of its laws , and to evaluate medicines as structural means furthering the life process of our body. His investigations were unconnected to magical mixtures. These things drove von Hohenheim through the world of his day. He was hated and feared , for he had the stamp of dissident genius. He did not regard churches and altars , doctrines and words , as things in themselves. Rather , he evaluated them according to how deeply they were rooted in nature and racial blood. Like the great Paracelsus , von Hohenheim became the vocal leader of all German natural scientists and mystics , a great preacher of our existence , our existential being in the world. In order to raise himself up from the earth , von Hohenheim reached for the stars like Meister Eckehart , and masterfully , yet modestly , fitted himself into the great laws of the universe.

A yantra represents the particular force whose power or energy increases in proportion to the abstraction and precision of the diagram. The principle behind this is that just as each form is the visible product of an energy pattern rooted in sound , so reciprocally , each visible form carries its own implicit power pattern. The equilateral , triangular shape standing on its base represents purusha or Shiva whereas standing on its apex it represents prakriti or Shakti. The duality that persists in yantra manifests itself in the magnificent doctrine of the tantras as Shiva and Shakti , male and female , the balance of form and energy. All manifestation is based on this fundamental duality . </root.v.2421><root.v.2422>Therefore , you must be God 's co-worker and comforter , one who prays that every fundamental root that is connected with the fall of man is rooted out from the heart of God.

Such preciousness will be realized because God 's shimjung of love will be reflected. Because God 's shimjung of love is reflected , you will long for people , you will long for villages , and you will long for nations. Therefore , you must always remember that God can not be liberated from His worries or from His shimjung of pain until His hope is fulfilled; that is His ultimate purpose of the liberated kingdom of Heaven on earth transcending the level of the nation.

She defines " lore " as derived from an Old English root meaning either the act of teaching or that which is learned. Thus , she goes on to explain , " folklore is what people have learned and passed on through the ages -- in effect , the traditions , beliefs , customs , sayings , stories , superstitions , and prejudices preserved by word of mouth among the common people " ( p. 61 ) . </root.v.2423><root.v.2424>69.1 Autoregulation means that the cause of change is not external but exclusively internal , i.e. rooted in the architecture &amp;the momentum of its constituent parts.

The newer top shoots once rooted may grow quicker. Either will make good cuttings . </root.v.2426><root.v.2427>Ceropegias have relatively few pest problems. Tuberous types and some of the deciduous vines can harbor the occasional mealy bug. In the greenhouse or during the summer outside , a slug may find a tuber tasty. Plants are most vulnerable right after they move back inside after a summer spent outdoors. A ceropegia that has bloomed with an extraordinary number of flowers is especially susceptible to sudden death. The plant may have exhausted itself or its soil and be too weak to cope with the change in light and humidity that are part of moving inside. Other ceropegias may die suddenly from a fungal infection or rot. Once a thick stem has black spots on it , there is little you can do beyond cutting the growing tips off the plant and trying to root them and discarding the rest . </root.v.2427><root.v.2428>My one suggestion to any reader would be , keep an open mind.

Purity is the foundation of yogic life. One has to be rooted in goodness , purity , truth and selflessness. Half of the process of Yoga is in thus getting perfectly established in ideal moral conduct. Yoga transforms one 's lower nature into the Divine nature. Yoga shows how to overcome the imperfections of the lower nature and how to gain complete mastery over the mind and senses.

Unlike other members of the Malus genus , Crabs do not usually root from hardwood cuttings. They must be propagated from semi-hardwood cuttings taken from June through about early August. For some reason talc based hormones work better than solution formulations. The usual hormone strength ( IBA ) is 0.8 . If you have a place at home that stays shady , cool , and damp you might try some. Take 6 inch cuttings , remove most of the leaves by cutting off about 3/4 of each one , dip in hormone and place in a clean flat of 4 parts perlite to one part peat and loosely cover with plastic. Do not let them dry out. They will root in about 4 weeks . </root.v.2446><root.v.2447>From the founding of the first colonies until the end of the 19th century , the westward expansion on the North American continent played a major role for society. Today , the West , as an identityforming momentum , still exists. The West survived in legends , in film and in literature. Listen carefully and read attentively , then you will find key expressions like high-noon , man against man or playing Cowboys and Indians everywhere. Still today , big parts of language are soaked in metaphors and similes that refer to the ideals of the white settlers who conquered the West. Over time , the aforementioned aspects became deeply rooted in U.S. society. Since the West is such a vital part of American identity , it is of crucial importance to any approach of today s politics. To understand this part of the American mind , one event in the American history of the West needs special emphasis : Custer s Last Stand. This event reflects the ideals of the West in the perfect sense . </root.v.2447><root.v.2448>Garden centers and nursery rewholesalers prefer container-grown plants because balled and burlapped ( B &amp;B ) plants can be more difficult to maintain in good condition while being held in the nursery yard.

Its longevity is perhaps attributable to the fact that there are some important powerful interests in our society who , despite often espousing anti-colonialism sentiments , continue to swear by the merits of a British-type education , particularly its grammar school and university education. Many consider it superior and sacred , and so it has become the standard by which all other education systems are judged.

It was one of North America ' s earliest floral colonizers , arriving in contaminated hay and grain seed during the 17th century. In BC , Canada thistle is listed as a provincially noxious species and is the most aggressive and difficult to control thistle occurring in the Okanagan-Similkameen region. This creeping rooted perennial reaches a height of 1.2 metres. Canada thistle can be recognized by its stalkless , dark green leaves that have irregular spiny lobes and by its small spineless rose-purple to white flowers. Plants produce an average of 1 , 500 seeds annually , which are predominantly spread by wind. About 90 of the seeds will germinate within one year , but other seeds can remain viable for about 20 years. Unlike other thistles , the Canada thistle has a deep and wide-spreading root system. Small fragments of the roots can sprout new thistle plants , so the plant is especially troublesome in fields where it is spread by cultivation. Control efforts should focus on preventing seed production and attacking the roots . </root.v.2468><root.v.2469>Mitral valve prolapse ( MVP ) valve does n't close properly. Sister disease of reflux.

This is because rose cuttings contain auxin ( indoleacetic acid -- " IAA " ) , a natural root-promoting hormone. It is produced by the leaves and growing buds or shoot tips and accumulates at the bottom of a cutting , where the roots will form. But some roses apparently do n't produce adequate supplies of auxin and are difficult to root. If they produce any roots at all , they are few and weak. So , many growers apply a commercial hormone preparation to stimulate the production of strong roots.

FHD has discovered that by changing the cycle timer during the plant stages of life , we received overall better production without adding higher cost in the systems. This idea is based on applying more oxygen to the root system than continual misting cycle. When using this type of system the following points should be taken into account. There is not one set ideal misting program , the amount of nutrient mist time required is largely depended on the plant , stage of development and more importantly the temperature in the root chamber during the plant stages. The major benefit of an adjustable misting program is its flexibility in the growing stages of the plant.

They will root and produce a new plant at their nodes when they touch the soil . </root.v.2526><root.v.2527>As a consequence of the life energy technology that I developed ( I have built the first device on this planet that actually generates life energy , i.e. , the Chi Generator , or generator of Od ) and the scientific explanation of magic , radionics , and the power of abstractions such as thought forms , gods , sigils , radionic settings , etc. ( also a first on this planet , see my course " Magick of the Future " ) , the power of a Rune magic that is rooted in the realms of creation has increased significantly ! A Rune can then become a creative energy that is continuously powered by life force ( Od ) coming from your Chi Generator . You can direct the general effect of the action of this Runic energy and define the outcome of the operation. The Rune ( or bind-rune ) will then be the ultimate thought-form that works independently and creatively towards the result with an efficiency that the traditional " spirits " , " familiars " , etc. , certainly can never exhibit . </root.v.2527><root.v.2528>Leaf cuttings. Leaf cuttings include only a leaf blade or the blade and a portion of the petiole ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Leaf cuttings of plants such as African violet should not be rooted with long petioles. Trim the petiole to no more than 1/2 inch in length . </root.v.2528><root.v.2529>The above list is a wide spectrum of symptoms and certainly not every symptom needs to be present to diagnose that they are rooted in silicon. Many of the symptoms can also be caused by other factors too. Furthermore , it must be remembered that silicon dioxide is not the only form of silicon used in breast implants , and various other symptoms may be due to the other silicones/silicons and trace materials , rather than the silicon dioxide. Some of these other silicons are converted into silicon dioxide when they leak into the body. Because I have not found any firm data on the correlation between the various ingredients of implants and their diseases , I can not ascribe the one to the other with certainty. For example , autoimmune diseases and candida that are associated with implant leakage may or may not have anything to do with silicon dioxide , and this is not something that I recognise as part of my own set of symptoms . </root.v.2529><root.v.2530>In that sense , Egyptian civilization was quite unique in the Mediterranean , and perhaps even in the world. It is remarkable that a civilization producing such a vast literary corpus , never reached ( as a collective ) the rational mode of cognition. Egypt 's attachment to the contextual and the local , as well as the special pictoral nature of the " sacred script " , all point to an ante-rational mentality , rooted in the mythical , pre-rational ( pre-concepts ) and proto-rational ( concrete concepts ) layers of early African cognition . </root.v.2530><root.v.2531>Being rooted in Christ is a bit like being shaded by the branches of the mustard tree described in Mark 4 : 26-29. We shall be nurtured and protected and will gradually come to offer to other people similar branches under which they themselves may be protected and nurtured. We shall bear fruit that will bring glory to God as these people themselves grow to accept the creative force of God. If we are securely rooted in Christ , God 's self-expression , his purposive word , will work though us , will effect his creative force within us and will enable us to nurture others in their growth as they come to take root in Christ and accept for themselves his creative force. In this way we shall bring glory to God and glory to his creation . </root.v.2531><root.v.2532>Most men are going to drink something and many of them a considerable quantity. The amount , so long as it remains within normal limits , may to some extent depend upon the direct alcoholic suggestion received in one form or another. But the point I wish to make clear is this. Whether or not a man becomes an alcoholic as the term is defined in this book depends on character traits deeply rooted in his personality , and not primarily on exposure to an alcoholic environment . </root.v.2532><root.v.2533>While these two camps have been battling , a third value system or world view , rooted in eastern mysticism and issuing from the humanistic psychology movement , has worked itself into the American consciousness.

It was shaped in reaction to , and continues in many subtle ways to reflect , Christian thought. It also draws heavily on the ancient Greeks and more recently on Asian and other world thought as scientists search for insight into the complex and often paradoxical findings that confront them , particularly in the atomic , astronomical , and psychological realms. Greater use of mythic , religious , philosophic , and scientific knowledge from other cultures could further illuminate current investigations , reveal blind spots , reduce dogmatism , and suggest new issues and approaches for research . </root.v.2535><root.v.2536>Hydrangeas can grow up to 6 feet high and wide; they are bushy and have woody stems. As the new grow emerges stake the stems of the flowers and needed otherwise let them grow and enjoy. As the seasons progress keep the hydrangea well fertilized with a general fertilizer 10 10 10. You must always water after applying fertilizer so that it reaches the soil. To propagate the plant you need to have a small trench next to the plant. Then remove a little of the bark and lay it in the ground and cover it with soil. Make sure that the tip of growth is uncovered and it will root under the soil . </root.v.2536><root.v.2537>We need to develop pasture plants that have rooting depths and architectures that compliment each other and utilise all of the soil profile.

It has not yet been deter mined whether this trait is genetically controlled ( dominant or recessive ) , but efforts to develop a true-breeding strain of creepers are meeting with partial success. This phenotype appears when the main stalk of the seedling has grown to about 1 meter ( 3 feet ) in height. It then begins to bend at approximately the middle of the stalk , up to 700 from the vertical , usually in the direction of the sun. Sub sequently , the first limbs sag until they touch the ground and begin to grow back up. In extremely loose mulch and humid conditions the limbs will occasionally root along the bottom surface. Possibly as a result of increased light exposure , the primary limbs continue to branch once or twice , creating wide frond-like limbs of buds resembling South Indian strains. This phenotype usually produces very high flower yields. The leaves of these creeper phenotype plants are nearly always of medium size with 7-11 long , narrow , highly serrated leaflets . </root.v.2538><root.v.2539>Root can belong to any of the open word classes , functioning as a transitive verb ( e.g. , I rooted her ) and nominally ( e.g. , Jesus , I could do with a good root ) .

This phenomenon allows for a unique period of root manipulation. If a plant is heavily root pruned during this period the buds will open but new shoots will not expand. This will limit transpiration and the following photosynthesis from the opened leaves will restore the food lost from the root pruning. I have used this principle to root prune bare rooted field grown seedlings ( see Root Pruning Bare Root Seedlings ) .

In the acquisition of a new habit , or the leaving off of an old one we must take care to launch ourselves with as strong and decided initiative as possible.

Dip the cut end in a rooting hormone , like Rooton , and insert it in a dry mix to a depth of 1 " . It is important that an areole on each side is covered because the best new growth comes from below the soil line. Withhold water thefirst week , spray therafter until the roots are established. If a cutting should rot at the base , cut off the damged tissue , making sure the center core is clean , and start over as before after allowing the cutting to dry in a cool place for several days. Unrooted cutting will survive long periods unplanted , but it is to their advantage to plant them as soon as possible. Cuttings can be started at any time , but will root faster in warmer temperatures . </root.v.2565><root.v.2566>Since both kidney and lima beans are epigeal in habit and the large cotyledons must be pulled out of the ground , thorough preparation and good tilth of a well-compacted seed bed are essential. A deep , mellow soil promotes deeper root development and at the same time a more thorough occupancy of the richest portion of the substratum , the surface soil layer. This is due in part to better aeration and partly to better water-holding capacity of the soil. In dry-land farming this early stirring of the soil forms a dry soil layer. If this is maintained , the plants will root only below this layer. Otherwise many surface roots would undoubtedly die as a result of later drought . </root.v.2566><root.v.2567>And it dawned on me that , yes , despite 32 years of persistent nonvoting , I 've usually rooted for one of the major presidential candidates , always seeing one potential master as slightly less odious than the other.

The U.S. system of copyrights and patents goes back to the English system , which in turn is rooted in old practices of the kingdom. In mediaeval times , the English Crown granted patents in order to raise funds and to secure control over industries that were considered to be of political importance. Copyright was granted as a measure for ensuring government control over the printing press , in a time of great religious and political dissent.

They should be of young wood from the ends of branches , and about 4 inches in length. Inserted in clear sand over bottom-heat , they will strike roots in a month or two; without bottom-heat they root very slowly. It is sometimes advised to keep them covered with a bell-jar. In Florida good results have been obtained by using as cuttings the young sprouts which appear around the base of the plant; these are removed with a heel when still quite small , and are planted in sand.

Roots need to breathe oxygen; a lack of dissolved oxygen will slow and even stop the root growth. Lack of dissolved oxygen will cause roots to rot , killing the clone. The best way to give clones dissolved oxygen is to oxygenate the water before giving it to the cutting or rooted clone. Put a couple of air stones into a bucket of water and let it bubble for a few hours; this also has the benefit of allowing the water to warm to room temperature. For those who use cloning machines , put the air pump outside the growing area where the CO2 level is lower and the atmospheric oxygen level is higher . </root.v.2580><root.v.2581>Cover the cuttings with clear plastic to keep the humidity up.

The process of rooting these runners should be facilitated by fixing them close down to the soil , which is done by small wooden hooked pegs or by stones; hair-pins , short lengths of bent wire , &amp;c. , may also be used. After the roots are formed , the strings are cut through , and the runners become independent plants . </root.v.2591><root.v.2592>Before removing the plant from its pot , first prepare the planting hole. The hole should be at least twice the diameter of the root ball , leaving at least a foot or more of space between the root ball and the wall of the hole. The hole should NOT be dug any deeper than the depth of the root ball. Magnolias are fairly surface rooted and do not like being planted deeper than the level at which they were grown. If your soil is on the clay side , make sure you scarify the sides of the hole with a shovel to avoid creating a smooth wall as this would act as a barrier for the roots and prevent or slow their penetration into the surrounding soil. This could be a fatal mistake . </root.v.2592><root.v.2593>I generally use mohair from the same supplier. It is ultra premium mohair.

Yoga teaches us that our effort to find happiness by controlling things outside ourselves , such as the opinion of others , will never bear lasting fruit. Our endless efforts to prove worthy of love may bring temporary results , but as we probably all know from current relationships , the affection of others comes and goes; demanding it or holding it too tightly is generally counterproductive. Keeping busy may help us feel good about ourselves , but this feeling will also prove temporary when the pain of pushing so hard catches up with us. There is true irony in discovering that we are hurting ourselves in our attempt to feel good , to be happy . </root.v.2594><root.v.2595>All our leaders must render themselves accountable in all senses of the word to the people who have voted them into power in good faith.

Water should penetrate the soil profile to a depth slightly below the bottom of the root zone. Turfgrass plants take up water only where roots are located so wetting to a depth slightly below the bottom of the root zone encourages roots to to grow deeper to seek water. Watering too deeply wastes water since roots can not reach it. Likewise , turf should not watered too frequently so that the soil profile is only wetted to a shallow depth leads to a shallow rooted plant . </root.v.2597><root.v.2598>Bitterness is a characteristic of the ungodly " Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness " ( Romans 3 : 14 ) . A Christian must never try to rationalize it as " righteous indignation " or to think that certain injustices give him the " right " to be bitter and resentful. " If ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish " ( James 3 : 14-15 ) . Rooted bitterness will soon " spring up , " not only robbing the bitter believer of joy and true fruitfulness , but bearing bitter fruit whereby many others will " be defiled.

These are the rights " implicit in the concept of ordered liberty , " so that " neither liberty nor justice would exist if [ they ] were sacrificed. " Further , they are rights " deeply rooted in this nation 's history and tradition. " Given the long and widespread existence of state laws criminalizing sodomy , Justice White commented , " to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is deeply rooted in this nation 's history and tradition ' or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty ' is at best facetious.

Other kinds of belongingness are more subjective : Your heart swells with not only patriotism but also belongingness while being in a crowd watching an Independence Day parade. You may root for your team to win a sports contest. Hey , it isn ' t your team ! This is you identifying with the team and its efforts it ' s in your head. Well , it feels like your team by rooting for it , it symbolically becomes yours , and your rooting ( even if they can ' t hear you because you ' re in front of a television set ) still works at a psychological level . </root.v.2607><root.v.2608>The principle that is used in extracting multi-rooted teeth is to section them into their individual root components and then remove each section as for a single rooted tooth. This does require knowledge of the relevant anatomy as to root numbers and position of root furcations.

When your cuttings are well rooted and have begun to shoot it is time to transplant them into you growing system. Slowly introduce them to full strength nutrient and place them under a H.I.D. light system. Remember the new clones are tender and exposing them rapidly to a full strength H.I.D. lamp after the fluros would be a shock. Care should be taken to acclimatise your new clones to the brighter light. Start by raising the H.I.D. lamp approx one metre above the clones for the first few days slowly lower the lamp over the next week till the lamp is at the correct height. This will ensure a smooth stress free transition to growing under H.I.D. lamps . </root.v.2609><root.v.2610>With different types of brush layering , loose rock slopes can be stabilized.

Take one long section ( leaf ) of the mother in law plant ( Sansevieria trifasciata; also known as snake plant ) , lay it on a cutting surface , and cut it into 3- or 4-inch sections without picking it up. It is very important to keep tabs of the tops and bottoms of each section and you can do this by either making a slit where the top would be , cutting at a slant , or marking with a permanent marker. If you wish , dip the bottom ends into some rooting hormone before inserting into some sterile medium. I use peat moss with perlite or vermiculite mixed 50/50 for potting. Some instructions say to cover with plastic until the cuttings take root but since Sansevieria doesn ' t like humidity , you can skip this. Place your cuttings someplace where there is average humidity and light. Don ' t let them dry out and in due time you will see new plants emerging from the base of each cutting. If a cutting shrivels up and doesn ' t resist tugging , pull it out and toss it. Some may root within a couple of months but most take longer just don ' t give up on them . </root.v.2612><root.v.2613>How did this foundation get distorted so as to give way to systems of domination ? This question remains as one of the theological challenges that were identified by the WCC at the very beginning of the decade to overcome violence.10 It demands fresh considerations of foundational tenets such as original sin , and a reconsideration of human behaviour. As an example , let us remember Ren Girard 's well known thesis , 11 which draws him closer to finding the roots of domination in the very essence of the human being. For him , domination and violence are part of our becoming human , as we learn to be human by copying from others what we desire. Hence , a " mimetic rivalry " arises and leads to a conflict that is resolved by way of the necessary victim or scapegoat. Whatever the answer to this dilemma , domination remains a contextualized construction that is not dictated by natural law nor rooted in any unshakeable soil. Systems of domination are transient and obedient to dynamics that can be discerned , questioned , and transformed . </root.v.2613><root.v.2614>While today marks a great feat in the Android community , rooting a phone does involve risks.

Public employers who learn of misconduct at work may investigate it with dual motives : they may seek evidence both to root out " inefficiency , incompetence , mismanagement , or other work-related misfeasance , " id. at 724 , and also to collect evidence for a criminal prosecution. Indeed , the two categories may merge altogether. For example , government officials who have criminal investigators under their command may respond to allegations of work-related misconduct by directing the investigators to search employee offices for evidence of a crime . </root.v.2615><root.v.2616>The military struggle following the overthrow of Huerta in July 1914 pitted the forces of the three caudillos against each other. Emiliano Zapata 's army , based in the state of Morelia , controlled the south central area. Zapata 's preoccupation was the restoration of indigenous peasants ' claims to communal lands. These claims were rooted in land grants of the viceregal period and were the core of Zapata 's Plan de Ayala. Pancho Villa 's Division del Norte controlled most of the north , including his home state of Chihuahua. Villa was the most complex and contradictory personality of the three. He was capable of extremes of tenderness and gratuitous cruelty , and his generals ranged from the humanitarian ( Felipe ngeles ) to the sadistic ( Rodolfo Fierro ) . He was also the most charismatic , and his style captured the attention and support of a U.S. public that ranged from President Wilson to Hollywood. His political agenda was less well developed than either Zapata 's or Carranza 's and consisted primarily of justice for the downtrodden and dispossessed. But his military prowess was formidable. It appeared invincible until he was outwitted by the Sonoran general lvaro Obreg n during the time Obreg n was aligned with Carranza . </root.v.2616><root.v.2617>I want you to look at that word hope in Romans 4 : 18 above. The purest definition I have been able to find of hope is " desire accompanied by the expectation for fulfillment " There is a lot of talk about faith , but we can not have faith unless we first have a hope. That is why faith and hope work hand in hand. Abram is known as the " father of faith , " yet it is the hope he possessed that made him the father of faith. Abram 's desire for a son of his own body had been stirring within him for years. He had an expectation of what God would do , because God had promised , and Abram believed Him. His desire became rooted in hope , based on God 's promise. Paul wrote that we should have the same hope for the redemption of our bodies : </root.v.2617><root.v.2618>I would root for the Yanks in the world series , if they were playing the Braves.

Most likely , the fish expired of old age , exacerbated by the low oxygen level . </root.v.2619><root.v.2620>Most of the plants that I ' m lumping together with E. milii grow easily in cultivation. With a few exceptions , they like very bright light , and most do best with a somewhat richer soil than most succulents , water once a week ( or even a bit more frequently ) in warm weather , and water about every two weeks in winter. E. milii itself is marginally outdoor hardy in our area , but most of the others are both slow growing and somewhat rare , not good subjects for experiments in frost-hardiness. A few of these species require more care. E didiereoides should be kept somewhat drier during the winter , as should E. pedilanthoides and similar tuberous rooted species such as E. kondoi. In my experience E. rossii will suffer and possibly rot if watered too frequently in winter , and E. guillauminiana in particular requires very dry treatment after it drops its leaves; leaving it completely dry for a few months until it makes its new growth won ' t hurt it , although water every six weeks or so is probably all right also. These water-sensitive species will also benefit from a leaner , quicker draining soil mix as well . </root.v.2620><root.v.2621>After teaching for the past 100 years that dietary requirements can be determined solely by science rather than nature , now it seems , medicine is beginning to recognise the superiority of nature.

Most succulents have fibrous roots and do not require or use the full depth of a standard pot. If you were to put a shallow rooted succulent in a deep pot this will be counter-productive as the soil below the reach of the roots will stay wet for prolonged periods after watering and may become stagnant. Those succulents that have tuberous or tap roots may require more depth and will probably grow better in a standard pot if you can find one. All pots of whatever type chosen should have drainage holes and the bottom should be lined with several pieces of broken clay pots or large clean gravel. Bonsai pots can work effectively for a succulent that have a swollen root or lower stem and is raised up above the compost. You may also want to consider using limestone , as there are some succulents that are native to limestone boulders . </root.v.2625><root.v.2626>One reason is rooted in the way our concept of what a Lessons Learned System is. Too often , those who establish and maintain the system perceive its success in terms of how many users receive their prepared , packaged and distributed stories with a lesson.

Furthermore , he prefers to rely on historical " facts " ( such as the baptism by John , the calling of the twelve , and the outburst in the Temple ) , versus Schweitzer 's reliance on , what Sanders calls , " dubious texts " . The " fact " that the Christian community , shortly after the death of Jesus , still espoused an eschatological perspective , and held on to apocalyptic expectations , further supports Sanders ' thesis. It is these " facts " that lead Sanders to argue that " prophet " is the best type to apply to Jesus , rather than " charismatic " or " magician " . Therefore , Jesus was a " charismatic and autonomous prophet " and a " radical eschatologist " calling for the final restoration of Israel. In all of this , Sanders paints a rather unique picture of Jesus as a prophet because he removes the notion of repentance from Jesus ' prophetic message. Jesus does not issue a national call for repentance , John had already done this , and so Jesus freely offers restoration to the rejects within Israel . </root.v.2628><root.v.2629>Opuntia imbricata : Tree cholla - Tree like cactus to 5 ' tall.

Conversely , when wingedness becomes dominant and we begin to lose our rootedness in the Christian tradition , we could easily become individualistic liberals who are no longer trusted or recognised by our Christian communities.

The blessed ones who possess the Kingdom are they who have repudiated every external thing and have rooted from their hearts all sense of possessing. They are poor in spirit. ' They have reached an inward state paralleling the outward circumstances of the common beggar in the streets of Jerusalem; that is what the word poor ' as Christ used it actually means. These blessed poor are no longer slaves to the tyranny of things. They have broken the yoke of the oppressor; and this they have done not by fighting but by surrendering.

One without leaves may root but not as easily or as quickly. You can also make a regular stem cutting from parts of a stem that don ' t have the tip. For those types of cuttings , since they don ' t have the tip , need to have at least two nodes with buds. One at the base of the cutting that will be buried in the potting mix and one to grow into top growth. It should also have a leaf if possible. Woody hardened stems will root without leaves however.

The " nurse " tops ( from the eyes above the bud ) are allowed to grow until the rooted cuttings are well established in the peat pots. At this stage we move plants into 5 inch pots ( clay or plastic ) . The nurse top is cut back and as the budded eye grows it is pinched several times to form a new well rounded top. Flowers are usually kept off to give more strength to the developing head. If possible the stub above the bud should stay on until the top is well grown , then cut off and sealed with a pruning or grafting compound such as " Treeheal " made by the Flintcoat Co. and available from seed and garden stores . </root.v.2664><root.v.2665>My pineapple tops arrived today , sugar loaf and a variegated one.

This means that flaws can exist , but in the end , everything will return to the final state of repair , when the true essence of God 's unity will be seen. In accordance with this pathway , the axiomatic law was instituted that would eventually bring about the formation of a realm of existence based on good and evil -- " God made also this one against this one " ( Kohelet 7 : 14 ) . This means that the entire array of the Sefirot was to unfold on all their levels with all that they generate , all with a view to bestowing good , while a created realm was to be brought into being that would involve every kind of defect and lack of goodness. This is called the Other Side. The intention is that the power to bestow good should gain sway , until every flaw returns to a state of repair , and then the true essence of God 's unity will be known . </root.v.2668><root.v.2669>Pruned branches may serve as propagating material. Cuttings of half-ripened wood , 1/4 to 1/2 in ( 6-12.5 mm ) thick will root with bottom heat or rooting-hormone treatment. Using both , 87 success has been achieved. Treated softwood cuttings will also root well in intermittent mist. In Trinidad , softwood , treated cuttings have been rooted in 18 days in coconut fiber dust or sand in shaded bins sprayed 2 or 3 times daily to keep humidity above 90 . Over 100 , 000 plants were produced by this method over a 2-year period.

The cuttings from the base make the best plants in most cases. These cuttings may be taken from a plant at any time through the fall or winter , rooted in sand and potted up , to be held in pots until the planting out time in the spring , usually in April , or any time when the ground is ready to handle. Care should be taken to pinch out the tops of the young plants while growing in the pot , and later while in the ground , causing them to grow stocky and send out new growths along the stem. The young plants should be grown cool , a temperature of 45 suiting them well. Attention should be given to spraying the cuttings each day while in the house to keep down the red spider , which is very partial to the carnation . </root.v.2676><root.v.2677>The bourgeois revolution had sundered the connection between the past and present of early 19th century Europe and had left the future in question.

We are beginning to grasp that modern pharmacology is rooted in the ancient knowledge of forest plants , and that we have barely begun to tap the Indians ' full knowledge in these matters.

The dual nature of Gemini adores Libra 's balance and Libra can not fail to be entertained by the chatty and brainy Gemini. Libra loves art and beauty while Gemini loves the beauty of an idea ... but these loves are not too far from one another. There is a great deal of mental energy in this pairing and both partners can hatch all sorts of magnificent ideas when working together. Plus , Libra has the " get up and go " ability needed to put those ideas into action ... a quality that is often lacking in the Gemini character. In the birth of an idea , Gemini is better at pontification than direction , but this is a valuable contribution to the Libra mental process.

Every day and as often as we can we should try to recall what action of the Supreme our own functions represent. Whatever our walk in life , whether we be clerks or professional men , manual workers or creative thinkers and writers , we should learn to look for the inner meaning , the spiritual reality , the invisible glory , behind all our visible , mundane and often irksome duties. This is what makes the prosaic poetic , makes the worldly romantic and holy.

This process is called " hardening off " . Since you have had your plants in shade only for two to six months , they ca n't be exposed to long hours of direct light , or they will die of sun stroke. This is especially true if your plants become rooted in the late spring through summer. Start by locating the cuttings where they will receive only two to three hours of direct light daily ( DLD ) for a period of five to seven days. Then graduate them to four to five hours DLD. After a time at this level , the DLD can be increased to six or seven hours. After a couple weeks , you could allow them even more DLD. However , most cacti will grow best receiving only partial sun ( four to seven hours DLD ) . This is especially true with Trichocereus varieties. If the plants are located in full sun ( eight to twelve hours daily ) , they will continue to grow , but more slowly than in partial sun , and very regular waterings will be needed for faster growth and good appearance . </root.v.2684><root.v.2685>David Beckham emerged as India 's favourite football icon , courtesy his glam quotient and off-field antics.

Since we are journeying through a changing and sometimes dangerous landscape , it is essential to locate sources of knowledge that are balanced and rooted in scripture. Additionally as we integrate that new knowledge , we need to recognize that as followers of God , the process is much more spiritually discerned than intellectually synthesized. Success is therefore determined by obtaining accurate and authentic knowledge , testing it against scripture , and transforming it from intellectual understanding to spiritual transformation and practical action. Facilitating this process , as Gods new vision evolves , is the purpose of The Praxis Project . </root.v.2686><root.v.2687>A tip cutting has to have certain elements in order to grow a good plant from it.

Lobha and dosa condition the citta and its accompanying cetasikas by way of root-condition. Moreover , rupa produced by lobha-mula-citta is also conditioned by the roots of lobha and moha. In the case of root-condition , the hetus which are the conditioning factors ( the paccayas ) and the dhammas they condition ( the paccayupanna dhammas ) arise simultaneously.

Ivy in full sun tends to winter-burn , so it is particularly important to have them planted in the shade in Zones 4-7 where winters very are cold. Set the plants out in spring , placing English ivy 12 inches apart and Algerian ivy 18 inches apart. It is important to be sure that the plant and the soil are well watered prior to setting them. If the plant is to grow up a wall , put them as close as possible to the base of the wall. New plants should be pruned to 6 ' and then not fertilized for the first 3-4 months. Once established , feed them every other month with an all purpose ( 10-10-10 ) fertilizer during their growing season. Regular pruning 2-3 times a year will promote fuller growth , but the plants can be trimmed at any time there are bare spots. Ivy may be propagated by cuttings , which are only partially successful , or by layering ( pin a section of the stem to the ground , where it will root , then once rooted you may sever the new start from the parent plant ) . </root.v.2696><root.v.2697>We are confident that he will prove to be an effective , inclusive and respected 7th leader of Fianna F  il and in time his record as Taoiseach na hEireann will compare favourably with any of his ten predecessors.

It can be placed in a bucket of water or secured with rocks into the moving water where it will root within a week and can be relocated if needed. Watercress will not do well in water with little movement or deep water. The benefits of watercress include filtration of the water all year long and at least one plant that will grow in fast moving water. In moving water in Zone 7 , it remains green ( at least under the water ) all year round. It grows best during the spring and fall and dies back in the summer and winter. While it can grow so much as to divert waterfall flow , careful removal of excess growth should prevent this. Watercress should be anchored with small pea gravel or stones.

The Court explained in 1937 ( Palko v. Connecticut ) that due process did not require incorporating those provisions that " are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. " A state acting against such provisions would not violate " a principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.

It is through this connectedness that we have our spiritual lives. To be rooted is more than to be connected to; it is also to be nourished and fed. Christ 's love in the Sacred Heart is the source of the needed nourishment of our souls. And it is always present and available to us. St. Mechtilde , a German mystic of the 13th century heard Jesus say to her : " My Sacred Heart is a treasury of all graces which I confer on you unceasingly. It is the source of all those interior consolations and of the ineffable sweetness which I lavish on my faithful friends.

The container can be as simple as a clear plastic cup covered with saran wrap for single cuttings or an expensive tray with a clear dome. You can even root leaf cuttings in zip lock bags. If you ' re lucky enough to have a greenhouse , you can root leaf cuttings out in the open under a misting system.

As humans have become increasingly identified with their mind , most relationships are not rooted in Being and so turn into a source of pain and become dominated by problems and conflict. Millions are now living alone or as single parents , unable to establish an intimate relationship or unwilling to repeat the insane drama of past relationships. Others go from one relationship to another , from one pleasure-and-pain cycle to another , in search of the elusive goal of fulfillment through union with the opposite energy polarity. Still others compromise and continue to be together in a dysfunctional relationship in which negativity prevails , for the sake of the children or security , through force of habit , fear of being alone , or some other mutually " beneficial " arrangement , or even through the unconscious addiction to the excitement of emotional drama and pain . </root.v.2708><root.v.2709>Next , we dip the butt end of the cutting in rooting solution and stick it in the moist medium to a depth of about one-inch.

If you can not do that , put the cuttings in a very high humidity environment. Keep the rooting bed in a shaded , wind protected area with high light intensity. In winter , try to keep the root area warm. Preferred rooting temperature is 65F to 75F. Whatever technique you use , do not let the cuttings become dry , nor let them puddle.

As their lands were invaded by Mongols and Turks , however , the Russians and Balkan Slavs remained for centuries without any close contact with the European community; they evolved a system of bureaucratic autocracy and militarism that tended to retard the development of urban middle classes and to prolong the conditions of serfdom.

Peat pots are small compressed peat moss containers with an outside expandable wall. The flat pellets pop-up into a seedling pot when watered. Place the seed or cutting in the wet root cube and keep it evenly moist. For clones , make sure to crimp the top in around the stem so firm contact is made between the stem and the growing medium. When roots show through the sides of the cube it is time to transplant. Slit the side and remove the expandable nylon shell of peat pots before transplanting. When completed properly seedlings and clones suffer no transplant shock. Check peat pots or root cubes daily. Keep them evenly moist , but not soggy. Root cubes and peat pots contain no nutrients.

Cuttings are an excellent propagation method , because they will create numerous trees that are genetically identical to the " parent " tree or bonsai. By taking cuttings , you can create new trees from a tree that contains the characteristics you consider to be important and suitable for a bonsai tree to have. An additional reason that makes cuttings one of the more popular ways to propagate bonsai material is that it is faster than starting bonsai trees from seed. Some species of trees will produce a rooted , growing tree -from a cutting - before the seeds of another tree can even sprout !

It is commonly sold as rooted plugs that were grown hydroponically , and these can be used just like pre-started plants. If you find bunches of cut watercress , pieces of it will root readily in water. Remove any flowers or flower buds as they produce a hormone that inhibits rooting. Plant the plugs or rooted pieces in sand or soil ( real soil , not artificial potting mixes ) and set the pot on blocks in the water with the soil surface an inch or so above the water level , to keep the soil wet , but hold the plant crown above the water. The first time I planted watercress , I put the soil line below the water level and algae caused the plant to rot. The plug type plants from the grocery store are especially tender and need some shade to keep them from either rotting or sunscalding until they harden off and put out new growth that is adapted to the outdoors.

The joints must be filled with soil material to ensure plant growth. Green willow branches and rooted plants which have the ability to produce adventitious root systems should be used as vegetation. The branches should not protrude from the wall more than 10 cm to prevent desiccation. Additionally , a greening with hydroseeding is possible.

Phloxes and Arenarias for example can be quickly increased by layering.It does take a season or so for rooting to take place but the rooted pieces are larger than normal cuttings. If growing in a pot just knock it out and repot it lower than it was originally. Top dress with a gritty mix and grow on as normal. many of the sides shoots now under the top dressing will root and can be removed and potted on after about a year. If the plant is growing in the garden , work the gritty mix in and over the side shoots. Rooting wil take place in exactly the same way. In fact by just examining the outside shoots before you cover them you may find some rooted pieces anyway . </root.v.2779><root.v.2780>The temperature of the water has a lot to do with it.

DK describes how it is the wish that each student will have his or her own separated chamber with a place for study , meditation and bath. The stay will eventually be for several years , and DK in LOM gives some advice regarding the criteria that should govern permission to participate and to graduate. Meditation will occur in three periods a day ( morning , noon and evening ) with time for an evening review. In the beginning the meditations will last half an hour , but in the end the span will be around five hours daily , indeed a span that demands a deeply rooted balance and maturity.

The first point is the big toe; the other two points are on the inner part of the heel and the inner part of the ball of the foot. These points are on opposite sides of the instep. I call these points the three active nails. When the foot is rooted , these three points grip like three nails penetrating the ground. In the movements of Tai Chi Chuan , these three points are aligned with the weight-bearing centerline of the upper body. They are very active and play a crucial role in our everyday movements. As we walk , the root foot of the three nails propels the other foot to make a step. They assist in serving a cup of coffee or tea , even help our fingers to turn a door key . </root.v.2782><root.v.2783>Perennial plant found at the margin of streams and ponds , rooted in the mud and often partially submerged in water.

These should usually be taken in autumn and winter. Cuttings taken between July and October for semi-hardwood cuttings , and between September and March for hardwood cuttings produce the best results. These cuttings should root between two to twelve months. Hardy plants should be rooted in containers outdoors or in cold greenhouses. When selecting semi-hardwood cuttings you should look for : mature sections from the current growth , ( usually from the base of the stem ) , firm , woody shoots and no flowers , fruit or seedheads. Always remove any diseased or damaged parts and make sure your cuttings are at least three to ten inches long with at least two leaf joints attached . </root.v.2785><root.v.2786>When taking cuttings , choose healthy , robust limb tips. The tips with two or more growing points may make more compact plants for container growth , but branches with only one tip will also do fine. Plumeria cuttings are likely to be best if made 30-40 cm in length and include a bit of gray barked wood. Shorter cuttings often have more difficulty in striking root and will generally take longer to reach blooming size. Larger cuttings will root very well but are occasionally difficult to stabilize during the rooting process. Cuttings can be taken from any Plumeria plant having limb ( s ) meeting the above length criteria. Cuts should be made at an oblique angle to the limb being cut. This gives the cutting more root callus formation area and avoids water collection on cut surface of the donor plant. Use a very sharp knife , pruners , or a saw to make the cuts . </root.v.2786><root.v.2787>Few young bands have embraced classic rock as fully as the Black Crowes.

Through dialogue , the relationship between cultural identity and change , unity and plurality , and politics and agency is accommodated and directed toward a process of cross-cultural understanding. Dialogue , indeed , derives from the awareness , willingness , and openness of the global demos for mutual learning and reconciliation. It is , in turn , a mode of reciprocal recognition among different cultural identities over the critical importance of a shared horizon of meanings with no condition except the one that admits participatory parity among all dialogical participants. That is to say that the dialogical agents are committed to mutual recognition and cooperation among themselves for a rooted model of global community with no cultural , rational , geographical , and national restrictions; a commitment to understand and practice the political and ethical implications of unity within plurality; a cosmopolitan , but situated life-world for all . </root.v.2791><root.v.2792>University research also validates the sunflower plant 's ability to nab soil N.

It is very important to select a light , well-aerated rooting medium. In addition to natural aeration from the atmosphere , rooting media may be enriched with oxygen ( 02 ) gas; enriched rooting solutions have been shown to increase rooting in many plant species. No threshold for damage by excess oxygenation has been determined , although excessive oxygenation could displace carbon dioxide which is also vital for proper root initiation and growth. If oxygen levels are low , roots will form only near the surface of the medium , whereas with adequate oxygen levels , roots will tend to form along the entire length of the implanted shoot , especially at the cut end . </root.v.2799><root.v.2800>DAMPEN the ground where the sod will be installed.

The amount and the location of auxin will vary depending on the variety of rose , the season in which the cutting is taken , as well as other environmental factors. Thus , as Dr. Manners observes , some roses , notably many of the Teas and Chinas , seem to be inherently easy to root from cuttings , almost regardless of the method one uses. Others are more difficult , and some are exceedingly difficult to root. So the answer to the question of whether rooting hormones are necessary is , as it is with many other rose questions : " it depends " . </root.v.2837><root.v.2838>So what they do is buy in rooted cuttings , plant them in the field or in containers , and then they either grow them on to sell , or they grow them on and just keep them around a year or two longer so they can take cuttings from them.

They grow well into their shrubbier shapes being rooted from cuttings from the original plants found in old gardens and cemeteries. Own-root roses are typically propagated by rooting stem cuttings of one variety of rose. Amity Heritage Roses are rooted from cuttings off of the stock plants which we have at our home garden and nursery , and from other reputable sources. From the band size pots that we sell , the plants will put out a few new full sized canes each year and then reach mature height and width in 2-5 years , depending on the variety. Yes , they bloom according to variety during this maturing period. Own root roses are not graded by cane size. This is a practice done for bare-root grafted roses . </root.v.2842><root.v.2843>-- -Cultivation -- -The plant grows almost anywhere , but thrives best in a partially sheltered and dry situation. Propagation may be effected : ( 1 ) by seeds , sown outside , broadcast , in spring , raked in and the beds kept free from weeds , the seedlings , when about 2 inches high , being transplanted into fresh beds , allowing about 18 inches each way , as the plants become busy; ( 2 ) by cuttings , taken in spring and inserted for a time , until well rooted , in a shady border; ( 3 ) by rooted slips , also taken in spring.

Like most superstitions , the belief in the peculiar powers of the mandrake was founded upon an ancient secret doctrine concerning the true nature of the plant. " It is slightly narcotic , " says Eliphas Levi , " and an aphrodisiacal virtue was ascribed to it by the ancients , who represented it as being sought by Thessalian sorcerers for the composition of philtres. Is this root the umbilical vestige of our terrestrial origin , as a certain magical mysticism has suggested ? We dare not affirm it seriously , but it is true all the same that man issued from the slime of earth and his first appearance must have been in the form of a rough sketch. The analogies of Nature compel us to admit the notion , at least as a possibility.

You want to time it so the cutting is soft but not too soft. I find when the thorns bend but do not snap off the cane , the cutting is too green ( but it will root ) . When the thorns do not want to snap off the cane when you push them sideways , the cutting is too far along and will not root very easily if at all. Mature wood ( the brown stem ) rarely roots well if at all. But when the thorns will snap off with a little sideways pressure , the cutting is just about right. If in doubt , go with a younger shoot . </root.v.2853><root.v.2854>The commercial grape grower will usually find it is most satisfactory to obtain plants from a dependable nursery. If vigorous one-year-old plants are purchased , the grower will get healthy stock with a well-developed fibrous root system. Such vines will grow rapidly in the vineyard and will repay the extra cost because they bear more quickly and give greater returns over a period of years. A vineyard is a long-term investment. It is not worthwhile to try to economize by starting with questionable stock. Purchasing the young vines has the further advantage of saving the grower the year 's time that is necessary to obtain a rooted plant from a cutting. Nursery plants which are two years old or more are often those that were too weak for selling at the end of one year and may grow poorly in the vineyard . </root.v.2854><root.v.2855>Three inches is a good depth.

The principle of the system is perhaps universally accepted now , but even this acceptance is not unqualified. In the ultimate analysis , the survival and acceptance of any system would depend crucially on its capacity to deliver the goods. This may not be so obvious in countries where democracy has become a way of life and the political process has been rooted in the principle for centuries , making it normal and unquestioned. But elsewhere , the temptation to cut corners for immediate benefits and the tendency to superficialize democracy while the real wielders of power only make it a mask -- these are phenomena that should make genuine votaries of the system sit up and think . </root.v.2857><root.v.2858>All of us are rooted by something.

In general , you should receive and pot rooted cuttings for stock plants use from December 1 to January 15. The earlier cuttings are potted , the more cuttings that plant will likely produce. Most growers plant three to five cuttings in a 10- to 12-inch hanging basket pot ( without the hanger ) for later sales. Alternatively , some growers pot rooted-cuttings in smaller pots ( 6- to 8-inch azalea pot ) and transplant to larger containers later to minimize the space plants initially require . </root.v.2859><root.v.2860>The job of the troubleshooter is , quite literally , to find trouble , and shoot it.

It is an artificial method for the vegetative reproduction. Use auxin hormone to help development of adventitious root at the cut end. Because auxin is a hormone which controls growth of plant , it will help rooting with any species. Usually the rooted cuttings use young plants , because younger plants will grow better than older ones. ( Younger plants , which are used for the cutting stems , can stand better with diseases. Also , they will not require much tape. ) [ 9 ] </root.v.2861><root.v.2862>General guidelines for successful cutting propagation include using a healthy plant and watering thoroughly the day before so the plant is well hydrated. Use a light potting soil containing peat moss and vermiculite ( you can make your own using equal parts builders sand , peat moss and vermiculite ) and keep the cutting damp but not soaked until rooted. A cloudy day is ideal for propagating and a well lit but not too sunny area is best for storing the rooting cuttings. Remove all flowers from cuttings and dont despair if they wilt or the bottom leaves wither. Lateral or side shoots tend to root better than end or terminal shoots. Late summer is a great time to root cuttings so they can be planted during the fall to benefit from our winter rains . </root.v.2862><root.v.2863>In the passage from Corinthians Paul asks us to consider our own call , to be rooted in our own nothingness. Interestingly enough the word , humility , derives from the Latin word , humus , meaning earth or ground. So we are called to be grounded or rooted in the reality of our own nothingness. All that we are is gift. Of ourselves we have nothing but our sins ! In the excerpt from Phililippians , Paul recommends that we have the same attitude of humility as Jesus who emptied himself and became as we are , so we might become as He is : Child of the Father and we , daughters and sons of God. This humility , this self-emptying , this kenosis , is seen pre-eminently on the cross when Jesus ' side is opened and he empties himself , that is , blood and water flow out.

Rock stars with classical roots , their music showcases the place where tradition meets youthful irreverence. Superstars in their native Japan , Tsugaru-shamisen virtuosos Ryoichiro and Kenichi Yoshida have effected nothing short of a cultural revolution with a muscular reinvention of the ancient three-stringed instrument , giving it the fiery passion of a rock music guitar. Their sound is at once rooted firmly in the ancestral sounds of northern Japan , while infused with the energy of contemporary interpretation. Hishou continues the exploration of marrying new phrasings to traditional sounds , producing mesmeric music that is at once sentimental and respectful of the past , while also forging a sonic bridge to the future. Having explored rock and world music themes in previous releases , this album marks a return to basics for the brothers , highlighting their commitment to and reverence for the historic art of Tsugaru-Shamisen - a genre of shamisen music originating in Aomori prefecture in the northernmost area of the Japanese island of Honsh and today performed throughout Japan.

The authors contend that environmental crises , misguided development strategies , and the militarization of global culture all affect women disproportionately. However , it is argued that militarism , the environment , and development are linked and gendered. Moreover , the authors assert that people can no longer think about women and development without considering both direct and structural violence. This violence , in turn , can not be divorced from the impact on the environment. War destroys the physical and social environment , consumes massive sums of money , and shatters development progress. All of this exacerbates the structural violence women experience. And both militarism and environmental deterioration are rooted in development models that emphasize capital accumulation for the few. Thus , the global forces of militarism , the accumulation of capital , and the exploitation of natural resources depend on a gendered order . </root.v.2874><root.v.2875>Since the primary root in monocots is short-lived , some develop a system of adventitious roots with many lateral branches.

I keep envisioning a living game of Whack-a-Mole with the mallet being the service agencies . </root.v.2899><root.v.2900>The Way of Divine Ignorance , which I teach , is a complete Way of life . It is not merely a system of self- applied methods of inwardness or of exclusively external and worldly functional improvement. It is a whole culture , lived principally among others who do likewise , and in complete touch with every level of our structural humanity , from the gross physical to the subtle and transcendental ranges of Light. The presumption of independent conscious existence , rooted in the heart prior to mind , and expressed as forms of contraction or self-definition at every functional level of the body-being , as well as in all relations , is the present foundation of the conventional and chaotic " culture " or habit of adaptation of most human beings. Therefore , if we are to be adapted ( or readapted ) to another Principle than the ego , or independent and separative self , we must likewise become involved in a total culture of that alternative . </root.v.2900><root.v.2901>Cut just above a node so you wo n't leave a stub on the parent. Then remove and discard any flowers , buds , or small lateral shoots.

It may be clear that coercion is sometimes the right choice , but how does one allow it yet still control it ? Sadism is deeply rooted in the human psyche. Every army has its share of soldiers who delight in kicking and beating bound captives. Men in authority tend to abuse it not all men , but many. As a mass , they should be assumed to lean toward abuse. How does a country best regulate behavior in its dark and distant corners , in prisons , on battlefields , and in interrogation rooms , particularly when its forces number in the millions and are spread all over the globe ? In considering a change in national policy , one is obliged to anticipate the practical consequences. So if we formally lift the ban on torture , even if only partially and in rare , specific cases ( the attorney and author Alan Dershowitz has proposed issuing " torture warrants " ) , the question will be , How can we ensure that the practice does not become commonplace not just a tool for extracting vital , life-saving information in rare cases but a routine tool of oppression ? </root.v.2904><root.v.2905>If you are starting cuttings inside your home or inside a greenhouse during the winter , a heat mat is often recommended for cuttings as heat is very important to the rooting process. After the initial watering at planting time , I will only water when the soil looks dry. If the cutting is rooting in full sun or intense heat , it is important to keep the cutting well-hydrated so that it does not become desiccated. For this reason , some growers prefer to root their cuttings in filtered sun or part shade. Misting is also beneficial in these conditions . </root.v.2905><root.v.2906>Some cuttings can be rooted in water. However , their roots tend to be more succulent and weak , and they may have later problems adapting to potting soil. Cuttings develop a sturdier root system and survive the transplant into pots better if they are rooted in a solid medium.To root a cutting in water simply place it in a jar full of tepid water until roots develop. Using colored glass and changing the water regularly inhibits algal growth. To anchor the cutting , insert it in a piece of wire mesh.

Generally , trees are the least likely to root this way but sometimes they do. Willows are easily rooted trees. Oaks , redbuds , and sourwoods will not root.

In ground layering , the stem is bent down and the target region buried in the soil. This is done in plant nurseries in imitation of natural layering by many plants such as brambles which bow over and touch the tip on the ground , at which point it grows roots and , when separated , can continue as a separate plant.

To the extent that some sections of the fundamentalist Christian community within the U.S. view toleration of uncloseted gay and lesbian relationships as damaging to their own identity , they will seek to prevent that toleration.

Modernist art is urban art and it has incorporated the pastoral idea in various disguises , often hiding in its abstract facade a nostalgia for landscape. In modernism the landscape has been painted by urban creatures knowing nothing about it or the rural life. Impressionist landscapes are as neutral as Cubism 's guitars. Nature becomes a perceptual laboratory in which light and color disengage themselves from representation to become the chief actors. The landscape , even Expressionist landscape into which violent emotion is projected - is drained of its violence. The Darwinian struggle is transferred from the landscape to the city , and this transposal of the rural mythology is an unexplored part of the urban mind. That mind , however , while it accepts the urban view of the landscape ( from Fairfield Porter 's sunny idealizations to Hopper 's bald realism ) , will not accept the rural view-nor is it equipped to read it , or perceive in it anything more than clich s identified with forms of nationalism troubling to the liberal spirit . </root.v.2919><root.v.2920>These laws of existence , given form through the imagery of the cult of the Sun , became the Heliopolitan model of creation , rooted in mythical &amp;pre-rational thought.

Contrary to the old Victorian habit of placing them in a dark corner , snake plants prefer a bright location. but not direct sun. Too little light will cause the leaves to flop over while bright light will make the plant produce a tall stalk of scented flowers. This plant produces erect leather-like leaves that have a pattern of dark and light coloration resembling snakeskin. Water it only when the soil becomes dry and a little less often during the winter months. Too much water will rot the roots. It 's not a heavy feeder so use a very weak solution of plant food during the summer months.

It is in this large volume that the " Absolute Truth " is rooted and defined. That is why it is inacessible to us , excepting only as it is injected from outside , for we have no means , save death , of breaching our confinements so as to behold it.

When enough leaves are gone , the plant takes on a " stemmy " or " necky " appearance that is unattractive to most growers. Changes take place with humans as they age and the same is true of African violets. In other words , this is normal with older plants. According to Mel Roby , who wrote the book on African violet culture , everything will be fine if you follow a few steps. Cut off the main stalk of the plant at the soil surface. Trim the stalk so that about 2 inches remain below the rest of the plant. Scrape the stalk with a knife or some other sharp object to rough up the plant 's tissue. This will encourage root formation. Allow the stalk to dry for about 20 to 30 minutes and then place the stalk in water , vermiculite or perlite until new roots form. Transfer the rooted plant to a pot filled with African violet potting soil. Wait a couple of weeks and begin applying a high P and K fertilizer. This will encourage flowering.

Therefore commune with your own selves , for the kingdom of God is within you. See with whom ye associate , with whom ye readily stay; and examine the reasons and the tendency to all evil habits. For if a man gives way to a fault for a year or two , that fault takes such deep root in his heart , that he can scarcely overcome it with all his might. Therefore young men should guard themselves carefully , so that no evil tendencies may take root in them.

However , he overlooked the differences between the two. When Iran took the hostages , it was certainly a slap in the Americans ' face , but Iraq had seized the entire West by the throat. Lifelines are naturally more important than face , and the United States had no choice but to take it seriously , while other countries which felt threatened by Iraq also had to take it seriously. In their alliance with the United States , what most of the Arab countries had in mind was rooting out the Islamic heresy represented by Saddam to keep him from damaging their own interests were he to grow stronger unopposed , and it is very difficult to really say that they wanted to extend justice to Kuwait.

Rational reflection and daily experience demonstrate the weakness which marks man 's freedom. That freedom is real but limited : its absolute and unconditional origin is not in itself , but in the life within which it is situated and which represents for it , at one and the same time , both a limitation and a possibility. Human freedom belongs to us as creatures; it is a freedom which is given as a gift , one to be received like a seed and to be cultivated responsibly. It is an essential part of that creaturely image which is the basis of the dignity of the person. Within that freedom there is an echo of the primordial vocation whereby the Creator calls man to the true Good , and even more , through Christ 's Revelation , to become his friend and to share his own divine life. It is at once inalienable self- possession and openness to all that exists , in passing beyond self to knowledge and love of the other.

If all understandings of history are tentative and arguable , why not one day say all of history is rooted in genetics , the next , that history is rooted in the machinations of god , and the next day that history is the struggle against overpopulation ? The tendency , however , is to lean to a " great men " picture of history , as seen in the stress on the evaluation of " key decisions made at critical points " , as if these decisions stood outside the developing social constructs of the decision-makers . </root.v.3022><root.v.3023>Diseases that are incurable , etiology unknown or there is no cure , may constitute a spiritually rooted disease - a disease that comes from our heart condition. ( Some dis-eases are passed down through the generations , and those dis-eases derived from someone in your generations that had spiritual issues. ) Dis-eases start at a breakdown with someone in relationship. If you have a dis-ease , ask God where your relationship breach is. You may even have a relationship breach with yourself ! Matthew 22 : 38-40 states that we are to love the Lord our God with all our heart , soul and mind and love our neighbor as ourself upon this hang all the laws and the prophets. In otherwords , when we keep this commandment we fullfill all the law ! If we restore those areas of relationship that are not perfected in love , I can guarantee you , you will find your peace. Peace produces homeostasis that can produce good health. You do not need to know the " root " of a disease to find peace , I 've found that by restoring our relationships with God , self and others , produces better health to deal with the dis-ease you may have . </root.v.3023><root.v.3024>i.

This is because most types are fairly shallowly rooted and therefore prone to drying out. Any plant in a container will suffer more easily from water shortage than one in the open garden , and water shortage in a fruiting plant means poor quality fruit. All of these factors can lead to problems , but if you are prepared to devote more than the normal amount of attention to watering and plant initially with care , then it is possible to obtain modest crops of soft fruit , even on a paved area by someone with no real garden . </root.v.3033><root.v.3034>Because of the obstacles due to our impulses and desires , the moral law appears to us as a law that we ought to obey for its own sake , and so as what Kant calls it a categorical imperative.

In the epistle of James , for example , we read that those who claim to have faith , but who fail to care for their brothers and sisters in need , actually possess no real faith at all ( 2.14-18 ) . In a similar vein , Augustine , the great father of the Church , warns us that no one " has the right to lead such a life of contemplation as to forget in his own ease the service due to this neighbor. " Given the continuity in the Church 's teachings on social activism , it seems evident that those who neglect this important dimension of the religious life in order to focus exclusively on personal spiritual development , far from being model Christians , are actually engaged in the most egregious sort of sin imaginable . </root.v.3039><root.v.3040>Red Elephant A variety sold in Australia till the 1910 's when it was discontinued by seed companies for unknown reasons..

I generally do this on a warmer day , when the temperature is above 40 degrees , but only when the perennials are still dormant under the soil with no sign of visible growth. These cool season weeds are generally noticeable in late Fall , but I much prefer to allow them to grow throughout my field beds for the Winter. The reason is , they help prevent heaving of any plants that may not be that well rooted in , ( the weeds act as a layer of mulch on the ground surface. ) I wait for a warm spell in late winter , early spring and then spray them. This is much easier than trying to spray around the growing plants later. After all , I know I am not in a big hurry for them to die , so once I spray them , I know that they will die off before my plants start to grow . </root.v.3048><root.v.3049>But all of this is a cautionary tale : The mass movements and trade unions can always be coopted by centre-left regimes or even centre-right regimes. As critical educators , we must work tirelessly to broaden our political project to include the support of social movements seriously challenging the distribution of public wealth and the destruction of local habitat and economies by multinational corporations. As Petras argues , social movements must work towards developing national cadre structures so that they have a chance to take state power without state power little can be done to seriously challenge the power of the transnational capitalist class. Needed more than ever , Petras argues , are concrete organisations of struggle rooted among radical youth and among ' employed ' as well as ' informal workers ' in a broad effort at socialist revival and renewal that will ensure socialist organisations make stronger organic links with everyday anti-capitalist struggles. Direct intervention of conscious socialist-political formations deeply inserted in everyday struggles capable of linking economic conditions to political action is , according to Petras , the only way forward. That is the point at which we must secure our opposition to the rule of capital . </root.v.3049><root.v.3050>A sangha is a spiritual community. Ramakrishna once used a beautiful analogy to show the need for community. He likened the spiritual aspirant to a young tree. He said when a tree is young , it is helpful to have a fence surrounding it to protect it from the elements around it. In time , as the tree becomes stronger , as it ' s roots grow deeper , that tree will be able to provide shade for others. When the spiritual aspirant is young , it is helpful to have a supportive fence around to protect against unwanted elements. With time , the fence can be removed because the aspirant is firmly rooted in his/her own truth. I think community is vitally important in the early stages of spiritual development. It ' s not essential , but it is a blessing and can help alleviate so much confusion . </root.v.3050><root.v.3051>Having described some of the prevalent forms of masturbatory activity , and omitting consideration of more esoteric kinds , I proceed to offer some pastoral suggestions which counselees have found helpful. In providing these I realize that there are no infallible guidelines , and that sometimes , despite the diligent use of such suggestions , individuals may occasionally fall back into a tendency so deeply rooted in their persons. In developing a pastoral approach it is necessary to understand the phenomena of masturbation within the context of the person 's life , because therein is hidden the meaning it has for him/her.

Rooting an enemy can , if you 're lucky and the root does n't break early , give you enough time to heal and then either escape or get some distance and start up a nice slow casting damaging spell. In group PvP , rooting a warrior or rogue can render them largely ineffective , as they are left to plink away with their ranged weapons and ca n't close with the enemy.

Cuttings are divided into two main categories depending on the kind of plant and what time of year is best suited to them. The two categories are softwood and hardwood cuttings. Each has requirements for rooting i.e. correct size , enough warmth and moisture and suitable rooting medium.

You just slice the cutting sideways off the branch and stick it immediately into water. This prevents air bubbles forming in the stem. After that I plunge the cutting into a solution of rooting hormone. You can use a sharp knife to thinly slice off the outer layer at the end of the stem which allows the cutting to soak up that stimulating solution much more easily. This is a good idea if you use plants that tend to have a sturdy woody stem , as otherwise the new root development can be really slow . </root.v.3060><root.v.3061>Figure 1.

The doctrine of the necessary conformity of civil law to moral truth imposes on conscientious citizens of a regime that authorizes the killing of the unborn and infirm a clear obligation of resistance. It is not merely that the claim of these justices to have found a pro-abortion " mandate " in the Constitution is manifestly ludicrous. The value of constitutional democracy lies ultimately in its capacity to serve and secure the common good , which demands , above all , the protection of fundamental human rights. If the Constitution really did abandon the vulnerable to private acts of lethal violence , and , indeed , positively disempowered citizens from working through the democratic process to correct these injustices , then it would utterly lack the capacity to bind the consciences of citizens.

Spread to new areas usually is due to planting infected , rooted plants or moving infested soil. Root-knot nematode was found in 10 of the Oregon vineyards surveyed and in 66 of Washington vineyards. In eastern Washington , root-knot nematodes may be more problematic in vineyards planted on sites previously cropped to potato or alfalfa . </root.v.3084><root.v.3085>To root your foot , three points on the medial or inner aspect of the sole are especially useful. The first is the big toe. The other two points are on the heel and the inner part of the ball of the foot. Grandmaster Chen calls these " the three active nails " because when the foot is rooted , these three points anchor your steps like nails that penetrate the ground. The nails remain passive while you move your leg and sink your foot into place; they become active when you energize your movements . </root.v.3085><root.v.3086>The Root Blade is a shovel/spade specifically designed to help with the removal of shallow rooted woody weeds from the ground. Prime examples of relevant weeds are lantana and privet. The device consists of a sharpened flat tip made from a concave steel blade at the digging/cutting end. This has an upward curving front , and is narrow to minimise the dirt removal as it is levered up , whilst enabling greater access to the base of the root ball . </root.v.3086><root.v.3087>New plants can be propagated ( started ) from tip cuttings taken in late spring or summer. The cut surface should be allowed to callous over before the cutting is inserted in a well-drained rooting medium. This is done by placing the cutting ( s ) in a warm , dry location out of direct sun , for a few days. The larger the cutting , the longer it will take to callous over ( become dry and thicken over with a hard crust ) , as much as two or three weeks. The rooting medium should be kept just barely moist and the container should not be covered with polythene or glass. If the medium can be kept close to 70 F , the cutting ( s ) will root much quicker . </root.v.3087><root.v.3088>You 've created a " portable terrarium " with 100 humidity so the cutting will not dry out and there 's at least a 50 or better chance that it will root.

To move them back to the ingroup select the names in the Outgroup table and click the Ingroup button. All trees loaded in memory will be rooted if the outgroup is valid. Otherwise the user will be notified and asked whether the tree should be left unchanged , or the action cancelled . </root.v.3089><root.v.3090>Mix the ingredients and break up any lumps , you want the soil to have lumps no larger than your rock chips. If you are rooting a bud or small stalk , fill the pot to within 1-1/2 inches to the top , packing the soil down tightly with your fist while filling. Center your bud or cutting and pack soil mix around it to within ? inch of the top of the pot. You want about 1 to 1-1/2 inches of the cutting in the soil , just enough to hold it stable. Make sure to pack the mix tight. Then soak the pot slowly and thoroughly with plain water. You can set the pot in a bucket and fill with water to the pot rim , let soak 15 min , remove &amp;let drain . </root.v.3090><root.v.3091>A presentable bonsai can be created in a few seasons. Cultivating these miniature potted trees is both an intriguing hobby , and a means of adapting a wide range of plants to specialized and decorative uses.

The hair is securely attached with strong , clear glue and can be gently brushed and easily restyled with your fingers or curled with a warm curling iron . </root.v.3092><root.v.3093>When I was unemployed for four years , people kept asking me : How do you manage to get through this ? And my answer was : Because I trust in God. It hasn ' t always been as easy as it sounds. There was a time when I couldn ' t hear God ' s voice anymore. It wasn ' t a dropped call but it was very bad reception on my end. But the fact that I was so deeply rooted in my Lutheran faith helped me to still have that trust in God ' s unconditional love. I was able to trust God that he was still there , still present in my life because he loved me so much. I still knew that I was one of his precious beloved children . </root.v.3093><root.v.3094>A person can lack moderation in the way he adorns himself either with regard to clothing or with regard to his home. He can lack moderation in two ways. First , in comparison with the social customs. It may not be immoderate for a woman of some African tribe to go around topless , but it is certainly immoderate for a woman living in the United States to proceed topless around the yard. A person may also become inordinately attached to outward apparel and take too much pleasure in them. This is evidence of an excessive preoccupation with the self. This attachment may be rooted in a desire for attention , or it may be rooted in an excessive desire for sensuous pleasure. Humility , which avoids " excessive expenditure and parade " , is the remedy against the former. Contentment and simplicity are the virtues that overcome the latter. One who is married is not required to live like a religious in a monastery , but neither is he required to spend thousands on a chandelier or the finest furniture . </root.v.3094><root.v.3095>Deep rooted weeds like nettle , dandelion and thistle should be dug out carefully using a hand trowel. If the clump is very big , a digging fork may be necessary. Make sure that no scraps of root are left in the soil otherwise they will re-grow. Continually removing the leaves of perennial weeds does weaken the roots and eventually make them easier to dig up. Leaves can be added to the compost heap , but not roots or seed heads . </root.v.3095><root.v.3096>The image shown above is courtesy of forum member ' Stericson ' confirming the accomplishment.

Elements of tantric thought had already pervaded the south by the time of Tirumular , as they had seeped into yogic theory and practice at some antecedent time and even impacted temple ritual and the budding bhakti cults. Tantra was more deeply rooted in a fluid set of symbolic constructs than a static enunciation of doctrine. It represents a profound refinement of the symbol system of Hindu-Buddhist South Asia. It 's emphasis on the experiential aspects of the individual 's religious experience collided with the Shaivite orthodoxy like the Gnostic heresy did with the early Christian Church . </root.v.3100><root.v.3101>Still another method sometimes used in rooting cuttings is to slip the pot or can into a plastic bag which extends above the cuttings high enough to be tightly closed with a rubber band or a twist tie. Support the bag top with a stick or wire bow which can be made from an old coat hanger. Or the plastic bag may be slipped on from the top and tied around the can. For larger quantities of cuttings a nursery flat , including wood or wire bows for support , may be completely encased with a sheet of polyethylene film. When planted , cuttings should be thoroughly watered before covering. Little or no added water will be needed while cuttings are rooting . </root.v.3101><root.v.3102>Realize that a lack of self-esteem generally is rooted in the formative years of children ( birth/pre-natal to age six. ) You can not of yourself change another adult 's self esteem.

As a result of the trauma caused by the digging process , trees will commonly exhibit what is known as transplant shock. Transplant shock is indicated by slow growth and reduced vigor following transplanting. Proper site preparation before and during planting coupled with good follow-up care will reduce the amount of time the plant experiences transplant shock and will allow the tree to quickly establish in its new location. Carefully follow eight simple steps and you can significantly reduce the stress placed on the plant at the time of planting . </root.v.3106><root.v.3107>In sum , this Iranian proposal called for a non-rushed withdrawal and relocation of U.S. troops to bases inside Iraq , a rejection of all attempts to partition Iraq , a commitment by the Sunni bloc to root out the jihadists and acknowledgement by Washington that the Iranian nuclear file can not be uncoupled from the Iraq negotiations. In return , Iran would rein in the armed Shiite militias , revise the de-Baathification law and Iraqi Constitution to double Sunni political representation , create a policy to allow for the fair distribution of oil revenues ( particularly to the Sunnis ) and use its regional influence to quell crises in areas such as Lebanon , Syria and the Palestinian territories . </root.v.3107><root.v.3108>Clones apply just the same as seed plants of course.

This type of soil , this type of heart , is , according to Jesus , the one who hears the Word , accepts it , and lets it bear fruit abundantly. To whom do you think Jesus was alluding when he spoke about the rich soil that produced a hundredfold ? I am sure that He was referring to His Mother ' s heart and womb. Mary is the perfect fertile , rich and fruitful soil , totally receptive to and available for the seed , of whom Elizabeth said , Blessed is the fruit of your Womb , Jesus ( cf. Lk. 1 : 42 ) .

And in attempting to correct this deeply rooted problem , one might hope Mr. Will would grant a bit more than a year or two or three for it to succeed . </root.v.3110><root.v.3111>Greenwood Cuttings : These are cuttings made of shoots of plants that are mature enough to break when bent sharply. These cuttings are rooted indoors in sand , gravel , or sandy peat moss almost up to the lower leaves. The lower leaves are often removed or cut to reduce the area exposed to air and so prevent wilting. The cuttings should have some leaves , though , as this will help them to root faster. They should be shaded and have gentle bottom heat. Many herbaceous plants may be rooted in water. When rooting this way , never place the cuttings in more than 2 inches of water , as deep water does not absorb enough oxygen for good root development. If the cutting wilts , clip the leaves in half to reduce surface area , or placed a jar upside down over it. Rootone , a rooting hormone , may be used to hasten root growth. Plants from which cuttings are to be taken should receive plenty of sunlight for several days before the cutting is made. This builds up the sugar-energy storage and improves the success of the cutting . </root.v.3111><root.v.3112>Paul says it this way.

There are two ways to propagate from plant cuttings. Stem cuttings are where part of the plants growth is cut off and planted. Leaf cuttings are taking a leaf off the plant. The stem cutting is taken from a smaller stem coming off the main stem . The leaf cutting should include 1 1/2 to 2 inches of the stem. When taking a cutting , do it at an angle to allow moisture to reach cut area easily and prevent drying. Cuttings are planted in a sand or soiless potting mix , watered thoroughly and set in a warm area. Cover the cuttings with loose plastic wrap to keep in moisture. When sprouts appear , remove plastic. Stem cuttings are not obvious when they 've rooted. Give them a light tug and if they offer resistance they have rooted. Leaf cuttings , on the other hand , are easy to identify. When they have rooted smaller leafs will sprout up. Once rooted the cutting need to be replanted in a soil mixture. Pull each little leaf and plant separately.

Remove the leaf 'pads ' from the stem and allow the exposed ends to dry and callus over for a few days , then place them , callus side down , in moistened potting soil , in individual pots.

Among the varieties studied considerable differences were found in the rooting habit and the ability of the root system to adjust itself to different soil environments has been shown. Further studies of these and others of the very numerous varieties will throw much light upon root behavior under various conditions of growth. How the roots respond in their distribution and activities under dry-land culture , irrigation , various methods of seed-bed preparation , depth and method of distributing manures and other fertilizers , depths of intertillage , etc. are problems awaiting further investigation. 85 More attention should be given to their activities in the subsoil.

Take , for example , that lovely shrubby viola from the Sierra de Cazorla in Spain , Viola cazorlensis. Thin stems with tiny leaves rise up about 4 " and are topped with huge , pink-purple , long-spurred flowers. Although my plant has set seed on two occasions , there has never been any germination. Propagation therefore has had to be carried out vegetatively. All cuttings root very easily in sand and grow on well when taken as early as possible after growth commences in the spring. This enables new plants to have a long growing season and make a good root system before they go dormant. If you miss the first growth and take cuttings later in the year , they will root and grow but you will be disappointed the following spring when nothing emerges , the roots having died off in winter. Taking cuttings from the first growth produces a bonus , encouraging the plant to break out from the base bearing far more flowering stems , resulting in a much showier exhibition plant . </root.v.3143><root.v.3144>Bhagavan says the root of this tree of samsara is the basic thought 'I'.

Unfortunately , only a very recent translation seems to be available. Recently , we ran across this article and are now very happy to be able to present a heavily edited translation of the central thesis , published before the book in the American Journal of Sociology. Philosophy of Money may seem like an unlikely topic in social psychology , but as the reader will discover , important evidence can be found in the most unlikely of places. Here , Simmel provides an extremely important analysis for social psychology it roots value in a specific kind of social relationship , independent of how the participants themselves might be characterized. Value ( and hence values ) is an emergent character within a system of interactions , a key notion in justifying a social psychology , independent of a individualistic psychology . </root.v.3148><root.v.3149>Cuttings can be made from several areas of the plant , but the most common are stem cuttings.

But who was found good by the Lord , since " Christ died for the ungodly " ? He found them all corrupt trees , but to those who " believed in His Name , He gave power to become the sons of God. " Whosoever then now is a good man , that is , a good tree , was found corrupt , and made good. And if when He came He had chosen to root up the corrupt trees , what tree would have remained which did not deserve to be rooted up ? But He came first to impart mercy , that He might afterwards exercise judgment , to whom it is said , " I will sing unto Thee O Lord , of mercy and judgment. " He gave then remission of sins to those who believed in Him , He would not even take account with them of past reckonings. He gave remission of sins , He made them good trees. He delayed the ax , He gave security . </root.v.3150><root.v.3151>Now that your plants are rooted and self-sufficient , it is important to provide them with ideal vegetative conditions. Water the plants properly : soak the soil deeply with clean pH-balanced water , then do not re-water until the surface of the soil is quite dry. This will force the roots to " chase " their water supply as gravity slowly pulls it down , resulting in a dense root system. Always soak the soil thoroughly before fertilizing to avoid creating " hot spots " of high fertilizer concentration. Begin fertilizing within a few days , but mix to only one-eighth the recommended concentration at first , increasing the dose gradually to full strength and beyond. Do not fertilize with each watering; every second watering is recommended. Lastly , leach the soil every few weeks to remove mineral salts by slowly pouring four to five times the container 's volume in pH-balanced water through it . </root.v.3151><root.v.3152>The obscurations are rooted in what we call mind poisons : greed , hatred , delusion , pride , an jealousy.

We ought to be able to recognise , in other words , the fundamentally new characteristics these struggles all present , despite their radical diversity. First , each struggle , although firmly rooted in local conditions , leaps immediately to the global level and attacks the imperial constitution in its generality. Second , all the struggles destroy the traditional distinction between economic and political struggles. The struggles are at once economic , political and cultural - and hence they are biopolitical struggles , struggles over the form of life.

That particular interpretation of void has not been especially created by buddhas and bodhisattvas in order to emphasize that all dharmas are rooted in emptiness , because all existence is originally devoid of self-hood and , therefore , empty.

The thematic order of the article is as follows : The first part is dedicated to a brief analysis of the impact of globalization on the fundamental transformations in social relations and the emergence of the rooted conception of cosmopolitanism. I will argue that this concept is interrelated with the notion of dialogue and signals an emerging sense of a 'we '; the rooted global demos. The second part covers a comparative analysis of the appreciation of dialogue as the building block of the global demos. I will argue how these two thinkers are vigilantly aware of the importance of dialogue in a highly pluralist world of cultures. While highlighting G len 's approach to dialogue as imperative to having the sense of being of human , this part follows an analysis of dialogue in light of Shabestary as well. In conclusion I will argue that the appreciation of dialogue would promise an all-encompassing peaceful life in an accelerated world of violence and conflicts . </root.v.3162><root.v.3163>This is clearly seen in the contrast between the " green olive tree " and the " green bay tree.

By rooting the speaker 's identification with the Jew in the issue of paternity , Plath 's poem enters into one of the key phantasmic scenarios of Nazism itself.

It is through the constant reconstruction of experience that human intelligence and human society are expanded. Mead 's evolutionary conception of human history is clearly a progressive notion which he seeks to document throughout his writings. There is implicit in human history a tendency toward a larger and larger sense of community. The ultimate formulation of this historical tendency is found in the ideal of the universal community. This ideal is not purely abstract ( i.e. , extra-historical ) , but is rooted in actual historical forces such as the universal religions , modern economic forces , and the human communicational process. According to Mead , it is this ideal of the universal community that informs the human evolutionary process and that indicates the implicit direction or teleology of history . </root.v.3173><root.v.3174>I want to have rooted cuttings ready in two weeks to give away.

Take the single edged razor blade and begin trimming your cuttings. Take cuttings one at a time from tepid water and now trim bottom two sets of leaves flush with stem. Trim approx 50 of leaves by cutting across the leaf surface. It is hard for the cutting to keep these large leaves alive and they usually wilt and fall off if not cut in half. Cut the stem at fourty five degrees across the bottom leaf nodes. Gently scrape the cut area around the bottom of the stem. This disrupts the cells on the stem surface and helps them change into root cells. Take whatever rooting hormone you have purchased and dip the bottom of stem into your rooting compound. Here is a tip : Do not dip directly into rooting hormone bottle instead pour some off into a small container such as a thimble and discard what is not used.

You 've probably seen the same thing when watering a potted plant that 's gone too dry ... it just wo n't take water unless you fuss with it. One of the reasons I prefer a heavy percentage of sand in my mix is because I can tell by weight and appearance if your trays are too dry. Sand seldom appears wet on the outside while having dry innards , but will dry a lot quicker than a mix with some peat. The ideal rooting media for most people will have excellent drainage ( Perlite or sand ) with some ability to retain a little moisture ( peat ) .

This principle does not delegitimize private property; instead it broadens the understanding and management of private property to embrace its indispensable social function , to the advantage of the common good and in particular the good of society 's weakest members.2 Unfortunately , this basic principle is widely disregarded , as shown by the persistent and growing gulf in the world between a North filled with abundant commodities and resources and increasingly made up of older people , and a South where the great majority of younger people now live , still deprived of credible prospects for social , cultural and economic development . </root.v.3188><root.v.3189>Now is the time to take cuttings from your alpines to increase your stock and produce new plants to replace old , tired specimens.

Anyone who knows Heidegger 's work knows that this is a complicated claim , which explains why Romano flounders in trying to explain it , and then turns to ridicule , of all things , as if we can take as axiomatic that his philosophical insights are bunk and so the Nazism is reason to ignore it.

Starch levels drop , strengthening tissues and fibers begin to soften , cell wall thickness decreases , vascular tissue is diminished , auxin levels rise , and undifferentiated tissue begins to form. These conditions are very conducive to the initiation of root growth. If the light cycle can be con trolled , whole plants can be subjected to etiolation , but usually single limbs are selected for cloning and wrapped for several inches just above the area where the cutting will be taken. This is done two weeks prior to rooting. The etiolated end may then be unwrapped and inserted into the rooting medium.

If your unit is large enough , you may also wish to add fish and the equipment needed to care for them . </root.v.3207><root.v.3208>At the same time , a much deeper aspiration - rooted in Persian culture and history - is to reclaim lost status. Iranians long to reassert their authority as a regional power. ( Ironically , the current regime 's domestically tenuous claim to legitimacy is now only being strengthened by Western hostility. Moreover , what from the vantage point of the US and Europe looks like Ahmadinejad 's recklessness , to many in the rest of the world must surely look like America 's comeupance . ) </root.v.3208><root.v.3209>The round rooted radish seems to reach England in the second half of the 16th century. William Turner writes in the Names of Herbes ( 1548 ); " There are two kindes of radice , the one is the commune radice with the longe roote the other kynde hath a rounde roote lyke a rape the former kynde groweth communely in Englande , but I have sene the seconde kynde no where els onely in high Almany " ( Germany ) . The Black rooted radish also reaches England in the 16th century. Henry Lyte records in the1586 English translation of Dodoens Herball; " The radish with a black root has of late years been brought into England and now biginnith to be common. " By the time Gerard publishes his Herball in 1597 there are several varieties of radish in England. " There be sundrie sorts of Radish , whereof some be long and white; others long and blacke; some round and white; others round , or of the forme of a peare , and blacke of colour. " He lists and illustrates four sorts that seem to be the most common . </root.v.3209><root.v.3210>Chimeras ( plants with pinwheel flowers ) can not be propagated by rooting a leaf because they will not bloom true. To propagate a chimera , cut out the crown with a sharp knife or razor and root it in a light airy potting mix. Place pot in a plastic bag to increase humidity. The remaining plant without the crown will sprout suckers. These suckers can be removed and rooted to produce additional new plants . </root.v.3210><root.v.3211>invariably use it to persecute those who differ from them in opinion.The murders of Christians by Christians for opinions sake , exceed in number and barbarity those of Christians by Pagans from the same motive.An alarm now prevails in churches of all denominations ( or rather , with the unprogressive fossilised individuals in these churches ) at the rapid enlargement and progress of scientific knowledge. The cry , " We must root out printing , " is changed to , " We must root out science , or science will root out us , " But it needs no gift of prophetic vision to foresee the inevitable outcome of such an antagonism. Modern enlightened development substitutes facts for fables , and a grand and worthy conception of the devine Creator of the vast universe is taking the place of that imagined by a narrow , cruel , benighted and barbarous people of a past age.They created a personal God after their own Image , capricious and vindictive. But " The time cometh , and now is. " When the immortal human soul , emancipated from the obscurity of a narrow superstition , will emerge into the broad light of truth and reason , and ascend through nature </root.v.3211><root.v.3212>Figure 1 Five incongruent rooted trees that all derive from the same unrooted network of four taxa. The incongruence arises purely because of different potential placements of the root on the network ( indicated by numbers ) . </root.v.3212><root.v.3213>The Gaia Puja is a celebration of the Goddess within everyone. We all are both yin and yang , no matter what our gender. We have to strive to be in harmony with both sides. It 's crucial that , in this time of powerful energy shifts , we are rooted in the Goddess energy of Mother Gaia to ensure an easy transit . </root.v.3213><root.v.3214>Palestine as a Global Agenda : ZIONISM IS BOTH alien and illegitimate in origin : it is a hegemonist and nationalist project rooted and nourished on the traditional European impulse towards expansion and domination. The founding fathers of the Zionist adventure were not in any way believers in Judaism , not even in its distorted , rabbinical form : they were in essence pragmatists who exploited the Jewish heritage as a means to achieve their nationalistic goals. All this , moreover , was done within the broader context of Western strategic hopes for the destabilizing and enfeebling of the Islamic world . </root.v.3214><root.v.3215>If you ' ve watered too much for too long or let it sit in a pan of water , rot will eventually occur. There is no saving your original plant now.. It starts at the very bottom of the stem turning it brown and eventually mushy. The only way to save it now is to make as many cuttings as possible. Put them in little containers with moist soil in a plastic bag out of direct sunlight. Let them root and try again. You can root cuttings in various ways so I won ' t go over that , especially since I haven ' t found a perfect method myself . </root.v.3215><root.v.3216>TO PLANT - I take a clear plastic cup and set in on my bench - no hole in bottom , stick the calloused cutting down into the cup ( with rooting hormone or not - I 'm not a fanatic about rooting hormone ) then add FRESH , moist cactus soil to the cup almost to the top and press the soil down and around the cutting very tightly. Then I set it aside in a warm spot to root. I do not water the cutting after planting. The moisture in the fresh cactus soil is enough and condensation forms within the pastic cup , feeding moisture to the soil. For very large cuttings , I plant them in a larger black garden pot the same way . </root.v.3216><root.v.3217>No tree can grow except on the root from which it sprang. Even as we need to look to the first Adam and his fall to know the power of the sin within us , we need to know well the Second Adam and His power to give within us a life of humility as real and abiding and overmastering as has been that of pride. We have our life from and in Christ , as truly , yea more truly , than from and in Adam. We are to walk " rooted in Him , " " holding fast the Head from whom the whole body increaseth with the increase of God. " The life of God which in the incarnation entered human nature , is the root in which we are to stand and grow; it is the same almighty power that worked there , and thence onward to the resurrection , which works daily in us. Our one need is to study and know and trust the life that has been revealed in Christ as the life that is now ours , and waits for our consent to gain possession and mastery of our whole being . </root.v.3217><root.v.3218>The Scripture knows that most people do n't succeed in being self-confident. Most people are quite unhappy about their inability to appear self-reliant and self-assured and cool and in control. So when the Scripture teaches us to root out self-confidence , it means go for the root , not the half-withered branches. Go for the DESIRE to be self-confident , not the meager manifestations of it that make their way into peoples ' actions . </root.v.3218><root.v.3219> The idea is first of all to point out that the quote-unquote success of my mother , and by extension me , had roots hundreds of years into the past. And I wanted to be incredibly specific. It ' s all about how success stories are rooted in the specifics of the individual and to the quirks of their own past and culture and history. </root.v.3219><root.v.3220>Every plant must have both soil and root. Without both of these there can be no life , no growth , no fruit. The root is " peace with God "; the soil in which that root strikes itself , and out of which it draws the vital sap , is the free love of God in Christ. " Rooted in love " is the apostle 's description of a holy man. The secret of a believer 's holy walk is his continual recurrence to the blood of the Surety , and his daily intercourse with a crucified and risen Lord. All divine life , and all the precious fruits of it , pardon , peace , and holiness , spring from the cross. All fancied sanctification which does not arise wholly from the blood of the cross is nothing better than Pharisaism. If we would be holy , we must get to the cross , and dwell there; else , notwithstanding all our labour , diligence , fasting , praying and good works , we shall be yet void of real sanctification , destitute of those humble , gracious tempers which accompany a clear view of the cross . </root.v.3220><root.v.3221>Q : I have four spider plants that I took from babies off a friend 's plant. I put them in water until they rooted , then placed each of them in 4-inch pots. They have been in the pots since June. While the plants are healthy , they do n't seem to be growing. I water them weekly and they are in a south-facing window that seems to receive good light. My African violets are doing well in this window. Any idea 's on why these plants are not getting any bigger ? ( E-mail reference ) </root.v.3221><root.v.3222>And after repeating these words , they will say , one after another , O you who brought us these sweet things appear ! ' Then you must answer , Nay , for you will eat me. ' And they will say , We swear by our spoon that we will not eat you ! ' But do not stir; and they will continue , We swear by our spit that we will not eat you ! ' But stand firm , as if rooted to the spot; and they will say , We swear by our broom that we will not eat you ! ' Still do not believe them; and when they say , We swear by our pail that we will not eat you ! ' shut your mouth , and say not a word , or it will cost you your life. At last they will say , We swear by Thunder-and-Lightning that we will not eat you ! ' Then take courage and mount up , for they will do you no harm. " </root.v.3222><root.v.3223>Yonina Pritzker describes her visit to Hebron , viewing it both as an ancient Jewish city in which Judaism 's early history is rooted and as a small-scale model of the players and the pressures Israel needs to confront to protect her heritage. She writes , " Hevron is a microcosm. Hevron represents the duplicity and grave injustice that is being perpetrated against Jews today , against Jewish history and heritage. If something so clear , so straightforward , so indisputable as Hevron , if something as unmistakable as the Jewish connection to Hevron can be so rewritten , so misrepresented; if those around the world can literally turn history on its head and accuse Jews of being occupiers in Hevron , then the absolute , dire necessity to stand up and fight against this attempt to subvert the truth and rob Jews of their history , heritage , and homeland has never been made more clear. " </root.v.3223><root.v.3224>3 ) Roots punish you for bad positioning. If you get rooted in the middle of the enemy team and die , it 's because you were in the middle of the enemy team and were gon na die anyways. It 's the same as Knockbacks , especially in Tor Anroc. If you get kb 'd into the lava , its cause you were in a bad position already . </root.v.3224><root.v.3225>Next , unless you have access to rooted clones , you will need seeds. A package of ten Indica-dominant high-quality seeds will cost only $ 20. Marc Emery runs a secure and prolific seed distribution company from cannabisculture.com . </root.v.3225><root.v.3226>And Jesus said we have to be really one-eyed about this. It is the one big decision we have to make in our life that sets the direction in which everything goes. Either we take God seriously or we take Mammon seriously. We can not do both. Opt for Mammon and it will take us over; opt for God and He will take us over. Nor must we imagine there is a third option open to us , as though to say , " I 'll opt for neither. I 'll opt for me , and so be free , " because the 'me ' we opt for then still has wants - wants rooted deep in our vitals we have to turn somewhere to satisfy. Turn to Mammon , and it will root us in this world so we perish with it; turn to God and He will root us in the real world so we endure with it . </root.v.3226><root.v.3227>The reach of this device becomes ever clearer when we recall that the Court was not faced , in Romer , with an attempt to stir up prosecutions or withdraw the protections of the law from gays and lesbians. Colorado had already repealed its laws on sodomy. With Amendment 2 , the people of Colorado had decided simply to withhold endorsement or favoritism : The coercions of the law would not be used to punish those people who bore moral objections to homosexuality. And yet , this perspective , reflected in the law , was characterized by the Court now as an " animus , " a form of blind prejudice that could not justify itself in the name of any rational purpose. As Scalia noted , his colleagues were now " disparaging as bigotry adherence to traditional attitudes , " rooted in religious teaching. In a stroke then-and without the need to marshal any reasons-the Court could pronounce the traditional moral teaching of Judaism and Christianity as empty , irrational , unjustified . </root.v.3227><root.v.3228>The cuttings made as soon as the buds have formed and the wood has lost its succulent nature , will root quicker , and a much larger per cent of them will form roots , or " strike , " as it is called. If the variety is a new and choice one , the blind shoots , or those that have not formed flower buds , are often used for making cuttings. While it may be done occasionally without marked injury , if persisted in the tendency will be to develop plants that form few flowering stems , and the results will not be satisfactory , so that the continued use of the blind shoots for cuttings is not to be recommended . </root.v.3228><root.v.3229>Cuttings will root more quickly and reliably in warm rooting mix. Keep your cuttings between 65 F and 75 F , avoiding excessive heat. If your area is too cold , consider a heating mat or cable especially designed for this purpose . </root.v.3229><root.v.3230>This is not to say , however , that rooting is inimical to mobility. On the contrary , rooting is necessary to mobility , particularly the changeable footwork of Chinese boxing. Since the combative encounter is filled with the need for changeable footwork , it is important that this principle of rooting be developed in transition. My point is simply that the skill of rooting is difficult to learn. A vision of its benefit is important as it will provide the patience and perseverance until one makes rooting a reality . </root.v.3230><root.v.3231>I am a fan of the Colorado Rockies first and foremost , but when you play a team as much as we play the Dodgers , you get to know their players , and you learn to respect the good guys on the other team. I personally love James Loney and I root for him all the time. I see nothing wrong with wanting the Dodgers to succeed. Plus ... that means next year we would get to smack around the WS Champs in the regular season . </root.v.3231><root.v.3232>That is , use a segment between two leaf nodes. Remove the bottom leaf and treat the bottom and leaf node the same as your first cutting. Dip in rooting hormone and plant in the potting medium . </root.v.3232><root.v.3233>Ginda Simpson 's memoir , Deeply Rooted , records not the pangs of growth , the passions of youth , or the high points of a successful career , but rather a process of re-evaluation and recommitment experienced in middle age. What to do when you are no longer tied to a specific location because of your job or your family ? Do you go , or do you stay ? Perhaps because Americans are less rooted in their soil than people of other cultures , or perhaps because they have essentially remained pioneers , more and more American retirees pack up and move somewhere else. Those with international experience may leave the United States altogether . </root.v.3233><root.v.3234>Living the Gospel of life may be described in a phrase from Robert Frost -- - a vocation to journey on " the road less traveled. " A people of life and for life is a pilgrim people following the Gospel path of " human freedom rooted in law , law which is rooted , in turn , in the truth about the sanctity of the human person. " ( LGL n.39 ) </root.v.3234><root.v.3235>SPIRIT OF BAAL - II KINGS 10 : 28 - " Thus Jehu rooted Baal out of Israel.

Hydrangea macrophylla ssp. macrophylla is so easy to root that it is not necessary to make the cutting at the node. Roots initiate in greater numbers at the node but develop in sufficient numbers elsewhere . </root.v.3239><root.v.3240>Start watering again in the spring and throughout out the summer. The cuttings should be rooted by late spring and you can cut back on the water , but don t let them dry out to the point that they burn up . </root.v.3240><root.v.3241>Plant pieces cut from a parent plant and rooted to form new plants are called " cuttings. " They are a simple and inexpensive way to multiply houseplants as well as garden plants. These new plants have the same characteristics and genetic makeup as the parent plant . </root.v.3241><root.v.3242>every time you speak about rooting Android devices , you are missing the main point : even with all the Android devices being sold in nearly every country of the world , the possibility to buy applications in the Android Market ( and not be limited only to free apps ) is still extremely limited. The result is that users are looking for ways to go around this , which basically means rooting their Android phone , installing an application such as Market Enabler which allows to fake being on another wireless provider , then finally be able to buy applications . </root.v.3242><root.v.3243>For your outdoor plants , you should not transplant recently rooted cuttings to a permanent location in the landscape. Instead , transplant to individual pots or in a bed. Grow these transplants to a larger size to improve their chances of survival in the landscape. Give special care to the young plants for one or two growing seasons. Carefully prepare soil beds with the addition of organic amendments and nutrients. Water and fertilize the plants carefully the first year to increase the top and root system . </root.v.3243><root.v.3244>Next , I fill a 2 1/2 inch pot with moist soil mix and just set the crown in it. Then I cover the plant with a baggie , or put it in a covered tray or container from the salad bar. It will be rooted in a month or so. After one week , go ahead and peak at the new roots coming. In a few weeks you will be able to gently tug on the plant , but the roots will hold tight. When it 's covered in plastic , do n't set it in direct sunlight. It needs bright light , but not to strong . </root.v.3244><root.v.3245>( Interlude while I watch Michael Phelps win his record-tying seventh gold medal in his most exciting race since the 4x100 freestyle relay. Same thing goes here. Aside from the fact that Phelps is probably from another planet , he is from the USA , so I root for him. My sister and I leapt off the couch and roared when he somehow got in first. This at least has somewhat more sense in the fact that that 's where I 'm from , so national solidarity ... . so ... . state solidarity ? Is it that we decide this particular group represents us , so we come together in a unity show ? Is it the old pack mentality ? Since we are from one place , we are better than you from another place ? ) </root.v.3245><root.v.3246>The image and likeness of God in man , created as man and woman ( in the analogy that can be presumed between Creator and creature ) , thus also expresses the " unity of the two " in a common humanity. This " unity of the two , " which is a sign of interpersonal communion , shows that the creation of man is also marked by a certain likeness to the divine communion ( " communio " ) . This likeness is a quality of the personal being of both man and woman , and is also a call and a task. The foundation of the whole human " ethos " is rooted in the image and likeness of God which the human being bears within himself from the beginning. Both the Old and New Testament will develop that " ethos , " which reaches its apex in the commandment of love. [ 25 ] </root.v.3246><root.v.3247>This new , more descriptive structural approach is inaugurated in the essay " The Origin of Our Belief in the Reality of the External World and Its Justification " of 1890. Here Dilthey writes that the structure of all psychic life consists of impressions " evoking purposive reactions in the system of our lives and the feelings connected with them " ( Dilthey 1924a , 96 ) . Rather than basing our initial sense of an external world on theoretical inferences from effects to causes , he roots it in a felt resistance to the will. But resistance must be internalized as a restraint of a volitional intention for it to signify the existence of something independent. Thus Dilthey is not merely replacing a representational phenomenalism with a direct perceptual realism. Each perceptual process has " an inner side " that involves " an energy and affective tone deriving from inner stirrings that connect it to our own life " ( Dilthey 1924a , 96 ) . All aspects of our own life are brought into play as we respond to the world . </root.v.3247><root.v.3248>Pledge number seven of the Family Pledge is important , although it is simple.

The lights ( 3-5 inches above tent ) add about 2-3 degrees to the temperature inside the tent. The temperature for rooting should not go above 75 F and 70 to 74 is ideal.

Attendees will need to bring their own tools and rooting needles . </root.v.3254><root.v.3255>Let us hear again for the first time Paul s insight into the biblical perspective. The darkening of human minds is ultimately rooted in the hardening of the human heart towards God and one s fellow human beings ( Romans l.lSff; Ephesians 4.17ff ) . Our alien minds ( human reason ) is restored to its proper functioning by divine revelation and redemption. While post modern relativism finds talk of sin distasteful , it shares with Enlightenment Modernism a naive belief in the human power to overcome evil. Post Modern prophets reconstruct our world through the endless free play of language the creation of new vocabularies. ( No logocentric coherency is available in post modern speak see Stephen Katz , How to Speak and Write Postmodern ( posted to alt.humor.best-of-Usenet by Andrew C. Bulhak ( June 20 , 1995 ) Thus sin and evil are banished at one stroke. Christian witness in our postmodern rushing towards the 2lst century can not remain at the epistemological level. It must address the perversity of the human mind , soul , body and will by articulating a comprehensive Christian world view ( cf. which is not politically correct ) . </root.v.3255><root.v.3256>This is an excellent time to move plants from one location to another , if they are currently growing in the same area. If you are moving them from a more southern environment , you may want to wait a few more weeks. These plants may be in a more advanced state of growth in the south , and might suffer winter damage , if you place them outside here , where it is colder. When you do move them , the key is to protect the root system during the move. Wrap the root ball in burlap , sheets , or some-such fabric , and try to avoid exposure to cold weather or drying winds. The tops will be more winter hardy than the roots. For those plants that may be too large to move , consider taking cuttings. Not all plants will root readily now , but you wo n't be out anything , and you may have good results. The cuttings should be no larger than three to four inches. Wrap the cuttings in a moist paper towel , and put them in a plastic bag , until you get home and can get them in soil . </root.v.3256><root.v.3257>In less than six months you could end up with an adult plant that is exactly like its parent in every way.

An important component of attaining this result centers on the ability to speak freely. The coordinator for the Safe Streets Partnership believes that conflict is necessary to solve problems , especially those that are deeply rooted in anger , violence , and negativity. When people come to the table without a name tag and speak their minds , it resulted in a more real portrayal of the problem. With a fuller understanding of a problem , people can create more effective solutions.

Such an attitude towards mathematics is a micro-illustration of a greater flaw in modern educational philosophy. Modern education , rooted in atheism , has reduced its worldview of education to utilitarianism.

No rooting hormone is needed with pilosa. In general , pilosa has a rapid rooting behavior. It roots in two to three weeks in dormant condition , during the winter months in a mist house or greenhouse environment. Misting occurs three times a day for ten minutes each session. It is slower to root in spring and summer when it is active with seed production but is still showing rooting attempts during the summer heat and bloom cycle. When the temperature rose in March , mice attacked the cuttings in the rooting trays and would continue to eat the new growth as pilosa attempted to rebound. Rooting during the cold months in the mist house was much more successful with near 100 percent success for cuttings taken then.

The size of the rootball is based upon how long the cutting has been rooted. A newly rooted plant will have a relatively small root-ball whereas one which may have been rooted many months prior or even the previous year will have a much more substantial size rootball. When rooted cuttings are prepared for shipment it is quite common for some roots to be broken from the tree.

This obscurantism is rooted in human nature more deeply than any particular subject of interest. It is just as strong among the men of science as among the clergy , and among professional men and business men as among the other classes. Obscurantism is the refusal to speculate freely on the limitations of traditional methods. It is more than that : it is the negation of the importance of such speculation , the insistence on incidental dangers.

His joy was rooted in his union with the Father in the Spirit. Jesus did not find his joy in the recognition he received from the crowds. His joy flowed from the knowledge that he was recognized by the Father. This is my Son whom I love. With him I am well pleased ( Mat. 3 : 17 ) . Long awaited by the Lord , Jesus is the descendant of Jesse. God is faithful and He will fulfill his pledge to all the members of the human family. The Lord of Lords and the King of Kings will indeed bring peace to our war torn world. Even though the tree has been reduced to a stump , God ' s designs can not be frustrated.

When you transfer them to soil , all the water roots will break off. They are extremely fragile , and they do n't absorb water from soil anyway.

Sometimes some of the stems have collapsed and sunk into the surrounding vegetation rendering them practically invisible.

There are also some twisted sisters out there , my dear , that you would be well advised to stay away from. The bottom line is , make sure you associate with people you trust. Always remember that the Radical Faerie Fellowship is diverse and eclectic. Each circle is very different. Even within one area , several different Faerie " factions " will probably exist. One group may enshrine the use of drugs in its rituals , another may abhor the use of drugs , etc. Find the circle you belong with and root your heart in it. If you ca n't find the circle you belong with , start your own. The Good Goddess will show you the way. We have learned to take responsibility for our own spiritual lives , creating a loving , sacred community.

Once the first true leaves appear , the seedlings are removed from the growing medium and the roots washed. They are decapitated at just above the root level , with a scalpel or razor blade. Stand them briefly in liquid rooting hormone and then replant in the damp growing medium. Mist spray regularly and keep out of direct sun , until new roots are formed. Most species will root rapidly and develop stronger radial root systems than if they had been left to develop naturally. This technique is used particularly with pine seedlings in Japan , but I also " discovered " the technique myself , prior to reading about it , when sciarid fly grubs ate all the roots from a pan of Pinus densiflora seedlings. I did n't use any rooting hormone , just forlornly placed the rootless pines in sharp sand and to my surprise they all rooted and grew on strongly . </root.v.3351><root.v.3352>In v. 2 , Paul deals with resistance to authority.

A government that defies the laws of God is heading for disaster. " [ 3 ] Paul is not requiring an unquestioning submission to all authority.

Crabgrass leaves are rolled in the bud; the first leaf appears short , wide and blunt-tipped. The ligule is tall and membranous with jagged edges , and the auricles are absent. The collar is broad with long hairs. Crabgrass is light green in color , coarse bladed and will root at the nodes when they touch the ground. A single crabgrass plant can produce up to 700 tillers. It is a bunch type grass.The inflorescence is a panicle of branches , with spikelets in two rows. A crabgrass plant can produce 150 , 000 seeds. Crabgrass needs warm soils and sunlight to germinate.

Trees may be available in a variety of root conditions. Balled and burlapped and bare rooted trees are dug from the ground with only a small part of the root system intact. Trees in containers may have many or all roots included , but must be grown carefully to avoid becoming too large for the container . </root.v.3362><root.v.3363>The physiological basis for root initiation is well understood and allows many advantageous modifications of rooting systems. Natural plant growth substances such as auxins , cytokinins , and gibberellins are certainly responsible for the control of root initiation and the rate of root formation. Auxins are considered the most influential. Auxins and other growth substances are involved in the control of virtually all plant processes : stem growth , root formation , lateral bud inhibition , floral maturation , fruit development , and determination of sex. Great care is exercised in application of artificial growth substances so that detrimental conflicting reactions in addition to rooting do not occur. Auxins seem to affect most related plant species in the same way , but the mechanism of this action is not yet fully understood . </root.v.3363><root.v.3364>E. H. Wilson was one of the first to urge propagation by cuttings , but since during his lifetime no one had devised an adequate method of rooting them , his opinion on the subject was only a theory. Now we can see the facts. When a cutting-grown rhododendron and a grafted plant of the same variety are placed side by side , and both treated as they should be , the grafted plant will make better growth than the cutting for two , three or four seasons , after which the cutting-grown plant will gain in vigor , and by the sixth or seventh year , will usually have caught up to and passed the grafted one in size and shapeliness. From that time on , there is no comparison. The cutting-grown rhododendron is superior to the graft in every respect . </root.v.3364><root.v.3365>Dig a hole 12 to 18 inches deep and 18 inches wide , spacing holes 3 to 4 feet apart.

Whether it was the case of a prophet pointing people back to the ancient traditions , Josiah discovering anew the law , or Peter proclaiming the relationship of the Old Testament to the life and death of Jesus , revival is normally based on the Bible and rooted in a new appreciation of the biblical text. Revival phenomena will not likely produce lasting good unless they drive people to a deeper study of the Scripture resulting in a more devoted living of Scripture. Revivals ' effects depend upon what happens to the majority of the people. When large numbers of people change their lives , revival lasts. If people only change while around the revival leaders or while the influence of these leaders is felt , then it is unlikely that the revival will produce lasting good. The best place to measure the real effect of the revival is at the grassroots , not among the leaders of the movement . </root.v.3368><root.v.3369>The plant was furry silver rosettes with hot rose tiny flowers in clusters waving above a tag labeled : Androsace sarmentosa 'Chumbyi'.

One can only be amazed at how easily and deeply children accept faith in God and what a beneficial influence it has on them. Faith in God not only helps a child to fight bad inclinations , but it also helps him to understand many fundamental questions which are inexplicable in human terms regarding the nature of good and evil , the appearance of the world , the aim of life , etc. The main point is that faith in God is the key to the development of all the positive qualities in a child - piety , love , compassion , sensitivity , repentance and the wish to improve . </root.v.3372><root.v.3373>The health sector and in particular the private sector focuses its efforts on those who can pay , emphasises the treatment of disease , and so neglects the promotion of good health , the prevention of disease and the rehabilitation of the disabled.

Feral hogs will root into the most difficult places and inflict much damage , but on their terms and time. In trapping , the trapper wants the hog to enter on the trapper 's clock. This means that trap doors ( openings ) should be large enough to accommodate the anticipated hog traffic.

The best way to determine that this has been accomplished is to examine the soil. Loamy , sand soil holds 1 inch of water per foot of depth.

On a more personal note , the Emperor had lost what was supposed to be Vader 's successor as his new apprentice. To have lost someone of Marek 's potential and having to still make do with a cyborg apprentice was a frustrating setback.

Yet as time passes , their tenuous , makeshift arrangement unearths a series of buried personal secrets that challenges their bonds , and reveals just how inextricably their lives are intertwined . </root.v.3399><root.v.3400>You can mow your sod on the highest mower setting once it is rooted down. New sod will die if you mow it at a shorter level. Each week following the initial mowing you can lower the mower deck one level until you are finally at the normal level you typically mow at . </root.v.3400><root.v.3401>Verbenas , Euonymus , Pachysandra , Ivy , and climbing roses , among others , will root fairly quickly by layering them into the warm soil. Fasten a section of the stem containing one or more " eyes " down onto cultivated soil with a horseshoe shaped piece of wire or weighted with a rock and cover it with additional soil. By summers end , the stem should be rooted sufficiently to sever it from the parent plant and replant into another area of the garden . </root.v.3401><root.v.3402>Getting your rooted cutting into the pot will only take a minute or so. From there we place it in the nursery , trim it once during the summer , and by fall it has completely filled out and is a saleable plant. Or course it requires watering , and we pull a few weeds , but I 've got secret weed control formulas that I will share with you . </root.v.3402><root.v.3403>" All of us have chosen to write on our individual windows the set of principles by which we live. These principles can be lofty , rooted in deep moral concepts; they can also be petty , springing from our own set of jealousies and prejudices. " </root.v.3403><root.v.3404>Most sedums are spreading or creeping plants that will root from broken branches or fallen leaves. Related to the cacti , their thick , waxy , generally evergreen leaves mean that they do not require large amounts of water. Most sedums are very drought tolerant and will rot if kept too moist or if air circulation is poor . </root.v.3404><root.v.3405>A moment is a unit of experience. It has a beginning , a middle , and an end. You can feel when something begins to rise in energy in your life. It presents , then it swells to a climax , and then it recedes and resolves. That is a moment from the time it arrives into your life until it recedes and resolves. Every moment arrives containing everything it needs for its completion. It unfolds perfectly , and even when you are in the midst of a challenging time , you can remain rooted in the moment and thus move through it with Grace. The more you can detach the more you can ALLOW THE MOVEMENT the more ease and comfort you will have in your journey through the days ahead. Resistance of any kind blocks the flow. You can remain rooted in your truth without resisting the flow that occurs all around you. Think of a tree with a stream flowing around it. The tree remains in place when it is rooted and grounded. Be that tree. This is not the same as stubbornness or resistance. Be rooted in the moment. Be rooted in your truth . </root.v.3405><root.v.3406>On a TV programme about indoor gardening ( airing on the specialized gardening channel ) , I was amazed to see the host actually recommend rooting fuchsia cuttings in water; and say that potting soil used for indoor plants should have a balanced pH , and contain a balanced fertilizer. </root.v.3406><root.v.3407>This is a slightly more dramatic method than the tourniquet. When I began in bonsai , I thought that it looked like a good way to kill the tree. It involves removing the bark for a length of about 1 " to 2 " all the way around the trunk or branch that is going to form the new plant ( ring barking ) . The edges should be a clean cut and right down to the harder wood beneath. Any remaining soft sappy tissue , the cambium layer , must be scraped down to wood. Otherwise it provides a nutrient path and hinders rooting or calluses over again completely. The top of the cut area is then dusted with rooting hormone. Use a small paintbrush for this and try to get all of the bark/cambium edge covered. Be careful not to breathe in the dust. The same procedure of wrapping with damp sphagnum moss and covering with polythene , as used for a tourniquet layer , is followed. Suitable species survive the trauma and root so well , that they often develop a better radial root system than a seedling or cutting . </root.v.3407><root.v.3408>thanks for all the years amani. loved watching you play and always was a u of m fan too so i always rooted for you. thanks and best.

Some mineral component , such as coarse sand , pumice , perlite , vermiculite , or grit is also added. There are n't any " perfect " mixes , though a blend of sand and peat moss works well , or pumice and peat moss. Coarse particles are essential for air flow but the twig must be firmly in touch with the mix and supported by it . </root.v.3411><root.v.3412>Evergreen shrubs can be planted during showery weather. Pot-grown wall shrubs should also be planted. If the weather is dry , water newly-planted trees and shrubs. Mulch with lawn mowings or compost. Layer shoots of Hydrangea in a pot of peaty soil , pegging a shoot down. Once rooted , sever from the parent plant. Prune trees and shrubs once they have finished flowering. Forsythia can be cut back to within two buds of the old growth; any stems which have rooted themselves can be severed and replanted. Prune Buddleia and Hydrangea hard as these flower on the growth of the current season. Prune straggly lavender and Magnolia and remove any weak shoots on other trees and shrubs . </root.v.3412><root.v.3413>The hardening off of newly rooted plants is a very critical process.

The T'ai Chi Ch'uan Classics say " the motion should be rooted in the feet , released through the legs , controlled by the waist and manifested through the fingers. " Everything acts simultaneously. When the hand , waist and foot move together , the eyes follow. If one part does n't follow , the whole body is disordered . </root.v.3416><root.v.3417>Add a sterile rooting media to the container. Examples of rooting media are a 50-50 mix of peat moss and coarse perlite or 100 percent sand , 100 vermiculite or combinations of the above. If using a flat or pot , fill it to within an inch of the top. If using a large jar or aquarium , add at least 4 inches of rooting media and leave a 6- to 8-inch space from the surface of the media to the top of the container. Add water to make sure the media is evenly moist . </root.v.3417><root.v.3418>So what are we missing here.

If the plant is already rooted , bury the roots in gravel , but do n't bury any of the stem. If the plant is n't rooted , trim the ends off and put the fresh end in gravel - hopefully it will root . </root.v.3419><root.v.3420>Nisargadatta became primarily interested only in practicing the meditation as prescribed by his Guru and singing devotional bhajan songs. In his meditations , Nisargadatta experienced strange and colorful divine lights , various divine forms of God and saints , visions of beautiful landscapes never seen before , and deep trance states of samadhi. These manifestations of initial " imbalance " ceased after a while , giving way to absorptionslater , final absorptionin the utterly natural state of nisarga samadhi , or sahaja samadhi. This " extraordinarily ordinary , " " unconditioned condition " is formless Awareness abiding unto ItSelf while a form-full world of changing appearances arises. It has been likened to " waking sleep " by the illustrious sage , Sri Ramana Maharshi ( 1879-1950 ) , wherein one experiences the utter peace and care-free bliss of formless deep sleep while clearly aware of arising forms of experience. This nisarga or sahaja samadhi transcends all dramatic , flashy " experiences " for such experiences are changing and transient , and rooted in the dualistic , subject-object split. Nisargadatta himself tells of his time with his Guru , and what transpired in the more mature phase of his spiritual practice ( sadhana ) : </root.v.3420><root.v.3421>This inner code of behavior becomes deeply rooted in connected children. As a result , they develop a healthy sense of guilt , feeling appropriately wrong when they act wrong. To a connected kid , a lie is a breach of trust. When he slips , his well-being is disturbed , so he strives to preserve and restore this sense of moral balance. A connected child can truly do the right things for others because others have done the right things for him . </root.v.3421><root.v.3422>While in the state of rest or semi-activity , the human autonomic nervous system takes its cue from the frequency and depth of breathing. The average adult breathes at the rate of 15 breaths per minute , a rate that the autonomic nervous system interprets as " fight or flight " . In other words , even though you may be sitting quite still reading this page , if you are breathing at the typical rate of 15 breaths per minute , your autonomic nervous system is shifted toward " sympathetic emphasis " . Generally , sympathetic emphasis involves activation of bodily systems resulting in increased heart rate , increased muscle tension , and the production of biotransmitters associated with threatened survival. Because most adults breathe at this rate much of the time , most adults persist in a relative state of chronic " sympathetic dominance " and related psycho-physiological stress. The emerging medical understanding is that many modern day maladies are rooted in autonomic nervous system imbalance. What has not been understood is the root cause for this imbalance . </root.v.3422><root.v.3423>I live in southern Kentucky , so when the Titans opened their new stadium in 1999 , I was a beaten-down , disheartened Bengals fan who wondered if it was worth it anymore. I decided that , hey , there was another NFL team in my back door , so why not start following them instead. I managed to pretend that I liked my new local team for a while , but when they came within a foot of a Super Bowl championship and I found that I was still spending as much time reading about the Bengals as I was the Titans , I knew that I was what I had always been : a Cincinnati Bengals fan. I 'm okay with the Titans today , and will root for them against the Stealers , Cowboys , Patriots , every time. But overall I 'm just indifferent about them when it comes down to it . </root.v.3423><root.v.3424>The tough bottom bag is used primarily by customers who are moving , handling and shipping the plant directly in the bag. The plastic bottom bag is used primarily by customers who remove the bag and transplant the tree to a plastic pot or wooden box.

Usually for most species the best period is in Spring , however if you want to take cuttings from the early flowering species like montana 's , alpina 's than take the cuttings after the flowering period when new growth is on his way. My experience is that in spring the cuttings root very easily and they have the whole summer to get more , and stronger roots to survive the next winter period . </root.v.3425><root.v.3426>OCD is essentially defined as a anxiety disorder. The mind is filled with thoughts " If I fail to do something or forget to do something a negative will happen to me " . This thought is often fed from some subconscious connection of a past event in life. As a example the person may have been told something when they were a child. If you do n't X you will get Y " . Because of this a fear develops and becomes rooted deep in the subconscious mind. It did not matter if there was any basis or actual fact that supports the reason. Because of lack of real life experience to test the statement the thought is accepted as factual . </root.v.3426><root.v.3427>Rooted cuttings are usually first potted into 2 and 1/4-inch or 3 inch plastic or clay pots using the potting soil mix recommended earlier. When potted they may be set into a nursery flat or other tray for easy handling. Water plants thoroughly as each flat is filled and again after pots are set on the greenhouse bench or other growing area. When plants become well rooted and large enough they may be sold or planted out. If desired they may be moved into larger pots or other containers for growing . </root.v.3427><root.v.3428>Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) -- Perennial Mediterranean herb that needs excellent drainage. If planted in sandy loam in full sun , it can reach quite a size and live several years. Planting in a raised berm can increase its chances for survival. Has a strong , resinous flavor and scent and tiny , edible flowers which are usually blue , but sometimes pink. Good in meat and fish dishes , and to accent goat cheese. Unlike most herbs , Rosemary is stronger fresh than dried , so bear this fact in mind when using in recipes which call for the dried herb. Prostrate forms do best in a container or spilling over the edge of a raised area. Named cultivars can be found in mail order catalogs but you can usually get standard upright and prostrate plants locally. Rosemary should be pruned lightly and often - it does n't like its old wood cut into. Cuttings can be rooted in vermiculite or sharp sand during the cool season. It also makes fine topiary - use an upright one for a standard or - if you 're adventurous - a prostrate form for a Brontosaurus ! </root.v.3428><root.v.3429>The old rule of thumb was to start doing hardwood cuttings of evergreens after you have experienced at at least two hard freezes. After two hard freezes the plants are completely dormant. However , based on my experience it is beneficial to start doing your evergreen cuttings earlier than that. So instead of doing by the book  hardwood cuttings you re actually working with semi-hardwood cuttings. The down side to starting your cuttings early is that they will have to be watered daily unless you experience rain showers. The up side is that they will start rooting sooner , and therefore are better rooted when you pull them out to transplant them . </root.v.3429><root.v.3430>Cuttings of the stems of most evergreen azaleas can be rooted rather easily. Use new growth for the cuttings , at any time from June onwards , depending on the weather and the variety of azalea. The exact timing depends on the condition of the cutting wood , which should be somewhere between soft and brittle : it should not bend like rubber , and it should not snap like a matchstick. At the proper time , it will probably be putting out a new terminal bud . </root.v.3430><root.v.3431>The cuttings will root , within a few weeks , in a warm position in the greenhouse or on a windowledge shaded from direct sunlight. For quick rooting , provide bottom heat by using a heated propagator . </root.v.3431><root.v.3432>It is important when using Rain Birds or overhead sprinklers to water deeply and infrequently. At Sierra Azul sprinklers are left for 2-3 hours at each spot. This is done once a month during the summer and early fall and provides adequate water for healthy plant growth. Watering frequency may vary according to soil type , sandy soils requiring more frequent irrigation. Deeper rooted plants will need fewer irrigations than ones that have rooted shallowly. Frequent , shallow watering encourages shallowly rooted plants. This should be avoided in the mediterranean garden . </root.v.3432><root.v.3433>Everyone who is gearing up to make their big Nexus One purchase next week can look forward to having root access to their handset right out of the gate.

Note Paul 's mixing of metaphors ( rooted from the farming or agricultural world , and grounded from the building or architectural world ) . Meditate on the metaphor of rooted -- think of a tree which must sink its roots deep into the soil if it is to have nourishment and stability. Then thank God that as believers at the moment of salvation we have been permanently and completely rooted deep into the love of God ! Amazing love , how can it be ? ! Take a moment and read Psalm 1 and the passage in Jeremiah 17 : 5-8 contemplating your having been rooted in love. One of the most important questions a Christian can ask himself is , From Whom do I draw my nourishment and my stability ? If there is to be supernatural , God glorifying , Christ exalting power our Christian life , then there must be depth. The roots must go deeper and deeper into the love of Christ.

The gel contains hormones that encourage the cutting to grow roots. Our gel contain B vitamins , which help reduce stress and wilting and keep the cutting healthy while it roots. Gels coat the stem more completely than powders. If it was necessary to dunk cuttings in a bucket of water , try to shake excess water from the stems before dipping them into the gel.

Whilst Marx lived in poverty , it was a self-inflicted poverty , shunning the need to work for a living so he could write down the philosophy of Marxism. Even after Marx married and had a child , he refused to work and earn an wage to support and feed himself and his wife and child. Marx and his family survived courtesy of the charity of others , especially from Engels and his wealthy family , yet charity is firmly rooted in both Capitalism and Religion , and curiously , this hypocrisy of Marx is conveniently rarely ever mentioned . </root.v.3451><root.v.3452>Insert the cuttings vertically , 5 cm ( 2 inches ) apart in a moist , free draining , rooting compost with extra coarse grit added.

When you cut the offset , the more area that is cut , the more roots that will be produced. Most offsets are attached to the main plant by a narrow attachment point , instead of the width of the entire offset. By making another larger cut on the offset you can get at least 5 times the roots. This larger cut also has a larger wound to heal , so it is better to get used to rooting offsets before you try this.

The parallels between punk and alternative are so similar that the distinction between them is somewhat vague. Punk was originally a type of rebellion from the mainstream school of musical thought. It emphasized the rebellious side of music , with angry lyrics , and aggressive , quick-tempoed guitar onslaughts. The ideals of punk seemed truly alternative to the mainstream. Even the style of dress taken on by the punk scene was a rebellion , with its metallic trappings and mohawks. As McKenzie Wark , a professor and author , explains it , " The punks took the media technology of the time , the music , the fashion , the radio and video , and trashed it.

Whether young or old , everyone knows the classics of animated movies such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) , Fantasia ( 1940 ) or The Jungle Book ( 1967 ) . Still , only very few people realize how the images of these movies are deeply rooted in European art and literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the juxtaposition of original drawings , paintings , figure models and film clips produced by the early Walt Disney Studio ( 1928-1967 ) , with paintings and sculptures by German Romantics , French Symbolists , Victorians or Surrealists , the exhibition reveals concrete relations between popular and high culture , between literature and film , as well as between American and European art . </root.v.3473><root.v.3474>As odd as it may sound , not only does the material dimension receive its vitality and existence from the sefirot , but the spiritual dimension does too.

In the long hours of silence and solitude in the Eifel meadows where she minded the cattle , she became increasingly aware of the presence of the One who was calling her to his service.

The Lebanese people are still facing the challenge of establishing a state that transcends confessionalism. Azmi Bishara , a prominent Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset , captured the dynamic upon leaving Beirut after paying his condolences to the Hariri family and meeting with a wide range of Lebanese political figures. Bishara was dismayed to discover that Lebanon , despite mounting a dramatic and media-savvy movement for sovereignty , remains a country whose political system lacks formal definition , whose cosmopolitan politicians are rooted in a feudal era despite speaking a post-modern language , and whose greatest problems emanate not from external enemies but rather from chronic internal structural imbalances. Lebanese do indeed " want to be free , " but freedom from Syrian occupation has prompted a poignant acknowledgement of the continued constraints on Lebanon 's quest to define itself . </root.v.3537><root.v.3538>This beautiful column was originally from the Andes Mountains of northwestern Argentina.

Submergent plants , which are also firmly rooted in the soil , have leaves that remain below the surface of the water; they include elodea ( Elodea canadensis ) and eelgrass ( Vallisneria americana ) . The third category , floaters , includes plants that freely float on the open surface of the water though they may have been rooted in the soil as seedlings.

When we realize our dual nature continues to exist after salvation , we gain an awareness of how to cope ( or battle ) the duality of our nature through instructions written in God 's love letters. We simply have to learn how to cope with our opposing nature through the progression God intended from eternity past , by reading Gods ' Word , and praise and worship through prayer.

Woody overwintering stems send out new vines at nodes during the growing season , whereas the non-woody " green " stems and leaves crumble to mulch at the end of the growing season. Stem nodes are the source of all vines. Nodes develop rootlets , become rooted nodes , then develop into crowns attached to carrot-like roots. All of the horizontally-oriented stems in the diagram lie at the surface of the ground , and all of the vertically-oriented lines below them are rootlets or roots growing into the ground. For example , the features labeled ( A ) , ( B ) , ( C ) , and ( D ) , are all at ground level. Some mistakenly state that kudzu has rhizomes. However , all kudzu stems begin above ground so they are not " rhizomes " but can be referred to as " stolons " . Roots can weigh hundreds of pounds , and reach depths of a dozen feet in Asia , but they have less spectacular weights and depths in the United States. Kudzu has only been in the United States for about a century , whereas plants in Asia can be hundreds of years old.

Walking , playing and mowing will compact the soil further and thus stress the turfgrass. Raindrops and irrigation further compacts the soil reducing the large air spaces where roots readily grow. Compaction is greater on heavy clay soils than on sandy soils and it is greatest in the upper 1 to 1 inches of soil. Aeration can help relieve soil compaction thus allowing your grass to grow deeper roots and make better use of both water and fertilizer.The root system of your lawn is constantly attempting to renew itself by forming and sending out new shoots. This new growth is more extensive in loose open soil. In clay soils or heavy compacted soil , new roots will stay near the soil surface. if there is a thatch build up and the soil is hard , new roots mat remain in the thatch layer. This produces a lawn that dries out quickly and accumulates thatch at an accelerated rate compared to a lawn that is deeply rooted . </root.v.3592><root.v.3593>When you say grab aggro , do you mean he will switch and beat on the rooted mob , or that the rooted mob will beat on him ?

How does this technique work ? ( I know it 's a well-established , age-old thing. I 'm just wondering about the science behind it . ) </root.v.3594><root.v.3595>Depth of rooting can be controlled to a considerable extent by the use of cover crops or by intercropping. If the surface soil is depleted of its moisture by absorption , roots of both crops penetrate deeper. The effect that one kind of plant may have upon the root habit of another by modifying soil conditions is well illustrated in the case of chaparral and Monterey pine at Carmel , Cal. Here , the trees growing in an open stand among the shrubs died when the latter were cleared away. However , a new growth of pine flourished on the same area. The chaparral had shaded the soil and lessened evaporation from its surface , and the dense layers of rootlets and accumulated humus held the moisture in the surface soil. Consequently , the trees were shallow rooted and died of drought when the protecting cover was removed and the soil desiccated. Seedling trees in the changed habitat evidently rooted more deeply. 30 </root.v.3595><root.v.3596>Oasis Foam is my favourite medium because it is so airy and quick to dry , and it has the added bonus of having a neutral pH balance.

I fill the container with well-draining potting soil and make a small round opening in the center with my fingers. I then put the cutting in so that the bottom two or three inches of the cutting are beneath the soil line and fill in the hole with remaining potting soil and press down firmly to eliminate any air pockets and to hold the cutting in place. I then water each newly planted cutting with water which has a small amount of Start added , which has Vitamin B-1 in it as well as some rooting hormones and Yucca extract , to ease transplant shock. If you don ' t have Start in your area , the B-1 that Home Depot and other chain stores carry will work just as well. Superthrive is also used for this purpose. I then put the cutting on some hot concrete in full sun if it is spring , summer , or fall. If it is wintertime , I put it in the warm greenhouse . </root.v.3601><root.v.3602>It would appear from this passage that the church at Corinth was observing , in some fashion , both the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Otherwise , it would make no sense for Paul to use these analogies to Gentile believers. Paul later notes that the Sabbath and Holy Days are shadows pointing to Christ. Therefore some Christian teachers and groups have concluded that the annual Biblical Holy Days are relevant to Gentile Christians as well as Messianic Jews. And they observe them , not necessarily with specific Jewish customs , but as Christian celebrations rooted in the Bible , that teach and remind observers about the plan of salvation through the Blood of the ultimate Lamb , Jesus Christ . </root.v.3602><root.v.3603>When people first began to write down the practices of Ayurveda it was written on to palm leaves and then later on people began to write it down on to manuscripts.

The lack of attention of female aggression , as opposed to male aggression , has been suggested to be rooted in scholarly debates on nature , culture , and gender in which " sameness " or " differences " are key issues; but actually result from a reluctance to consider similarities between men and women , as opposed to differences ( Fry &amp;Gabriel , 1994 ) . Thus it is not surprising that domestic violence against women , as opposed to men , is a socially acceptable concern and receives study and support. This reinforces two more easily recognized social stereotypes , female vulnerability and male authority or dominance , and protectiveness. The admission and recognition of male victimization , in the battered husband , is the antithesis of this acceptable order and an equality between the sexes that has been resisted historically , especially by men ( e.g. , see judgments in the Willan vs. Willan and Teal vs. Teal cases , Bates , 1981 ) . </root.v.3609><root.v.3610>In Western society , many people tend to think of God and theology in legalistic terms. We may encounter those who think that God is an angry Judge waiting to punish them for breaking His laws. Contemporary movies and television programs have contributed the erroneous popular vision of God , judgment , Heaven , and hell. American misconceptions regarding hell likely find root , directly or indirectly , in the picture presented in Dante Alighieri ' s Divine Comedy and religious ideas generally present in Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Within the Orthodox Way , however , theological understanding is primarily rooted in the Inexhaustible Love of God. By teaching the true Orthodox vision of the Kingdom of Heaven and hell , inasmuch as we can comprehend it , within a culture that tends to compartmentalize knowledge and disconnect theological ideas from every-day life , we can help people to acquire an understanding that fits harmoniously within the whole Orthodox theological worldview , embodied in the comprehensive spiritual life of the Church . </root.v.3610><root.v.3611>Considering the fact that the identity of the people of Ghana is rooted in their cultural heritage , as expressed by all the people interviewed and by the Project Management , traditional governance would find a niche in the general governance structure of the people of Africa.

For most people , at our present level of consciousness and evolution , this mainspring is conscious even though its consequences and results may not be , as they could be the opposite of what is being desired and sought ! Generally speaking , we use the words su cc ess , happiness , personal fulfillment and pleasure or joy to describe what drives and motivates us.

Layering - While not a commercial method of propagating rhododendrons , this can be a method for a gardener to grow an additional plant exactly like the parent plant. This is a another form of vegetative propagation. Simply pull a low limb of the plant down onto the ground , wound or notch the bottom side , cover it with loose soil mix and weight it down with a rock. It will take at least a year and possibly two before the limb is sufficiently rooted to be cut from the plant , though some evergreen azaleas root faster.

According to Roediger , European-American workers " created " their " white " identity as a response to a fear of dependency on wage labor and to the necessities of capitalist work discipline. " 65 Artisans ' " revolutionary pride " and fear of being reduced to a dependent status as wage-laborers for capitalists was expressed in " white republican equalitarianism. " Unskilled immigrants ' nostalgia for the halcyon life in their homelands , found solace in " white identity , " which made them " free citizens , " shielded from being compared to " slaves. " A sort of Freudian , rather than Du Boisian , " psychological wage " was provided for the European-American laboring people , according to David , in the form of release from sexual repression by projecting their sexual fantasies onto African-Americans , most commonly in blackface minstrel shows , but also on occasion in sadistic behavior toward Black people. Even in his somewhat self-critical " Afterword " in the second edition of Wages , David still " decidely argue [ s ] that white identity has it roots both in domination and in a desire to avoid confronting one 's own miseries.

With America drinking it all in and taking the lead , " civilized " nations swallowed the Romans ' doctrine of love , digested it into her religious system , namely Christianity , and exported it with the Gospel as a total package for living. Alas , wherever the Gospel went , the whole package was received and swallowed without question as total Gospel truth. Thus the true Biblical Gospel which God has ordained to be rooted in the Middle Eastern patriarchal culture is deceptively suppressed and replaced with one that is adulterated by a heathen Roman culture. There will always be some tolerable societal differences in all parts of the world , but the ways of God were defined and taught in the Biblical patriarchal setting of our forefathers where polygamy was not just tolerated , but accepted. But the western Gospel is romantically and not patriarchally inclined , thus it is actually not just anti-polygamy but also in truth , anti-patriarchy. This is why the Old Testament seems to contain many passages of polygamy and patriarchy that can not be expounded by western Protestant Christianity and this is where her blindness and powerlessness lie . </root.v.3621><root.v.3622>*There are psychosomatic diseases where our thinking does affect our bodies , but there are also viral diseases that are rooted biologically.

They are like trees planted along the riverbank , bearing fruit each season without fail. Their leaves never wither , and in all they do , they prosper. And in Psalm 52 we get the picture of sturdy contentment that results from a life that is faithfully rooted and drawing up nourishment from God : Psalm 52 : 8-9 says , I am like an olive tree , thriving in the house of God.

Why the " battered husband syndrome " is so belittled and considered a non-social problem can be found in the patriarchal ethos that reinforces female victimization. By rooting the debate on domestic violence only in notions such as gender and physical size or strength , rather than the inherent attitudes and propensity of individuals to use violence and abuse as an interrelational strategy , female victimization will continue as will the unseen victimization of some men both inside and outside the home. The fact that so many in society , including some academics , are so unwilling to accept the unilateral battering of men by women stems , in large part , from the deep and profoundly disturbing challenge such a fact poses to cherished male and female stereotypes . </root.v.3665><root.v.3666>Acclimation of the newly-rooted plants should be done gradually.

It strove to bring happiness to all humanity and to wipe feudalism completely out of the world. The world wars of Napoleon had no deliberate nationalistic purpose. There was even no indication of any desire to oppress foreign nationalities , root out their languages , smooth out their differences or establish uniformity in their customs. No , the youthful bourgeoisie dealt disinterestedly indeed with the differences that existed among the subject peoples. On the contrary , wherever he went , he merely overthrew the dynasty and permitted the people to retain their independence. ( It is well known that Napoleon often depended for support in his campaigns , upon the oppressed nationalities while he simultaneously attacked their oppressors. According to certain date , he even planned to restore Palestine to the Jews. ) But the wave of nationalism which swept over Europe finally washed away even this sign of cosmopolitanism which Napoleon had manifested . </root.v.3668><root.v.3669>Some plants , like Mother-in-Laws Tongue have no real leaf stalk and must be propagated by cutting the leaf into sections.

It becomes evident as we go through the scriptures and find in them various stories related to the libidinous activities of various gods and goddesses. While on the one hand we have an established school of opinion that considers celibacy as a great virtue and a necessary condition for liberation , on the other we have stories from the Hindu Puranas which depict the sexual exploits of gods and goddesses and the odd situations that develop out of them . </root.v.3670><root.v.3671>" The thinking man must oppose all cruel customs no matter how deeply rooted in tradition or surrounded by a halo ...

In may ways , it is as if they are striking out , trying to hit anything , but not sure exactly what their target is. Even in their quarrels , they do not appear to be particularly effective because they are not sure exactly what it is that they are battling against. The problem is that the cause of such discord is rooted much deeper than any of the parties involved realise , and they are merely fighting the symptoms of a much greater issue. The only way that you can resolve this issue is to undertake a deep analysis of the situation to try to ascertain exactly when and where the crises actually began.

The cuttings will need to be treated with a rooting hormone and placed in a sand or vermiculite medium. For watering , use an intermittent misting system. If you are talking about just pruning the plants , there are a couple of options.

Dig the hole twice as large as the plant 's roots. Its width is more important that the depth to allow for root expansion. Keep the sides rough to allow roots easier access to the surrounding soil. Water the hole and allow it drain before planting. If staking is required place the stake in the hole before planting , so roots will not be damaged. Keep plant roots moist before planting. Trim any broken roots with sharp secateurs. Place the plant at the same depth as it originally grew. Spread roots out well , preferable over a mound in the bottom of the hole.

As I have tried to show here , these are three distinct entities , albeit closely interrelated. Judaism is the Covenant between God and the people of Israel which the Torah substantiates. Zionism is the movement for Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. It is Judaicaily justifiable when it roots itself in God 's promise of the Land of Israel to the elect people of Israel , and when it enhances the unique opportunity Jews have to serve God most fully in the Land of Israel. Messianism is the hope for God 's final redemption of the people of Israeland along with them all of humankind. And it is Judaicaily justifiable when it roots itself in God 's ultimate , eschatological promise , and when it does not see itself as Zionism 's inevitable outcome. Thus both Zionism and Messianism are rooted in Judaism , but they are rooted in it quite differently . </root.v.3692><root.v.3693>Taking cuttings. The first step is to take a healthy cutting.

They constitute in fact , if not initially in theory , a power above society. As Lenin put it , " the essence of bureaucracy " is " privileged persons divorced from the masses and superior to the masses. " [ Op. Cit. , p. 360 ] In the words of Malatesta , a " government , that is a group of people entrusted with making laws and empowered to use the collective power to oblige each individual to obey them , is already a privileged class and cut off from the people. As any constituted body would do , it will instinctively seek to extend its powers , to be beyond public control , to impose its own policies and to give priority to its special interests. Having been put in a privileged position , the government is already at odds with the people whose strength it disposes of.

NIV Do you wonder why the book of Hebrews solemnly admonishes us to go on to perfection , becoming rooted and grounded ? It is because immature spiritual life will eventually die. It can not last ! The person with no roots will fall away , and the cause of their falling is their lack of deep roots. Matthew says of such a person , but endures only for a while ( Matt 13 : 21 ) .

Levi-Strauss calls this approach " structural " . He finds sympathy with Propp 's " Morphology " rather than with the Marxist view. " Propp pays attention to the sequence organization of all elements in the narrative. Levi-Strauss throws this requirement to the wind and transforms that weakness into an apparent strength by making it central to the methodology of structuralism " . In short : instead of a formal organization of sequence in a linear chronological ordering like Propp 's model , Levi-Strauss pleads for structural composition. His structural anthropology is rooted on the most important premise : phenomenal realities , including cultural artifacts , are always reducible to a common infrastructure. The root for this universal collective and hidden reality is called " the unconscious brain " . This unconsciousness manifests its power not through class-struggle , but rather in a " gift " , i.e. a way of integrating the opposition between self and other. Therefore there are three principles of the unconscious : </root.v.3706><root.v.3707>Drain the basil and select a few stems for your cuttings. Will you root them in water or in potting soil ?

Only stems with diameters between 1 and 3 inches are used. Stems are cut into lengths of 1 to 3 feet , depending on how the materials will be used. It is important to select the appropriate cutting length. Stems that are too short will affect the success of the project , and cuttings that are too long will increase the costs of the project. During collection , basal ends of the cuttings are always oriented in the same direction to assure that the buds will be aligned. This will help avoid confusion later when the stakes are being installed. Finding the orientation of the buds is often difficult ( Figure 10.108 ) and having to reorient in the field takes time. As individual stakes are made , the top of the stake is cut flat , while the basal end is cut at an angle ( Figure 10.109 ) . This makes the stake easier to insert into the soil and orients the live stake so the buds are facing up and away from the soil surface. If buds are facing down , the live stake will not root . </root.v.3709><root.v.3710>I ' m interested in rooting , but cant afford making any mistakes.

That is the Biblical principle established in Ecclesiastes 3 : 2 there is a time and a season to everything. There is a time to plant. In such a manner , the New Testament church was planted throughout the New Testament Church Age , and there is a time to pluck up that which has been planted.

For example , obtaining perennial ryegrass or fine fescue sod will be difficult , perhaps impossible , in most areas of the region. If these species are desired in the lawn , seeding is the only way to establish them. In addition , soil incompatibility sometimes develops when sod is grown on soil that is different from that of the lawn area. Soil incompatibility can result in poorly rooted sod that has little tolerance to environmental or pest stresses. Thus , in many situations , the advantages of seeding may outweigh the advantages of sodding . </root.v.3713><root.v.3714>Many houseplants reproduce by sending out runners or shoots.

All types can be increased by cuttings taken in May or June from half-hardened shoots of the current season 's growth. Use a rooting mix of two parts sand and one part peat and a rooting hormone ( available at garden centers ) . Supply high humidity , warmth and light in order for the cuttings to root within four to five weeks. The large-flowered hybrids will take more time to root; if cuttings are taken in May , they may not root until late August. If rooted by early August , plant them out. If no rooting occurs until late August , hold plants over winter in pots and plant in early spring. Layering is the easier method and can be done in the fall. Choose a mature stem produced earlier in the season , or from the previous season 's growth. Secure it into the soil at the nodes or bury a pot containing a mixture of equal parts sand and peat and secure the stem into this.

In the first four talks I may seem to have taken for granted that religion is about conscious relationship to God , and that the main moral issue to be discussed is the relation between the will of God and human decision-making in morals. My general argument has been that religious morality does not primarily consist in the revelation of new and specific moral rules - we have a natural knowledge of right and wrong without religion. The idea of God provides a transcendental dimension to morality - it roots morality in an objective reality of supreme goodness , love of which can motivate us to greater moral effort , and encourage us to hope for the eventual realisation of universal human fulfilment . </root.v.3743><root.v.3744>Leaf sections. This method is frequently used with snake plant and fibrous rooted begonias. Cut begonia leaves into wedges with at least one vein. Lay leaves flat on the medium. A new plant will grow at the vein. Cut snake plant leaves into 2-inch sections. Consistently make the lower cut slanted and the upper cut straight so you can tell which is the top. Insert the cutting vertically. Roots will form fairly soon , and eventually a new plant will appear at the base of the cutting. These and other succulent cuttings will rot if kept too moist . </root.v.3744><root.v.3745>Clean , coarse , construction-grade sand may be used for rooting cuttings.

Once the diver enters the area and removes a plant the disturbed silt may make visibility next to impossible. Marking the spot with a buoy or a long stake helps the diver locate the exact spot later when the silt settles. Milfoil fragments can be wind blown into very shallow water and hide behind logs , sticks , rocks or shore grass. In the case of a large pioneer infestation , it is advisable to have someone on the surface in a canoe , kayak or small boat , catching any escaping fragments as the divers dig up plants. Note of the wind direction should be made as wind direction may indicate the next place one will find new plants . </root.v.3750><root.v.3751>Our present day occult revival is firmly rooted within these teachings.

The inexperienced person is best advised to place the cuttings in direct light which has been shaded with a commercial grade shade cloth every day until rooted.

Insert the plantlet stalk into the potting mix so that the plantlet sits on the surface of the growing medium. Water the pot and cover with plastic to maintain a high level of humidity. Roots should develop in about three weeks. Propagation is best carried out between mid-spring and late summer. Some plantlets may be rooted while still attached to the parent. In this case , the plantlets are layered into pots of growing medium and once they have rooted , the stems or stolons can be severed and the plantlets separated from the parent.

As John Phelan , in his book , The Hispanization of the Philippines , remarked , the decentralization of Philippine society clashed with one tradition deeply rooted in Spanish culture. As the heirs of Greco-Roman urbanism , the Spaniards instinctively identified civilization with the city , whose origins go back to the polis of ancient Greece . For the Spaniards , man was not only a rational animal gifted with the capacity to receive grace. He was also a social animal living in communion with his fellowmen. It was only through his daily contact with other men that he might hope to achieve a measure of his potentiality. The Spanish chroniclers endlessly repeated that the Filipinos lived without polity , sin policia , and for them that term was synonymous with barbarism. </root.v.3791><root.v.3792>One night , Juliette has a dream in which she 's woken by the smell of smoke and goes downstairs to find a veiled woman dressed in black , who tells her that she must now explore the dark side of her nature.

The dreams express Juliette 's subconscious thoughts -- the belief that she is somehow symbolically representative of the whole Earth , and images of a lover whom she both admires and fears. She knows that her dream lover wishes to become rooted to the Earth through her , and that she is being manipulated into this position; but she loves her duty nonetheless.

In contrast to the succulents ' shallow-rooted , rapid-response strategy , a substantial rain is required to wet the deeper root zone of shrubs and trees.

It takes a couple of weeks for dormant shrubs such as brittlebush ( Encelia farinosa ) and creosote bush ( Larrea tridentata ) to produce new roots and leaves and resume full metabolic activity after a soaking rain. The tradeoff between this strategy and that of succulents is that once the deeper soil is wetted , it stays moist much longer than the surface layer; the deeper moisture sustains growth of shrubs and trees for several weeks . </root.v.3807><root.v.3808>It can be rooted copied and duped .there is no such thing as security It all comes down if enough people want it to </root.v.3808><root.v.3809>Before inserting any cuttings into the striking medium , it may be beneficial to bathe them in a mixture of water and a fungicide which will reduce any chance of botrytis which is caused by insufficient air circulation within the propagator.

Philosophy , to us , means the inquiry after knowledge of things knowable and thinkable; while Metaphysical means the attempt to carry the inquiry over and beyond the boundaries and into regions unknowable and unthinkable , and with the same tendency as that of Theology.

If you switch their locations around then they would be very appreciative ( they may survive now but they would have a difficult time of it ) . Having said that , the vast majority of middle-of-the road requirement trees would appreciate this sort of amendment. The most important thing to be aware of when planting ( especially in clay ) is to make certain that you don ' t change the soil in the area around the new plant too much so that it will root into the undisturbed soil without difficulty . </root.v.3844><root.v.3845>African violets and bush-type peperomias are propagated from the whole leaf , that is , the blade ( the flat part of the leaf ) plus the petiole ( the leaf stalk ) . Break off a robust leaf , trim the petiole so it is no more than an inch long , apply rooting hormone , and sink the petiole into the rooting mix. The base of the leaf blade should just touch the mix ( Figure 12 ) . Place the pot in a plastic bag in a bright spot. In a few weeks roots will form and new plantlets will develop from these roots. When they are large enough to handle , gently divide them , making sure each plantlet has roots , and plant in individual containers. A single leaf will give rise to several small plantlets ( Figure 13 ) . </root.v.3845><root.v.3846>The governments simply declared the " new structure " , even making it mandatory. In doing so , however , they did not expand the school networks and did not raise the numbers of the teachers. In the name of establishing a , new system the administration ruined the existing secondary schools. The secondary schools were rooted in the prewar period and already were accepted by families. Those schools and their faculties had already suffered an earlier reorganization ( the creation of the general schools ) and could hardly cope with it . </root.v.3846><root.v.3847>Always use fresh medium. If you decide to use bark , put the desired amount into a container with hot ( almost boiling ) water and cover. Allow to cool , then drain. This will break the surface tension of the bark and allow water to be absorbed more readily. Charley 's offers several different bark mixes : Fir bark has been the standard potting medium used by orchid hobbyists nationwide for over a quarter of a century. Charley 's Orchid Bark is the same fir bark that is used by leading professional growers. This bark is recommended for all medium to large thick-rooted orchids. Charley 's Premium Seedling Orchid Bark is just the thing you need to get your seedlings , Lady Slippers , and other finely rooted orchids off to a good start. It is made of the same basic ingredients as the premium orchid mix but uses fine fir bark as the base. Our Premium Orchid mixture is fine to medium-sized fir bark combined with 3 perlite and Pro Mix. The Pro Mix has a moistener to keep the bark from drying out , and the perlite provides aeration. Recommended for medium to large sized orchids . </root.v.3847><root.v.3848>Larger quantities of cuttings can be bundled in lots of 50 - 100 and rooted in the 3 : 1 perlite peat mix in benches with bottom heat ( heat cables or hot water pipes ) set at 80 - 85oF ( 25oC ) in the root zone. Ideally , beds should be outdoors or in an unheated , or even refrigerated , room to retard sprouting of the buds while the cuttings callus and root , as in method 2. This reduces the likelihood of shoots that can break off during planting . </root.v.3848><root.v.3849>Tor is a very good example ... not the way you describe it.

While many species of willow will root from a cutting that is not dormant , the chances of success are slim , and only if specific site conditions are met. Dormant materials have the highest probability of growing with the broadest range of site conditions. One of the best indicators of dormancy is when the leaves have turned color , and fall from the twig. The time in which this happens can vary , but as a general rule one should not harvest materials until : </root.v.3852><root.v.3853>Good physical properties of coconut medium , and first of all high water and air volume as well as a stable structure are conducive to the rooting and the development of a big mass of bristles of rose cuttings [ 11 ] . The number of the roots formed is often reversely proportional to their length , and the effect of coconut fibre on this feature is often differentiated and related to the cultivar. According to Winiewska-Grzeszkiewicz and Rejman [ 12 ] , the bedding of cover roses in the coconut medium mixed with high peat ( 1 : 1 , v/v ) has a positive effect on the number of rooted cuttings and the root length. Besides , a relation to the cultivar and the cutting date is also observed . </root.v.3853><root.v.3854>Judaism is the religion of the jews and is older than Christianity.

Getting and staying on track , as well as continuing toward the mark of truth , requires us to be diligent in knowing the Scriptures , being rooted in a genuinely Biblical worldview , as well as understanding how the opposing force is trying to gain ground. Think about the deception in the Garden there was a questioning of God ' s goodness , of what He had said to be Truth , doubting just enough to make a decision against the worldview God had imparted to Adam and Eve.

Then the six paramitas and the bodhisattva action are the reflection in the mirror , since they are all amenable to change and therefore empty of self. The already introduced Chinese term Wu , meaning non , un- , or none , expresses the true nature of the mirror , or its capacity to receive and relinquish all that goes on in front of it without holding on to any part of it. If the paramitas are practiced with the understanding that they are rooted in Emptiness , the great enlightenment can be attained. Non-wisdom is the true wisdom , non-attainment is the true attainment.

So just be patient and if you ' ve already waited a month or two and she hasn ' t sped up try a little fertilizer. Miracid or Miracle Gro work pretty well. The last thing that will inhibit Salvia growth is too small a pot. When I want to grow another plant for myself I usually root the cutting and then put that cutting directly into the pot it will have for a very long time. I may only have a 2 inch tall plant in a foot and a half diameter pot. This will ensure plenty of room for the roots to grow and also so I won ' t have to transplant it.

Epistemologically , it affirms that all knowledge is subjective-objective , is rooted in our embodied experiential encounter in our world , given form through the accounts we give , articulated in our theories and models and expressed in our skilled and aware action in our worlds. Ecologically , it roots human beings again as a part of the natural world. Spiritually , it heals the wounds of alienation. To deny participation not only offends against human justice , not only leads to errors in epistemology , not only strains the limits of the natural world , but is also troublesome for human souls.

Our misting beds are open to the sky and sun but are protected on the sides by a 3-foot high plastic or screen glass wall protection from wind. Otherwise mist could be blown away from cuttings on the windward side. For our own propagation we have been pleased with constant misting. Our air is quite dry and waste water is not a problem.

Beans like warm soil and will not germinate if the soil temperature is below 60 F. Optimum soil temperature range is 65-85 F. You can expect emergence in 8-16 days depending on the variety. In a well worked bed , plant the seeds 2-3 inches apart and 1 inch deep in rows 18-36 inches apart. Thinning is rarely necessary. Beans are relatively light feeders. One cup of our complete fertilizer per 10 row feet will provide adequate nutrition. Excess nitrogen results in excess foliage with poor pod set and delayed maturity. Optimum pH is in the range of 5.5-6.5 , mildly acidic. Beans are shallow rooted and can require up to 1/4 inch of water a day during hot weather.

Thought is strongly rooted in the neurology of the brain , in orientation-sensitive cells , and center-surround receptive fields , the interface of the part with the whole. The sensory-motor system is fundamental in this orienting , as is metaphor which builds our neural maps. This allows sensory-motor structures to play a role in even abstract reasoning . </root.v.3957><root.v.3958>Strong , cohesive communities are the most resistant to messages of hate and violence from political and religious extremists. We will support individuals who make a stand against violent extremism , and we will provide platforms for people to challenge violent extremism with confidence. Labour 's vision remains for a society where people with different faiths and viewpoints can co-exist , and where there is a full role for faith-based organisations in the community.

They go further , to claim that political society and economic society must be rooted in civil society if they are to be democratic spheres of existence. In this model , " political society " refers to the mediating framework of interactions between government and all other social actors , where state represents the formal , over-arching institution of governance. " Economic society " similarly refers to the equivalent mediating framework of interactions between all potential actors in society and economic institutions , where markets are the most common institutions of exchange. In this view , " civil society " then includes " structures of socialization , association , and organized forms of communication of the lifeworld to the extent that these are institutionalized or are in the process of being institutionalized.

When the bulbs have rooted , bring the pots out of cold storage and set them in a bright window in a cool room ( one where the temperature stays below 65 degrees F ) . Bright light will help keep the leaves and flower stems compact; in weak light , they tend to flop. You are likely to find that the bulbs have produced white shoots during cold storage. Sunlight quickly turns them green . </root.v.3967><root.v.3968>To do less damage to your plant when taking cuttings always have a sharp cutting tool. Keep all cuttings and rooting materials as clean as possible to avoid transmitting diseases. Take cuttings in the early morning hours. In dry weather , water the parent plant well the day before so it will be well supplied with water and easier to cut. If you desire a lot of cuttings next year , prune heavily this year for an abundance of new growth for next year 's cuttings. Each plant should be pruned at the proper time . </root.v.3968><root.v.3969>" Back in the 1950s and early 1960s , British family values were still recognisably derived from a great religious tradition rooted in the family-nurturing Abrahamic soil.

If this is well rooted in the liver ( liver blood or liver yin ) , sleep is normal and sound and without too many dreams. If liver yin or liver blood is deficient , the ethereal soul is deprived of its residence and wanders off at night , causing a restless sleep with many tiring dreams.

The first problem is rooting them at all , and the second problem is getting them to break into new growth after they have grown some roots. The general procedure is the same as for evergreen azaleas. The differences start with the cuttings , which should be taken earlier , while the wood is still quite soft and green , usually around late May. They will require the use of a rooting hormone. While a stronger rooting hormone will increase their chances of rooting , it makes it harder to get them to break dormancy and go into active growth . </root.v.3974><root.v.3975>With it , Elliott offers us a revolutionary new theory of health based on breathing for autonomic nervous system balance , autonomic nervous function underlying all aspects of health and well being - body , mind , and spirit.

The emerging medical understanding is that these conditions are rooted in autonomic nervous system imbalance - what has not been understood is the root cause of this imbalance.

You should leave the petiole about one half to one inch long for rooting. When taking the cuttings leave the petiole long until just before you ' re ready to put it in the medium so that the cut is fresh. Leaving the petiole too long won ' t hurt anything.

The simple greatness of Peter Waldes must have been enormously influential in organising the communities of the poor of Lyon , as well as his triumphs during his travels along the Rhine and to Bohemia. The formation of Waldensian communities in central Austria , in Pomerania , and in Brandenburg , show that his demand for freedom to teach the gospels had struck a bright chord from the ancient German heartstrings. Now it had taken a firm root in men ' s souls and could no longer be rooted out. It was the same demand which was raised by Peter of Bruys , Henry of Cluny and Arnold of Brescia.

He used dreams and their subsequent interpretations to bring subconscious conflict to the forefront. The author succinctly describes the role of dreams in psychoanalysis; however , more recent evidence refuting Freud 's claims is rather interesting. The proliferation of psychotherapy in the modern day has brought controversial and unsettling issues under close scrutiny. The ability of therapists to strongly influence patients ' memories has been supported in numerous studies. Loftus ( 1993a , 1993b , 1995 ) has also shown in many studies that memories are often reconstructed and that the therapist aids in the construction process through such avenues as dream interpretation and hypnosis. The question of whether dreams are a reliable source of information has been refuted by most in the field; yet , patients continue to reconstruct memories with the aid of therapists.

A cutting is a vegetative plant part which is severed from the parent plant in order to regenerate itself , thereby forming a whole new plant. Take cuttings with a sharp blade to reduce injury to the parent plant. Dip the cutting tool in rubbing alcohol or a mixture of one part bleach to nine parts water to prevent transmitting diseases from infected plant parts to healthy ones. Remove flowers and flower buds to allow the cutting to use its energy and stored carbohydrates for root and shoot formation rather than fruit and seed production. With large-leaved cuttings ( i.e. , Rhododendron ) and limited space in the propagation container , trimming up to half the leaf length can improve efficiency , as well as light and air circulation for all the cuttings. To hasten rooting , increase the number of roots , or to obtain uniform rooting ( except on soft , fleshy stems ) , use a rooting hormone , preferably one containing a fungicide. Prevent possible contamination of the entire supply of rooting hormone by putting some hormone in a separate container for dipping cuttings. Discard this hormone after all the cuttings are treated . </root.v.4010><root.v.4011>However , Protestantism represents just one of it 's horns.

Thread-like rootlets spring from various points in the bark of the stem , and from confused lumps of callus where the stem has been wounded , but there are no main roots and no root system. The new plant lives only by a makeshift arrangement. Yet it must keep two kinds of sap moving to their proper destinations , and without the help of specialized crown cells. There is no crown. To convert the base of the stem into a crown , the new plant will first have to tear down the cell structure already there , then substitute for it a set of entirely new tissues.

Hardwood cuttings take longer than other cuttings to ' take ' , but are the easiest of all cuttings as they need no looking after. Hardwood cuttings should always have all the leaves removed. I like to cut the base of the cutting flat ( horizontal ) and the top of the cutting at an angle. This is not only to help prevent water sitting on top of the cutting , but also to remember which end is which.

For the great Sufis , the divine love exemplified in Yunus ' extraordinary character is rooted in the understanding that it is the Creator offering Himself to Himself.

Many conifers , houseplants and some deciduous plants are started from cuttings. Cuttings should be collected from healthy plants from strongly growing branches. Softwood cuttings are the tips of new growth collected in late spring and summer. Softwood cuttings usually root better but they need more care. Hardwood cuttings are collected in the fall and winter. They will root better if they are pulled off so a heel of two year old wood adheres to the base of the cutting. Otherwise , cut the bottom off just below a node. Usually , cuttings are trimmed so they are three to six inches long . </root.v.4045><root.v.4046>We repeat selection for the tree rooted with the root 2 ( Figure 6D ) and compare the results by calculating the number of paralogs resulting in two different runs.

While the Enneagram focuses on " self-improvement " via human understanding , the Catholic focuses on his or her littleness , weakness and total dependence on God 's Grace. Catholic " self-improvement " means " intimate union with Christ " - the more in union we are with Him the more holy we are. In other words , dying to self , decreasing so that God may increase within us. The support and action of God via His Grace is totally missing from the Enneagram. Great spiritual works by St. John of the Cross ( Ascent of Mt. Carmel and Dark Night of the Soul ) emphasize properly the top place that God has in our " self-improvement " towards holiness. The Enneagram is totally self-centered - that is based on pure human ego. As with other dissenter systems , holiness is also completely absent from the Enneagram , which instead focuses on ego and compulsions. Also noticeably absent is the need for the Sacraments of the Church on the path to holiness.

For instance , a growing trend among writers of self-help books is to base their ideas on the theory of " evolutionary psychology , " which assumes that human emotions are rooted in our supposed animal ancestry. The truth is , any effort to find happiness that is based on a theory that ignores the role of our Creator can not be valid and will ultimately lead to disappointment.

Cuttings should be about 4 inches long and may be rooted in any pasteurized media. The use of rooting compounds will increase the percentage of cuttings that will root and the rate of rooting. Place the pots where humidity is high. A terrarium or similar structure with high humidity is an ideal location for raising poinsettias. The leaves on the cuttings should not wilt. To prevent this , reduce the amount of leafy surface by cutting some basal leaves in half -- shading the cuttings. The more light the cuttings can be exposed to without wilting , the more rapidly the rooting and the more vigorous the rooted cutting. Keep the medium moist but not saturated with water. Air temperature of about 70 degrees F by day and 60 degrees F by night is best for rooting. Cuttings will root in about three to four weeks. Further treatment of the rooted cuttings is the same as for plants bought from commercial sources . </root.v.4063><root.v.4064>Post planting careWater the tree regularly for at least six weeks after planting.

If these are not visible , test one or two cuttings by gently taking hold of the stem and apply light pressure. It they move leave them a little longer. It is very important indeed not to leave the cuttings too long in the propagator after they have rooted. This will induce elongation and lush growth.

It is about the desire to think and act in certain ways , most of which are rooted in a conscious refusal to engage with processes of inner reflection. The problem is that some pedagogical strategies try to anticipate what students need to know , as if teachers have already solved their own contradictory relationship with learning. The result is that teachers create ( if not imagine ) an ideal student and then make judgements about the students who are unable to attain the standards set by their instructional methods. If there is to be some equality of exchange here , then the teacher has to be learning nearly all of the time. This can then set the stage for some linkage and visibility between the foundational assumptions of the instructor and her own past , as well as her own history of learning. This may then return the teacher to a closer understanding of what it means to be a student . </root.v.4076><root.v.4077>Many tree cultivars in the northern half of the US are bud grafted; this is less common in the southern half of the US.

Thus historical typology freezes into personification , an endlessly replayed battle of virtues and vices. Unlike their science-fictional works , those novels of the Strugatskys that gravitate to allegory do not use the format of " future history.

While cuttings can be taken any time of the year , we have found that cuttings taken during the fall and winter root slower. Therefore , it ' s best to make propagation cuttings in the spring and summer. We have also found that it is helpful to take cuttings under low ambient light to keep the leaf stoma closed and leaf turgor high. To take a cutting for propagation purposes , prepare a rooting vase filled with room temperature purified water and place this next to the mother plant. Use sharp scissors or a blade to remove a length of stem that contains at least two leaf nodes. Vigorous new tip growth is the best , but mid-stem segments will also root. Make your cutting just below a leaf node. Remove all leaves below the uppermost node and then immediately place the cutting in the waiting vase. Then , return your attention to the cut stem of the mother plant. Cut it back to just above the highest remaining node . </root.v.4095><root.v.4096>Root lenght density in average over rooted zone was found to be low compared to the data found in literature for grass swards ( De Willigen and Van Noordwijk , 1987 ) .For white clover high number of nodes must to be establish in first part of growing season and than in moist late summer strong adventitious roots could be developed.

Colossians 2 : 5-8 </root.v.4097><root.v.4098>It is necessary , however , to go one step further , because not everybody accepts the invitation to come to the Lord 's Table. Sadly , not all Christians live in eucharistic fellowship with one another , and the vast majority of people of other faiths do not and will not accept the invitation when it is extended to them. So , while the Eucharist shapes us for sensitive witness and inter-faith cooperation , we need an even wider spirituality , which roots us in solidarity with humanity as a whole and with the created universe . </root.v.4098><root.v.4099>Best Location - Overhead dappled light for most of the day is ideal for large , smooth-leafed forms. Scaly- leafed alpine forms and deciduous azaleas need more sun. Choose the north side of the house , fence or other plantings , where they will get good early morning light from the east , shade from the south during mid day , both summer and winter , and with wind screening on the west and north west. The best companion trees are pines and oaks which are deep rooted and do not compete with surface feeding rhododendrons. Their annual leaf shed also provides excellent mulch which , in turn , decays to create acidic compost . </root.v.4099><root.v.4100>Take a look at a young tree which has yet to grow branches. Every branch which will grow from this tree is part of the tree itself. The branches can not secede from the tree.

Similarly every Jew is a branch of the tree which is the Jewish People. We are all bound by the acceptance of Torah because our potential to exist was already rooted in our forefathers . </root.v.4100><root.v.4101>As a test for rooting roses , I took several Knockout rose cuttings.

Once the cutting is taken , allow it to dry out for a day or two. To enhance rooting success , use a rooting hormone powder. Place the cuttings in a tray filled with river sand and place the tray in a cold frame or in a cool , slightly shaded area. Keep the tray damp but not wet.

Almost any type of clean container can be used for the rooting of cuttings. The container should be a minimum of 3 inches deep and may be up to 6 inches deep. The container should be cleaned and sterilized. The best method of doing this is to use one part household bleach and nine parts of water , i. e. one pint of bleach and nine pints ( 1-1/8 gallons ) of water . It is best to wash the container well and then soak it in the bleach mixture for 30 minutes to one hour. After soaking , let the container dry thoroughly before using. The most widely used container for rooting cuttings is the flat. Both wood and plastic flats have been used successfully. Other containers that can be used are clay and plastic pots , hanging baskets and almost any container that is clean , sterilized , and of the proper depth . </root.v.4106><root.v.4107>Not the prettiest pruning job ( below ) but it was cold and I had to use a hatchet to separate out the new starts as the upper half of the soil was frozen solid.

As it is I only had enough soil ( I used a 1/3 topsoil 2/3 peat moss mixture ) to do 3 of the 6 buckets. I will probably wait till next winter to do the other three.

Choose an area that has deep soil , because grapes root deeply and need 3-5 feet for root development. Well-drained soil is also important , along with soil that is not too fertile. Avoid soils that contain high salts. Site preparation should be done in August-September or before wet , freezing weather has set in. You want to have your planting area ready for final preparations in the spring before your plants arrive. Install an irrigation system , preferably before planting , so that you can start watering the plants right away . </root.v.4111><root.v.4112>" Then came the disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , when they heard this saying ? But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up. Let them alone : they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch. " Matt. 15 : 12-14 . </root.v.4112><root.v.4113>It is hard to die. We know that little trees do not strike their roots deep into the earth , and therefore they can not stand long; so it is with all humble hearts , who do not take deep root in earth , but in heaven. But the great trees which have waxed high , and are intended to endure long upon the earth , these strike their roots deep , and spread them out wide into the soil. So it is with the men who in old times and now at this present have been great upon earth; they must needs through many a struggle and death die unto themselves , before all the self-sufficiency of their heart can be broken down , and they can be surely and firmly rooted for ever in humility. It does however happen sometimes that the Holy Spirit finds easier ways than those of which we have spoken , whereby He brings such souls to Himself . </root.v.4113><root.v.4114>With so much time on our hands in the tribulation , there 's no reason why we could n't reap additional benefits by replanting some vegetables in the cellar , after the winter temperatures become too hazardous for their outdoor existence. Of course , do n't replant them in the hardened soil floor , but in cases filled with sand or loose soil. This will keep some rooted vegetables for up to one month longer.

Susan and her 2 children , Erica and Kurt , live at Tap Root Too . This residence was built in 2004 on top of the hill across Clovercroft Road from the original farm house. This home was built to bring the outside in while utilizing the materials from the farm to construct the residency. The windows allow a clear view of many miles of Williamson County scenery. The screened porch and patios are perfect settings for the best memory-making events. The kitchen and great room cabinets are a mixture of cherry and walnut harvested from the farm. The large rock fireplace and rock walls are made from the limestone gathered while clearing the fields for pasture and from a slave fence on the farm. The study houses the red wool rug that was a part of the negotiated purchase of Tap Root Farm in 1961. Tap Root Too is built of the land , stands overlooking the original farm and is rooted in the heritage of Tap Root Farm . </root.v.4116><root.v.4117>This is exactly what we read in John 15 when a man is not abiding in Christ , he is as a branch that is withered and is good for nothing but to be burned. Likewise , this is the final end of the tares. When they are rooted up , they are rooted up for burning. They will be put into bundles to be burned , pointing to the awful judgment of God and the fires of Hell that await each and every unsaved person who has sought to escape the judgment of God by fleeing to the cover of the name Christian. They have sought to escape by fleeing to the cover of some church or to the cover of doctrines and creeds or to the cover of some denomination , yet none of that is any covering for sin at all . </root.v.4117><root.v.4118> Bhavart vhodd daiz , dennem Kristachem ( Faith is a great inheritance , a gift of Christ ) : we have been singing these lines since our childhood. True , Faith is a great legacy from Christ. Our greatness and security lie therein. Christianity may have existed for centuries , but what has been the impact of Christian living on our society ? In fact , we live with people of other Faiths and grow with our experience of one another. But is Christ reflected in what we speak , in our spirit of forgiveness and generosity , in our social concern , service of the other and in the moral responsibility we take for our actions ? If we are to reflect Christ , it is necessary that we understand our faith , that we celebrate what we understand and that we live what we celebrate. In simple words , we need to be rooted in our Faith so as to spread the glow of Jesus . </root.v.4118><root.v.4119>Why did it become so popular , so prevalent ? It is almost infinitely adaptable , it roots and spreads quickly , and it works well as sod , whereas more deeply-rooted , water-saving fescues , for instance , don't. ( Such , at least , has been the received wisdom. ) One has to wonder though , whether its prevalence became a function as much of inertia as of preference. Once the dark color of Kentucky bluegrass came to define what a lawn " ought " to look like , many people opted for it because it was familiar and easily available. Marketing thus played a major role , making bluegrass the only game in many a town . </root.v.4119><root.v.4120>The custom of Easter Monday and Bright Sunday celebrations were rooted in the musings of early church theologians ( like Augustine , Gregory of Nyssa , and John Chrysostom ) that God played a practical joke on the devil by raising Jesus from the dead.

Growth requires you to be honest as to what is causing your fears. They are rooted in your lack of good boundaries and lack of positive self esteem. You are easily pulled into overly burdensome roles in other people 's lives because you feel it is your lot in life.

But it is natural that the passion of anger be subject to reason , which is the work of the virtue of gentleness.

The Rumsfeld Defense Department knew full well that the very structure of the 21st century all-volunteer US military was predicated on the assumption that it would never be engaged in a prolonged occupation such as Vietnam.

On March 8 Hezbollah demonstrated its political and popular strength by organizing a massive rally of some 500 , 000 in support of the Syrians , dwarfing the crowds celebrating the cedar revolution. The Hezbollah demonstration showed that democracy and self-determination in Lebanon are not as straightforward a matter as the White House would have us believe. If it is to be successful , the Lebanese movement against the Syrian occupation will have to assuage the fears of the Shiites , rooted in longstanding US policy in the region. If the democratic movement thrives in Lebanon , it will be as much despite US pressure as because of it.

Because trees are deep rooted they bring mineral nutrients from the deep soil that may not be available to annual crops. After residues from trees rot in or on the soil , such minerals are released into the soil and become available to crop plants. If the tree is leguminous the amount of nitrogen in the leaves will be large enough to significantly affect crop yields. Furthermore , pruning of trees results in partial die back of roots , releasing additional nutrients directly into the soil. Nitrogen is always difficult and costly to obtain , and leguminous trees are a principal way to get nitrogen from trees . </root.v.4218><root.v.4219>If you are rooting cuttings in soil , do n't disturb them for at least ten days.

In the same vein , Saint Paul exhorts us not to be conformed to the mentality of this world , but to be transformed by the renewal of our mind ( cf. Rom 12 : 2 ) . It is the " heart " converted to the Lord and to the love of what is good which is really the source of true judgments of conscience. Indeed , in order to " prove what is the will of God , what is good and acceptable and perfect " ( Rom 12 : 2 ) , knowledge of God 's law in general is certainly necessary , but it is not sufficient : what is essential is a sort of " connaturality " between man and the true good. ( 110 ) Such a connaturality is rooted in and develops through the virtuous attitudes of the individual himself : prudence and the other cardinal virtues , and even before these the theological virtues of faith , hope and charity. This is the meaning of Jesus ' saying : " He who does what is true comes to the light " ( Jn 3 : 21 ) . </root.v.4224><root.v.4225>Whether you want vigorous young plants for a fall or winter crop , or decide to multiply a tomato you particularly like , learning to grow rooted cuttings is a valuable skill.

It is , perhaps , this linguistic regression which is at the heart of its perceived offence to canonical values. It does not merely refute the self-possession of the poetic subject but also suggests that , as Freud argues in The Ego and the Id , 'what is highest in the human mind ' is rooted in 'the lowest part of. ..mental life'. There is no document of culture , Walter Benjamin wrote in the 'Theses on the Philosophy of History ' that is not at the same time a document of barbarism. Although 'Daddy ' seems flagrantly to violate the Eliotic doctrine of 'impersonality ' , therefore , it can equally be seen as pushing it to an unholy extreme : the truly original poet who is in touch with tradition expresses 'the mind of Europe ' not merely in its cultural glories but also in its deepest disgrace . </root.v.4241><root.v.4242>Cutting propagation relies on the plant ' s innate ability to form new roots from stem tissue. To accomplish this seemingly simple task , cells embedded in the plant stem must be switched from a stem cell to a root cell. This ability , or sometimes lack of ability , to differentiate from one type of tissue and change into another is what determines which species can be propagated by cuttings and which can not. Generally speaking , younger plant and more vigorously growing plants are more likely to make this transformation than old , mature trees and shrubs that are just eking out an existence in their native habitat. Frequently plants that are propagated from the wild will display poorer rooting when initially collected but will root easer in subsequent generations when the plant is grown under cultivation . </root.v.4242><root.v.4243>Non-variegatred varieties of peperomia are best propagated from leaf cuttings.

Not much equipment is needed , just a clear quart-size glass jar and some cuttings from your favorite rose. For you modern sodapop lovers , a 2-liter plastic bottle with the bottom cut off will work just as well. Cut a piece of rose stem about 6 inches long , remove the bottom set of leaves , and just stick the stem into the ground ( or into a pot ) a couple inches deep , and cover with a jar or bottle. You will need to periodically water the soil around the jar , otherwise the rose stem will dry out. It will take a couple of months for the rose stem to take root and begin leafing out with its new growth. The best time of year is spring or early fall. If you live in a mild climate , then winter and summer can also be successful for rooting roses. Intense summer heat of 100 degrees is not conducive for taking cuttings , nor are 32 degree or below winters . </root.v.4244><root.v.4245>You can take cuttings from camellias all year , except during the short vegetative period.

I have successfully taken cuttings from a mother plant frozen to about -15 degrees of Celsius. There is a lot of magic in the time of day to cut. One can not always follow this advice : Select the mother plant , go out and stay with her over night , and do the cutting in the dawn. You can do it in sunshine , but clouded days are perhaps better. If you can not stick them immediately ( you are on a journey ) , put them in a plastic bag , tie it and place them in the refrigerator ( +5 C ) in the mini bar at your hotel room.

Britishness is an emotion , an experience , a flavour that does not lend itselfto empirical definition. But ifwe must draw up a British statement ofvalues , it should mention the following. The English language , with its inherent modes ofthought , culture and expression binds us together as a nation; it roots us to British culture. And Britain has an exceptional history. The Magna Carta set in motion our heritage as a nation ruled by constitutional law , committed to justice for all. As a country , we want other nations to enjoy the same honour.

But there are also those who challenge this assumption : Africa 's technological backwardness is rooted , they claim , on African traditional culture : it does not develop critical and analytical attitudes; it does not distinguish the secular and the sacred; man merges with life and nature; it is not a culture which aims at the transformation and the control of nature . </root.v.4253><root.v.4254>That was the theme , and we were taking long-odd bets that very few journalists would even sense it.

It is a forum where the participants talk together about their own experience and make decisions about their own learning. It is rooted in the principles developed by the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. Freire distinguishes his approach to education from the traditional " banking " approach where participants are treated as empty vessels that must be filled with information. The underlying implication of the traditional approach is that students are " uneducated " and in need of knowledge that can come only from teachers or experts. This need creates a dependency and reinforces a sense of powerlessness. People learn to distrust themselves , their own knowledge and intuitions and this can lead to confusion. They often feel there is something wrong but they are not sure what. Freire 's method encourages participants to see themselves as a fount of information and knowledge about the real world. When they are encouraged to work with the knowledge they have from their own experience they can develop strategies together to change their immediate situations . </root.v.4286><root.v.4287>After 28-days ' rooting , all cuttings independently of the combination formed compact root clods.

Any type of container can be used as long as it has drainage holes. Some people use flats if they are rooting a number of cuttings. Rooting in individual 4-inch pots will avoid later transplanting. My preference is a method recommended by Tom Leroy , one of the Harris County Extension horticultural agents , and I also saw this method mentioned in one of the Herb Companion articles. He suggests filling a large pot ( I use a 3-gallon ) with soilless mix , sinking a small clay pot with its drainage hole stoppered into the center and planting around it.

Because their root system is very different , Cacti need to go through a period of callusation. If you remove the cactus from the ground the roots become obsolete. If the wound is not callused and comes in contact with water or moist soil , the plant will root rot and the cactus will become infected and die in a short period. I suggest you remove all broken roots and loose soil manually from the root system and place the plant in a shaded area for 4-5 days in the summer and at least 7 days in the winter. After this you can plant in loose soil in the ground or container avoiding injury to the cacti. If the cactus does become injured from cuts or breaks , then an additional 2-3 day waiting period is recommended before watering. Remember , cactus store water within its flesh and can survive months uprooted.

No , the definition of the heart is that it is the depth of the mind , the mind being the surface of the heart. That in us which feels is the heart , that which thinks is the mind. It is the same thing which thinks and feels , but the direction is different : feeling comes from the depth , thought from the surface. When thought is not linked with feeling it is just like a plant rising up from the earth , the root of which has not gone deep. A thought without feeling is a powerless thought; it is just like a plant without a deep root.

The lateral branches longer than 2 , 5 cm were cut at this level. The cuttings were rooted in damp saturated vermiculite in plastic trays , in a greenhouse until their rooting. To maintain the air dampness inside the trays , they were covered with a glass at 3-4 cm over the trays and so also allowed the air circulation. When the rooting of the cuttings were higher than 90 , they were transferred to the open air and exposed gradually to the sun , for their rustication. The dampness of the cuttings were maintained by watering with a Nitrofoska ( BASF ) of 3 gr/ l solution.

The revolt against arbitrary authority " came on the basis of a description of human nature as having in it a rational principle from which authority could proceed " ( Movements of Thought in the Nineteenth Century 12 ) . Thus , the aim of modern social theory has been to root social institutions in human nature rather than in divine providence. The doctrine of the rights of man and the idea of the social contract , for example , were brought together by Hobbes , Locke , and Rousseau in an effort to ground political order in a purely human world. Society was conceived as a voluntary association of individuals; and the aim of this association was the preservation of natural rights to such goods as life , liberty , and property. Social authority , then , was derived from the individuals who had contracted to live together and to pursue certain human goals. This analysis of society was at the root of the revolutionary social criticism of the eighteenth century . </root.v.4366><root.v.4367>I may seem to have wandered far from early society , but I have not wandered.

The point I am bringing out is simple : one most important prerequisite of a prevailing nation is that it should have passed out of the first stage of civilisation into the second stage out of the stage where permanence is most wanted into that where variability is most wanted; and you can not comprehend why progress is so slow till you see how hard the most obstinate tendencies of human nature make that step to mankind . </root.v.4367><root.v.4368>Very easy species.

Now we have started on the later flowering perennials with Geums and many of the Geranium forms we offer ( or are building up numbers to offer ) are being divided. They root well now and will be ready for Spring , using coir compost we do n't suffer many winter losses so can continue right through until Christmas. Seed sowing of anything that needs a cold period to germinate is largely done , with more and more use being made of a friend 's Hamilton Seeder , this allows us to sow directly into plug trays. We have had great success with plants such as Digitalis , Aquilegia and Primula but we are experimenting with several of the slower germinating plants. We hope it will cut down on root disturbance when they are potted on and so suffer no check to early growth. In theory this will save labour and produce better quality plants , we shall see . </root.v.4418><root.v.4419>" That being said , I rooted for the Sox in their 1959 , 1983 and 2000 World Series bids.

Most are quite easy. Some are better than others. We only use one method , because we have had virtually 100 success. It involves placing the cutting into a mixture of perlite and vermiculite under a humidity dome or inside a humidhouse. The medium mixture should not exceed 10 vermiculite and should be made fresh for every batch. Start by mixing 90 perlite with 10 vermiculite ( by volume ) , placing it into a propagation tray and wetting it thoroughly. Now take a stem section and cut it to a toatl length of 12 cm , with a node at the top. Insert this into the medium with the node up. Place a humidity dome over the tray and place the tray into 20 cool white light ( fluorescents ) . direct sunlight or strong indirect sunlight is not appropriate here. Most people kill their cuttings by providing too much light or too much heat . </root.v.4422><root.v.4423>Similarly , fuchsia plants from last year , which had been pruned back to save valuable bench space over Winter , started spring bristling with suitable young shoots.

And you know it is not an easy thing to break love , or to take the affections off that object on which they are so deeply set , in which they are so deeply rooted , as man 's heart is in his sins. Alas ! how many are there that contemn all the allurements of heaven , and that trample upon all the threatenings of God , and that say , 'Tush , ' at all the flames of hell , whenever these are propounded as motives to work them off their sinful delights ! so fixed are they , so mad are they , upon these beastly idols.

The idea is not that Heidegger just had sympathies with Nazism or that he joined the party. While this calls into question his political judgement it does absolutely nothing -- on its own -- to show that his philosophy must be tainted. As I pointed out the claim people like Ott , Wollin , Farias , Faye and Romano are making is stronger ( actually we seem to have two claims ) : Heidegger is a Nazi theorist and stands to Nazism the way for example John Rawls stands to liberalism i.e. he is its architect and the second claim turns this relationship between H 's philosophy and his politics around and says that H 's philosophy is rooted in his Nazism and hence is a type of propaganda for Nazism . </root.v.4426><root.v.4427>A greenhouse is not necessary for successful propagation by stem cuttings; however , maintaining high humidity around the cutting is critical. If rooting only a few cuttings , you can use a flower pot ( Figure 1 ) . Maintain high humidity by covering the pot with a bottomless milk jug or by placing the pot into a clear plastic bag. Cuttings can also be placed in plastic trays covered with clear plastic stretched over a wire frame ( Figure 2 ) . Trays must have holes in the bottoms for drainage. The plastic will help keep the humidity high and reduce water loss from the cuttings . </root.v.4427><root.v.4428>The Tamil Siddha tradition places special importance on the eighteen Siddhas of which there are numerous lists , none of which seem to agree. But presented here is an interesting caste of characters , such as Puunaikkannar , " the Cat-eyed Siddha " who the tradition says came from Egypt , or Paampaatticittar , " the Siddha who makes the snake dance " who is said to have been a migrant North Indian. The names of many of these fellows seem rooted in this sandhaa speech , which is not surprising being that many of them are derived from signature lines or recurrent references in their compositions. Filling out this international caste is a Sinhalese Siddha , a Kannada Siddha , a Siddha who came to Tamil Nadu from Rome , and even a few Chinese Siddha's. One of whom happens to be the Siddha alchemist Bhogar who is said to have been a Chinese potter by trade. Another being a mysterious Chinese preceptor and alchemist named Kaalaanginathar , who was Bhogar 's guru , and whom he apparently followed to India sometime between the 16th and 17th centuries . </root.v.4428><root.v.4429>That said , it 's just silly to chalk this off to differing " assumptions about human nature " , as Chait does. Positions on negotiation are n't first-principles convictions rooted in political philosophy , they 're strategic arguments rooted in empirical observation. I do n't support negotiating with Iran out of a belief in the inherent goodness of man; I support negotiating with Iran because the US has pursued the opposing strategy for the past 30 years , with fairly disastrous results. Similarly , I do n't think liberals should avoid negotiating with , say , anti-abortion activists because I believe humans are nefarious creatures that ca n't be trusted , but because the right-to-life movement has demonstrated that piecemeal concessions like partial-birth bans and parental notification laws wo n't stop them from agitating for more far-reaching restrictions. The only contradiction here is between the history of US-Iran relations and the history of the American abortion debate. I do n't think one can pin that on the hypocrisy of liberals . </root.v.4429><root.v.4430>The process of rooting woody plant material , while the stem is still attached to the mother plant , is termed layering. There are plants that propagate themselves naturally through this process. Wounding or scraping the bark beneath the portion of stem that will be in contact with , or buried in soil can hasten the rooting process. Loosen the soil with a garden fork , in the area where layering will take place , and then firm it to remove any air pockets. Amending the soil may be necessary as it must be well-drained and rich in organic matter to promote root and shoot development in the new plant. The layering medium should be provided with a constant supply of moisture to enhance the rooting procedure. Layering is most successful when carried out during the early spring to mid-summer period and when performed on young wood formed in the previous or current season. It may take 12-18 months for the stem to root to a point where it can be severed from the parent plant . </root.v.4430><root.v.4431>Step 5. Rooting the blossom stems.

A few of them are , giving a name to a newborn baby , celebrating a marriage , burring a dead person , circumcising boys or excising girls to enter adulthood. Our attachment to these practices and our refusal to alter or abandon them lie mostly in our fear for the wrath of our ancestors who protect us. It ' s an everlasting relationship linking the livings and the deads. That is why , to feel stronger , we often do sacrifices for them , such as organizing a food party or offering gifts to people in dire need.

They will root at the swollen node hidden beneath each leaf.

At the very point of worship we drop man-made educational tools and philosophies , however useful , to adore the One Who created all things. In worship we recognize that God alone is the end of all things and that by Him all things are made and sustained.

It can be done by using a leaf or a stem. The stem method is done by cutting a 3-4 inch branch off the plant , then allowing the cut end to dry for 7-10 days by placing it in a warm dry place. Once the cut end is dry dip it in rooting hormone and place it in cacti mix or a mixture of perlite and soil. Water sparingly as you do not want it to rot. It will root in the next 2-4 weeks and once rooted give it the same care as a regular jade plant. A new plant can also be made by cutting a leaf off the plant and laying it on the same soil mixture making sure that the edges of the leaf touches the soil. Over the next 2-4 weeks little plantlets will form around the edges of the leaf and these will be the new plants . </root.v.4463><root.v.4464>The Sacred Heart tradition has its roots in patristic reflection on scripture. If I may be permitted to frame this cumulative process in spatial terms we can imagine those thinkers of the early church whom we speak of as the fathers , standing reflectively before the incarnate body. Their considerations were rooted in scripture and their conclusions were highly theological. Exegetes like Origen , Ambrose and Augustine explored two primary themes. First , that the church was Christ ' s bride who came forth from the side of Christ , just as Eve had come forth from the side of Adam. The living waters that flowed from that pierced side were the sacraments of the church. Second , that the breast of Christ was a fount of wisdom.

On the point on which Mary Scanlon asked for clarification , the issue is not about rooting out bad landlords , but about redressing the balance between landlords and tenants. The measure will give tenants much more confidence that they will not have to pay an extra amount and that they will get their deposit back , because the money was always a deposit. Too often in the past , deposits have become just another part of the rent and people have not had the means to get the money back at the end of the tenancy , as Tricia Marwick said. That is the main point that needs to be remembered and why committee members were keen to have tenancy deposit schemes in the bill . </root.v.4485><root.v.4486>To do that , leaders must feel the vision deep within.

We may share neither religion , nor race , nor work , nor hobbies. If sociocultural coherence is low , what does that mean for the environment we share ? Must our homes express such differences as true nodes in different networks ? Perhaps , on the contrary , formal coherence may be even more important because environmental preference is what brings us together. Just because we can easily relocate , sharing environmental coherence may be more important than ever. But then again , such coherence does not signify shared experience and need not be rooted in local formal tradition.

In the solitude and silence , we are forced to engage those noises in our hearts that keep us from resting in the Lord. It is no surprise that the early desert fathers spoke much about virtue and vice , especially in terms of the appetite and passions. The goal of the discipline of the desert is to root out attachments to sin and earthly things and discover God as the source of happiness and our motivation to love. This prayer discipline begins with silence. It is necessary to take time out each day away from distractions and simply sit with the Lord in silence. Empty yourself , ridding yourself of distractions and worries , so that you can receive from God. Be silent and enjoy a moment of sitting with the Lord , aware that he is present , seeing , knowing , and loving you more than you know and love yourself.

B &amp;B trees and shrubs are those which contain a rather large ball of soil around the roots which is wrapped in burlap and secured with string or twine. Some B &amp;B plants may have a wire basket around the burlap instead of twine. B &amp;B plants are usually planted during the spring and late summer - early fall. Container-grown plants are those which have their roots growing in a modified soil medium ( mixture ) contained in some type of suitable container ( i.e. plastic , wood , etc. ) .

Threadleaf spreads by short runners , usually a couple inches from the original plant , but the new shoots grow roots and grow upright , so the plant maintains a nice vertical appearance , whether it 's a single plant or a miniature " bush. " On the other hand they are easy to transplant -- just clip a stalk with roots apart from the " bush , " and get it rooted elsewhere. In early summer , each stalk of Threadleaf sprouts a yellow daisy-shaped flower that may last until mid-autumn , or may come and go if there are weather extremes.

If so spray the cuttings with the Captan solution or appropriate insecticide. Remove any leaves that have fallen or dead cuttings.

Therefore , many growers prefer to propagate cuttings by rooting them in a sterile potting medium or soil mix. Sterilized growing mixes can usually be purchased at a garden center. Otherwise , a mixture of half sand and half peat moss is good for rooting most cuttings. Sterilize it by putting it into a 300-degree oven for an hour. Then moisten it before using. Stem cuttings should be dipped into a powder containing a rooting hormone and a fungicide ( available from a garden center ) before inserting into the growing medium. Insert the stem deeply enough so that the exposed nodes are covered. Keep the medium moist but never soggy. Maintain high humidity , perhaps by using a plastic bag as above or by frequent misting with water. Place the cuttings in bright , indirect light.

The English language , with its inherent modes of thought , culture and expression , binds us together as a nation; it roots us to British culture. And Britain has an exceptional history. The Magna Carta set in motion our heritage as a nation ruled by constitutional law , committed to justice for all. As a country , we want other nations to enjoy the same honour.

Some roses are good at producing top growth before they produce roots. This can cause some people to think that the rose has rooted when it actually has n't yet and they make the mistake of trying to harden the cutting off too early. In this case just wait. I 've never had success hardening off a cutting that did n't show roots. Other roses are good at producing lots of roots but are slow to produce top growth. You can successfully harden off the cutting at this point. But it does n't hurt at all to wait. I 've left cuttings so long in the baggie that they bloomed.

Since there is not enough room for all of the transplanted clones in the greenhouse , Vansterdan fills the greenhouse three different times. The first crop of clones is transplanted into the soil or 3-gallon pots and set out in the back yard garden after they have hardened-off for two or three weeks. The second crop of clones is moved in to harden-off and later transplanted to the local mountain plots. The third set of clones is moved into the greenhouse and grown until they are about 18 inches tall before he prompts flowering. Vansterdan covers the greenhouse to induce flowering with 12 hours of darkness . </root.v.4536><root.v.4537>Butterflyman , You may already know this , but I thought it might be a good idea to point out that most plants are best not rooted in water.

Any pastor knows that beneath the surface appearance of unity of faith , even though the congregation joins in heartily with the singing , dutifully participates in the responses and creeds , there is significant theological diversity in any congregation. A frank acknowledgement of pluralism , within the church and beyond , calls for respectful conversation rather than authoritarian dicta. Brueggemann puts it this way : Preaching must be conducted in a context where one makes proposals and advocacies , but not conclusions .

To water these plants effectively , and get water down into their root-zone ( often 6-15 inches deep ) , you need use an enormous amount of water when a sprinkler is employed. You have to saturate all the soil from the top - down to the feeder roots. The lawn and beds can become a soggy mess - especially when the soil has a lot of clay content. But if you do n't water deep enough , the roots will start to come closer to the surface , often robbing from the lawn . </root.v.4553><root.v.4554>Cultivation and Propagation : Do ana may be grown outdoors in the West and South or as a pot plant in the North.

Propagation is very easy : literally pull the plant apart and pot up the rooted pieces. This can be done from the time the new shoots appear above ground in spring right through the growing season until early autumn. In the nursery , it is far easier to grow half a dozen plants in plastic pots and use them for propagation stock than it is to keep digging up the garden specimen. In this way I can divide the stock plants at least three times in one year. I have never found any seed in the capsules , but several self-sown seedlings have appeared in pots where sale plants had been kept in the alpine house.

The next step is to pin it down ( use a U shaped piece of wire turned upside down or a hair pin ) onto a pot of moist potting media that is located next to the parent plant. Cover the notched area with inch of media , leaving the end of the stem exposed. Once new growth appears at the end of the stem or near the notch , or gentle tugging indicates the stem has rooted , the stem attaching the new plant to the parent plant may be severed.

If the stem-tip cutting fails to root , you will be no further ahead. Successful cuttings require a lot of rooting hormone ( good quality stuff ) and lots of luck.

( A note here; I had spaced mine about 9 inches apart initially , I later found out it is a good idea for better production to give them a little more room ) Like potatoes the vines can be hilled up as they grow , more vine/soil contact means more potatoes. However the more potatoes there are the smaller they will be in overall size. I recommend fertilizing their soil before planting but if you did not do so , a week or two after planting or when planting is a fine time to side dress with a good organic fertilizer like MicroLife. If you can I would mulch the vines shortly after planting , that way the vines can not root as they grow across the ground , or just lift the vines once or twice a week to prevent rooting.

In secular terms , pro-immigrant agencies try to convince the public to adopt a favorable view of migrants and , if possible , to identify with them.

In religious terms , these agencies seek to convert or evangelize the undecided , indifferent , or hostile , particularly their co-religionists. On a highly polarized issue like immigration , advocacy can not succeed or conversion occur without an agreement on who immigrants are , what they want , and what kind of society the long-settled want to create. The Woodstock reflection , in service to the common good and rooted in justice , will clarify these issues. It will benefit service providers , persons of good faith , and ultimately migrants themselves.

This is another of the ingenious puns the bards of the Norsemen used to convey their message. Ygg has been variously translated in conjunction with other words as " eternal , " " awesome " or " terrible , " and also " old " or rather , " ageless. " Odin ( 4 ) is called Yggjung -- " old-young , " equivalent to the biblical " Ancient of Days " -- a concept the mind can grasp only in the wake of intuition. Yggdrasil is Odin 's steed or , with equal logic , his gallows , the implication being of a divine sacrifice , a crucifixion of the silent guardian whose body is a world. In this thinking any Tree of Life , large or small , constitutes a cross whereon its ruling deity remains transfixed for the duration of its material presence. While Yggdrasil may refer to a whole universe with all its worlds , each human being is an Yggdrasil in its own measure , a miniature of the cosmic ash tree. Each is rooted in the divine ground of All-being and bears its Odin -- omnipresent spirit which is the root and reason of all living things . </root.v.4599><root.v.4600>Relegated for a long time to a marginal place in the health planning of developing countries , traditional medicine or more appropriately , traditional systems of health care , have undergone a major revival in the last twenty years. Every region has had , at one time in its history , a form of traditional medicine. We can therefore talk of Chinese traditional medicine , Arabic traditional medicine or African traditional medicine. This medicine is traditional because it is deeply rooted in a specific socio-cultural context , which varies from one community to another. Each community has its own particular approach to health and disease even at the level of ethno-pathogenic perceptions of diseases and therapeutic behaviour. In this respect , we can argue that there are as many traditional medicines as there are communities. This gives traditional medicine its diverse and pluralist nature . </root.v.4600><root.v.4601>I figure that will be it 's best option but this 'closed system ' seems like Lenovo might not allow an office suite in the first place ( I mean why would n't it come pre-installed if they did ) .

The bud is where all future basal growth will come from as the cutting grows. Using cuttings where the nodes have had blooms will result in plants that can never send up new basal growth. The illustration shows how to determine what nodes you have. If you look at a node and there is a leaf or the scar left after a leaf has fallen off , and there is no scar left from a flower , then there is a growth bud there whether you can see it or not. When leaves and flowers fall off they both leave round scars on the stem where they were. So , a bare node that has two scars is a node that previously had a leaf and a flower cluster.

It is still important to prepare the yard for receiving a new plant , as well as make sure grass is kept watered. Winter weather has more moisture , therefore requiring little to no maintenance this time of year. Wind can dry the sod out so it is important to keep an eye on your newly installed sod. The sod will root in 10-14 days. After the sod has rooted , it should still be kept saturated by the winter weather. If we have a dry spell water it once a week. It is recommended to water in the morning to wash off the dew - which has sugar in it. It is important to continue watering while the roots are still " baby " roots. Although Mother Nature may give us an afternoon rain - watering in the morning allows the sod to soak it up and be dry towards the evening hours . </root.v.4606><root.v.4607>After the cuttings have rooted , it is time to acclimate them by eliminating automatic mist and by increasing air flow and light levels.

Successful growth of ginseng most often occurs in sites where herbaceous woodland plants such as Jack-in-the-Pulpit , Bloodroot , Solomon 's Seal and ferns are thriving.

Langer is proposing a feeling ( psychical ) phase of a total organism that may be elaborated into the more specific experiences of sense , emotion , and thought. She continues to warn us against a substantive view of feeling , and yet seeks for some source of such unity and change as we find in feeling. Hence she says , it is this transiency and general ability of the psychical phase that accounts for the importance of preconscious processes in the construction of such elaborate phenomena as ideas , intentions , images and fantasies , and makes it not only reasonable but obvious that they are rooted in the fabric of totally unfelt activities which Freud reified with the substantive term the Unconscious ( p. 22 , italics added ) . In place of a substantive Unconscious , and of a substantive ego or consciousness , she seems to root the transiency and lability of feelings in the fabric of totally unfelt activities.

Delivering on a promise to provide outstanding and exceptional service to all customers , internal and external , is best accomplished when the promise becomes deeply rooted in the company culture. Providing exceptional customer service is aspirational. It begins with desire and is rewarded through the self-satisfaction of knowing you did the right thing by doing right for others. The benefits can be measured in small assurances or large returns. Smiling faces , exceptional morale , increased productivity , enhanced customer loyalty , and lower employee turnover rates are all tangible benefits of an exceptional customer service program . </root.v.4667><root.v.4668>If you want to propagate your poinsettia , take leafy cuttings during early to mid August.

I will never become used to the miracle of taking a cutting from a perennial or bush and producing a new plant. When a plant is wounded by being cut , hormones called auxins collect briefly around the wound. This alters the nature of cell division in the inner bark of the stem , the cambium , so that it begins to form embryonic tissue. Callus material forms over the wound. When exposed to air , this callus becomes hard but in contact with moist soil it stays somewhat soft and roots emerge beneath the wound. Cuttings should be taken when the plant is healthy and actively growing , from spring to fall. The succulent new growth is easiest to root when the stems are just firm enough to snap instead of bend. An exception to this rule is bay which should be cut from new growth late in the season. Water plants well the day before you plan to take cuttings. Scented geraniums should be allowed to dry out and wilt slightly , then watered thoroughly with cuttings taken 12 to 24 hours later. Geranium cuttings should be allowed to dry out overnight before planting . </root.v.4675><root.v.4676>" I think it was something that gave him anxiety , not feeling particularly rooted , " Lindenberg said.

Or if need be you can just keep the flat half filled with water , however you may not get as many shoots this way. The important thing is to keep them warm , perhaps on top of the refrigerator. Once the shoots are 2-3 inches tall break them off at their base away from the potato and place them in a vase where the base is in the water and the leaves are above water.

Since the leaf cutting contains a portion of the stem with a growth bud it can be used for any type of begonia. It ' s mostly useful for creating as many plants as possible of a certain variety. Say you have a cane with one stem that has several nodes with good buds. If you propagate by stem cuttings you might only get one or two cuttings. By using mallet cuttings you may get a dozen , depending on how many nodes and leaves there were. Varieties of canes that drop their leaves easily may not be good candidates because the leaf may separate from the stem before the mallet roots. Treat mallet cuttings as you would whole leaf cuttings following the same procedures. After rooting a shoot will grow from the bud on the cutting . </root.v.4681><root.v.4682>With separate environmental controls you can also stimulate a higher rate of shoot production.

Green plants from cuttings tend to flower 2 to 3 weeks later than the divided clumps , because it takes a bit longer for the root structure to get underway. However , from the time you start a pot root , you would need a few extra weeks for plants from cuttings , because you need to add the time required for the cutting to root. If you plant a pot root and it has more than 1 shoot , remove the surplus with the point of a sharp knife . </root.v.4685><root.v.4686>Now , Delphi ' s companies in China have passed ISO9001 and QS9000 Qualification Certificate.

Rooted plants ( aged 16-18 months ) with and without ball are planted during June and bag plants are generally planted during Sept- Oct. A hole is made at the centre of the pit after leveling the soil. The seedling is placed in the hole with its taproot and lateral roots spread out in proper position. The hole is then filled. The soil around the seedling is packed 3 cm high above the ground to prevent stagnation of water around the collar. The seedlings are provided with cross stakes to prevent wind damage and mulched properly . </root.v.4734><root.v.4735>Leave the branch buried until late fall , when you can loosen the soil and pop it out of the ground. At this time you will find that the plant has rooted , and you can remove the new plant from the parent simply by clipping just below the new roots.

This sheds water away from the cut end of the cutting and helps to reduce the chance of disease. Once you have all of your cuttings made , dip the bottom of the cutting in a rooting compound. Make sure you have the right strength rooting compound ( available at most garden stores ) for hardwood cuttings. Line them up so the butt ends are even and tie them into bundles. Select a spot in your garden that is in full sun. Dig a hole about 12 " deep and large enough to hold all of the bundles of cuttings. Place the bundles of cuttings in the hole upside down. The butt ends of the cuttings should be up. The butt ends of the cuttings should be about 6 " below the surface.

The atom was being split , after which the world was never again to be the same. Such a quiet stadium too. It is left to us , therefore , in our varied circumstances but with common challenges to make the interplay of our time and talent bring about the development of the key eternal attributes and the everlasting skills. A botched performance here means less chance to serve there. Any resulting advantage we have in the world to come clearly will result from taking advantage of the opportunities this life affords us.

Soffer and Burger [ Soffer et al. , 1988 ] studied the effects of dissolved oxygen concentrations on the formation of adventitious roots in what they termed aero-hydroponics. They utilized a 3-tier hydro and aero system , in which three separate zones were formed within the root area. The ends of the roots were submerged in the nutrient reservoir , while the middle of the root section received nutrient mist and the upper portion was above the mist. Their results showed that dissolved O2 is essential to root formation , but went on to show that for the three O2 concentrations tested , the number of roots and root length were always greater in the central misted section than either the submersed section or the un-misted section. Even at the lowest concentration , the misted section rooted successfully.

Naturally occurring auxin is formed mainly in the apical shoot men stem and young leaves. It moves downward after its formation at the growing shoot tip , but massive concentrations of auxins in rooting solutions will force travel up the vascular tissue. Knowledge of the physiology of auxins has led to practical applications in rooting cuttings. It was shown originally by Went and later by Thimann and Went that auxins promote adventitious root formation in stem cuttings. Since application of natural or synthetic auxin seems to stimulate adventitious root formation in many plants , it is assumed that auxin levels are associated with the formation of root initials. Further research by Warmke and Warmke ( 1950 ) suggested that the levels of auxin may determine whether adventitious roots or shoots are formed , with high auxin levels promoting root growth and low levels favoring shoots . </root.v.4763><root.v.4764>The uncomfortable examination of Islamic doctrines and history is required in order to understand the enduring phenomenon of Muslim Jew hatred , which dates back to the origins of Islam.

Let me for a bit approach this subject from the positive aspect of anarchism. Anarchism is not a dead or negative philosophy as you suggest - it is very much alive with a positive message for humankind. Far from being solely bent on trying to tear down government , anarchists are a people of peace who ask nothing more than that people respect the humanity and individuality of each other and reject coercion as a way of life. Of course we condemn government every opportunity we get because we recognize it as the single greatest threat there is to human peace and well being. But our attacks on the state are rooted not only in our knowledge that government by its very nature is destructive of true society , but also in our conviction that the full benefits of social life can come only to free people , and , conversely , that only free people can create a climate where true society can flourish . </root.v.4806><root.v.4807>Native of Pacific beaches and bluffs , North and South America.

Among those who attempt to divorce subordination from obedience are E. KAhler , Die Frau in den paulinischen Briefen , ( Zurich/Frankfurt : Gotthelf , 1960 ); Adams , pp. 171-177; and Scanzoni and Hardesty , pp. 80-105. The justification offered for this separation is often that of denying that " blind obedience " is required of the wife , and rooting the voluntary aspect of her submission in the New Testament. While these points are in themselves well taken , they do not exclude the very real aspect of obedience which is also evident in the New Testament idea of submission-an obedience which should not be misinterpreted by equating all obedience with extreme forms of it. Thus , for instance , obedience need not be " blind obedience. " ( See further the discussion of " in everything " on pp. 82-83 of this chapter for a clarification of the limits of obedience. ) These observations , of course , do not mean that subordination is to be equated with obedience , nor that Paul in this chapter might not have specifically avoided using the word " obedience " for the wife 's relation to her husband to indicate its difference from that of a child or slave . </root.v.4808><root.v.4809>I was under the impression that the Catholic schools generally rooted for each other.

Milk 's bold riposte tackles the issue head on , calling on all gays to " come out " to their families , friends and colleagues , refusing to keep homosexuality out of sight and mind. Such a tactic takes guts on the part of those involved : once you 've come out of the closet , you ca n't go back in - you 've stood up to be counted and put yourself on the line.

That will give the roots a chance to form and the plant to rebuild itself. A rooting hormone or starting solution will help with the high standing water , which means the roots are not getting any oxygen. That will help bring life back to the soil and the root system to the plant. If you have to remove a tree , now is the best time of year to replant.

It is therefore a legitimate , and indeed unavoidable question whether the first principles of the scientific faith -- for example , the coherence and uniformity of nature , the transsubjectivity of human knowledge , the adequacy of reason to draw conclusions from observation -- are founded in absolute truth; if they are not , they can be no more than unverifiable probabilities. The " pragmatic " position taken by many scientists and humanists who can not be troubled to think about ultimate things -- the position that these principles are no more than experimental hypotheses which collective experience finds reliable -- is surely unsatisfactory; it may offer a psychological explanation of the faith these principles inspire , but since it does not establish the foundation of that faith in truth , it leaves the whole scientific edifice on shifting sands and provides no sure defense against the irrational winds that periodically attack it . </root.v.4868><root.v.4869>Such experiments show the importance of the subsoil as a probable source of nutrients for crops. It seems clear that an attempt should be made to promote , by cultural practices , an ample distribution of the deeper portion of the root system. In the agricultural practices of humid regions , the " rawness " or unproductiveness of subsoil has long been recognized , but it is well known and generally accepted that subsoils of arid regions are not unproductive and that , in them , plants make a good growth. 88 , 5 , 139a In the semiarid soils of the eastern half of Nebraska , eight successive crops of inoculated alfalfa gave almost as heavy yields on the subsoil as on the corresponding surface soils , although corn and non-inoculated legumes did poorly. 5 That roots absorb phosphorus and potassium as well as other elements from the subsoil is indicated by the fact that plants , when potted in subsoil , will grow if nitrogen is added. 139 In some soils , nitrogen has been shown to leach in rather large amounts to depths of 3 to 6 feet or more. 188 </root.v.4869><root.v.4870>Finding savings is not only about reducing budgets , it is also about combating corruption , wastage and leakage in government.

Simply cut a leaf off the crown , with the petiole attached , and stick it in a sand/peat mix ( 50/50 ) , keeping it moist , and under diffused or flourescent light. In about four to six weeks , roots should appear and a new plantlet should be visible getting started at the base of the leaf petiole. Go ahead and whack the tree roots. I have never heard of a root developing like you describe , but then I learn something new about nature every day. Go right ahead and bring the Coleus inside. You might also take some cuttings and root them in the same manner as described for African violets , except that you need some of the stem as well.

It is very successful at propagating by vegetative means , that is has propbably lost its ability to produce seed. It may also be possible that Salvia divinorum is a hybrid and has become self sterile in the hybridisation process. Little is known about hte true reasons for its low seed production. In nature , virtually no seed is roduced , but handpoliination can remedy this. The seed produced this way has a very low viability and this is not a recommended way of propagating salvia divinorum. In its natural habitat the plant grow to a height beyond what it can support and falls over. The length of the stem that is now touching the ground will form roots and new vertical shoots will emerge from the node axils. It will continue to do this every few weeks and can cover substantial areas this way. As the plant prefers to grow near water courses , it is inevitable that small sections get brokn off occasionally and get washed further down the stream.

He first sees Bathsheba atop a load of furniture arranged accordingly to the immemorial custom of peasants on moving day; he tells time by the stars , while around him on Norcombe Hill the wind touches the grass in " breezes of differing powers one rubbing the blades heavily , another raking them piercingly , another brushing them like a soft broom.

Following a set of rules or suppressing evil desires can never make us righteous , for if we were truly righteous we would not need those rules and we would not have those desires. Therefore , in order to properly train our conscience it is not enough to simply say we are sinners while blinding ourselves to our sin. Instead we need find our sins , root out the thinking that produced those sins , and trust in Christ ' s finished work , rather than our own works , to make us righteous.

Rhizomes that are single can have the tips pinched out ( removed ) to make them put out new growth along the single rhizome. Rhizomes that have grown over the edge of the pot can be cut off inside the rim. The removed portion can be used to start a new plant or can just be placed back in the pot on the soil surface in a bare spot.

The righteous will root out wickedness , and I want to live to see it , for that time will give great consolation to the righteous. I wish to speak relative to a temporal salvation. If we do not have wisdom to take care of and save our own lives , it appears to me that it will be more difficult for us to attain to that principle necessary to save the spiritual life. As Elders of Israel , we must take a more judicious course , as relates to a family capacity and a Church compact , than we have yet taken. If we do not , I fear exceedingly for the result. Yet God is much more merciful than we are. He is determined to save those who will take a course to secure their election and heirship to eternal life. All such people will prevail. If they fail in their integrity and firmness to the cause of righteousness , and repent not , they will lose all they have already gained , all they have expected , and all that has ever been promised to them that overcome . </root.v.4929><root.v.4930>Soak the mix and allow excess water to drain completely. We can not stress enought to not overwater your plumeria cutting. Although the top of the soil may be dry , the cutting will be moist on the bottom and needs little water to root. It roots to find more water and if the end of the cutting is too wet , it will rot. Water at the initial planting and then do not water till you see at least four leaves. By then the plumeria cuttings roots will be developed and can not wait for your fertilizer. See below for plumeria fertilizer recommendations. Drainage , amount of sun , wind , etc will all affect the amount of water your cutting needs so you 'll need to carefully monitor the cutting while it is rooting. Generally speaking , you 'll want to water sparingly. It 's essential that you not overwater as plumeria will as stem rot can occur rapidly when cuttings are kept too wet. Rooting can take from 1-3 months , again depending on conditions . </root.v.4930><root.v.4931>Broadleaf plantain is a shallow mostly fibrous rooted perennial.

Here too man can control his life; not through science but through higher consciousness. E.g. the individual who is a brute , without values , indiscriminate in his actions can learn to become a more moral man filled with essential human values. Likewise the weak , reluctant , timid individual who still retains his goodness can learn to express that goodness in his strength and through more forceful action in the world. ( There are endless permutations of these limitations and their positive reconstitutions. ) Such change will have 100 times or more the power and effect on the life of man than the scientific approach. Through this wider and deeper approach man can learn to rise in consciousness to overcome his own unique limiting , wanting propensities in life.

Being pro- or anti-American is a gut reaction often conceived in childhood or adolescence , in part influenced by the surrounding adult environment or by early traumas loosely connected to the US image. Those against America will root for anyone who might , even potentially , be able to unsettle US might , be they Castro , bin Laden , a French Gaullist , a communist North Korean " king " , a conservative Peronist or a Palestinian kamikaze anything goes , as long as it is against America. On the contrary , those who during a lifetime have rooted for the US team will be inclined to see everything that Americans do as being for the greater Good , and everyone opposed as incarnating Evil. This is the formal , i.e. sports-like , face of ideologies.

Certainly some have been in the area a long time , probably associated with natural vegetation before cultivation. Then as the area was brought under agriculture , the nematode pest began to feed and reproduce on the cultivated crop. Most workers regard these nematodes as indigenous ( native ) . Other nematodes undoubtedly came from other areas and were introduced by one or more agents. Nematodes usually are brought to new areas by movement of soil , water , and plant material. Agricultural practices such as clearing or leveling land , cultivation , and irrigation are important in moving nematode-infested soil. Carefully cleaning farm machinery between fields is a cheap , effective way to reduce movement of nematodes from infested to noninfested fields. Nematodes frequently are established in a new area with plant material. Plant propagation material ( seeds , bulbs , tubers , cuttings , and transplants ) can conceal numerous kinds of nematode pests. Naturally , cuttings and transplants rooted in soil greatly increase the chance of pest introduction. Wind and animals also may move nematode pests . </root.v.4944><root.v.4945>As new top growth appears , it is advisable to pinch out the growing tips at about 10 cm ( 4 in ) to encourage the plant to become more bushy.

Given the underlying premises of vanguardism , unsurprisingly the Bolsheviks took " class consciousness " to mean this. If the workers protested against the policies of the party , this represented a fall in class consciousness and , therefore , working class resistance placed " class " power in danger. If , on the other hand , the workers remained quiet and followed the party 's decision then , obviously , they showed high levels of class consciousness. The net effect of this position was , of course , to justify party dictatorship. Which , of course , the Bolsheviks did create and justified ideologically . </root.v.4980><root.v.4981>He hath set the world in their heart - lw [ h haolam , that hidden time-the period beyond the present , - ETERNITY. The proper translation of this clause is the following : " Also that eternity hath he placed in their heart , without which man could not find out the work which God hath made from the commencement to the end. " God has deeply rooted the idea of eternity in every human heart; and every considerate man sees , that all the operations of God refer to that endless duration. See ver. 14. And it is only in eternity that man will be able to discover what God has designed by the various works he has formed . </root.v.4981><root.v.4982>They facilitate communication and coordination of activities in society , and they provide basic well-being to their participants.7 Both individuals and society as a whole benefit from the sheer fact of belonging , and the wide variety of organizations to which we can belong gives expression to the vast diversity present in our society.

I was someone who grew up outside the Big Apple. It offended me that anyone rooted for those cheesy , expansion-draft D-backs that year.

No. It meant this time wasn ' t different , even if people had died this time . </root.v.4983><root.v.4984>Spur flowers are extremely fast growing , easily cultivated and require little extra attention or special treatment. They enjoy well-composted soil , and as a rule thrive in semi-shade or cool positions on the south facing side of buildings. They are ideally suited to growth under the shade of trees , are generally shallow rooted and enjoy adequate water. They do however , store water in their stems and are therefore resistant to prolonged periods of drought. Due to the fact that they all flower at the end of the growing season , frost does not affect flowering. If the plants are affected by frost , cut them back at the end of winter and they will grow out rapidly. Once the plants have been growing in one position for more than a year or more they become woodier at the base and are more resistant to frost damage . </root.v.4984><root.v.4985>Even today , an estimated 80 of the world ' s population uses herbal remedies for parts of their health care regimen. There is not a single culture known to man that does not utilize herbal plants and herbs as part of their healing arts. While the oldest known culture to record the use of herbs was China , this practice is found in every indigenous peoples approach to healing from around the world. Ayurvedic Herbalism came from India; the herbalism we practice in the United States , that is not rooted in the practices of the indigenous people of North America , came to us from Rome and Greece. The World Health Organization or WHO , states that there are over 100 plant derived pharmaceuticals and that over 70 of these are used exactly like the traditional uses of native cultures . </root.v.4985><root.v.4986>The soil opening should be approximately 10-12'' deep. The hole must be deep and wide enough so that the roots can be spread out. The vine should be planted to that the soil surface will be a the ''crown'' , the point where the new cane grows from the cutting. Grafted vines should be planted so that the graft union is 3-4'' above the soil surface. If the scion contacts the soil it will root and then reject the rootstock . </root.v.4986><root.v.4987>And this is the point where true Christians and the world have the impasse.

Borg , like Crossan and even more like Thiessen , is difficult to fit into the categories used to structure this paper. He is a member of the Jesus Seminar and sees Jesus as a subversive sage , but he also argues that Jesus was a radical social prophet and movement founder who espoused a fully here-and-now approach to eschatology and apocalyptic. However , Borg argues that all of these ideas about Jesus are firmly rooted in the notion of Jesus as a Spirit-Person , and this becomes the fundamental paradigm that he applies to Jesus. Thus , as a Spirit-Person Jesus was a visionary mystic , a channel through which God 's Spirit flowed to others , a healer , and a person with a deep personal relationship with God. Borg also highlights the fact that this notion of Jesus as a Spirit-Person also fits well with the charismatic experiences that abounded in the New Testament church. Finally , as a Spirit-Person , Borg 's Jesus is incredibly compassionate , and thus Borg 's focus on Jesus as a charismatic is used to downplay the moral teachings of Jesus . </root.v.4996><root.v.4997>Each kill on the commando 's kill meter increases the chance to get a 1000 armor bonus per point spent when stunned ( snared , rooted , etc ) .

The first step toward this goal is the fulfillment of the 613 mitzvot , as specified in the Torah and Oral Law. The performance of mitzvot inspires one to learn , expand his knowledge , and rise spiritually. Once a person decides to fulfill his obligation in this world , he can not remain the same. There is ascent and descent , advancement and regression; he can not stagnate. Driven by his soul , this person will search more and more. This drive fills him with yearning. As King David said , My soul thirsts for You ( Psalms 63 ) , and As a deer yearns for brooks of water , so my soul yearns for you , 0 God ( ibid. 42 ) .

For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it. For what will a man be profited , if he gains the whole world , and loses his soul ?

The JFI campaign receives a high volume of protest letters from Catholic members ( and even leaders ) of well-organized anti-immigrant groups. Partially for this reason and to rebut the frequent attacks on immigrants on television and radio , the campaign has made the education of Catholics one of its core goals. In fact , the Church ' s policy prescriptions address security , rule of law , economic and other concerns. More importantly , they are rooted in a religious tradition that treats the disenfranchised and vulnerable as brothers and sisters and sees in them the face of God. They reflect our nation ' s and Church ' s immigrant heritage . </root.v.5013><root.v.5014>Yeshua 's followers were Jewish.

Mussolini and other early proto-fascists like the famous futurist artist Marinelli did this , attracting many radical youth to them as a more radical alternative to the mainstream Marxists. This is why Antonio Gramsci and other student socialists idolized Mussolini until he became pro-war in1914. The bourgeois reformist character of the Social-Democracy played into the fascists ' hands. People in the U.S. have a false picture of the historic euro-left , they don ' t realize how big and strong rooted Social Democracy was. How , like our AFL-CIO , the Civil Rights movement , the women ' s movement here , how much a part of the establishment it had become. And of course from its beginnings fascism was a fighting force , an armed organization. It emphasized violence and direct , spontaneous action which made them look a lot racier than the broad socialist movement which was de facto pacifist. Just like today the ' anti-war movement ' Mussolini faced was totally inept and bourgeoisified . </root.v.5015><root.v.5016>Here , most of us have a tendency to try to graft before the plant is well started.

Pieces of any roots except the smallest and the very large , cut into 5 - 10 inch lengths , are placed flat in a prepared bed and covered with 2 - 4 inches of soil , which must be kept moist. They may also be grown by air-layering or from cuttings of half-ripened wood. Pieces 1/4 - 1/2 inch will root with bottom heat and rooting-hormone treatment. Trees grown from cuttings or air-layering have no taproot , however , and are apt to be blown down in the first 2 or 3 years.

Only the grower knows for sure , but here are some guidelines for planning purposes. Finished 4.5-inch pots should take six to eight weeks from rooted cuttings. Each plant should have a minimum of one fully opened bloom and be heavily branched. Six-inch pots should take 9 to 11 weeks from rooted cuttings. Each plant should have at least two fully opened flowers and be heavily branched. Eight-inch pots should take 14 weeks or longer from rooted cuttings. Each plant should be loaded with fully opened blooms and be heavily branched. Finishing time is dependent on your market and growing environment.

In direct opposition to this , the forces of wickedness constantly hunger after money , swallowing the sparks of holiness hidden in the money and rooted in the supernal colors. The more a person breaks his lust for money and draws closer to the wisdom of Torah , the more he releases the holy sparks from the forces of wickedness.

A word about pruning : if you are uncertain about whether to create jin or shari , simply stub off the branches. You can always carve the ends later for a dry or driftwood effect.

The difficulties in getting both a business license and the land on which to build a business are discouraging. Some contractors and businesses object to the manner in which Navajo preference laws are currently enforced. The laws require hiring of a Navajo employee if he/she is qualified. The objections are rooted in the fact that Navajo preference is not used only to favor a Navajo applicant when there is another equally qualified applicant. It favors any Navajo applicant. Because of this interpretation , businesses can not always hire the most qualified candidates that can make them successful. A Navajo applicant who was not hired for a position can appeal and if the local board decides he/she was even minimally qualified , then the employer may be liable for a penalty . </root.v.5050><root.v.5051>Verbenas , Euonymus , Pachysandra , Ivy , and climbing roses are some of plants that will root fairly quickly by layering them into the warm soil.

If necessary during the summer , all the plants are watered overhead using a hose-pipe and rose. During the rest of the year they are given glass protection overhead but the frame sides are generally left open except in the severest cold or rain.

For instance , using evidence from gene duplication data , Donoghue and Mathews ( 1998 ) inferred the root of the angiosperms to lie along the branch leading to Sorghum. However , with the subsequent analysis of additional species , it was found that the root lay in a very different location , at or close to the branch leading to Amborella ( Mathews and Donoghue , 1999 , 2000 ) . It has been long appreciated that phylogenetic estimates for a given group can differ merely because of disagreement as to the position of the root. This point was amply demonstrated for apparently conflicting phylogenies of cetaceans by Messenger and McGuire ( 1998 ) . Another example is for eutherian mammals. Although the rooted trees derived from nuclear versus mitochondrial sequences conflict , the unrooted networks are congruent with respect to the major eutherian clades ( Lin et al. , 2002 ) . </root.v.5064><root.v.5065>40.

Because of their food value , various animals seek them out. Although relatively harmless to mature longleaf , pocket gophers excavate extensive caverns while feeding on the roots of longleaf pine and other plant species. At one time , wild pigs were very abundant in the southeast and their voracious appetite for longleaf roots resulted in countless acres of young trees being rooted up. When a longleaf pine tree dies , fires often consume the stump creating a hole roughly the dimensions of the tap root. The burned or rotted out root systems of these stumps create a myriad of tunnels ideal for various cold-blooded creatures . </root.v.5067><root.v.5068>Oxygen enrichment of rooting media is fairly simple. Since shoot cuttings must be constantly wetted to ensure proper rooting , aeration of the rooting media may be facilitated by aerating the water used in irrigation. Mist systems achieve this automatically because they deliver a fine mist ( high in dissolved oxygen ) to the leaves , from where much of it runs off into the soil , aiding rooting. Oxygen enrichment of irrigation water is accomplished by installing an aerator in the main water line so that atmospheric oxygen can be absorbed by the water. An increase in dissolved oxygen of only 20 parts per million may have a great influence on rooting. Aeration is a convenient way to add oxygen to water as it also adds carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Air from a small pump or bottled oxygen may also be supplied directly to the rooting media through tiny tubes with pin holes , or through a porous stone such as those used to aerate aquariums . </root.v.5068><root.v.5069>Some succulent plants ( for example , jade plant and jelly bean plant ) have leaves that lack petioles ( Figure 14 ) . These leaves can simply be broken off the stem , the broken end dipped in rooting hormone , and the leaf inserted about 1/3 of its length into rooting mix. Since these plants are very sensitive to excess water , make sure the rooting mix stays damp but DO NOT enclose the pot in a plastic bag. Roots and then new shoots will develop at the base of the leaf and can be separated into individual plantlets ( Figure 15 ) . If the leaves rot instead of root , start over with fresh cuttings and media , add vermiculite or perlite to your rooting mix , and water only when the upper 1/4 inch of mix has dried . </root.v.5069><root.v.5070>Utthita hasta padangustasana variation ( and standing balances ) : In all of the standing balances , I find that the energy naturally tends to get unplugged ( pulled up ) in the effort to balance , and if I ' m not mindful of actively rooting through the feet , my legs will actually feel more unplugged after the pose than before.

Balancing on one leg , draw your other leg in and hold the outer edge of the foot ( arm inside the leg ) with the sole of the foot pointing straight down and the knee slightly wide to the side. Feel the weight in your standing leg , and then lift your toes and engage the legs fully. As you spread the pinky toes , press into the big toe mounds and draw back so the inner thighs root back , and then stand down through all four corners of both feet as you rise up through the spine.

My understanding is that several sweet potato diseases can spread from the tuber to the shoot , and that it is actually wisest to even cut off at least one inch of the shoot to prevent these dieseases from spreading to the new plants. I 've done it both ways without problem ( cut the sprout carefully from the potato , or cut off all but the bottom one inch of the sprout ) . Sweetpotato vines root readily from stem cuttings , which is , in effect , what we are doing. Any sweet potato vine cutting will root within a week.

At the same time , history clearly shows that religion has often been linked directly to the worst example of human behavior.

From the perspective of Transpersonal Psychotherapy , the therapist is recognized to be equal to the client and that on the level of pure consciousness , there is no separation between them. This view of shared consciousness within the psychotherapeutic encounter , where one person has a direct impact on the other and vice versa , radically changes the role of the therapist as ' projection screen ' that was delineated by Psychoanalysis.

Fortunately that is not required. The most important parts of all our life-learning and experiences , always come with us. The external manifestations of them are much less important.

Christianity and culture are thereby mutually enriched. The Gospel of liberation here refers equally to the person of Jesus Christ , his spoken and dynamic message of setting human beings free ( liberation ) so that these human beings may have life in abundance ( development ) . </root.v.5100><root.v.5101>Heavenly Father , may Christ Jesus through my ( our ) faith dwell in my ( our ) heart ( s ) .

Fill a sturdy water tight container about 2-3 inches with sand and bed the sweet potato ( uncut ) down into the sand , keep the sand moist and warm. Over time the potato will grow sprouts that will form leaves , once these reach 2-3 inches each with a good strong leaf or two you can break them off and let their ends rest in water. After a couple of days the ends of the shoots resting in water will have formed roots. When you have the desired number of rooting slips they can be planted out into soil ( make sure to water them thoroughly to help them make the transition from water to soil easier. This is best done in the evening so they do not get too much sun right away , light shade for a few days to a week would also be beneficial to help the plants get a fast start . </root.v.5103><root.v.5104>Policy choices must focus on unlocking the opportunities for all members of our society.

This is where government should focus its intervention . </root.v.5104><root.v.5105>The main method for working on Prana is Pranayama or Yogic breathing exercises. Yoga emphasizes purification of the body ( deha suddhi ) and purification of the mind ( citta suddhi ) as the means to Self-realization. For this reason Yoga emphasizes a vegetarian diet rich in Prana or foods full of the life-force and a mind rooted in ethical values like truthfulness and nonviolence. An impure , toxic or disturbed body and mind can not realize the higher Self. However the key to purifying body and mind is prana. For this purpose the main method is purification of the nadis or channels through which Prana flows ( Nadi-sodhana ) . </root.v.5105><root.v.5106>Propagating woody green plants such as fuschias , needs a slightly different technique. Take a cutting with one or two leaves , dip the stem in rooting hormone powder , and push it into your special potting soil. Keep the cuttings moist , and you 'll find that in three to six weeks they will have sprouted roots. This method works well with most woody stemmed plants , but to get the best results , the cuttings need to be taken from the green part of the stem when the plant is actively growing . </root.v.5106><root.v.5107>Softwood cuttings , or leafy stem cuttings root better and are more common than hardwood cuttings. Leafy shoots are taken from 1 to 2-yr-old wood in summer , treated with growth regulators , and stuck in well aerated media under mist for 2-3 months. A 4-5 " cutting will attain a height of about 2 ' by the following summer and be ready to plant. Planting is often delayed until the following spring due to the hot , arid conditions of summer , and consequent poorer field survival . </root.v.5107><root.v.5108>As Mona Abu-Fadl has explained , this is not the Aristotelian " mean " based on the idea of " a middle ground arrived at by the elimination of extremes or an aggregate amounting to a moderate stance " which would , by its very nature , be " shifting and defined , moreover , in terms of other positions , not of any intrinsic characteristics. " A middle way rooted in tawhid and " deriving its elements from transcendental sources , provides a stable integral core which serves in itself as a point of departure and a referent for defining and qualifying other positions , and not the reverse. In this way , it constitutes an intrinsic core and provides a vertical axis , or a spinal component , round which the diverse elements and modes of knowledge in the circle of consciousness cohere.

Some types of propagation require more skill than others do or more specialized conditions. Everyone should be able to propagate begonias without too much difficulty. The following pages contain descriptions and illustrations of the various types of propagation. Nearly all begonias can be started from stem or tip cuttings. Rexes , rhizomatous , tuberous , and a few other types can be started from leaf cuttings or portions of leaves. All begonias can be divided except for some tuberous begonias . </root.v.5109><root.v.5110>This review is from : Root of the Righteous ( Paperback ) This is definately one of Tozer 's best , he encourages us to lay down roots , the fruit will follow.

He asks for his brethren that , " being rooted and having been grounded in love , they may be able to comprehend , " etc. The force of this is very clear. Until settled in the grace of God , the soul has neither power nor encouragement to venture on a search into the infiniteness of a God who is not known. A doubting spirit comprehends nothing but the fact of its own wretchedness. A purged conscience is the first lesson that the Spirit of grace imparts to our souls as the Revealer of Jesus. Then , and not earlier , are we enabled ( by the power of the same Spirit ) to enter , with all saints , on the study of that which is the children 's portion . </root.v.5111><root.v.5112>So you no longer need to be tormented by the fear of death , and you don ' t need to look any further for ways to deal with the dilemma of sin and God ' s wrath.

These roots snap off with the slightest touch. In the national parks , visitors are instructed to stay on the trails when visiting the sequoia groves because simply walking on the ground under the giants will crush the shallow feeder roots. Sequoias should never be bare rooted. The process of removing the soil will also remove the feeder roots. Once the feeder roots are removed the tree will slowly dehydrate until it is dead or nearly so. The only hope the bare rooted sequoia has is to regenerate the feeder roots before death from dehydration. That is not likely. Many people have tried sequoias in their area and assume that they died because of soil , climate , fungus , and other types of problems. Most of those trees died because bare rooting destroyed the feeder roots. Shipping costs are higher to get sequoias with the roots intact but the chances of transplant success are improved from a very low percentage with bare root to 100 percent for container grown stock . </root.v.5116><root.v.5117>Like the martial arts ability of the same name , this skill allows the user to remain firmly rooted in place. it is as if he is stronger and heavier than he really is.

These roots grow downward through the moist bark and into the soil. As the root grows in diameter , it sometimes breaks free from the soft bark and appears as an aerial root. The lower stems of occasional robusta eucalyptus become completely encased in an interwoven mass of these aerial roots , some of them 20 cm ( 8 in ) in diameter ( 14 ) . The species rarely displays this habit in its native range or in more temperate climates. Adventitious roots , however , have been noted on a robusta eucalyptus in the Sydney Botanical Garden in Australia , and near Rio de Janeiro ( 15 ) . Although some layering from the stem may occur as noted earlier , most roots originate below the lignotubers and occupy the entire available soil profile on well-drained sites. Robusta eucalyptus is usually quite windfirm on deeper soils and is often used for windbreaks in Hawaii . </root.v.5126><root.v.5127>A common theme in New Age philosophy is that problems arise when ' ego ' gets out of control ( Eckart Tolle , among others , does a good job of articulating this concept ) . More to the point , many of the most ancient spiritual systems arose after their founders discovered ways to shatter the ego-centered mind , and get in touch with selfless states of consciousness. The New Atheists often rebut claims that religions improve human charity , but I do not see them addressing the fact that religions help some people achieve a state of consciousness deeply rooted in selflessness , humility and surrender. Even if the atheists are correct , and on average religious people are no more ' upright ' than others , it is also true that highly motivated seekers can use spiritual practice to escape the ego ' s tyranny and destructiveness. Promoting the attainment of this enlightened state of mind is perhaps the most valuable function of religion , even if it often gets buried under layers of doctrine and hierarchy. Until the New Atheists recognize humanity ' s need for ego-suppression , they will fail to win over many people who value spiritual development. They will simply be missing the point . </root.v.5127><root.v.5128>The best way to obtain well-rooted plants is to layer the young branches in autumn which will root well in the following autumn , especially if they are watered during dry weather. They can then be separated from the mother plants and transplanted to where they are supposed to stay. The plants which are grown from layered shoots do n't produce suckers from their roots as easily as those which were propagated from suckers. They are therefore preferred to the latter because they are easier to confine and they also flower more vigorously. These plants can be transplanted at will from October to April. However , if they are to flower strongly during the first year after transplanting , they have to be planted soon. Also , if they are transplanted somewhat late in spring they will only flower in autumn , as I said before , if they do n't suffer from drought . </root.v.5128><root.v.5129>As a milfoil plant matures , its shorter side stem growth may develop white roots while still attached to the mother plant.

This is because most types are fairly shallowly rooted and therefore prone to drying out. Any plant in a container will suffer more easily from water shortage than one in the open garden , and water shortage in a fruiting plant means poor quality fruit. All of these factors can lead to problems , but if you are prepared to devote more than the normal amount of attention to watering and plant initially with care , then it is possible to obtain modest crops of soft fruit , even on a paved area by someone with no real garden . </root.v.5147><root.v.5148>When Romeo was named coached , I bit down hard and held my tongue.

Insert the shovel at a 45 degree angle and push forward to the upright position. Remove the shovel and place the seedling at the correct depth. Remember you want the root flare to be at ground level. Hold the seedling at the correct depth and insert the shovel approximately 3 inches behind the seedling and pull the shovel towards yourself to close the hole at the bottom of the roots. With this method , bare rooted seedlings require some extra care to ensure the roots fall down the hole to avoid the deformity called J rooting. Seedlings with J- roots are more susceptible to drought , disease , and insect attacks because the root system never developed properly. Root systems with a characteristic J shape are typically caused by not making the planting hole deep enough or twisting the tree into the hole . </root.v.5151><root.v.5152>The " tree " of our lives will be " good " or " corrupt " based on the soil in which our " roots " are planted.

Cuttings should be young growth taken with a heel in early spring or August and September. They should be rooted in sandy soil.

Rooted in the cleansing waters of the Spirit in confession , the substance of faith is uncovered and begins to glow in its character as desire and love for that on which it places its hope. Faith , then , proceeds from the heartfelt confession of one ' s sins to manifest its character as desire and love for Christ God on whom it hopes : this is our second lesson from this morning.

These include African violets , begonias , peperomias , and most succulent plants , such as aloe vera , jade plant , kalanchoe and sansevieria. Using a sharp , clean knife , cut the leaf including any stem ( the leaf petiole ) from the main plant. Dip the cut end in rooting powder. For soft or slender stems like begonias and peperomias , insert the petiole immediately into the rooting medium , nearly up to the base of the leaf without touching it. For thicker leaves , like African violets , allow the cut end to callus for 2 or 3 days before inserting. Succulent leaves , including jade plant , aloe , and similar plants , should callus at least a week before propagation; otherwise the cuttings will tend to rot. Do not supply any extra humidity for succulents , again to avoid rotting from too much moisture . </root.v.5157><root.v.5158>African violets are easily propagated by leaf cuttings which should include the leaf blade and about 2 inches of stalk.

The process of lexification and its cyclic genelexification has the potential to achieve what initiators of WAZOBIA ( a combination of lexicon from the three dominant languages ) intend to achieve minimally. Through genelexification allowing for adapting and incorporating lexical repertoire from diverse background , even the minority languages would have the opportunity to be included. In a country where there is a growing antipathy between the majority and minority ethnicities and nationalities , the positive relevance of using the NPE for achieving national cohesion and integration is immense.

The botanical name for trailing arbutus is Epigaea repens and the common name is Mayflower. Cuttings made in summer and then rooted in a propagation bed with ' mist ' are slow to grow , but what a joy when one grows and finally blooms in a pot in which it has been growing. It roots and will grow in pots in a shady area for a short time , but often disappears after growing in the garden for a few years if there is not enough decaying leaf mold. Because of this , arbutus never takes well to a garden setting. It needs an acid soil with no fertilizer other than a think layer of decaying leaves , preferably of the oak variety. It needs a very specific type of acidy moist soil with leaf mold and humus on top and moist sand beneath in a shady spot . </root.v.5170><root.v.5171>It 's amazing how sturdily rooted most plants are in 4 weeks time.

Cuttings can be successfully overwintered by forcing the cutting to break bud and produce a flush of new growth immediately after it roots with the use of gibberellic acid ( 128 ) . Rooting response varies greatly between clones-differences range from 0 to 100 percent , and rooting response tends to be consistent from year to year. Timing the collection of cuttings is critical; those taken in mid-June generally give the best results. A rooting medium consisting of a 1 to 1 mixture of perlite and sphagnum moss , with intermittent misting , has worked well with sugar maple cuttings. The reliability of cuttings to propagate trees with figured wood , such as curly grain and bird's-eye , has not been verified ( 30 ) . </root.v.5179><root.v.5180>But what I want to write about tonight is the impact that Hamilton has had on my 9 year-old son.

Does n't Lenin stand precisely for the FAILURE to put Marxism into practice , for the big catastrophe which left its mark on the entire XXth century world politics , for the Real Socialist experiment which culminated in an economically inefficient dictatorship ? So , in the contemporary academic politics , the idea to deal with Lenin is accompanied by two qualifications : yes , why not , we live in a liberal democracy , there is freedom of thought ... however , one should treat Lenin in an " objective critical and scientific way , " not in an attitude of nostalgic idolatry , and , furthermore , from the perspective firmly rooted in the democratic political order , within the horizon of human rights - therein resides the lesson painfully learned through the experience of the XXth century totalitarianisms . </root.v.5196><root.v.5197>For best quality start plants in the greenhouse and grow until roots reach the edge of the pot.

The monstrose plants enjoy a warm sunny environment and for more speedy growth a light position on a higher shelf with light feeding and rainwater given to the bottom of the plant will ensure success , especially with rooted detached branches , which do well in these conditions. I had a plant which grew almost 6 like this last year . </root.v.5227><root.v.5228>Thus the first act was the formation of the Place brought about by the Tzimtzum. This Place was the first innovation produced when Eyn Sof , blessed be He , removed His limitlessness. This gave existence to the new pathway so that it could be revealed and operate. The pathway of limitation is the order underlying the course of the government of the universe. If so -- It was rooted in the Tzimtzum that the government of the universe should follow its course ... </root.v.5228><root.v.5229>I suspect that our reaction to comparisons that don ' t favour us is rooted in our childhood. Parents have a great responsibility in this matter. It ' s easy to single out one of your offspring for particular praise and then - intentionally or unintentionally - to create a sense of inadequacy or failure on the part of another sibling not similarly blessed. Brothers and sisters are always being analyzed in terms of who they most resemble or what traits they possess in comparison with someone else in the family . </root.v.5229><root.v.5230>The trees represent not only growth , triumph , and accumulation , but depending on the circumstance , they conversely represent any blocks we have experienced in reaching our goals. We must work with all of the elements in tandem to see good results. When we are rooted in one way of thinking , we diminish our ability to grow. We run the risk of become stunted , unwilling to compromise , and experiencing difficulty in finding nourishment. If we stay open , allowing the breeze to sway us , the earth , water and light to nurture us then we will continue to mature , become stronger and more able to expand and share our resources with others to make a stronger natural system . </root.v.5230><root.v.5231>Spain in the 1930s had the biggest anarchist movement in the world , rooted in working class life and struggle for decades.

The first bunch of plants are grown with branching hormone to make them multiply like crazy. The secret is in the gel made from very special ingredients. I guess you could say it ' s like hydroponic gello and is made from agar , nutrients , vitamins , sugar and hormones and a special preservative to eliminate the need to work under an expensive hood . </root.v.5233><root.v.5234>A wide-bladed prostrate summer annual.

They could seem to respond with violence as moral hygiene , as if to flush from their brains the codes of faceless conspiracies that govern their minds as well as their worlds. So does violence become one of the principal expressions of agency in mind-job cinema , rooted as it is in an apparent revulsion from intimacies of any kind. We should not presume that these films valorize agency of a modernist ideal , however. The thematic depiction appears to be more complex . </root.v.5235><root.v.5236>A unique daily personal guide that will lead you through a fascinating experience of emotional character refinement , with exercises for each of the 49 days between Passover and Shavuot.

On the question of the current seriousness of the conflict , Mr. Egal replied : " We have not rooted out all the terrorists. There are still a few pockets of them hiding in Hargeisa. They are fighting a hit-and-run war against us but we will root them out.

If people get well rooted , they can stand a good deal to begin with. Young converts , that are made after the New Testament standard , can stand lots of persecution; they can stand quite a storm. And that is not all -- if they are properly rooted , storms help rather than hinder them; storms strengthen their fibers and make their leaves a richer green than before . </root.v.5238><root.v.5239>JPS 's new holiday books take us through the joys , spirit , and meaning of the seasons. Blending the old and the new , they ground us in the origins and traditions of each holiday and open up to us ways we can add our own expression to these special days. Although synagogue ritual is touched upon , the real focus here is on our personal connections to each holiday and our home observance. As we move from season to season , Paul Steinberg shares with us a rich collection of readings from many of the Jewish greats -- Maimonides , Rashi , Nachmanides , Shlomo Carlebach , Marge Piercy , Elie Wiesel , Martin Buber , Abraham Joshua Heschel , Arthur Green , and others -- and he guides us in discovering for ourselves the many treasures within each text. The readings teach us about the history of each holiday , as well as its theological , ethical , agricultural , and seasonal importance and interpretation; others give us inspiration and much food for thought. These stories , essays , poems , anecdotes , and rituals help us discover how deeply Jewish traditions are rooted in nature 's yearly cycle , and how beautifully season and spirit are woven together throughout the Jewish year.

Shoot growth index , dry weight and height did not differ among treatments over the course of the study ( data not shown ) . Shoot growth index increased from 52.9 cm ( 20.8 in ) after four weeks to 57.8 cm ( 22.8 in ) at the end of the study. In the same period shoot height increased from 47 to 51 cm ( 18.5 to 20.1 in ) . Shoot dry weight increased from 1 , 046 g to 1 , 253 g ( 2.3 to 2.8 lb ) . Coarse root dry weight increased from 233 g to 278 g ( 8.2 to 9.8 oz ) over the study , with no differences among treatments.

But the spirituality of sport is grounded in an inner logic that is very much its own. In contrast to the equanimity , detachment , and directionality of a meditative path , the secret life of sport thrives on enthusiasm ( a word whose Greek source means " possessed by a god " ) , on both player and fan being " carried away " ( desporto , the Latin root of sport ) into a more vital mode of being.

Other methods are by cuttings , which will root from almost any portion of the stem , or by leaves , which are simply severed from the plants and pricked into pots or pans of light compost , taking care to bury all the petiole , or leaf stem; and by scales. These should be carefully rubbed from the tubers in spring and sown thinly in the same manner as seeds. In every case early spring is the best time to commence operations. A close moist atmosphere and a similar temperature to that recommended for seed sowing are also essential . </root.v.5245><root.v.5246>" The concern for world evangelization is not something tacked on to a man 's personal Christianity , which he may take or leave as he chooses. It is rooted in the character of the God who has come to us in Christ Jesus.

We are all infected with these in childhood , and exposed to them like deadly bacteria throughout our adult lives as well. Sometimes we think we have healed them , but they can lie dormant for years and then crop up again. Or they may continue at such a diminished strength and low level that we think they 're gone. And yet many of our unconsciously-held beliefs are continuously creating an undercurrent of conflicts with what we consciously feel and believe. Even if they were useful at some time , they do not serve you now. Root them out; choose , decide , and commit to to letting them go. How do we do that ? How can we change ? </root.v.5247><root.v.5248>One of the simplest techniques of propagating new roses is to cut off pieces of stem and plant them directly into a growing medium , where they will eventually take root. Commercial growers use stem cuttings primarily to multiply miniature and old garden roses , which take root readily by this method. However , some large modern bush roses , especially the larger and more vigorous varieties , can also be rooted from stem cuttings. Like budding , rooting stem cuttings is an asexual method of propagation that produces plants identical to the parent . </root.v.5248><root.v.5249>Comment : All people sin in general because we are sinners , but why do we sin in any particular instance ? Luther indicates the first commandment is foundational to all the others. Why ? Because we will not break commandment 2-10 unless we are in some way breaking commandment One and serving some idol. Every sin is rooted in the inordinate lust for something which comes because we are trusting in that thing rather than in Christ for our righteousness or salvation. At the moment we sin it is because we are looking to something to give us what only Jesus can give us. Beneath any particular sin is the general sin of rejecting Christ-salvation and indulging in self-salvation . </root.v.5249><root.v.5250>When Manifesto II says that it can find no design or purpose or providence for the human species , it devaluates man to a level below that on which God places him as His highest creation. The humanists pretend to esteem the human being above all else. In reality , as Manifesto II shows , the humanist takes away all worth from mankind. Unless our worth is rooted and grounded in something objective and outside ourselves , we are of value only to ourselves , and can never rise above the impermanence of our own short lives. The God of Christianity is outside our finite and transitory universe and His love for us gives us a value which transcends not only ourselves but our finite universe as well . </root.v.5250><root.v.5251>is not exactly meaningless , but is so rhetorically over-blown that only two things justify its place in the poem : it sounds magnificent and it is unforgettable.

The method in which this is done , through what is called waypoint and vector mapping , when generalised and so abstracted is transformed into the feeling of 'right ' from 'wrong ' and that is tied in to syntax processing. ( This feeling has been sourced in the left hemisphere of humans , note how EITHER/OR this feeling is. This either/or emphasis reflects the distinction of square-wave from fourier transform where the latter sums waves to approach the 'pure ' square-wave; in other words fourier tranforms are like summing aspects , harmonics , of a whole but despite the level of precision possible you can never absolutely assert 'the whole ' since the list of harmonics is infinite . ) </root.v.5252><root.v.5253>Have you ever wondered what happened to REAL country music ? Sadly , it has been pushed into the underground by the image-consumed , money-making monster of the corporate music industry.

First of all , there as to be complete anonymity. Secondly , there has to be solution to the race condition where the buyer has to be assured he is getting the goods before delivering payment , and the seller has to be assured of receiving payment before delivering the goods. Finally , the problem of fraud ( misrepresentation of goods ) has to be solved : the seller has to prove he has the goods claimed.

It probably makes sense to keep these assemblies small ( say , less than 1000 , or even 500 , people ) , especially at the lower levels so that they start out with face-to-face interaction and provide enough diversity of nodes , and are rooted in local walking-distance neighborhoods where people can be in regular contact and share a common , embodied rather than virtual , daily experience. If they are too large to begin with , the input from local nodes will be blurred. As the network expands , it will be appropriate to assemble larger groups ( in the multi-thousand range ) . It is my sense that the nodes need to meet on their own , not as a part of a larger process that includes nodes. There is too much dynamic here for making the nodes subsidiary to the larger process. It also takes longer and more resources to organize a large multi-node event. Nodes can organize by themselves and then join in networks of nodes. This parallel organizing will speed things up and diversify the input at the next level . </root.v.5267><root.v.5268>What is winning ?

From simple things like clearing the cache from core applications , to more advanced things like wirelessly tethering a laptop or iPod touch through your phone , root can do it.

In addition , modern weapons systems have made it possible for them to be far removed from any conventional battlefield , and they can attack the enemy from a place beyond his range of vision where they need not come face to face with the dripping blood that comes with killing. All of this has turned each and every soldier into a self-effacing gentleman who would just as soon avoid the sight of blood.

The green cuttings should always have some of their leaves preserved. The woody cuttings can be made either with or without leaves , according to the variety of Rose and the time of year when the cuttings are made. A large number of varieties will not root well unless they are struck with some of the leaves left on. It is desirable , or even necessary , to know the varieties in question , or at least the types or sections to which they belong. As a general rule , all Roses which hold their leaves for a long time at the end of the season and those which are almost evergreen , such as those classed with the Teas , Bengals , Bourbons , Polyanthas , Sempervirens , Banksias , Noisettes , and all derived from these , require to be struck with their leaves on.

It suffices to disassemble this machine piece by piece in order to possess it entirely. The fundamental postulate of mechanistic thought is that Nature can be known and conquered by scientific methodology , defined in a way which is completely independent of human beings and separate from us.

Earlier findings are reported in the 1999 and 2000 HRC Annual Reports. While sweetgum are not difficult to root from greenwood cuttings , such a system must be operationally efficient to reduce associated costs , and to maximize the utility of elite clones. Clonal selection and deployment is likely to be a key factor in the economic viability of sweetgum plantations. A clonal forest system will rapidly capture genetic gain , provide uniformity of response , and overcome the large variability among individuals common in sweetgum , even in superior families. This variability has a significant impact on plantation productivity , and may be efficiently overcome through the use of clonal stock.

It is also essential that you provide adequate bottom heat. Do not try to skimp here. The cuttings and their cubes should be warm 24hrs per day.

For example some questions such as acceptance of homosexuality are rooted in ego in scope. Ego based questions can not be answered from a universal perspective : despite ego 's insistence that it 's universal in nature. So in the end , " ego " based questions must be answered by each person. Giving a general answer actually creates interpersonal conflict. To a Taoist this problem is easily avoided by leaving the question unanswered from a larger perspective. To recognize this question is personal in scope for each individual to balance in their life . </root.v.5282><root.v.5283>Writing against what they characterize as Zizek ' s tendentially conservative politics , Andrew Robinson and Simon Tormey argue that transformative politics should be theorized ... as a process of transformation , an a-linear , rhizomatic , multiform plurality of resistances , initiatives and , indeed , acts which are sometimes spectacular and carnivalesque , sometimes prefigurative , sometimes subterranean , sometimes rooted in institutional change and reform and , under certain circumstances , directly transformative ( 2005 , 104-5 ) . This observation moves us away from political sociological treatments of TAGs , shifting the analysis from effect and resource mobilization toward process and praxis. This is the realm of autonomy , where communal identity is renegotiated. Robinson and Tormey observe that , it is important that radicals invoke ' utopias. ' Through enacting utopia , we have the ability to bring the no-where into the now-here ( 2005 , 105 ) . While the Palestinian struggle for the right of return plays itself out against a Zionist backdrop that continues to deny that excursion , TAGs suggest that another world is emerging despite the political regimes that are in place to silence its inheritors.

Oh , beloved , we have to realize that it is because there is so much of that selflife in us that the power of God can not work in us as mightily as He desires that it should work. Do you realize that the great God is longing to double His blessing , to give tenfold blessing through us ? But there is something hindering Him , and that something is a proof of nothing but the self-life. We talk about the pride of Peter , and the impetuosity of Peter , and the self confidence of Peter. It is all rooted in that one word , self Christ had said , " Deny self , " and Peter had never understood , and never obeyed. Every failing came out of that . </root.v.5284><root.v.5285>The alienation of Reformed and Catholic Christians , especially in Europe , is deeply rooted in painful memories.

While the " war against terrorism " may be a US-crafted phrase , it is a dire necessity for Pakistan. In a relentless fight to root out terrorism from our midst , there can be no appeasement of those who are engaged in mindless violence ripping apart our social fabric both literally and symbolically. The poverty in our masses and the lack of education is fertile ground for exploitation. Our Jehadi militants are exploiting this frustration to the hilt by giving it religious connotations. Can one even begin to decipher the callous mindset of those who launch others on suicide bombing missions ? While the aim is certainly to spread fear and anarchy , the proliferation of incidents is alarming. Mian Sahib must come up with a clear statement of intention; one has yet to be convinced he is committed to fighting this prime menace to the state and society as we know it . </root.v.5286><root.v.5287>Cosmic consciousness is not just 'out there '; it is also resonating within you. Be sacramentally rooted where you are. You are made of the Earth ! Look through the 'eyes ' in your feet. Your body is the present focus of your consciousness - through it all gifts are received.

He will be curious to know and feel what sort of happiness the sexual enjoyment will give. He thinks sometimes : " Let me have the carnal knowledge of a woman once. Then I will be able to root out this sexual impulse and desire completely. This sexual curiosity is troubling me very much " . Mind wants to delude this Brahmachari. Maya havocs through curiosity. Curiosity is transmuted into a strong desire. Enjoyment can not bring satisfaction of a desire. The wise way is to kill the strong wave of curiosity by Vichara or enquiry about that pure sexless Atman , by totally eradicating the sexual desire through constant meditation , and by thinking over the glory of Brahmacharya and the defects of an impure life . </root.v.5290><root.v.5291>I have recently been very much struck with hearing an individual relate his own Christian experience. His case showed how truth seemed crowding its way into his mind , and how time after time its entrance was resisted and prevented by his selfishness. It seemed for a long time impossible for him to know God , and the reason was nothing else than thisselfishness was deeply rooted in his heart , and while there , the truth concerning God could get no admission. Sometimes , he came almost up to the very gate which , once opened , would introduce him to God; then his bounding heart would say , " Now I shall know God , and I shall be a great mana distinguished Christian " and lo , down he goes againfarther from God than ever. So time after time he was thrown all aback by such developments of selfishness and self-seeking . </root.v.5291><root.v.5292>" 'No , ' he answered , 'because while you are pulling the weeds , you may root up the wheat with them.

Avoid taking cuttings from plants that show symptoms of mineral nutrient deficiency. Conversely , plants that have been fertilized heavily , particularly with nitrogen , may not root well. The stock plant should not be under moisture stress. In general , cuttings taken from young plants root in higher percentages than cuttings taken from older , more mature plants.

Elements of a good tip cutting It has buds in the leaf nodes for future stem growth as described previously. When taking a tip or stem cutting cut the stem about half an inch below the selected node. It ' s possible that if you have any stem rot while rooting the cutting , if you have cut closer than half an inch below , you could lose that lower node. Half an inch gives you some margin. Cutting further than half an inch below leaves too much unnecessary stem below the lowest bud. When you get ready to pot up the cutting after it roots , it will be hard to get that lowest bud buried in the potting mix if too much extra stem is left below it. When rooting the cutting , you should remove any leaves from the lower nodes first , since those parts will be buried eventually anyway can could rot . </root.v.5297><root.v.5298>Cuttings from 'City of York ' , covered and in the cold frame.

The normal process by which life sustains it self is through mixing of information and formation of new seeds against changing time. The information and characteristic of the plants obtained from seed changes because of mixing of information. This is a serious disadvantage in planning a quantitative economy of agro industry. Humankind has always struggled to predict , plan and reap. He has struggled to overcome uncertainties. Mixing of information and the uncertainty associated with productivity of plants derived from seed was always a concern to him and a clone that over steps the mixing of the information is a solution. Plants are known to be toti-potent. In other words , they retained the capacity to develop complete plants from the parts. It was noted from time immemorial that many parts of plants such as fallen branches twigs , in appropriate condition , could produce a complete plants. This observation gave rise to techniques of rooting the cuttings to get cloned plants . </root.v.5307><root.v.5308>The Second Noble Truth relates to the cause of suffering.

The novel 's most memorable images the garden of Coulibri , the fire and Tia throwing the stone , the red-haired boy and the bad-smelling girl , the mother in the arms of the black man are dreamlike in their haunting power , and like dreams they represent the conflicts of the unconscious. In its fidelity to the unresolved nature of those conflicts , Wide Sargasso Sea has a kind of painful , masochistic integrity. It is disturbingly honest in its exploration of the fantasies and the tangled , contradictory desires not only of a Creole society , but of the Western imagination itself in its continuing struggle with the dilemma of race. Its political sympathies whether with the oppressed black majority or the dispossessed white minority are finally as profoundly ambiguous as the unconscious conflicts in which they are rooted . </root.v.5316><root.v.5317>Another way of putting this is to say that the primary qualities of an object are those which are subject to precise mathematical calculation , whereas the secondary qualities of the object are those which are rooted in the sensibility of the perceiving organism and which are therefore not " objectively " quantifiable. The primary qualities ( number , position , extension , bulk , and so forth ) are there in the object , but the secondary qualities are subjective reactions to the object on the part of the sensitive organism. A corollary of this doctrine is that the primary qualities , because they are objective , are more " knowable " than are the subjective secondary qualities . </root.v.5317><root.v.5318>This occurs when one wants something one can not or does not have.

More emphatically , my main point is that the two are inseparable. This is precisely why Ricouer attaches such importance to Kant ' s understanding of imagination as schematizing a synthetic operation.

Dirr ( 3 ) reports 100 rooting of H. arborescens 'Annabelle ' using 5000 ppm of K-IBA on early July cuttings. Hardwood cuttings taken in November or December benefit from auxin treatment and have been successfully grown in open ground , open bench as well as under polytent material.

Taking cuttings has every right to be so popular with urban gardeners because it ' s such lo-fi technology. As long as you have a plant that ' s reasonably easy to take cuttings from , it ' s a technique that works well for most growers.

If Obama had failed or even lost too much political capital passing the stimulus , his presidency would have suffered. But becoming the stimulus bill 's public lobby risks making " Organizing for America , " part of the " politics as usual " Obama repudiated.

Without being rooted in a renewed American nationalism , bipartisanship will remain a slogan . </root.v.5324><root.v.5325>I found that the best thing to do is to keep the cuttings at lower temperature ( no heater ) like 15 C. The clematis will root but mould has less chance. Under 12 C , and above 20 C you definitely have to use fungicides ( in general ) . Under 12 C rooting takes very long and therefore fungus is winning at the end. Above 20 C the fungus is developing very fast , faster than clematis roots. In general I would suggest to keep the cuttings between 15-20 C , and use the fungicide as mentioned above . </root.v.5325><root.v.5326>Today this self-centered system of ideas exerts influence in all of our lives. Its assumptions and dogmas continue to be adopted by more and more people , and as a result , many secular humanist organizations are in existence both in Europe and in America , some of which have been around for a long time. Two prominent organizations , The American Humanist Association and The British Humanist Association , are both front-runners in the secular humanist cause. Another secular humanist-oriented organization is The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies ( see The Aspen Idea by Sidney Hyman , Norman , OK : University of Oklahoma Press , 1975 ) . The Aspen Institute is a motivator for thought and action on cultural issues affecting man and society. Committed to and rooted in a secular humanistic approach , it seeks solutions to local , national , and international problems. Another organization is The Sex Information and Education Council ( see The Siecus Circle : A Humanist Revolution , Claire Chambers , Belmont , MA : Western Islands Publishing Company , 1977 ) . The Sex Information and Education Council is humanistic in its outlook and policy.

Part II introduces white identity in " the language of class , " wherein the European-American artisans responded to the threat of extinction by capitalist enterprise by an appeal to a " whites-only " republicanism. Part III relates the growing industrialization to the development of a " white " culture , the emergence of " whiteness. " Unskilled European immigrant peasant recruits , resentful of the routine discipline of industrial employment , consoled themselves with the social distinction of being free and citizens. Special attention is given to laboring-class Irish-Americans who , the author says , combined their political and economic motives with an " unthinking decision " rooted in repressed sexual fantasies which they projected onto their image of African-Americans. Part IV argues that in the Civil War and Post-Emancipation periods there was a degree of moderation of " white " workers ' " tendency to equate Blackness with servility. " ( 174 ) In the end , however , European-Americans were still governed by " fears " of equality and of " sexual amalgamation.

Most source trees are rooted , and the use of the MR-outgroup preserves this rooting information. By contrast , it is the position of the root in the source tree that may be problematic in a supertree context. Often , the root will have been determined based on received phylogenetic opinion at the time , a type of " appeal to authority " ( sensu Gatesy et al. , 2002 ) in the form of an assumption of monophyly. Changes in phylogenetic opinion might mean that , among other changes , the ingroup in the source tree is no longer regarded as being monophyletic with respect to the outgroup.

Plants that are drought tolerant still require moisture , so do n't think that they can go for extended period without any water. Drought tolerant plants are often deep rooted , have waxy or thick leaves that conserve water , or leaf structures that close to minimize transpiration. All plants in droughty situations benefit from an occasional deep watering and a 2-3 inch thick layer of mulch.

It lurked in the central mountains of France itself and cognate forms lurked in the valleys of the Alps. It is possible to trace a sort of vague continuity between the Albigensian and the later Puritan groups , such as the Vaudois , just as it is possible to trace some sort of connection between the Albigensian and the earlier Manichean heresies.

When human beings deal with other human beings without any reference whatsoever to God , all kinds of malpractices are to be expected. But the moment God becomes the true focus of attention , all such ignoble activity ceases outright. When one is truly and sincerely dealing with God , from whom nothing can be hidden , one steps warily , and with due regard for one 's fellow-men.

On the contrary , we must rely solely on Christ and His strength. That ' s what St. Paul meant when he wrote in Galatians 2 : 20 , ... it is no longer I who live , but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and delivered Himself up for me.

Once again we see the importance of our connection with the Lord himself-how we need to be rooted securely in him to sustain life and bear fruit : " Some of the seed landed on rocky ground where it had little soil; it sprouted immediately because the soil had no depth. Then , when the sun rose and scorched it , it began to wither for lack of roots " ( Mark 4 : 5-6 ) . These seeds put down roots , and the roots struggled to find anchorage , but the soil was rocky. Finally the plant withered and died , because the roots found no source of water and nutrients. As Jesus explained , " Those sown on rocky ground are people who on listening to the word accept it joyfully at the outset. Being rootless , they last only a while. When some pressure or persecution overtakes them because of the word , they falter " ( Mark 4 : 16-17 ) .

I ' ve had great success rooting cuttings when the weather is hot during the summer and fall in my climate. When the weather is cool in the winter and early spring , cuttings can be challenging to root. June Gloom , as it is called , can be a hard time to root cuttings , when the sun doesn ' t show up for weeks and everything is cold and damp. Potting soil which becomes cold and damp can encourage a cutting to rot. Even in a greenhouse where the temperatures are warm or hot during the day but drop down below 50 at night can lead to cold and damp potting soil. I have found that it is best , when rooting cuttings in a greenhouse , to keep the overall temperature above 50 and higher if possible. The soil temperature of 80 seems ideal. It is important to keep the soil temperature high for the rooting process to be successful. In this effort , heat mats can be beneficial in raising the soil temperature.

The mechanical wounding of root tissues facilitates infection by facultative parasites. Defects resulting from wounds can extend into the root crown , and columns of discoloration and decay from various wounds can coalesce in the stem. Although root tissue might continue to generate , roots can gradually become hollow and weakened. Wound fungi can cause the rooting zone to shrink and anchorage to weaken , although much more slowly than the aggressive pathogens ( Sharon , 1980 ) . </root.v.5414><root.v.5415>As far back as 1998 , Biden was calling for a U.S. invasion of that oil rich country.

Rooting hormone is available in florist shops and garden centres , and is sold in three grades. For house plants , no. 1 or no. 2 rooting hormone is suggested. Pour a small amount of powder onto a piece of paper. Dip the lower end of your cutting in water , let the excess drain away , and dip it in the powder.

This poses difficulties when trying to improve such characteristics as bean quality and yield , or disease and insect resistance in cacao. Individual trees bearing beneficial traits fail to produce offspring that consistently bear the same traits. When farmers select seed from their best trees , the resulting trees are often of poor quality , produce low yields and are susceptible to diseases and insects. The only way to produce trees of uniform high quality is by vegetative propagation resulting in exact clones of the parent tree. A number of vegetative propagation methods have been developed. These include low-tech rooted cuttings and grafting techniques ( Fig. 19 ) as well as high-tech tissue culture and micropropagation techniques ( Fig. 20 ) ( 23 ) . Unfortunately , high-tech solutions are expensive , requiring government or industry support , and low-tech solutions are slow. Considering the intensive pressure from diseases and insects on the world cacao crop , these techniques fail to meet the farmers ' needs for high quality seedlings. A combination of low-tech and high-tech methods has been worked out and offers hope for the production of large numbers of high quality seedlings in the future . </root.v.5435><root.v.5436>John Innes Seed Compost ( low nutrient level suitable for sowing seeds and rooting cuttings ) .

Most can be taken throughout summer and fall , but stem cuttings of some woody plants root better if taken in the fall or in the dormant season.

There are several different types of stem cuttings depending on the part of the stem needed. At least one node ( the point on a stem where leaves are attached and buds form ) should be below the media surface.

He puts the question of immortality in a " problematic manner " : If there is an immortality. Thus he is cognitively a doubter or an ignorant. But nobody was more in truth ( in paganism ) than Socrates while in his ignorance. Ignorance is the adequate expression of the relationship between the eternal truth and the existing individual. The eternal truth which is not paradoxical in itself becomes paradoxical by being related to an existing person. This relation must remain a paradox as long as the individual exists. But in risking his entire life he provides a more effective proof of immortality than anything one can derive from philosophical assertions about the nature of the soul. The certainty of immortality is rooted in subjectivity and the quality of existential appropriation ( reduplication ) . </root.v.5443><root.v.5444>For my own part , I would credit the avowals made by gay spokesmen like Barney Frank and Andrew Sullivan that they do not have the remotest interest in promoting polygamy , or in weakening the laws that sustain families. But their argument runs beyond their intentions. The arguments for gay marriage must in fact put into place the premises that make it untenable for the law to hold back from the acceptance of polygamy. And one thing may be attributed to the gay activists quite accurately and fairly : they have the most profound interest , rooted in the logic of their doctrine , in discrediting the notion that marriage finds its defining ground in nature.

If your purpose is just to propagate a couple of new plants for yourself , you may choose to just use whole leaf cuttings. Cone cuttings are slower than regular whole leaf cuttings but since more veins are exposed to the rooting medium , the resulting plant is much fuller . </root.v.5445><root.v.5446>To be sure , the problems which make the path to peace difficult and often discouraging are many and complex , but peace is a need deeply rooted in the heart of every man and woman.

Then returning to the original plant , select a shoot that is rooted near the center of the pot. Using floral pins or hairpins , lay the vine onto the soil surface as closely to the center as possible. Pin the vine to the soil at the leaf node. Spiral around the pot , pinning down every other leaf or so until you the reach the end of the shoot. All leaves should face up.

Any 1 year canes that are long and falling over because of shoot length should be pruned to a 2 to 3 foot height , depending upon the diameter of the cane. Do not let too many branches grow in the plant because they will crowd each other out and create weak shoot growth.

[ 5 ] In recent synods this vision has given us a better understanding of the vocation and mission of the laity ( 1987 ) and of the identity and mission of priests and their formation in the circumstances of the present day ( 1990 ) , as can be clearly seen in the post-synodal apostolic exhortations &lt; Christifideles Laici &gt; and &lt; Pastores Dabo Vobis. &gt; The ecclesiology of communion must now contribute to a deeper reflection on the consecrated life in the church.

Never use weak , damaged or diseased hedging plants and always handle hedging material with care. Do not clip roots unless it is absolutely essential. If you are going to plant within 7 days of receipt there is no need to heel hedging plants in just keep them in a cool place in their bags. If you are storing bare root hedge plants for over a week , heel them into a trench at a 45 degree angle. Cover the roots with soft soil and firm lightly. Hedging will keep for 8 weeks like this. Whatever you do , whilst keeping the roots damp until they are planted is important , please DO NOT put bare-rooted hedge plants in a bucket of water and leave them there; 30 seconds will do them a power of good but 48 hours will kill them stone dead . </root.v.5456><root.v.5457>Just sayin ' ...

Remove all leaves on the lower two-thirds of the cutting. This most likely will expose some cambial tissue on young cuttings. If the main stem has hardened at all , use a knife to scrape the stem on two sides to create a wound and expose more cambium. Most gardeners recommend the use of a rooting hormone like Rootone which provides synthetic auxins that imitate the plant 's hormonal response to wounding. Rooting hormone probably is not necessary with tender young growth but is recommended with woodier cuttings and is essential in some species. Pour some of the rooting hormone in a small lid or saucer , dip the prepared cutting in the powder and knock off the excess before planting. Do not blow the powder off as it can be toxic. Use the hormone conservatively as it promotes embryonic root growth but can inhibit further root development . </root.v.5464><root.v.5465>Figure 7.

The first which the church clearly understood remains rooted in misery and does not move from the spot. It thus signifies only unfruitful lamentation; nothing comes of it. Things are otherwise with divine repentance : As soon as inner disapproval arises in a man , he at once elevates himself to god and sets himself with unshakeable will armed securely against every sin. Thus , here , the direction upward is stressed anew and everything evaluated only according to whether it made the soul creative; elevated or not : But whoever may really have come into the will of god , will not wish that the sin into which he had fallen might not have existed.

The species with really large caudices , such as E. groenwaldii , should be treated very carefully during transplanting , as injuries , even fairly minor ones , to the caudex may often prove fatal; the plants should be watched carefully before normal watering is resumed. The thick stemmed plants will root from cuttings , but the cuttings may have to be dried off for what seems like a really unreasonable amount of time , up to a year , before being replanted to avoid rot.

If you choose to root it in water , keep the water temperature at 72-74F. Change the water every few days. Once you see root initiation , use a diluted flowering formula to promote root growth for about a week , then the cutting should be ready to plant.

No , the definition of the heart is that it is the depth of the mind , the mind being the surface of the heart. That in us which feels is the heart , that which thinks is the mind. It is the same thing which thinks and feels , but the direction is different : feeling comes from the depth , thought from the surface. When thought is not linked with feeling it is just like a plant rising up from the earth , the root of which has not gone deep. A thought without feeling is a powerless thought; it is just like a plant without a deep root. A tree the root of which has gone deep into the earth is stronger , more reliable , and so the thought deeply rooted in the heart has greater power.

" Our problem with sin is that it is rooted in the core of our being , permeating our hearts. It is because sin is at our core and not merely at the exterior of our lives that Romans 3 : 10-12 declares : " There is none righteous , no not one; there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God.

[ 87 ] In rejecting the view that scientific progress is better understood exclusively from a systematic perspective , detache [ d ] from its historical bonds , [ 88 ] Cohen remarks that the very value and security of science is rooted in its own history , connected , as it were , with the general history of mind [ Geist ] ( Cohen 1916 : 310 ) . This sounds odd since we have heard again and again that science is rooted in its method , but now are told it is rooted in its history. Perhaps the paradox is only seeming , for there is an intimate connection between the Marburg School 's notion of hypothesis as the active posit of mind , on the one hand , and its notion of science as essentially historical , on the other. Their conception of the logic of science as the dynamic Gang of categorial hypotheses implies that science can only be grasped developmentally , i.e. , historically . </root.v.5569><root.v.5570>In the task of understanding the 2004 US presidential election result , research into the moral values of christian fundamentalism has been vital.

The child is really only helpless if it is abandoned in time of need.

A healthy infant is biologically weak , not psychologically helpless. The crying infant is not helpless as long as his signal of need is reaching the parent in the way that nature intended. Genuine helplessness or recklessness in any infant produces major disturbances in its physiological functioning , such as lethargy , digestive disturbances , and hypermotile rage reactions. Fledglings throughout the animal world know what it is to claim parental attention and help.

It is human nature to try and distinguish one person from another. The questions arise : is such action for-better or for-worse ? good or bad ? invidious or constructive ? fair or unfair ? accurate or not ? PRE-judicial or merely a sorting ? There is abundant evidence that race ( viewed as a biological determinant rooted in genetic markers and their products ) is one lousy sorter. It just is n't very predictive at all. But it 's easy to see and thus a great tool for small minds that do n't care to delve further than the dermal layer or bone structure. Nonetheless , with other things like opportunity and information being equal , the statistics simply do n't stack up. Now , that is n't to say that cultural artifacts which surround members of a " racial " ( or ethnic ) category in a particular context do n't matter-they obviously do. They 're just not hard-wired into the DNA. This is where the " majority " and " minority " issues become important : who sets the rules for the dominant culture ? who gets to be the judge ? who 's scorecard applies ? what determines a " win ? " who exploits whom ? ( Cowan 1998 ) . </root.v.5594><root.v.5595>Brahman ( the Supreme Reality ) is Sat or Existence-Absolute. Truth must be observed in thought , word and deed. If you are established in truth , all other virtues will cling to you by themselves. Harishchandra sacrificed everything for the sake of truth. He lives still in our hearts. Yudhishthira was also devoted to truth. There is no virtue higher than truth. Practice of truth and Ahimsa constitute the crown and glory of ethical life. In the Taittiriya Upanishad , the preceptor says in his convocation address to the students : " Satyam vada " -Speak the truth. The world is rooted in truth. Dharma is rooted in truth.

Yet the life of the psalmist is severely afflicted ( verse107 ) , so much so that his life is continually at stake ( verse 109 ) .

This belief , arguably a central tenet of the middle class Victorian mindset , can be regarded as loosely rooted in the then popular philosophy of determinism. The extensive arrangements Eliza puts in place for her husband and the older of her two daughters while she is away place her firmly within this philosophical outlook. So too does her carefully planned journey to London with her younger daughter , Theodora. They set out from Aghadoe , heading first for Dublin on the recently completed railway. There is some shopping to be done. They go to Pim ' s department store. Dress-making fabric and lace are purchased. Instructions are given to have the items sent to their hotel.

They have high authority for most Buddhists , and they certainly enjoin a set of moral precepts that include a prohibition on the taking of sentient life.

The freedom of initiation is wholly rooted in the " I " . </root.v.5608><root.v.5609>Roses typically are fairly easy to root. If you have any of the long canes that are pliable enough to bring down to the soil level , you can layer the plant while it is attached to the mother plant. Simply , weave the plant in and out of the soil. The part that will be underground , should lightly be scraped on the underside , and then weighted down with a rock or brick to keep it from popping back out of the soil. This way , the plant will root while it is being supplied nourishment from the mother plant. You can also take cuttings , making sure there are no flower buds on the cuttings. Some people take them when pruning -- which on a climber is best done after the first flush of flowers. You can put the cuttings in the ground outside and put a glass jar over them , or do it indoors in a pot , sealed with a plastic bag. I like covering the cuttings to keep the moisture level and the humidity high during rooting. The individual cuttings should be no larger than three to four inches in length-no flower buds , or spent blooms . </root.v.5609><root.v.5610>Life is suffering , this is the teaching of the Buddha. Why is it suffering ? It must be that something makes this suffering. Yes , it is true; it is something rooted within , and when it is activated , it bursts out and gives rise to the fruit of suffering. Then we ask What is the root of suffering ? The answer which the Buddha himself gave , in Itivuttaka , is that the root of suffering is desire , which consists of three roots; greed , hatred and delusion. If the roots of suffering are eliminated , life can be extremely happy . </root.v.5610><root.v.5611>Paul prayed , " That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love , may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height; and to know the love of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God " ( Eph. 3 : 17-19 ) . </root.v.5611><root.v.5612>When I red some good books a few years later I learned how to grow clematis from cuttings with a much better and faster method.

It is true that in many cases contraception and even abortion are practised under the pressure of real-life difficulties , which nonetheless can never exonerate from striving to observe God 's law fully. Still , in very many other instances such practices are rooted in a hedonistic mentality unwilling to accept responsibility in matters of sexuality , and they imply a self-centered concept of freedom , which regards procreation as an obstacle to personal fulfilment. The life which could result from a sexual encounter thus becomes an enemy to be avoided at all costs , and abortion becomes the only possible decisive response to failed contraception . </root.v.5617><root.v.5618>The first batch of stump rooted carrots , as they are called by the National Vegetable Society , or other than long carrots as they are known by the Royal Horticultural Society will be sown this coming week. Sowing them as early as this will assure me of good roots from mid August onwards. They are grown in four raised concrete block beds filled with concreting sand which have produced consistently good roots over the past few years. Last year I had five beds but the fifth , the one nearest the hedge , has now been converted to growing celery. The slight shade resulting because of the close proximity of my Leylandii hedge will be far more beneficial to the celery than the carrots. Each bed will have 50 carrots sown so I should have plenty from which to select. The problem is which one to sow as the plant breeders are doing such marvellous work with carrots at the moment. Let me go through a few of them to examine their merits or drawbacks . </root.v.5618><root.v.5619>Although it appears there are fewer advantages than disadvantages to seeding a lawn , do not discount the importance of being able to select the desired species or cultivars and the fact that the turf plants develop in the environment in which they must ultimately survive. For example , obtaining perennial ryegrass or fine fescue sod will be difficult , perhaps impossible , in most areas of the region. If these species are desired in the lawn , seeding is the only way to establish them. In addition , soil incompatibility sometimes develops when sod is grown on soil that is different from that of the lawn area. Soil incompatibility can result in poorly rooted sod that has little tolerance to environmental or pest stresses. Thus , in many situations , the advantages of seeding may outweigh the advantages of sodding . </root.v.5619><root.v.5620>That 's easy.

The Seven Expression makes the individual very inwardly directed , reflective , retiring , almost shy and withdrawn. Yet , the Eight PE ( the Seven Expression combined with the One Lifepath ) will cause the individual to give a performance exactly opposite from his true nature because the Seven and Eight are opposite in characteristics. The Eight PE would make anyone not knowing the Seven individual personally see him as connective , integrating , social , outwardly motivated - anything but inward. Such a combination is very difficult for the person living it because of the opposing natures of the Seven and Eight. Two other combinations creating the same type of opposition in the Expression/PE duo are the Four/Five and the One/Two. Four is rooted; Five is free. One is male; Two is female.

The two lower leaves are removed , and the cutting is ready to be inserted ( click on illustration to see it full size ) . It is unimportant whether the cutting is taken immediately below a leaf axil or not , as either type will root easily at this time of year.

The best leaf cuttings are young leaves but any leaf will work such as damaged leaves you have to remove anyway. If the leaf is small you can just cut the petiole and insert it into the rooting medium. Larger or damaged leaves you should cut down as in the illustration leaving a round center of the leaf with the petiole. The remaining part of the leaf can be discarded or used for wedges. The reasons for cutting the leaf down is that it takes up less space in the tray and because the petiole will have less leaf to support. The cut down leaf will have less leaf surface to transpire from so the petiole won ' t have to provide so much water. Even if making wedges or cone cuttings , save that middle portion as an extra cutting. On difficult varieties , that portion will usually root , even if your wedges fail . </root.v.5641><root.v.5642>If you look up the word possessed when used in conjunction with the word demon or devil in the NT Greek , you 'll find that it means to be under the power ( influence ) of a demon , not to be owned by a demon.

So if half the sickness and diseases in the world today were demonically rooted , then a lot of people ( including Christians ) are without a doubt influenced by demons.

The more the soul is enslaved by pleasure and sadness , the more the tempter can manipulate it unwittingly , and the more the least renunciation will appear large and unbearable ( this is the reason why temperance is so closely linked to veracity , and intemperance to inveracity , inasmuch as its root lies in subjective , exaggerated perception ! ) . As a consequence , the renunciation of small pleasures and the bearing of small pains and discomforts ( sadness ) subjectively appear arduous. That is to say , the soul perceives them to be great evils. As such the soul opposes them with even greater aggressiveness and violence.

These will root easily if pinned into a damp growing media or can be clipped from the stolon and rooted under mist like any other clone. Runners or plants purchased in a dormant state ( usually available for sale in fall , winter and spring ) , can be held under refrigeration for as long as four to five months before planting out , allowing the season of fruit producing to be manipulated. However , the longer the plant is under refrigeration , the greater the chance of it losing viability , so only strong , well developed plants or runners should be given the extended chilling storage . </root.v.5658><root.v.5659>Many of his followers , known as Sabbateans , continued to worship him in secret , explaining his conversion not as an effort to save his life but to recover the sparks of the holy in each religion , and most leading rabbis were always on guard to root them out.

Ten years ago , we just had nine employees and two customers in China. But now , we employee more than 7000 people , and supply products for almost all the car factories in China. In 1995 , our revenue in China is 20 million dollars. In 2003 , the figure was US $ 650 million , which increased by 50 . Except supplying for the Chinese auto manufactures , we still exported our products to Europe and America and we got the revenue of 20 million dollars. Delphi also enlarged the purchase in China.

A Catholic who ( a ) is able to attend Sunday Mass ( i.e. , who is not impeded by illness , lack of transportation , etc. ) , ( b ) knows the seriousness of this requirement , and ( c ) nonetheless freely chooses to miss Mass , thereby commits a mortal sin ( cf.

The bubbling-well is a single point; the beginning of an important meridian. It is good for the energy circulation , but not necessarily for physical actions or movements. Based on Principles of mathematics and physics , three points determine a plane , and three basic colors combine to make all others. We need at least combinations of three elements , such as the three active nails , to execute all different physical activities.

Sand and vermiculite contain almost no soluble plant nutrients , and should be considered a rooting medium only. Most commercially available cactus soil is suitable for growing. You can produce your own high quality growing soil for pennies per gallon ( see Growing Lophophora and Trichocereus Cactus from Seeds ) . Levels of around 7.0 ph are most desirable. However , wonderful results have been achieved with a ph of 8.0 as well. The most important factor is to have a rich loam/sand soil mix ( 50/50 ) , as can be found under mountain trees of the southwest. Limestone or any other liming compound is suggested if ph levels are below 6.5. If fresh loam soil ca n't be found , you can compost leaves and pine needles into a naturally superior loam.

The central objection that commentators have raised is this : what 's so special about higher-order willings or desires ? ( See in particular Watson 2003a. ) Why suppose that they inevitably reflect my true self , as against first-order desires ? Frankfurt is explicit that higher-order desires need not be rooted in a person 's moral or even settled outlook ( 1982 , 89 , n.6 ) .

In 1972 , Herbert Benson and Keith Wallace published an article in the Scientific American The Physiology of Meditation which gave scientific credibility to an ancient spiritual practice that changes the body ' s metabolism , reduces stress and all its parameters and even offers a way of treating addictions. This search for healing of a problem , rather than control of symptoms , is one of the greatest draws of alternative medicine , and meditation is no exception to this effect ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . </root.v.5718><root.v.5719>The Bible teaches that we are to be uprooted , then replanted. We are not only to be replanted , but we are to become rooted and grounded in the love of God. We are to get rooted and grounded in Jesus Christ. Every single time you hear the Word of God , if you pay attention and do what God tells you to do , you get a little more healing.

John Evelyn writes in The Compleat Gard'ner ( 1693 ) , a translation of the French work by De la Quintinye that seed should be saved only from those plants that have the Reddest roots and fewest leaves. The round or turnip rooted radish seems to be known from an early date but is never as common as the long rooted radish during the 18th century. Stephen Switzer writes in Practical Kitchen Gardiner ( 1727 ); " the round rooted radish is not very plentiful in England. I had some seed from Holland , about seven or eight years ago , and it is indeed a much better kind that the common radish , " observing that it is not as hot and keeps better , by some call 'd Hanover radishes , in allusion to its turnep shape . </root.v.5722><root.v.5723>The book includes sections on Practical Steps to Change Our Condition , Taqwa : Its Definition and its Benefits , The Heart and its Treatment ( by Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi ) , culminating with a series of exercises on how to attain taqwa.

They enjoy well-composted soils , and as rule thrive in semi shade or cool positions on south facing aspects. They are ideally suited to growth under the shade of trees. They are generally shallow rooted and enjoy adequate water but they do store water in their stems and are resistant to prolonged periods of drought. Plectranthus are often grown for their attractive foliage , flowers or both and vary in their growth forms from dense prostrate ground covers to sub-shrubs and large shrubs . </root.v.5725><root.v.5726>The Bible is rooted in the belief that there is a single god that worshippers may worship , a being commonly referred to today as God. There are no other acceptable deities. Wicca , on the other hand , involves the reverence of two deities minimally , a god and a goddess. These are core beliefs of both religions , and they are not compatible. If you worship God alongside a goddess , then you are breaking the commandment to worship only God and denying his existence as the only God. It 's like saying " I 'll listen to you , but only when I feel like it. " </root.v.5726><root.v.5727>Roots formed in water may appear sooner than those formed in soil , but they may not be as sturdy and may have a more difficult time adjusting to being transplanted. Therefore , many growers prefer to propagate cuttings by rooting them in a sterile potting medium or soil mix. Sterilized growing mixes can usually be purchased at a garden center. Otherwise , a mixture of half sand and half peat moss is good for rooting most cuttings. Sterilize it by putting it into a 300-degree oven for an hour. Then moisten it before using. Stem cuttings should be dipped into a powder containing a rooting hormone and a fungicide ( available from a garden center ) before inserting into the growing medium. Insert the stem deeply enough so that the exposed nodes are covered. Keep the medium moist but never soggy. Maintain high humidity , perhaps by using a plastic bag as above or by frequent misting with water. Place the cuttings in bright , indirect light. After 5 or 6 weeks , cuttings should be rea ! dy for transplanting . </root.v.5727><root.v.5728>Throughout the entire encounter you ' ll need to constantly be moving to avoid biting cold.

Some are designed for general health and well-being and may be practiced every day for a lifetime. Others are therapeutic and targeted to cure specific problems. Qigong techniques are suitable for men and women , young and old , athletes and sedentary , and for the disabled. All styles are based on similar principles : relaxed , rooted posture; straight , supple spine; diaphragmatic respiration -- the abdomen expanding on inhalation , retracting on exhalation; fluid movements without excess effort; and tranquil awareness . </root.v.5731><root.v.5732>There is the concept of the Third World : thus , we already have three worlds. Undoubtedly , however , the number is even greater; we are just too far away to see.

As a minimum , we must include in this China , India , the Muslim world , and Africa , if indeed we accept the approximation of viewing the latter two as uniform . </root.v.5732><root.v.5733>One advantage of the matted row is that it provides plenty of plants for setting new beds. The best way to produce these is to use one of the new peat-and-fiber pots in which to root them. These pots come in three-inch round or three-inch square sizes , just right to produce a husky plant. The pot is filled with a rich composted soil and plunged under a likely-looking runner. By late August the rooted plant can be cut from the parent plant and used to plant a new row. Although fall-planted rows require protection for one additional winter , they are usually more productive than spring-planted rows. They can even be allowed to bear a light crop the first spring . </root.v.5733><root.v.5734>11. The ivies should root in 4-6 weeks.

The inter-ethnic or intra-ethnic conflicts often manifest as religions , boundary , political and farmland/grazing disputes between groups within or outside a community. Similarly , ethnic conflicts are variously manifested as chieftaincy , religious , land , native/settler , and political disputes. Most ethnic conflicts are often manipulations for economic motives. The Jukun/Chamba - Kuteb ethnic conflict has its origin on conflictual meaning and ownership of Takum , chieftaincy disputes , mutual feeling of marginalisation , and creation of USSA Local Government and problem of boundaries . </root.v.5735><root.v.5736>I 've rooted marijuana clones on the floor in my bedroom , and in many a veg room in the shade of a leafy mother.

If you take any one of the knowledge producing institutions or the situations where knowledge is maintained you will discover that the fundamental aims of the institutions is to make information mysterious , to mystify the simple , to keep children away from the advance levelsof information , and to distance some groups of people from access to information. In reality , the idea behind racial and gender discrimination is rooted in the limitations of access to knowledge because knowledge has become property reserved for a few. But this reservation of knowledge is motivated by the quest for domination . </root.v.5738><root.v.5739>So how might we understand this oftentimes mysterious and demanding process today ? Within the context of analytical psychology , we can begin with Jung ' s definition of it and proceed from there. " I use the term ' individuation , ' " writes Jung , " to denote the process by which a person becomes a psychological ' in-dividual , ' that is , a separate , indivisible unity or ' whole. ' " Jung ' s understanding of the impact and the nature of the individuation process came from his own experience , most dramatically from his own psychological crisis immediately following his break with Freud in 1913 , and subsequently , from his ongoing self-analysis , his work with psychiatric patients at the Burgholzli Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich , his study of ancient alchemical and Gnostic manuscripts , and his travels abroad , which included trips to India , Africa and the southwestern United States. It is very important to realize that Jung ' s understanding of individuation is rooted in his personal experience of that process. He underwent that of which he spoke , and hence could speak with some authority of what this process involves , or at the very least , of his own personal experience of this universal process . </root.v.5739><root.v.5740>An old acquaintance of Jabba Desilijic Tiure , Mon served as the Hutt 's liaison and took care of his estate while Jabba was away on business. The Hutt 's trust in Mon was founded in their life-long friendship , which saw the two friends pursue many collective paths , both having once worked together as high-risk gunrunners. After Jabba saved his life on Glakka , Ephant became the Hutt 's head of security , rooting out several conspiracies and assassination plots. Although he repaid his debt in abundance , Mon 's loyalty to Jabba was unswerving , and he kept his position for several decades , until Jabba 's death in 4 ABY. Mon was extremely loyal to the Hutt , for Jabba had once saved his life Mon regularly turned down extravagant offers from Jabba 's rival , Lady Valarian , who wanted to see the old Chevin leave Jabba 's employ and join her criminal enterprise . </root.v.5740><root.v.5741>This new way of thinking is fundamentally transforming our society.

They may be propagated by seed when available. Bottom heat greatly speeds up germination. Young plants should be watered frequently until tub-plant size. They need a rich , well-drained soil and a large tub. A large root-system is required for good bloom. In the summer they should be watered once a week with liquid fertilizer. In cold-winter areas , tub plants may be kept outdoors in summer and wintered-over in a cellar or similar place , as they require little moisture and light while dormant. When planted outdoors they should be sheltered from wind. Except for D. sanguinea , they may also be propagated by cuttings taken with heels , which root easily in water. D. sanguinea is the hardiest of the four . </root.v.5744><root.v.5745>Lemon Grass ( Cymbopogon citratus ) -The lower stalks of this tropical grass are highly valued for their fresh lemony flavor in Southeast Asia. Fresh lemon grass has become widely available in the USA in the past few years , and freeze-dried , powdered , and pureed versions are also available. For the best flavor , use only fresh lemon grass. Although only the most tender central portions of the stalk are used , they are nonetheless woody and are usually chopped very finely or cooked whole and removed from the dish before serving. Store-bought fresh stalk may often be rooted in a glass of water before transplanting to the garden where they will grow and multiply rapidly even in moderate climates , although the plant is tender and will not survive frost conditions. Use it for a taste of authenticity in almost all Southeast Asian soups , curries , and stir-fried dishes . </root.v.5745><root.v.5746>As there is a wide range of plant species , there are many different root structures ( Savory and Butterfield 1999 ) .

The material should hold enough water to prevent the lower end of the stem from drying , and it should also be free of insects and disease-causing organisms. Plants , such as gardenias , that prefer acid soil often root better in a mixture containing peat moss in addition to sand or perlite. Water is not a good medium to root most cuttings in because an adequate amount of oxygen ca n't reach developing roots. You 'll get a sturdier root system if you use another rooting medium.

Just as a graphologist can read a person through their writing , so a plant may be read through its growth pattern. This may include the colour of the flower , root structure , shape of leaves , preferred place of growth , the general shape of the plant , how it fruits , its yearly cycle , historical uses , folk law and so on.

We preach to men to give freely to Christ 's poor; but covetousness makes them like the man in the gospel , who had " a withered hand. " Mark 3 : 1. They have a withered hand , and can not stretch it out to the poor. It is impossible to be earthly-minded and charitably-minded. Covetousness obstructs the efficacy of the Word , and makes it prove abortive.

Crown-forming submergent plants such as Echinodorus , Cryptocoryne , or Barclaya must not be planted too deeply which means that you should plant them a little too shallowly , taking into account the final layer of gravel , which brings the substrate to the appropriate height. Branching or " stem-type " submergent plants , such as Anacharis , Hygrophila , and Ludwigia are usually sold as bunches of unrooted terminal shoots. They can be planted directly into the substrate , after removing the bottom foliage. Use a rock or stone to weight them down until they are rooted. Submergent floaters , such as Ceratopteris or Nymphoides , may simply be " released " and left to their devices; they will root as they grow.

In the light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience such judgment is found to be erroneous. The dishonest man may have some admirable virtues , which the other does , not possess; and the honest man obnoxious vices which are absent in the other.

Almost any size Trichocereus cutting can be rooted. The technique for rooting a very small specimen , say one inch tall by 1/8 inch in diameter is the same as for a large three foot tall by three inch in diameter plant.

Bulletin ( October 1992 ) . </root.v.5839><root.v.5840>The perfect time for planting is when the grass is rapidly growing. The grass stolons will root and become established more quickly. The range of St. Augustine in the U.S. is from the most southern reaches of Florida to just north of Dallas , TX. If you live most anywhere in the southern half of Florida where the grass grows continuously all year , almost anytime of year is a good time to plant. The soil temperatures need to stay above 60 degrees. If you live in the northern areas of St. Augustine grass adaptability range , fall may not be the best time to plant. The grass goes completely dormant in late fall and through winter . </root.v.5840><root.v.5841>By now stools should have been taken from their pots , washed , placed in new compost and placed on the cable. Whilst on the cable it is wise to keep them growing steadily by giving a weak feed and not neglecting to water when required. This way the cutting material is in a turgid condition , fresh and green and will root readily . </root.v.5841><root.v.5842>When the roots appear through the bottom of the pot put each rooted cutting into a pot in John Innes No.1 mixed with equal parts of sharp sand and grit . </root.v.5842><root.v.5843>Yeah - I appreciate Plax and what he did for us as well , no denying that. I also hope he learns from this and begins to think before he does rash things. My bullit was aimed more at the silliness of people judging who is a giants fan and not a Giants fan based on who we would like to see win in this years playoffs. Even when Bossy , Potvin , Smith and the Sutter Bros. were tearing my heart out in the '80 's After they eliminated the Rangers I rooted for them , because 1 ) keep the trophy in NY and 2 ) consolation of being beat by the champions - always hated losing to a team that could , t win the whole show in the playoffs . </root.v.5843><root.v.5844>13. , Peace on earth to those whom God loves ! From the problem of war , our gaze naturally turns to another closely related issue : the question of solidarity. The lofty and demanding task of peace , deeply rooted in humanity ' s vocation to be one family and to recognize itself as such , has one of its foundations in the principle of the universal destination of the earth ' s resources. This principle does not delegitimize private property; instead it broadens the understanding and management of private property to embrace its indispensable social function , to the advantage of the common good and in particular the good of society ' s weakest members. Unfortunately , this basic principle is widely disregarded , as shown by the persistent and growing gulf in the world between a North filled with abundant commodities and resources and increasingly made up of older people , and a South where the great majority of younger people now live , still deprived of credible prospects for social , cultural and economic development . </root.v.5844><root.v.5845>A collection of anecdotes , sayings , parables , and meditations from one of the most fascinating spiritual guides of the 20th century. Rooted as it is in a distinctively Indian idiom , his Christian wisdom challenges Western readers to step beyond theological ideas and encounter the essence of the Gospels . </root.v.5845><root.v.5846>Discovering in faith that in Jesus Christ God has given the definitive answer to man 's questions is precisely what gives faith its existential value. Existential faith is " a state of consciousness and an attitude " that give rise to actions by which the content of faith is lived out because it is seen to give meaning to life. [ 23 ] This , in turn , is the antidote to " the split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives [ which ] deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age " ( GS , 41 ) . [ 24 ] The awareness of the correspondence between those questions , rooted as they are in human nature , [ 25 ] and God 's answer in Jesus Christ , is the foundation for the joint witness of our own spirit and the Holy Spirit that Christians are adopted sons of God ( see Romans 8 : 16 ) . </root.v.5846><root.v.5847>There are two different ways to do hardwood cuttings of deciduous plants. Is one better than the other ? It depends on exactly what you are rooting , what the soil conditions are at your house , and what Mother Nature has up her sleeve for the coming winter. I have experienced both success and failure using each method. Only experimentation will determine what works best for you. Try some cuttings using each method . </root.v.5847><root.v.5848>Of course rooting Carnations with the Q Plug is currently used through-out the world , but the Carnations in these pictures are rooted in the Q Plug surrounded by air. That 's right , instead of using the cells as intended the rooting trays were turned upside down and the spaces were used between the cells to put the Q Plugs in with the desired spacing. That 's why you see the roots coming out right from the top and completely engulfing the Q Plug . </root.v.5848><root.v.5849>Integrity is not rooted in the public life. It is only revealed there as to whether we have it or not. Those with little integrity will eventually be exposed publicly. Integrity is not rooted in our professional life. It is only reinforced there. If we have integrity it is reinforced in our everyday professional dealings where we beat out its principles on the anvil of personal experience. Integrity is not rooted in the personal life of close , intimate relationships. It is only reflected there in our dealings with those who truly know us. Integrity , as beautifully illustrated in the life of Daniel , is rooted in the private life. It is that part of you that will live as long as God lives , the real you in close communion and fellowship with the Lord himself. When we root our integrity with Him alone , then just as natural as water running downhill , our integrity will be reflected to those in our personal world with whom we love and live , reinforced in our professional world with those with whom we work and play , and finally , revealed in the public world for the glory of God . </root.v.5849><root.v.5850>On the other hand , more deeply rooted species growing in well-drained soils can tolerate 2 to 4 inches of mulch. Coarser textured mulches ( such as large " nuggets " ) can be applied relatively thickly. You must be more cautious with the finer , more compactable , " double-shredded " mulches. A 2-inch layer usually is adequate to provide the benefits of mulching-weed suppression , moisture conservation , reduced frost heaving-without the negative consequences of overdoing it . </root.v.5850><root.v.5851>4.Mint can overtake a garden in short order during the summer.

This sensibility can vary in intensity and expression as a result of genetic factors , cultural patterns , and family up-bringing , but it is universal , appearing across societies , across history. Whatever the society , Wilson maintains , sympathy , fairness , self-control , and duty can be found at the heart of social life , even as they come into conflict with less benign natural impulses or with each other. Cultural relativists have focused too much on the disparate rules found from one society to another; the moral sense is best understood as a series of dispositions that will appear differently in differing circumstances. The theatre in which the moral sense is primarily nurtured or deformed is the family , a universal institution that is under severe pressure in the modern world , particularly in the West; if it is forced into bankruptcy as a result of this cultural and intellectual pressure , the costs will be considerable , including the further desiccation of moral life . </root.v.5852><root.v.5853>Jesus is the ultimate truth and reality and is the only one capable of filling the emptiness that exists in our life. But before this can happen we must first do three things. We must root and build our life in Him; we must pray with a sincere and pure heart; and we must be willing to accept the fullness that only God can give us. In other words , we need to strengthen our spiritual relationship with God. Now the question that remains is : will you take the first step ? </root.v.5853><root.v.5854>In the present experiment , the plants rooted in vitro before acclimatization and plants directly acclimatized in perlite had the most of roots with the highest fresh weight ( Table 1 and 2 ) . Dbski [ 2 ] observed the highest fresh weight of roots of glasshouse carnation 8 weeks after planting the plants from in vitro cultures into the substrate composed of perlite and sand in the proportion of 1 : 1 , and the largest number of the main roots in pure perlite. In the experiment by Borkowska [ 1 ] , who compared in vitro rooting of strawberry on a medium supplemented with 0.1 mg dm-3 IBA and in vivo in multiplates filled with mineral wool , the fresh weight of in vivo regenerated roots was higher than that of the roots regenerated in vitro. The root system produced in vitro consisted only of the main roots , which were breakable while the plants being pulled out from the medium. The most distinctly marked difference between the plants of strawberry rooted in vitro and in vivo was the relation of the dry weight of shoots to the roots. This parameter was smaller in the shoots rooted in vivo , thus indicating better development of the root system . </root.v.5854><root.v.5855>Like all great revolutionary thinkers , Engels tries to draw the attention of the class-conscious workers to the very fact which prevailing philistinism regards as least worthy of attention , as the most habitual and sanctified not only by firmly rooted , but one might say by petrified prejudices.

However , if the immune system is down , colds will take root. Spiritual rooted problem is in a broken immune system. People tend to get sick more when an event is about to take place in their life. Why ? Because the pressure is on people get offended easier , and brokenness of heart happens self-doubt , guilt and so forth roots up and now you have a broken immune system open to any floating virus. The virus itself is not a spiritually rooted problem , but letting it in , is. Keep protected by walking daily especially during stressful times in forgiveness with others and toward self. You are just as valuable when the even is NOT happening as when it is.

The dictionary meaning of the term eradication is " the act of rooting out , the condition of being rooted out , complete destruction and removal , extermination " ( Funk and Wagnall , New Standard Dictionary , 1939 -- entity ) . The term eradication is drawn in part from the words of Jesus to his disciples when he said , " Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. " The Greek form is . The same expression is found in Matthew 13 : 29; Luke 17 : 6; and Jude 1 : 12. When we change the form .

The Scripture says : Do n't discourage a child; build up his God-confidence. In fact the Scripture is more precise than that; it teaches : Do n't discourage a child , but do your best to root out his self-confidence and replace it with a confidence in God. And when it teaches us to root out self-confidence , it means root out the desire to be and to appear self-confident . </root.v.5863><root.v.5864>In this Letter the author expresses the truth about the Church as the bride of Christ , and also indicates how this truth is rooted in the biblical reality of the creation of the human being as male and female. Created in the image and likeness of God as a " unity of the two , " both have been called to a spousal love. Following the description of creation in the Book of Genesis ( 2 : 18-25 ) , one can also say that this fundamental call appears in the creation of woman , and is inscribed by the Creator in the institution of marriage , which , according to Genesis 2 : 24 , has the character of a union of persons ( " communio personarum " ) from the very beginning. Although not directly , the very description of the " beginning " ( cf. Gen 1 : 27; 2 : 24 ) shows that the whole " ethos " of mutual relations between men and women has to correspond to the personal truth of their being . </root.v.5864><root.v.5865>Parts of a plant severed from a parent plant and rooted to form new plants are called cuttings.

Purity of the spirit can not be achieved unless one exercises discipline , restraint and control over the internal and external forces of the world which are constantly urging and importuning the individual to be undisciplined , unrestrained , uncontrolled , unfaithful , if not down right wanton and dissolute. Thus , it is good to be rooted in the onslaught of such negativity , otherwise , one might well be destabilized , moved off course , and , thereby , denied the opportunity of achieving spiritual success which is generated and achieved by strength , courage , determination , and an absolute conviction and set of actions , behaviors and conducts which do not betray its manifestation . </root.v.5874><root.v.5875>This chapter may open up the depth of the teaching of Saint Therese on the " little way " in a whole new and exciting way !

Whether our income makes us ' rich ' is not the point , rather that we conduct our lives in a manner which is true to spiritual beliefs. When we are not moving or perpetuating the deepest beliefs that we have we are unhappy. This can be the case whether we have tons of money in the bank or just enough to buy us some food. Money does not cause our content or unhappiness. It can add to either but it is never the root cause. What does cause these emotional stirrings is how well we are manifesting our potential , our dreams , our spiritual connectedness and patterns. Closely related to that is just how much wealth we will be willing and able to experience in this lifetime . </root.v.5876><root.v.5877>Thippali is propagated by rooted vine cuttings or suckers.

It would not be difficult to write a set of programs implementing a Web Services API against MyLibrary. MyLibrary 's strength is its ability to read and write to a specific database schema. It essentially includes three tables : 1 ) resources whose " content model " is rooted in Dublin Core , 2 ) people whose " content model " is rooted in FOAF , and 3 ) facet/term combinations providing controlled vocabulary services against the resources and people. The problem with MyLibrary is a diminishing number of people who know how to write things in Perl. PHP , Java , Ruby On Rails , etc. are becoming more popular. Through Web Services this would be a non-problem , almost. Send a ( CGI ) script a URL containing a set of well-defined name-value pairs. Use the MyLibrary Perl API to process the query. Return to the client a similarly well-defined stream of XML. Allow the client to transform the data into services and applications.

Field grown , bare rooted or " root-balled " plants are " lifted " in late autumn for planting during the winter. Now , a vast number of plants are plants grown in containers and sold throughout the year. Container grown plants enable planting to be undertaken any time with little risk of failure - as long as the needs of the plants are met.

Place it in a moderately cool and dry location , so that the base will form a dry scab at least 1/8 " deep. The location must be shaded. The process usually takes 3-4 weeks. Once it has formed a scab , make two or three clean punctures with a sharp blade about one inch above the base. These openings will enable the cuttings to absorb small amounts of nourishment while it is developing roots. Then dip the entire base in rooting powder up to 1/2 " deep. Establish it in a container of pure sand or vermiculite. A small container is best because this will allow the rooting medium to dry back quickly between waterings , making the danger of root rot less likely. If you wish , you can take a section without a tip and bury one half of it horizontally , following the same steps outlined above.

Keep the medium temperature at 60 to 70 F until roots have been initiated but are only barely noticeable on the outside of the cutting. Then lower the temperature of the air and storage or rooting medium to about 40 F to complete the required cold ( rest ) period of the buds and hold back further root growth. Cuttings handled in this way are often tied in bundles keeping the basal ends all in the same direction. Plunge the bundle into the rooting or storage medium. When the root initiation and storage period are over , untie the bundles and plant the cuttings individually , usually outside in a closely spaced nursery row . </root.v.5889><root.v.5890>The proper application of both natural and synthetic hormones has enabled us to root cultivars that previously resisted the talents of the most sagacious propagators.

It is essential that tall trees and shrubs are well staked to avoid the plant being rocked in the wind which has the effect of breaking off any new root growth and will probably lead to the plant dying. This is also the best time of year to take cuttings from almost any of your shrubs - take cuttings of this year 's growth between six and twelve inches , dip the cut end in a rooting compound and plunge the cutting up to half its length in potting compost and sit it in the cold frame. Open the cold frame in mild weather and make sure the compost is kept damp but not too wet. By late spring next year the cuttings should be well rooted and new growth starting.

On receipt , these cuttings are not much to look at : a mass of roots with an " eye " or possibly one cut-off stem. Some cuttings are nondescript , making it hard to determine which part will give rise to the stem. Since it is important that the plant not be placed in the ground " upside down " ( in which case it will probably fail to come up , ) look carefully for either a short above-ground stem or an " eye " similar to a large bud. This " eye " should be planted at about ground level , with the rest of the cutting below ground. In the case of multiple " eyes " , try to plant such that each eye remains at about ground level. From such humble beginnings , elderberries will often grow 5 to 8 feet the first year and fruit heavily the second year . </root.v.5899><root.v.5900>I have a Behold II , so if an OS update isn ' t forthcoming from Samsung/Tmo , I ' ll be rooting to flash a stock Android ROM on that bad boy.

A stolon is a horizontal , often fleshy stem that can root and then produce new shoots where it touches the medium. A runner is a slender stem that originates in a leaf axil and grows along the ground or downward from a hanging basket , producing a new plant at its tip. Plants that produce stolons or runners are propagated by severing the new plants from their parent stems. Plantlets at the tips of runners may be rooted while still attached to the parent , or they can be detached and placed in a rooting medium. This method can be used with strawberry and spider plant , for example . </root.v.5901><root.v.5902>1. Make sure your cutting is healthy and the bottom cut is hardened off.

The plant takes root from the stolons at nodes along the stems when they come in contact with the soil. The white clover plant has compound leaves divided into three leaflets which are all joined at a central point and originate at the nodes along the stems. Leaves may contain a white ' watermark ' . White clover is adapted to many soils but tends to grow best in soils that are moist and low in nitrogen .The flowers are an aggregate of 20 - 40 individual flowers.

The importance of dialogue in a rooted approach to cosmopolitanism is growing in recent philosophical debates. Relying on the ancient idea of the 'citizens of the world ' , cosmopolitanism basically grants the ultimate significance to individuals and contrasts all particularistic political/moral barriers in formation of the community of mankind. Turning into a rooted insight , and in light of the impact of the process of globalization on social relations , a more recent version of cosmopolitanism celebrates the cultural differences among individuals , groups , and nations and draws on the dialogue among them as the corner-stone of the political community of mankind. The rooted conception of cosmopolitanism , indeed , highlights a terrain of exchange for the historically constructed identities extending across cultural , moral , and political boundaries. This patently cross-cultural insight into cosmopolitanism appreciates the underlying significance of dialogue in a recognition-based community of mankind in which deep diversity is celebrated as the crux of a peaceful life-world . </root.v.5920><root.v.5921>The cuttings should be made from the tip growth , cut from 2.5 cm to 10 cm ( 1 " to 4 " ) long , depending on the growth size of the plant you are trying to propagate. The lower leaves should be removed and often the ends of the top leaves are shortened to provide more space between the cuttings , to allow air circulation and to lessen the amount of foliage the scion has to feed while it is rooting. Wound the cutting with a cut on each side , about 12.5 mm to 25 mm ( 1/2 " to l " ) , just deep enough to cut through the bark. Dipping the cutting in a rooting hormone containing indolebutyric acid wll make rooting easier. The exact formula depends on the hardness of the cutting and the difficulty in rooting the cultivar you are tying to propagate. Experience is the only good teacher as to the strength needed , though most commercial rooting hormones will give some instructions . </root.v.5921><root.v.5922>National Baptists rooted in struggle for justice and equality ...

Dip the cutting tool in rubbing alcohol or a mixture of one part bleach and nine parts water to prevent transmitting diseases from infected plant parts to healthy ones. Remove flowers and flower buds from cuttings to allow the cutting to use its energy and stored carbohydrates for root and shoot formation rather than for fruit and seed production. To hasten rooting , increase the number of roots , or to obtain uniform rooting except on soft fleshy stems , use a rooting hormone that preferably contains a fungicide. Prevent possible contamination of the entire supply of rooting hormone by putting some in a separate container for dipping cuttings . </root.v.5925><root.v.5926>However , based on my experience it is beneficial to start doing your evergreen cuttings earlier than that. So instead of doing " by the book " hardwood cuttings you 're actually working with semi-hardwood cuttings.

But unless you know the center you are bound to feel a thrownness , as if life has been forced upon you. This center which is there , although man is not aware of it , is the concern of these sutras which we will discuss. Before we enter into VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA and its techniques concerning the center , two or three things more. One : when man is born he is rooted in a particular spot , in a particular CHAKRA -- center -- and that is the navel. The Japanese call it HARA; hence the term HARA-KIRI. Hara-kiri means suicide. Literally , the term means killing the hara -- the spine , the center. Hara is the center; destroying the center is the meaning of hara-kiri. But in a way , we have all committed hara-kiri.

If Hillary Clinton is the nominee , I suspect that the dominant media narrative will be the dynastic element of the election ( Bush-Clinton-Bush-Clinton ) . I suspect the media dynamic will be very similar to campaign 2000 , where press coverage was overwhelming tilted in favor of the Republican candidate. If Obama is the nominee , however , I suspect that the dominant media narrative will be the historic nature of the election. Coverage will revolve around America 's willingness to take a giant leap forward as a country and elect its first black president. And I think the mainstream press corps -- who are political junkies at heart -- will be rooting for that outcome , in much the same way sports fans rooted for the Red Sox in 2004.

The top ( grafted ) part is the Plumeria variety that you want to have. Grafting is an alternative to rooting a cutting , and is a rapid way to increase the growth and the chances of cutting survival. A graft becomes part of the plant onto which it has been joined and literally takes over to become the main tree ! One very positive note about grafted Plumerias is that they can bloom true to variety the first season. Cuttings are slow to root and can take a while to " get their bearings " and bloom as they should. For this reason cuttings will often wait until the second year to bloom true. The scar on the grafted plant will eventually become unnoticeable. The flowers will be true because the top part is the Plumeria you want to have . </root.v.5943><root.v.5944>For you , this can well be the first time that learning about a technology will not only be useful , it will be used.

In the words of the American sociologist Robert Merton , who formulated the norm in an influential essay in 1942 , " The acceptance or rejection of claims entering the lists of science is not to depend on the personal or social attributes of their protagonist; his race , nationality , religion , class and personal qualities are as such irrelevant. Objectivity precludes particularism ... . The imperative of universalism is rooted deeply in the impersonal character of science " [ 52 , p. 553 ] . For Merton , writing in the midst of the Second World War , when Nazi Germany sought to impose a nationalist " Aryan " ideology on its science , the universalism of Western science was a progressive attribute , indeed a central condition of progress itself. Universalism was linked to objectivity , or what Merton called " organized skepticism " and " disinterestedness " to establish a set of values that could ensure a knowledge free from ideological bias and that was central to a Western democratic societal developmental process . </root.v.5953><root.v.5954>Gnosticism is one of the most potent , complex , and misunderstood elements of western esoteric spirituality.

Don ' t let the rooted cuttings stay very long in the forsythe pot , since the vermiculite offers almost no nourishment for continued growth . </root.v.5958><root.v.5959>Prometheus : No news to me , in truth , is the message this fellow has proclaimed so noisily.Yet for enemy to suffer ill from enemy is no disgrace.

It 's long woolly , silver-white leaves form a basal rosette and soft silver flower spikes with purple flowers shoot up two feet. Lamb 's ear is very hardy , grows easily under all conditions and spreads readily. It is easy to propagate by digging up rooted stems. The leaves of lamb 's ear are so soft and furry that they are irresistible to children. These leaves are used in wreaths and dried crafts. Fresh leaves are used medicinally similar to a band aid to protect wounds and draw out infection. The leaves were also used in China to make a tea . </root.v.5960><root.v.5961>Vermiculite , a lightweight expanded mica product , is suitable for rooting cuttings.

The time before the second was too brief for new growth to go deep enough to root itself.

Only now , more than forty years later , can we begin again to repair the ruins of even the recent past , to pick up the pieces of that era in relation to the deeper questions of life. Only now can we say a prayer for those forgotten pathfinders of the thirties , and only now can we make yet another attempt to cultivate the soil of the human spirit - remembering that we are ourselves children of our century , so that in any such cultivation we must begin with ourselves . </root.v.5967><root.v.5968>The rooting medium may be clean sand , a mixture of sand and peat , all perlite or a mixture of equal parts of peat and perlite. We prefer the latter mixture which needs no sterilization. Mix the dry materials in a clean can , bucket or wheelbarrow then add enough water and Mix to wet thoroughly. Be sure you have sufficient drainage. All our cutting beds have 1/2 inch clean fine gravel and about 3 inches of rooting medium. A plastic pot or a clean tin can with drain holes makes a fine container for a few cuttings . </root.v.5968><root.v.5969>The rooting medium may affect the success of rooting and quality of the root system produced. When rooted in sand , cuttings of some plants produce long , unbranched , brittle root systems. When rooted in mixtures of sand and peat , the roots are slender , branched , and flexible. Differences in the air- and water-holding capacity of various media produce these effects. The container used for rooting may influence these responses if drainage is not adequate in the container bottom to prevent waterlogging . </root.v.5969><root.v.5970>+ All " true " ministry is rooted and grounded in love.

The muscadine types will be solid while the bunch grapes will have a softer or hollow pith. Other indications that you have a bunch grape are larger leaves with more fuzz and points on the margins. Muscadines have a thicker hull and the grapes are seldom found in large bunches. There was a wild vine near my parent 's house that was fairly reliable for bunches of eight but this was an exception. Many vines will have two or three grapes in a bunch.

One can not engage with these scholars and still retain any doubt that Jesus was political and was at least subversively , and perhaps revolutionarily , so. Especially important in this regard is the insight that the miracles Jesus performed were done with a political and eschatological end in mind. As a first century prophet , Jesus ' socio-political stance is firmly rooted within the traditions of Israel , and thus in the works of Horsley , Kaylor , and Herzog , the result is a convincing historical portrait of Jesus . </root.v.6007><root.v.6008>The cuttings are inserted in the ground with a minimum two-thirds of the cutting below ground as they will root along the stem.

Each one of us is here to recover our true selves in the ecstasy of a new manifestation of that eternal and blissful Divine consciousness. God delights in discovering and recovering Himself in new forms , and likewise , so do we. Cyber Therapy consists of identifying the cathections and the intellectual and moral falsehoods , which obscure this identity and ultimately , the ecstatic and depression-free living that is our birthright.

It honours the basic right of people to have a say in forms of decision-making. Following John Heron , ( 1989; 1992 ) I argue that institutions need to enhance human association by an appropriate balance of the principles of hierarchy , collaboration , and autonomy : deciding for others , with others , and for oneself . Authentic hierarchy provides appropriate direction by those with greater vision , skill and experience and is always concerned with transforming relationships so that those in relatively subordinate positions move toward greater skills in collaborative and autonomous action ( Torbert 1991 ) . Collaboration roots the individual within a community of peers , offering basic support and the creative and corrective feedback of other views and possibilities ( Randall and Southgate , 1980 ) . Autonomy expresses the self-creating and self-transfiguring potential of the person ( Heron , 1992 ) . The shadow face of authority is authoritarianism; that of collaboration peer pressure and conformity; that of autonomy narcissism , wilfulness and isolation. The challenge is to design institutions which manifest valid forms of these principles; and to find ways in which they can be maintained in self-correcting and creative tension ( Heron , 1989 , 1993 ) . </root.v.6011><root.v.6012>40.1.1 History holds the dramatic record of the tragi-comic failures of religious ethics.
