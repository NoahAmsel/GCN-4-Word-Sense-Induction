Is he to defy the central government ? Also , Alistair Darling made clear on BBC Newsnight last evening that there would be no divident payouts to aided banks.

Place one hand under the wrist and the other under the elbow. Lift the arm and if it is relaxed it will feel heavy and limp.

Once the muscles relax then the other components of the relaxation response will naturally follow. Relaxed muscles require less oxygen so the breathing pattern slows and deepens. The heart does not need to be beating so fast to carry oxygen out to tense muscles. Heart rate and blood pressure decline. The normal blood flow returns to the belly and digestion resumes. The belly is calmed. Hands and feet warm up. Such a series of bodily adaptations all start and fall naturally into place because the voluntary muscles are being directed into a state of relaxation. Soon changes in mood follow , and you become more calm and refreshed . </relax.v.46><relax.v.47>Now here 's the qualifier : remember that in my initial newsletter contribution on this subject ( 285 ) , I did not criticize arm weight per se but rather the tendency when using arm weight to introduce a basic structural weakness into the hand. Letting the arm go allows me to feel my structural alignments superbly. Why then undermine that crucial structure by softening and caving in the hand in an attempt to relax further ? Often this happens because a 'down ' movement is used to help arm weight 'clamp ' the finger to the key. No down movement is needed to have your arm 's weight connect the finger to the key; indeed , a down movement can disturb the exactitude with which this is felt , and lead to the hand 's structure caving in . </relax.v.47><relax.v.48>The science of relaxation is based on learning to control our nervous system.

For example , when a woman has uncomfortable feelings about sex or a particular sexual partner , she may tighten these muscles when engaging in or even thinking about sex.

Usually the child learns to relax his or her grip as writing develops , but teachers can remind students to hold the instrument gently. Frequent practice and letting the child write large letters , also helps children learn to relax their grip. The child will tend to naturally reduce the size of the writing as s/he attains better motor control ( Clark 1959 ) . </relax.v.802><relax.v.803>A good thing is nothing. Try not to think about the day behind you , nor the day that awaits you.

You will notice your sticks come together so they are almost parallel. The French grip is unique because the way you are holding your sticks changes from palms down , to palms up. This means you can get a lot more speed by using your fingers. The only down side to this is the lack of power you will get from your strokes . </relax.v.806><relax.v.807>In Srinagar , the summer capital of Indian Kashmir , people swarmed into grocery shops as authorities relaxed a curfew for more than an hour.

If you move the wheel under a hand that is gently touching the wheel you should hear the quiet sound of the wheel 's leather sliding against skin. If you were looking at a photograph of somebody shuffle steering , you would be unable to tell the difference between gripping and touching , as they look the same. ( You could only tell by watching a video of the wheel turning. ) Your hands never leave contact with the wheel. If the wheel is stationary , both hands are gripping. If the wheel is moving , one hand is gripping ( the one that is turning the wheel ) , and the other hand is sliding , although you should " unwind " the wheel by relaxing both grips. If the wheel is stationary you can change the height of your grip ( say from 11 and 1 to 9 and 3 ) by quickly relaxing and sliding the left hand and then doing the same with the right ( or the converse , of course ) . </relax.v.808><relax.v.809>[ ... ] Read this and learn to relax in the middle of the storm.

As you learn to relax unnecessary tension in poses , you will find that your body becomes more pliable and responds dramatically to even the slightest effort. In many poses gravity alone is more than sufficient to create a wonderful stretch. Having released unconscious residual tensions that hold you back - to the best of your ability , only then is it safe and appropriate to actively seek deeper stretches in a pose.

Your goal is to learn to ' relax ' , to learn what the relaxed state ' feels like ' . Read through the instructions a couple times , practice each a couple times , then do all the exercises in the order presented. Many people find that lying on their back on the floor is most conducive to ' relaxing ' , while others prefer to sit either cross-legged on the floor or in a straight backed chair. But remember you want to relax , NOT go to sleep. It is useful to do these exercises each day at the same time , in the same location. Pick a quiet location. Immediately after arriving home from work , or before bedtime are often good times. A quiet bedroom is often a good location. After you learn the techniques , you will find that you can ' relax ' while sitting up ( back straight , shoulders back , feet flat on the floor ) , in a noisy room. The key is learning to focus on ' relaxing ' . You will learn the techniques within a week , but actually becoming proficient at voluntarily relaxing can take 1 to 3 months of practice in your ' quiet place ' . </relax.v.821><relax.v.822>Your first job will be to learn to recognize tension in your body.

However , I remember that one of " Dear Mr Matthay 's " oft-quoted maxims was 'steel fingers in velvet gloves ' , which suggests that a relaxed arm was intended to be combined with strong fingers. On the subject of jabbing notes down causing harsh tone , as far as I am aware all the scientific evidence is that the piano player can only control the volume of the note , not its timbre , up to the point where the volume attempted is too great for the instrument , causing the string to vibrate longitudinally as well as transversely , which would then cause unpleasant overtones to be produced. If this is true then all tonal effects must be produced by the way sounds are combined , i.e. in the connecting gesture rather than in the way individual notes are put down. So I would like to ask Raymond and Alan whether they know of any more recent research having been done on this subject ? </relax.v.823><relax.v.824>Luckily for us , calm abiding meditation has several powerful side-effects and one of them is that i combats stress in a very efficient way - by relaxing the body and mind.

Some collect and organize coins or stamps , some draw and paint others write or ' blog ' . Whatever it is should put you into a state of slow down so your mind can relax and the move to sleep is but a short step.

How far you can move your shoulder after surgery depends a lot on how far you could move your shoulder before surgery. Some people are not able to move their shoulder far enough to allow them to do their regular daily activities , even after several weeks of recovery. If this happens , the doctor may give you a medicine to relax your muscles and will gently force the shoulder to move farther. This may loosen tissues around the joint that are preventing you from bending it . </relax.v.829><relax.v.830>Feel heaviness in each part of the body. Start at the feet ( or the head ) and feel it being very heavy; totally surrender to gravity , and release any tension which would prevent that part from succumbing to the natural downward pull. Remain with that part until it is thoroughly relaxed. Then proceed to every other part of the body , one at a time. During this meditation , we might simply feel the actual heaviness of the part , or we might exaggerate that weight by imaging ( or visualizing ) that it is many tons. Although the part can be allowed to sink naturally under the influence of gravity , we can also test this state of relaxation by pressing that part firmly toward the floor , to see how much farther it might be able to go , and then relaxing the part. A variation of this exercise is to feel " lightness " ( rather than heaviness ); experience your body becoming so serene and light that it could float into the sky . </relax.v.830><relax.v.831>Although some ( e.g. , Smith , 1988 ) suggest that the symptoms of relaxation-induced anxiety can be therapeutic if subjects can learn to relax through the experience , there is data showing that this type of experience predicts poor treatment prognosis ( Borkovec , Mathews , Chambers , Ebrahimi , Lytle , &amp;Nelson , 1987 ) , and it may even contribute to high dropout rate in relaxation therapies. When clients experience AT or meditation-induced anxiety , clinicians should consider using PMR methods. PMR is an effective method to minimize physiological tension prior to meditating ( Girdano , Everly , &amp;Dusek , 1990 ) . </relax.v.831><relax.v.832>" Regular practice of deep relaxation for 20-30 minutes on a daily basis can produce over time , a generalization of relaxation to the rest of your life.

" </relax.v.832><relax.v.833>Emotional Tension arises from various emotional feelings which are sometimes more difficult to erase like love and hatred , profit and loss , success and failure , sadness and happiness. This is because we are unable to express our emotions freely and openly. Often we refuse to recognize them , so they are repressed , and the resulting tensions become more and more deeply rooted. It is not possible to relax these tensions through ordinary sleep or relaxation. A method such as yoga Nidra can tranquilize the entire emotional structure of the mind . </relax.v.833><relax.v.834>Commissioners intend to decide this spring whether to relax or ax a basket of decades-old media ownership rules intended to provide multiple owners and voices in a market.

Over the years , it becomes necessary to control and even suppress these natural urges to rest , since we must remain alert as we attend school , learn professions , go to work , or care for a family. Many people spend years conditioning themselves to perform well despite feelings of tiredness. While no one would argue that suppressing tiredness can be a necessary skill , it can impair our ability to actually " let go " and relax when we do find the time . </relax.v.836><relax.v.837>1.

This process is called Deep Muscle Relaxation . </relax.v.842><relax.v.843>The Government has published plans on how it might regulate the video on demand industry.

Heat will increase your menstrual flow , so keep the water a little cooler if heavy flow is a problem. Add one cup of sea salt and one cup of bicarbonate of soda to the tub. This is a highly alkaline mixture and I recommend using it only once or twice a month. I 've found it very helpful in reducing cramps and calming anxiety and irritability. Soak for 20 minutes.

Then once I got home I had to clear some floor space , take a deep breath and start throwing plates at the floor , breaking them into itty bitty pieces.

The interconnectedness of the body , the psyche , and the emotions , means that relaxing one leads to relaxing the whole. We could begin with relaxing our emotions , but the subtlety and intimacy of emotions makes them harder to perceive objectively and more difficult to relax. With our inner eye of attention , however , we can with relative ease inspect our body , checking its various parts , noticing the tensions in the muscles , and allowing them to subside. We can relax systematically by beginning with the face , the head , the neck , and gradually moving down through the entire body. In this way we can work at thoroughly relaxing the large and small muscles throughout our body.

Bring the bat back on your shoulder , and then get in your stance with the hands in the launch position that is most comfortable for you. The knuckles will almost be lined up. Coaches differ on which knuckles to line up anyway. So I lineup my door knocking knuckles or all four rows of knuckles. Old-timers , relax , physics will take over and the knuckles will line up naturally as the hands enter the hitting zone. The grip will tighten naturally throughout the swing. Too much emphasis is put on lining up the knuckles while in the stance and worrying about when to tighten the grip. This causes tension in the grip , which causes tension in the arms. This slows the hands into the hitting zone. A loose , relaxed grip with the bat in the fingers ( never back in the palms ) combined with a relaxed , balanced , comfortable stance gives the batter the best chance of hitting the ball frequently and with authority. The follow through of the swing will occur naturally because the swing is fluid and relaxed . </relax.v.1072><relax.v.1073>Part of the problem for many people is that they think of relaxation as " filler , " something of no actual importance - an absence of activity.

New Zealand shows how a set of rules can gradually be developed , and refined and strengthened in the light of experience. In some cases they have been tightened ( eg the rules on dissolution ) , in others relaxed ( the rules on collective responsibility ) . The Cabinet manual is drafted and periodically revised by officials , and the Cabinet Secretary involves all the key stakeholders ( Governor General , law officers , politicians , constitutional experts ) in the process. The Cabinet Secretary holds the ring , but it is a set of rules with no single constitutional guardian. Through their involvement in helping to articulate the rules , and revising them , all the key actors are more likely to observe the rules in practice . </relax.v.1100><relax.v.1101>we can relax the muscles in our face , shoulders , etc.; we can stretch and yawn ( fear is just tension -- no tension , no fear; and tension is just frozen energy ) . </relax.v.1101><relax.v.1102>Progressive muscle relaxation is a technique designed to reduce tension in the body. It requires the person to systematically work through each muscle group in the body , step by step , consciously and deliberately relaxing each muscle group in turn and not moving on to the next until relaxation has been achieved in the muscles that are the focus of attention. Thus tension in muscles is progressively removed. These states of tension occurring in both body muscles and especially in the muscles of the scalp and head and neck can result from a buildup of stress. Progressive muscle relaxation helps induce feelings of calm and reduces tension pain resulting from chronic muscular contraction . </relax.v.1102><relax.v.1103>Allow your partner to relax their arm for a moment.

In nearly every case , your partner will be unable to resist the pressure and their arm will go down easily. Although you are using the same amount of pressure , the arm goes weak. What has happened ? The energy field of the sugar has negatively influenced the energy field of the body and the indicator test muscle ( the Deltoid in this case ) has lost its strength.

Much of this pressure has come from the government as part of its general healthy lifestyle agenda. In addition , at the recent ASA stakeholder consultation event held in November 2008 ( ' Alcohol Advertising the right measure ? ' ) , various comments were made about the appropriateness of alcohol advertising and sponsorship in sport. Whilst alcohol misuse is of great concern , the challenge for the UK sports industry seems , therefore , to be one of resisting further restrictions or changes to the current position. As many rights owners are discovering that the economic downturn is leading to a flight away from sponsorship and a reduction in sponsorship revenues and appetite to renew , those entities need to ensure that they continue to treat alcohol sponsorship responsibly and guide the government to tackle areas which have been shown to have a causal link to harmful drinking such as happy-hour promotions . </relax.v.1123><relax.v.1124>Here is a little test to see how effective these exercises have been at improving your balance , position , and confidence.

The use of gravity can eliminate all unnecessary forces or tenseness. It might seem like a curious coincidence that the force of gravity is just the right force for playing the piano. This is no coincidence. Humans evolved under the influence of gravity. Our strengths for walking , lifting , etc. , evolved to match gravity exactly. The piano , of course , was designed to match those strengths. When you are truly relaxed , you can feel the effect of gravity on your hands as you are playing. Some teachers emphasize relaxation to the point of neglecting everything else until " total " relaxation is achieved; that may be going too far -- being able to feel gravity is a necessary and sufficient criterion for relaxation. The gravity drop is a method for practicing relaxation. Once this relaxed state is achieved , it must become a permanent , integral part of your piano playing. Total relaxation does not mean that you should always play the piano using only gravity. Most of the time , you will be applying your own force; " feeling gravity " is just a way of measuring your level of relaxation . </relax.v.1139><relax.v.1140>Lie on your back with legs and arms out from the body.

Thus , relaxation is most effective when used as a one component of treatment , rather than as treatment itself ( Barlow et al. , 1998 ) .

" finds that from 2000 to 2003 , four of the nation 's largest radio companies were responsible for 96 of FCC indecency fines , while their stations accounted for only about half of the country 's listening audience.

The report concludes that , " One of the unintended consequences of their support of deregulation is an increase in indecency. " Rather than increase fines for indecency , the report suggests that a more effective and First Amendment-friendly approach to the indecency problem would be to reintroduce meaningful station ownership caps , limit vertical integration of program ownership , and promoting localism and diversity of voices in our nation 's media.

Then when you decide it ' s time to take the plunge , simply turn on the tap which allows fresh water to flow in on top of the mat while the water below flows out.

Let go of the breath and allow your awareness to become open and spacious . </relax.v.1280><relax.v.1281>During the day we often find opportunities to relax emotionally. For example , an aggressive driver cuts us off. We react with anger. We could instead consider his state : perhaps a personal emergency , perhaps he has had some bad news and is full of tension , perhaps he is late for an appointment , or perhaps he is habitually inconsiderate. Regardless of what his actual state might be , we prefer not to let the event drag us into the mud. Not that we release others or ourselves for responsibility for actions , but we do seek to relax emotionally in difficult situations , not to be overwhelmed by our reactions. Such opportunities for emotional relaxation abound. To the extent that we are present , we can respond appropriately and with choice to life ' s challenges , rather than responding from reactive tension and self-centered views. Of course , it ' s easy for me to write this , and perhaps easy for you to read this , but for both of us it may not be so easy to actually put it into practice.

This lies at the heart of the majority of neurotransmitter malfunctions and chemical deficiencies in the brain. Simply put , if the tense muscles are relaxed , then the organs in the surrounding area ( including the brain ) recover their lost energy , and then the body is enabled to regulate itself properly again. Even so , the process is slightly more complex than that : the tension fills the role of both cause and effect in the emotional disorder , creating a vicious cycle . </relax.v.1294><relax.v.1295>Even as you are relaxing and feeling your tension drain away , remember to continue focusing on your breath.

Since the relaxation response counteracts the stress response , it is impossible to be both relaxed and tense at the same time. Further , the relaxation response can reduce existing distress and eventually ameliorate its effect. Progressive muscle relaxation is a simple and effective way to help patients learn how to relax . </relax.v.1301><relax.v.1302>Actually , if we had a finely-tuned electromyograph hooked up to you measuring the level of tension in your muscles , it would show that you relax more and more and more for up to 20 minutes.

From shomen dachi ( a stance with hips in shomen ) , our muscles are switched on . We then must relax the muscles , allowing the hips to return back to the middle , natural state , only to switch the same muscles back on to produce shomen again. Therefore , if we consider shomen hanme or hanme shomen twists to be one full movement , then this shomen relax shomen is two half movements , producing the strength of one full movement.

The ban was put in place in 1996 to ensure that people did n't eat cattle old enough to harbour BSE. But the number of BSE cases has dropped steadily since 1997 , and the FSA now thinks the time is right to check whether the precautions are still necessary. " As with all the BSE controls , this rule should be maintained for as long as it is needed to protect public health , " says John Krebs , who chairs the agency . </relax.v.1310><relax.v.1311>The evidence is clear; there 's no doubt that physical exercise has a positive effect on stress and can calm the mind and relax the body.

Localized relaxation of muscle groups allows one to relax a particular , limited group of muscles. A different technique is required to reduce these widespread , generalized tensions.

In my experience , such an endeavor usually fails; the person gets discouraged and usually gives up. To learn the violin , you need instruction from someone who plays the violin and the more accomplished the player the better. You want to learn the violin from someone who plays it everyday , who is excited about it , and whose expertise is obvious. Imagine learning the violin from someone who does not play it. The obstacles to learning to play the violin and learning to relax deeply are very similar -- - except learning to deeply relax a painful pelvic floor is harder than playing the violin . </relax.v.1582><relax.v.1583>The relaxation of the muscles in the forearms , wrists and hands , has a direct bearing on the accuracy of a putting stroke.

You drift into a meditative state and , as an abundance of research has shown , this can boost the immune system and optimize self-healing.

He found it cold , uncomfortable and he hated baths , which made it a stressful experience for all of us. Then I discovered what the Europeans have been doing for years. They bathe their babies in tubs that let them sit in a natural upright position with warm water to their shoulders. The tub calms the baby by providing an environment much like the one where they spent their very first nine months. It 's no wonder they relax completely and enjoy it so much ! And best of all , it is easy to use from newborn until your baby can go into an adult tub. It 's even great for colicky babies. So relax during bath time , and treat your baby to a Spa Baby . </relax.v.1652><relax.v.1653>This breathing is one that I , as a midwife , encourage for women in labor , especially during contractions.

When there is no tension in the arm at full draw , you can see the hand and wrist want to twist behind the fingers. The twist can be seen in the line made by the four base knuckles.

When I first learned this technique from Dr. Benson 's , I remember him telling us his dental analogy. He told us to treat the relaxation response the same way you treat brushing your teeth.

" would you ? Whether you " felt " it was a calming , relaxing experience or not , the physiologic benefits of doing the relaxation response are measurable , predictable and repeatable.

We breathe deeply and focus on our toes and feet. We scrunch up our toes and feet , curling them toward our arches. We note the feeling of tension there and then relax our feet and toes. This allows the mind and body to experience muscle relaxation. We progress up the leg , tensing the shin and calf muscles , holding them for a few seconds , and then releasing those muscles. We continue to tense and release all muscle groups in the body , all the way up to the face. By the time we reach the face , our bodies should begin to feel relaxed . </relax.v.1885><relax.v.1886>Gradually tense and release the muscles down through your torso , arms , fingers , legs and toes.

For example if you are asked for advice you usually give more than what was intended and end up doing something not too benefiting for yourself. Take knife work for example. If you work to complete a deflection or a step rather than making the goal clear in your head you will end up moving in directions that can get you killed or worse getting a loved one killed. Work first in evading one attacker with a knife ( you work with the person rather than against the knife ) focus on moving just to get the job done and note if you move more than you have to. Add a second attacker and again this is great to feel where you move without care or complete what has no relevance. Add another one and remember to keep both eyes free and relaxed from focus and after a while a good clean sense of survival and letting go of the outcome will emerge. This way you will do just what is needed and no more. This way you may survive . </relax.v.1887><relax.v.1888>If the stimulation continues and the muscle is never allowed to relax completely , tension will rise to a peak ( Figure 10-13b ) .

To avoid being caught by the teacher , he answered quietly and discovered an unexpected caller. Why are you answering the phone in class ? Gray ' s mother asked. He whispered back , You ' re the one who called me. His mother said she had intended to leave a question on Gray ' s voice mail. Such scenes are playing out across the country , as hundreds of high schools have reluctantly agreed to relax their rules about cellphones in schools. Rather than banning the phones outright , as many once did , they are capitulating to parent demands and market realities , and allowing students to carry phones in school though not to use them in class. The reversal is a significant change from policies of the 1990 ' s , when school administrators around the country viewed cellphones as the tools of drug dealers. In Florida , carrying a cellphone in school could be punishable by a 10-day suspension. In Louisiana , it was deemed a crime , with a potential penalty of 30 days in jail . </relax.v.1894><relax.v.1895>Contains a reliable post-hypnotic suggestion so you can go into a lightly relaxed state any time.

But tensions of all kinds , particularly muscular and emotional tensions , sap our energies , wastefully burning them up. Tensions create the proverbial hole in our bucket , our leaky spiritual vessel. The amount of energy that accrues to us naturally on any given day would suffice to take us very far , if we could stop wasting energy on tensions. To be sure , we have other holes in our bucket , but tensions wreak havoc with our energies. Intentional relaxation , though , can plug these drains. In addition , work with relaxation can go beyond releasing tensions , for example in relaxing the grip of the inner forces that keep us from our true nature. In these ways , relaxation serves as an essential element of balanced spiritual work.

Knapp , Downs , and Alperson ( 1976 ) suggests that the majority of the relaxation training significantly reduces the latency to sleep onset and the number of awakenings. There is some evidence that PMR also improves pseudoinsomnia ( self-reported insomnia ) ( Greeff &amp;Conradie , 1998 ) . Because cognitive rather than physiological arousal is critical to the cause and/or maintenance of insomnia , several researchers recommend a combination of CT and PMR methods ( Lacks , 1987 ) . A recent study has also found that self-administered treatment of progressive relaxation training is highly effective in treating insomnia. After a one year follow-up period , patients had learned to relax to an average of 83 , and also learned to achieve a state of calmness which improved their overall sleeping patterns by 86 .

You can either begin at the head and work down through the body or start from the toes and work up to the head . </relax.v.2037><relax.v.2038>1 ) Music : For many people , music is effective. It bypasses the sensor and can draw you in , in a meaningful and pleasurable way. Most all cultures have rituals based in music that have evolved over many centuries. The key here is to focus on what music evokes in you. The idea is to feel something. Numbness is not equivalent to relaxation. If any activities are making you feel numb , then you are narcotizing yourself , not relaxing . </relax.v.2038><relax.v.2039>Stand on the shooting line with one foot in front of the shooting-line and the other behind the line. Your feet should be shoulder width apart and you should just try to stand firm and yet relaxed with equal weight on both feet. Keep your legs straight but not unnecessary rigid. You might put the foot behind the line a little bit forward and you will then maintain what is referred to as an open stance. How many degrees the open stance should have is individual.An open stance might give better clearance for the string and many archers also feel more stable when an open stance is used. The open stance is preferred by some elite archers because it gives them a better feeling of stability when shooting in the wind. It 's important to use the same stance every shot , so some markers on the ground or some tape on the floor can be used. There is nothing wrong with a square stance , i.e. stand with your feet in line with the target as long as you do n't encounter clearance problems . </relax.v.2039><relax.v.2040>These concepts may seem strange when you first begin because they are not how we normally view our bodies. Energy ( described as chi in Tai Chi Chu'an practice and prana in Yoga ) is considered the essence of all living things , the essence that makes up all existence. The sensation of energy coming into the body , circulating , and being stored comes with practice. The more you relax and visualize this circuit the more readily it will be felt . </relax.v.2040><relax.v.2041>Telling someone to feel good may have the opposite effect. Hopefully , we all know that it is fruitless and even demeaning to try changing how someone feels by telling them how they should feel. According to the implications of the study , we can actually make someone feel worse ( stressed ) as a result of trying to get them relaxed while their minds are at work. This applies to managers giving performance feedback , parents disciplining children , and coaches working with clients. Healthy people are designed to live and learn by living and learning through the depth and breadth of their emotions. Attempting to alter the truth of what someone is experiencing will inhibit their process. And you wo n't be seen as helpful . </relax.v.2041><relax.v.2042>Investigate how you are feeling. Expectant or tense ? Then relax your attention a little. With this , the mind will probably calm down , and you may find some thoughts drifting in reflections , daydreams , memories , or doubts about whether you are doing it right ! Instead of following or contending with these thought patterns , bring more attention to the body , which is a useful anchor for a wandering mind . </relax.v.2042><relax.v.2043>Having 1-1/2 inches between the two measurements puts you at the approximate 10 level of body fat. A greater number is exceptional. The largest difference I 've ever measured was on the arm of Casey Viator , who won the 1971 AAU Mr. America. Casey 's right arm was 17-1/8 inches relaxed and 19-5/16 inches contracted which amounted to 2-1/4 inches between the two numbers . </relax.v.2043><relax.v.2044>To relax in T'ai Chi is more than just what people commonly think of when they use the word relax. To relax is our natural inheritance. We are born with the ability to relax. But we often leave it behind early in life , in our pursuit of other personal needs or cravings . </relax.v.2044><relax.v.2045>However it is a good idea , in the beginning , to train yourself to relax in a sitting position so that you will be able to relax at will just about anywhere and for just a few minutes e.g. in the dentist chair , while waiting for a train or plane , before an important interview or presentation , etc . </relax.v.2045><relax.v.2046>This practice can also help us to achieve release from mental and emotional pain. The stress that accompanies such pain usually produces physical tension. By relaxing the body , as outlined above , then extending the thought of physical relaxation to the release of tension in the mind and in the emotions , we can achieve mental and emotional tranquility with the release of tension in the body . </relax.v.2046><relax.v.2047>Turning your attention to your head , wrinkle your forehead as tight as you can. Now relax and smooth it out. Let yourself imagine your entire forehead becoming smooth and at rest. Now frown and notice the strain spreading throughout your forehead. Allow your brow to become smooth again. Close your eyes. Squint them together and look for the tension. Relax your eyes. Let them remain closed both gently and comfortably. Now , clench your jaw , biting hard - noticing the tension throughout your jaw. Relax your jaw. When it is relaxed , your lips will be slightly parted. Appreciate the difference between the tension and relaxation. Now press your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Feel the ache in the back of your mouth. Relax. Press your lips together. Now press them into an o . Relax your lips. Notice that your forehead , scalp , eyes , jaw , tongue , and lips are all relaxed . </relax.v.2047><relax.v.2048>It ' s hard to get the break we need to unwind and de-stress. Relax Now includes the proprietary power of jujube seed , passionflower and ashwagandha to help relieve stress and relax your body naturally.* </relax.v.2048><relax.v.2049>Now , look at your female organs. See your uterus and ovaries. They are an attractive pink color. Your uterus is relaxed and supple. Any fibroid tumors are melting away as you look at them. Your uterus is becoming its normal size and shape. Your uterus has good blood circulation. Look at your ovaries. They are extremely healthy and put out just the right levels of hormones. They are shiny and pink and look like two almonds. The fallopian tubes that pick up the eggs and bring them to the uterus are totally open and healthy . </relax.v.2049><relax.v.2050>One way to avoid uncontrolled tension is to cultivate the ability to relax at will. In the 1930s , Edmund Jacobson developed a simple technique for this called progressive relaxation. Jacobson said it was important to learn to recognize and create the feeling of muscle relaxation by contrasting it with the feeling of muscle tension. Therefore a person learning Jacobsonian progressive relaxation practices tensing and relaxing various muscle groups of the body , from the feet up. At each level one is supposed to notice the feeling of muscle tension ( when muscles are tense ) and the contrasting feeling of relaxation ( when letting go ) . Gradually one learns to discriminate the feeling of relaxation , then to bring it under control , so it can be made to happen at will . </relax.v.2050><relax.v.2051>When relaxed or sleeping , we breathe with the abdomen. This is the most relaxing to the body because carbon dioxide is expelled and oxygen inhaled efficiently. When we feel stressed , our breathing pattern changes to short , shallow , regular chest breaths , or we hold our breath. This type of breathing is not effective in inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide. This further stresses the body. Since waste products were not removed during the breathing out , they build up in the bloodstream and we feel more anxious . </relax.v.2051><relax.v.2052>There is no need to relax the rules on return of Pension Fund surpluses to the Employer , as this should never be allowed until the last beneficiary of the Fund has died. It is easy for an employer to achieve the same effect by agreeing with the Trustees to a reduced Schedule of Payments until the surplus is reduced. This would be more satisfactory for the CFO as it means a smoothed reduction in the Employer 's expenses rather than a one off lump sum dumped into the coffers with the prospect of having to pay part of it back if the financial condition change. The DWP should stop messing around with things they do n't understand ! </relax.v.2052><relax.v.2053>Imagine that your body is like an ice field , and that your mind and breath are like warm sunlight. Using your breath to help your awareness to focus and flow throughout your body , gently allow your awareness to travel through your body like a warm breeze flowing through the ice , warming and dissolving any places of tightness or tension. Continue to sweep the warmth of your awareness through your whole body until you are deeply relaxed or fall asleep. If your body quivers or twitches , or if you notice any deep sighs , ahhhh , recognize these as signs of tension being released . </relax.v.2053><relax.v.2054>Sit Back &amp;Relax Now when the winds get gusty or the road gets bumpy , your favorite motorcycle passenger can relax completely , making the ride better for both of you.

Now domain names are not strictly attached to businesses. Previously a name could not be transferred unless the business changed hands too. There will be a 6 month cooling off period before a sale can be finalized. It sounds as if you do have to have a good reason to sell however as the rules state that It will not be allowable to register a domain name for the sole purpose of resale or transfer to a third party . I would imagine an allowable change would include a situation where a domain name defines a product or service that a business no longer sells.

Sometimes just being aware of them results in their automatically relaxing , sometimes it doesn't. It 's variable. If you feel an obviously useless tension , such as noticing that you 're sitting there clenching your hand for no good reason , should you deliberately relax the tension , or should you just study it as it is ?

Taking an uninterrupted sound sleep for 7-9 hour regularly is a habit which all of us should adopt. A sound sleep helps us revitalize our mental and physical energy and refresh us for the next day. Often these days , owing to our urban life styles , we seldom give a proper attention to this habit. There is no fixed time for going to bed thanks to the so-called necessary occupations of Television , movies , Internet , clubs and discos.

Let your minds eye wander around your body , starting from your head and working down to the toes , releasing muscle tension , identifying areas of the body that are fatigued , tight or feel wonderful. Take the time to practice this simple technique for 5 minutes everyday , and when you feel comfortable with the simple quietness that this relaxation practice brings , challenge yourself.

The idea of meditation is to focus your thoughts on one relaxing thing for a sustained period of time. This rests your mind by diverting it from thinking about the problems that have caused stress. It gives your body time to relax and recuperate and clear away toxins that may have built up through stress and mental or physical activity. Meditation slows breathing , reduces blood pressure , helps muscles relax , gives the body time to eliminate lactic acid and other waste products , reduces anxiety , eliminates stressful thoughts , helps with clear thinking , focus/concentration , reduces irritability , and reduces stress headaches . </relax.v.2305><relax.v.2306>*Lavender to penetrate &amp;regenerate skin cells damaged by weather , environment or age.

Occasional challenging projects , arguments , difficulties with children , difficulties at work/school , etc. are a normal part of life. These types of stresses are normal and can actually be strengthening. The goal is not necessarily to avoid all stressful events , but to develop the ability to relax during day-to-day activities and during challenging occurences ( such as those mentioned above ) . Persons who are recovering from an illness should attempt to keep challenging situations to a minimum but not necessarily avoid them totally unless they are extremely weak . </relax.v.2308><relax.v.2309>Tense your whole body several times and then relax totally.

Hold it tightly for 5 to 15 seconds ( usually around 10 seconds works well for people ) . Do not overtighten your hand or any of the following muscle groups just enough to feel the tension. Then allow your hand to open and your arm to relax for the same 5 to 15 second time. Do the same thing with your left hand and arm. Focus on the difference between the relaxed state and the tense state. What does the relaxed state feel like to you ? Some people describe it as warm , heavy , or tingling. Think about what words or images you would use to describe the relaxed state , and encourage your mind and your body to focus on that relaxed state.

Now do the same thing but double time ( 8 beats per measure ) , now play around with this for the entire song , now you must learn a step called the " FRESNO " to really get this right , so leaning side to side pick one arm up and pop it and then lean to the other side and pick that arm up and pop it , and keep it on beat and funky , the FRESNO is a smooth side to side dance movement where you pop on each side your leaning on.

After relaxation in a class , the student feels like they have been relaxing a lot longer than they actually have , that is because time and space disappear from the consciousness , much as when your are in deep sleep. In relaxation , the student of yoga is brought a step closer to their soul , and its outer aura of peace. This unpronounced contact with the soul gives some people an enlightening and moving experience from time to time in relaxation . </relax.v.2316><relax.v.2317>After learning the full PMR procedure , you will spend about 10 minutes a day maintaining your proficiency by practicing a shortened form of the procedure. But in the beginning it might take longer and it would be a good idea to tense and relax one limb at a time instead of both together. With time and practice , approximately 3 to 6 weeks , you may shorten the exercise gradually. For example , you could try collapsing some of the muscle groups until you only work on your arms , legs , abdomen , chest and face. Ultimately , you will acquire something that will probably become an indispensable part of your daily life , and the initial drudgery of practice will be long-forgotten . </relax.v.2317><relax.v.2318>-- Stand behind your shot and take a deep breath.

As well as helping your body to relax by reducing muscle tension , these stretch exercises can be done to increase flexibility or to ease muscles , or cool down after exercising . </relax.v.2319><relax.v.2320>Employers are justified in relaxing their fraternization policies , says Powers , because , at least in the aggregate , failed love affairs rarely come back to haunt companies. Over a five-year period ended in 1998 , just 4 of the people who had an office romance in 617 companies surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management saw it end badly and made a formal complaint. Even so , most firms wisely ban fraternization between people in the same chain of command to avoid sexual harassment suits , says attorney Daniel Blake , a labor partner in Epstein Becker &amp;Green 's Boston office. Experts advise against general bans on office romance , which might invite invasion-of-privacy lawsuits. So far , though , workers have filed only a handful of such suits , and none have held up in court.

Of course , it is not easy to relax when you are stressed , but putting in a little effort will not harm. One of the easiest ways to calm yourself down is to think about things that make you happy. You could feel happy by watching your favorite television program or simply by going out for a walk. Finding a quiet spot to think of some happy memories is also a good idea to relax.

I have found that everyone is different and there is no one specific treatment that will work for everyone because there is no one cause for tension headaches. You might want to convince your spouse to massage your feet without oil , and work around the toes , particularly the big toe. Have you ever had reflexology before ? You can try working the hand reflexes. Try this the next time you have a tension headache. As soon as you feel it coming on , you might try an ice pack for a few minutes around your neck and shoulder region.The big thumb will have sore spots , as well as the web between your thumb and index finger. Find the sore spots and hold until the soreness dissipates. The idea of reflexology is not to rub but to put pressure below the surface where the reflexes are. If it feels a little sore , you are there. Hope that helps . </relax.v.2333><relax.v.2334>Breathe out slowly , to a count of 5. Breathe in again , make every breath slow and steady and exactly the same as the one before it and the one after it. As you breathe out , concentrate on expelling ALL the air in your lungs. If you 're alone , you could make a noise like " whoo " as you do this to help you feel the air being let out. Keep the outbreath going for as long as you can. Keep it relaxed for a few seconds before you inhale again . </relax.v.2334><relax.v.2335>This process of relaxation is guaranteed to happen because it is based on a principle of muscle physiology. Whenever you create tension in a muscle and then release the tension the muscle has to relax. The muscle does not have a choice. It must happen. The interesting aspect of this process is that the muscle will not only quickly relax back to its pre-tensed state , but if it is allowed to rest , will become even more relaxed that it was. As this procedure of creating tension and then releasing it is applied to every major muscle group of the body , all of these muscles will become more relaxed than when you started . </relax.v.2335><relax.v.2336>The word myotonic is the adjective for the word myotonia , an inability to relax muscles at will.

Pain and anxiety stimulate additional tension and aversion. Without instruction most patients who are not properly instructed are loathe to sit still in the presence of unresolved pain. The instructions of Paradoxical Relaxation train patients to stop the tension-anxiety-pain cycle by focusing on tiny residual tensions that they can easily relax at the same time accepting the tension and pain that remains. Attention is redirected from negative cognitions and focuses on letting go of tiny and often ignored tensions in the body unconsciously aimed stopping the pain and tension efforts that only exacerbate symptoms. In the paradoxical acceptance of pain and tension that does not easily relax , the patient learns how to ride the tension down in the pelvic floor in particular and autonomic arousal in general in small steps that require acceptance of what formerly has been unacceptable and frightening . </relax.v.2525><relax.v.2526>Spend time in quality relaxation.

In the first place , the exercise of public power requires public authorization , direct or indirect , a process that is bound to be more cumbersome than everyday corporate decision-making. Second , government is committed to norms of procedural fairness that tug against efficiency. This fact reflects Americans ' historic aversion to concentrated power as well as a more recent mistrust of unchecked administrative discretion. Public infrastructure projects , for example , now must run a gauntlet of public meetings , environmental impact statements , and multilayered policy reviews that can last for a decade longer than the entire New Deal era.

It all depends on what is actually causing your arm pump. For me the more often I ride the less arm pump I get. Obviously the arm pump is from squeezing the crap out of the handlebars. Happens when your excited from pulling a holeshot or worried about losing a position , etc , etc. For me I have realized if I pull a holeshot and am way out front , I 'm calm as can be. If someone gets close then BAM I tighten up , so for me I have to learn to calm down when someone catches me. Do you get arm pump in practice or just races ? If its only at races I would attribute the arm pump to the stresses of racing. If thats the case then you have to learn to relax , but as anyone that gets arm pump knows , it 's so much easier said than done.

An effective tension reduction program is a holistic experience. It includes going through the reactions to completion on every level. It includes learning to utilize the positive aspects of tension which enable us to exercise , learn and create. Only then will our primitive defense mechanisms relinquish tension as a way of dealing with the potential stresses of everyday living . </relax.v.2823><relax.v.2824>It is important when you are tensing and relaxing the muscles not to over tighten a muscle that is already tense. Tense the muscle enough to feel the tension , but not so much that you increase pain. If you have an injured muscle group , you may be uncertain if you should be tensing that muscle group in the manner described. Consult a psychologist or physiotherapist for assistance in determining alternative methods of tensing and relaxing that muscle group . </relax.v.2824><relax.v.2825>3.

If you 're working in front of a computer or keyboard for long hours , I recommend this little exercise after each hour of work in order to relax the muscles and prevent tension . </relax.v.2830><relax.v.2831>There are two main methods used in relaxation techniques.

These methods are often used in Lamaze and other childbirth classes . </relax.v.2831><relax.v.2832>Reduce emotional stress. Take time to relax and take time away from stressful situations.

QART allows you to feel the difference between contraction ( tension ) and relaxation. The idea is that in the end you will be able to relax your muscles at will , as you will know what the difference feels like. However this might take some time , therefore practice is essential . </relax.v.2833><relax.v.2834>Some of us always hold the abdominal muscles in , either to reduce the size of the belly or out of unconscious tension. Sometimes we tighten the belly in order to stabilize our balance. There is another , more productive , way to balance. Instead of trying to hold on with the belly , or the shoulders , or the neck or jaw , try dropping the weight of the body into the pelvis , supported by the legs. When you stabilize from the pelvis , but relax the belly , breath moves more freely in and out of the body . </relax.v.2834><relax.v.2835>Tranquil , relaxing aromatherapy for your bath , formulated with 100 certified organic ingredients , including moisturizing jojoba oil and relaxing geranium and sweet orange oils.

As Newton stated , you can not stop all that mass on a dime. Guess what ? We overshoot our tension. Next the signalman tells the brakeman to relax the brakes because we have overshot the desired tension. The brakeman overreacts , and , if we include a little of Newton 's law , we fall well below the desired tension. To compensate , he over-applies the brake. The two men keep repeating this over and over again until maybe they finally reach the correct tension. At this point it seems like they may be out of the woods. But alas , things can change , requiring corrections. If the scaleman and the brakeman do not have their act together , they must repeat their actions with the tension fluctuating all over the place . </relax.v.2840><relax.v.2841>Utilizing relaxation to it 's many uses will take you and your horse to the best possible performance , be it on the trail or in the show ring.
