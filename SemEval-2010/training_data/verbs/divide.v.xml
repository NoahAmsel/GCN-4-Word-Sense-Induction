Because these plants rarely produce seed , and most do n't start well from cuttings , new plants must be started by dividing the rhizome system of existing ones. The very growth habit that makes clumping bamboos so desirable as landscape plants - tightly grouped clumps of canes that do n't spread aggressively- makes them very difficult to divide. Underlying those canes is a gnarled mass of thick , woody rhizomes that resists cutting with all its woody might. And the larger a bamboo variety is , the more difficult it is to divide those rhizomes - digging pieces of eight foot tall Chinese Goddess is child 's play compared to digging 55 foot tall Buddha 's Belly , whose rhizome system sometimes extends as much as three feet underground . </divide.v.2><divide.v.3>Previously , filers either had to deposit all of their refund into one account or receive a paper check. This delays a worker ' s decision to save and requires a separate trip to a bank or credit union to divide the refund between savings and immediate use. The split refund option provides lower-income workers a convenient automatic savings mechanism that can facilitate their decision to save some of their income. Such workers usually do not have access to the savings opportunities offered by mechanisms such as payroll deductions for deposits into 401 ( k ) retirement plans. In addition , designating a portion of a substantial tax refund for savings may enable such workers to save more than they could by diverting only small amounts of their paychecks to savings . </divide.v.3><divide.v.4>The court must divide joint accounts equally.

A monetary award is usually reduced to a judgment. A judgment , however , is not the same as getting cash.

He always thought it were better for ministers to pray oftener and divide their prayers , than be long and tedious in the same , except upon solemn and special occasions as in days of humiliation and the like.

The Bible says that Peleg ( which means divide ) was born 100 years after the flood and lived for 239 years.

This is where the mediator can be of great benefit. By working through the division of property in the facilitative mediation process , the mediator helps the parties focus on the task at hand and keep emotions in check. Under the facilitative model of mediation , the mediator does not tell the parties how to divide their property , but rather simply enables them to have the necessary conversation to flesh out a deal themselves. Obviously there is no perfect solution to such a situation , but being in charge of the disposition of your own property is always going to be better than throwing caution to the wind and simply letting a stranger decide your fate . </divide.v.42><divide.v.43>25 In this case I favour an equal division of the pension over an award of spouse maintenance at this time.

In areas where early frosts and harsh winters prevail , fall division will not give plants enough time to establish adequate root systems before the ground freezes.

The DNA in all human cells except eggs and sperm is housed in 46 chromosomes. Eggs and sperm consist of only half that number , 23 chromosomes per cell. Every person inherits one set of chromosomes from their mother ( in the egg ) and the other set of chromosomes from their father ( in the sperm ) . It is imperative that when mitosis and meiosis are complete , the appropriate number of chromosomes exists in each cell. If there are extra or missing chromosomes , the cells usually do not live. To ensure that there are enough chromosomes to be divided evenly between the two daughter cells during mitosis , an essential step precedes cell division that allows the chromosomes to be copied , a step called DNA replication. In mitosis , ( 1 ) the DNA is replicated , ( 2 ) the chromosomes are separated into two equal sets , and ( 3 ) the cell divides. These steps must occur in this exact order or the resulting cells will have an incorrect number of chromosomes and may not live . </divide.v.87><divide.v.88>divide.. it 's what I feel when I think about you.. it 's where we 're at.

Most normal cells are only able to divide a set number of times and then loose the ability to divide forever but remain alive. Many scientists believe that this process , known as cellular ageing , is a major contributory factor in the normal ageing process within the body. The finding that HGPS cells use up their potential for division much faster than normal cells and then die is likely to be at the heart of the process leading to premature ageing in children suffering from HGPS. Certain tissues , such as skin , tendons and blood vessels , continuously replace worn-out or damaged cells. The cells used to replace the worn-out or damaged cells arise through cell division of existing cells. In HGPS this process may be compromised because firstly , cells are dividing too quickly and secondly that the very process of cell division leads to cell loss through apoptosis. Therefore , there would not be sufficient cells to support the normal function of the affected tissues . </divide.v.93><divide.v.94>When one makes the Cheney-Bush administration one 's role model , supported by the likes of Karl Rove , Richard Pearle , and Paul Wolfowitz , of course , it will divide the country.

For example , if you inherit a sum of money and keep it separate from marital property , you will most likely be able to keep that inheritance.

It might have been present in the last election. In many previous elections , at this time of July , four months from the November official voting , the undecided group typically had gathered a percentage of polled votes between 8 and 20 . The size of the uncommitted typically has been large , usually much larger than the margin of leadership by the front runner. Not this time. We have a polarized population this time around , and might have had a similar polarization with few undecided voters in the last election. The undecideds in this election are remarkably small in number. In previous years , the big polling question was how will the undecideds go this time ? Some polls of yesteryear were entirely directed at the large undecided group. In the current race , we have the advantage of delving deeper into issues and demographic disparity.

The answer can only be found if we create a climate where discussion and understanding of economic measures become relevant to the general public.

Most spreadsheets can actually do this and you can divide the equation into a number of parts which are then calculated in adjacent cells ( or alternatively you can do it all in the same cell if you are clever enough ! ) . Knowing the speed of light to be 3 x 10e8 m/sec ( such that c then equals 9 x 10e16 ) and that v , the velocity is also calculated in m/sec , the maths is quite straightforward.

Perhaps the smaller pieces stay on the clothes to continue softening , brightening , or adding a design element , waterproofing , smell-proofing , allergy free , anti-itch , etc. Perhaps the clothes are pre-treated with something that interacts with the small dryer pieces to extend the performance of the clothes , reducing cleaning , wear and tear , or wrinkles.

The average adult human brain weighs 1.3 to 1.4 kg ( approximately 3 pounds ) . The brain contains about 100 billion nerve cells ( neurons ) and trillons of " support cells " called glia. The spinal cord is about 43 cm long in adult women and 45 cm long in adult men and weighs about 35-40 grams. The vertebral column , the collection of bones ( back bone ) that houses the spinal cord , is about 70 cm long. Therefore , the spinal cord is much shorter than the vertebral column . </divide.v.359><divide.v.360>51. Whether repeated assembly is of any value to biologists depends to a large extent on how useful and appropriable it is for the study of other species and the development of evolutionary theory. To the extent that genotype and phenotype can be collapsed into a single unit of analysis for some research purposes , repeated assembly will likely be an unnecessarily complicated description of evolution. Still , this rephrasing seems to pose a challenge -- to recent notions , at least. One is the interactor/replicator distinction ( Hull , 1988 ) , which divides entities ( or their attributes ) into those things that interact and those that replicate. Repeated assembly , coordinated over levels of organization , implies that repeated interaction is replication , or at least the source of replication. Similarly , there has been a trend to divide evolution into two domains of inquiry : the process of evolution and the results of evolution ( Reeve &amp;Sherman , 1993 ) . If organisms ( and other entities ) are the continuation of evolutionary processes , than process and product are indistinguishable; the durability of repeated assemblies , or repeated assemblies nested in other repeated assemblies , replaces the process-product distinction . </divide.v.360><divide.v.361>When planning a will the vast majority of people simply decide how they wish to divide up their estate , and then they outline this in writing.

Industrial machinery was restored to use , restrictions against the German cartels went largely unenforced , and West Germany 's remarkable recovery and reindustrialization soon began. The rebuilding process was facilitated by the Marshall Plan. By 1947 , the Western occupation zones were increasingly coordinating their policies ( especially in economics ) , whereas the Soviet zone followed an increasingly divergent policy. The split between the three Western Allies and the USSR became complete in 1948. After the Western powers had planned steps toward establishing a West German constitution and had instituted a currency reform , the Soviet authorities unsuccessfully blockaded ( 194849 ) West Berlin as part of the cold war ( see Berlin airlift ) . In 1949 , Germany was divided into the Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) . The precise legal status of West Berlin remained unclear; however , West Berlin was intimately tied to West Germany in many ways ( see Berlin ) . </divide.v.362><divide.v.363>At one time , these plans were relatively rare. The Income Tax Act thresholds , however , have not kept pace with inflation and it is quite common to find that a member is entitled to benefits under a registered plan as well as under a supplementary plan. For federal public servants and for British Columbia public servants , the supplementary part of the pension is automatically divided under the relevant legislation. In other cases , it is sometimes difficult to discover a supplementary plan. Requests to the plan for information may not disclose the SPP if , for example , it is set up and operated by the employer , and a different party is the fund holder. If a party has an interest in an SPP , a copy of the plan text should be reviewed to identify the benefits available under it. Some kinds of SPP , for example , are directly integrated with the registered plan and simply pay the amount that exceeds the ITA maximum for registered plans. Other SPPs take the form of a defined contribution plan , and provide for increased benefits ( through indexing , for example ) . </divide.v.363><divide.v.364>In the usual sense of the word divide , we take it to be a representation of the everyday concept of division : I have one cake and I divide it into three pieces , giving me 3 pieces , each 1/3 of the whole.

In 1993 , Israelis living in East Jerusalem settlements , 160 , 000 , reached parity with resident Palestinians. Yet , despite decades of intensive settlement that today have brought almost 200 , 000 Israelis to East Jerusalem , Israeli plans were confounded as the percentage of Palestinians in the city rose from 25.8 percent in 1967 to 32.6 percent in 2000.

In the alternative , wills are often drafted so that the entire estate is given to the executor to hold on trust to divide equally ( or in specified proportions ) to a class of beneficiaries or to a named group of people.

In response to fertilization , microtubules again divide the chromosomes in an egg in half and dispose of another half of them. Current theory is that these microtubules do not age very well and as women get older there is greater difficulty in disposing of excess chromosomes.

Indeed , the Jewish settlements in Gaza were designed by Ariel Sharon to divide the strip into three manageable chunks , but by the time of the Israeli disengagement in 2005 this was no longer possible.

For example the are many one celled parasites such as the malaria parasite ( Plasmodium ) which undergo repeated nuclear divisions without dividing the cytoplasm. Thus , at certain stages of the life cycle the cell has many nuclei. The cell will then undergo a modified form of cytokinesis ( division of the cytoplasm ) .

Their proliferation is typically restrained only by the availability of nutrients and by the occasional demands of sex. In multicellular species , by contrast , natural selection acts not on each individual cell but on the organism as a whole. To produce and maintain the intricate organization of the body , the component cells must obey strict controls that limit their proliferation. At any instant most cells in the adult are not growing or dividing but instead are in a resting state , performing their specialized function while retired from the division cycle. Because nutrients are plentiful in the tissues of the body , the cells must refrain from proliferating in circumstances where a yeast or bacterium would proliferate readily.

Hi , You could start division on the right but the algorithm we usually use , that starts from the left , is more efficient. For example if I want to divide 5876 by 276 using our normal algorithm , the way I learned it , I would write : This procedure has two steps. First you see that 276 divides into 5876 twenty times with a remainder of 356. Secondly 276 divides into 356 once with a remainder of 80. Thus , in total , 276 divides into 5876 twenty-one times with a remainder of 80. Working from the right would be repeated subtraction.

( 3d ) 141 ( B.C.C.A. ) . In Armstrong , Proudfoot , J.A. at pages 148-149 pointed out that proceeding to divide unequally a pension without evidence of value created a potential for injustice to occur. I agree , however , the unequal division ordered in this case is with respect to the income benefits only. In this case unequal division of the income rights under the pension is made with evidence as to the value of the payments and as such the potential for injustice does not arise ... </divide.v.553><divide.v.554>Texas uses the " community property " system to distribute marital assets. Property acquired by either spouse during the marriage is community property to be divided upon divorce. Under Texas law , the division of property does not have to be equal. The courts are only required to divide the community property between the parties " in a manner that the court claims just and right , having due regard for the rights of each party and any children of the marriage. " If either spouse acquired property outside of the state , a court can also divide that property using community property rules if they divorce in Texas. Individual spouses may also own separate property which is not divided in a divorce. Because classification of property and its division can become one of the most contentious issues in a divorce , you need the advice and assistance of a family law attorney familiar with Texas family laws and procedures . </divide.v.554><divide.v.555>We can improve on this algorithm slightly by reducing the time it takes to achieve the y-coordinate sorting in Step 4. This is done by asking that the recursive solution computed in Step 1 returns the points in sorted order by their y coordinates. This will yield two sorted lists of points which need only be merged ( a linear time operation ) in Step 4 in order to yield a complete sorted list. Hence the revised algorithm involves making the following changes : Step 1 : Divide the set into ... , and recursively compute the distance in each part , returning the points in each set in sorted order by y-coordinate. Step 4 : Merge the two sorted lists into one sorted list in O ( n ) time. Hence the merging process is now dominated by the linear time steps thereby yielding an O ( nlogn ) algorithm for finding the closest pair of a set of points in the plane . </divide.v.555><divide.v.556>While Ron Paul does n't have the polling numbers of Rudy Giuliani or Mitt Romney , Ron Paul has empowered supporters. Some news outlets are even predicting that Ron Paul will out raise all other Republicans in funding this quarter. With his pro-constitution and limited government views Ron Paul is attracting conservatives and liberals alike. The nomination of any other Republican to face any Democrat in the presidential election will further divide the nation with typical partisan politics. But Ron Paul has the ability to unite America with his freedom loving message . </divide.v.556><divide.v.557>In this game , you can add , subtract , multiply or divide the numbers on the dice.

" The Confiteor creates an interior silence from the beginning of the Mass , as Priest and faithful turn away from their temporal concerns to face the reality of Calvary , for which their sins are responsible. It is the first expression of that humility which will accompany us through the Sacrifice of the Mass " . After the priest 's prayers the servers then similarly pray the Confiteor. After a brief dialogue of prayers between the priest and the servers , the priest ascends to the altar. " With the priest , we enter into the silence of Christ in His permanent sacrifice. The Mass does not divide sins into categories : we ask God to take away all of our sins and imperfections because they are an an obstacle to love of Him. " As the priest ascends , he prays that he be worthy to enter the holy of holies. The priest then beseeches the Lord to forgive his sins through the merits of the saints , whose relics are in the altar . </divide.v.561><divide.v.562>We identify odd and even numbers.

For most 401 ( k ) 's , pension plans , retirement accounts or IRA 's , a special order called a Qualified Domestic Relations Order ( called a " QDRO " ) is prepared which effectuates a division of those accounts. For some retirement accounts , such as military , state or county pension plans , QDRO 's do not apply and other special orders are required. If these type of retirement benefits exist , a lawyer or accountant is the most qualified person to address this type of issue . </divide.v.566><divide.v.567>By no means , then , does partisan parity necessarily imply a deeply divided citizenry. People who talk about culture wars usually have in mind not merely a close division ( fifty-fifty ) but a wide or deep division -- two populations with distinct and incompatible world views. It was this sort of divide that Hunter said he had found in 1991. One culture was " orthodox , " the other " progressive. " The disagreement transcended particular issues to encompass different conceptions of moral authority -- one side anchored to tradition or the Bible , the other more relativistic. Not only does this transcendental disagreement reverberate throughout both politics and everyday life , Hunter said , but " each side of the cultural divide can only talk past the other " ( his italics ) . In his book The Values Divide ( 2002 ) the political scientist John Kenneth White , of Catholic University , makes a similar case. " One faction emphasizes duty and morality; another stresses individual rights and self-fulfillment , " he writes. The result is a " values divide " -- indeed , a " chasm. " </divide.v.567><divide.v.568>Now , some US policy makers are talking about partitioning Iraq into Kurd , Sunni and Shia regions. Leading advocates include senior politicians and US ruling class foundations. Joseph Biden , chairman of the US Foreign Relations Committee and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination endorses " soft " partition , as does Leslie Gelb , president emeritus of the influential Council on Foreign Relations ( 2 ) . Last year , the two put together the Biden-Gelb plan , which calls for a " soft " partition of Iraq. Soft partition would see Iraq divided into three distinct ethno-religious regions : Kurdistan , Shiastan and Sunnistan , held together by a weak federal government . </divide.v.568><divide.v.569>So the change in the object 's mass is equal to the total energy lost divided by . Since any emission of energy can be carried out by a two step process , where first the energy is emitted as light and then the light is converted to some other form of energy , any emission of energy is accompanied by a loss of mass. Similarly , by considering absorption , a gain in energy is accompanied by a gain in mass. Einstein concludes that all the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content . </divide.v.569><divide.v.570>Is it fair to our children that we are allowing Darwins theory to be taught in our classrooms , when we are obviously divided on the issue of where creation comes from ? I personally am not divided. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that man comes from God. I; however , do not think that teachers are in the position or equiped to teach about God and creation , so consiquently , I do not think that Darwins theory should be taught either. It is not fair to teach just one side of the contraversy so niether creation or evolution should be taught in public schools. Children should elect to take these courses as electives not required courses. If they do take this subject as an elective then yes all view points should be discussed. Save it all for " Debate Class " ! ! ! ! Let children go to God , church , and science/evolution " elective " class if they choose to.

This would not be any sort of denying any sovereign country of its right to exist. Pakistan is comprised of five nations and there is no problem in giving these nations their new countries to enable them to have a more realistic identity of their own. This is necessary to eliminate the roots of terrorism completely.

Divide your lecture material into short segments ( e.g. , three tenminute segments ) . Divide students into the same number of groups ( e.g. , three , one for each segment ) . Ask the first group to prepare a short quiz on the first segment of your lecture. The quiz should take no more than five minutes to prepare. The other groups can use this time to review their notes. The first team then quizzes the other groups , either as a whole , or in turn , assigning points to a team when a question is answered correctly. Repeat this process with the other groups after your next lecture segment ( s ) . A variation on this is to divide students into small groups and give a practice visible multiple-choice quiz. Groups choose an answer within a short time , then you ask for their answers all at the same time; groups indicate their answer with index cards , number of fingers , or some other visible item. You can then discuss the answers as a large group . </divide.v.574><divide.v.575>The reason is related to the associated multiplication question. If you divide 6 by 3 the answer is 2 because 2 times 3 IS 6. If you divide 6 by zero , then you are asking the question , " What number times zero gives 6 ? " The answer to that one , of course , is no number , for we know that zero times any real number is zero not 6. So we say that division by zero is undefined , for it is not consistent with division by other numbers . </divide.v.575><divide.v.576>Through these meetings we have deepened our insights into life in Northern Ireland and beyond.

The first includes the great achievements of materialism. By any criteria materialism , to which all Natural Sciences belong , has achieved infinitely more than idealistic speculative philosophy; undoubtedly , it is predestined to achieve even more in the future. It all started with the atomists - the first materialists , - and Aristotle 's encyclopedia of sciences. According to Aristotle the soul and the body are essentially related; the soul is not a separate substance , but an arrangement of stuff , or material substance , of which the body is made. Furthermore , we have to mention the French and British materialists and all Natural Sciences; it was not without a good reason that the British called physics Natural Philosophy and considered Newton to be a philosopher. Their descendents - Feuerbach , Marx , Engels as well as a significant number of modern scientists , - succeeded in making great contributions to the latest development of realistic philosophy . </divide.v.581><divide.v.582>I divided the number of cookies i would get this after noon by two so i could share with Nancy , who was naturally my best friend.

All students participate in the communal activity together. The students then divide into two different groupsKitah Aleph ( children aged 6 8 ) and Kitah Bet ( children aged 9 12 ) . They are in their groups for two Class Sessions. One Class Session , taught by Rabbi Sternberg , will be devoted to learning prayers and making one 's own Siddur. The other Class Session , taught by Suri Maron , will be devoted to study and activities around the theme of the day. All students in the Religious School will be taught by both instructors. The groups are then brought back together for a concluding activity -- a game centered on the theme of the day that is facilitated by the instructors . </divide.v.585><divide.v.586>United we stand , divided we fall.

If I have to transplant in mid-summer I would refrain from dividing at that time ( too much disturbance to the root system ) , and make sure to dig as large a clump of soil attached to the root as possible , being careful not to knock much dirt off of the root in transit.

A secularist , who is also a socialist , would also oppose the current schooling system on the grounds that it acts as a tool to divide the working class. Two people may be the same age and live in the same street. Yet , solely because of their religion , or more particularly the religion of their parents , they may be sent to different schools yards apart from the age of 4 or 5. They could then grow up with differing groups of friends formed along religious lines. When people are organised by the state in separate groups , purely on religious or racial basis , this is a recipe for bigotry , racism and intolerance. If we wish the working class to unite then it is vital to not put up artificial barriers which hinder integration. By the age of 4 or 5 no one has been presented with enough information to make up their own mind about their choice of beliefs.

It is argued that the social cleavages salient at the time of mass enfranchisement remain crucial political divisions ( Lipset and Rokkan 1967 ) . Once everyone has the vote , party allegiances are frozen , and new voters are socialized into the existing divisions. Economic or social divisions which later emerge do not become the basis for political divisions , since all parties , to maintain their position , respond similarly to any developing social or economic discontent. Thus , only those issues salient at the time of mass mobilization divide the parties. The crucial divide in Ireland at the time of mass mobilization was pro-Treaty versus anti-Treaty , and this became the salient division between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael ( Garvin 1977 ) . As new economic and social issues have developed , both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have responded in similar fashions , and few policy differences have emerged.

For each type of growth factor there is a specific receptor or set of receptors , which some cells express on their surface and others do not. Cells respond to a given protein growth factor only if they display the appropriate receptor protein ( discussed in Chapter 15 ) . Other classes of molecules besides proteins can also function as growth factors; steroid hormones , which act on intracellular receptor proteins , are an example. The growth factors can be divided into broad- and narrow-specificity classes. The broad-specificity factors , like PDGF and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , affect many classes of cells. Thus PDGF acts on a range of target cells including fibroblasts , smooth muscle cells , and neuroglial cells , while EGF acts not only on epidermal cells but also on many other cell types , both epithelial and nonepithelial.

Chemical or pesticide repellency simply means that the ants can sense the presence of pesticides and they will avoid them. That 's right - the worker ants will simply avoid the chemical that you sprayed and travel or trail around it. If the chemical is sprayed too close to the nest , the queens will engage the workers to pick up the eggs and move the nest farther away from the pesticide ! And usually , as a result of moving , the queens will also engage the workers to divide or " split " into several new nests. This splitting of dividing of the carpenter ant nest is also called " satelliting " After the new nests are setup and established , the new queens begin to lay more eggs and the entire carpenter ant system is divided and now instead of a single nest there are several nests to deal with , making control much more difficult . </divide.v.687><divide.v.688>Our lesson plans are set up to include the standard , rationale , materials needed , the lesson layout , and the homework.

This means that if you put your fingers on middle " C " on a piano , and the " C " one octave above , the " F " which lays in the exact middle of the octave will produce the tri-tone.

The following statements from Dr. J. R. Dummelow , an eminent commentator , show that the Babylonians both divided time into weeks , and offered sacrifices , pointing to the unity of religions. " The Babylonians observed the 7th , 14th , 21st and 28th of each lunar month as days when men were subjected to certain restrictions; the king was not to eat food prepared by fire , nor offer sacrifice , nor consult an oracle , nor invoke curses on his enemies. " They also observed the 19th of each month. It was customary , therefore , in the days of Abraham , for the Babylonians to offer sacrifices and to observe the 7th day as especially sacred. This can only be accounted for upon the assumption , that God had revealed to the human race that creation occupied 6 days or periods , and the 7th was to be observed , -- all of which was doubtless handed down by tradition.

In older Victorian homes , the walls were divided into three parts and were known as tripartite walls. They consisted of the wainscot at the bottom , and the frieze at the top. The area between the two was known as the fill or the field. Ceilings were anywhere from 10 to 14 feet in height and the frieze was a regulated 18 inches high. As the ceiling heights were lowered to 9 or 10 feet at the turn of the century , the standard frieze height also gave way to a broad variety of heights. The wainscot reached a height that covered 2/3 of the wall , and it was often paneled with fir , birch or pine. In grander homes , oak or more rarely , mahogany was used. The wainscot was usually topped with a plate rail or cap molding. Often , wallpaper replaced the wood inside the panels , and this became a characteristic feature of many dining rooms.

In multicellular organisms , cell division is used for growth , development , and repair of the organism. Cell division is controlled by DNA , but exact copies of the DNA must be given to the daughter cells ( note use of " mother " and " daughter " ) . Bacteria reproduce by a simple process called binary fission. They have one chromosome which is attached to the cell membrane. This chromosome replicates , then the two copies are pulled apart as the cell grows. Eventually the cell pinches in two to make two cells. Eukaryotes do mitosis. In mitosis , each daughter cell gets about half of the cytoplasm from the mother cell and one set or copy of the DNA . </divide.v.827><divide.v.828>These elections have clearly shown that the American country is divided into two halves : one that is capable of using their brains and one that is easily manipulated by rhetoric or belief in false " moral issues " .

Karl Marx , while agreeing that the secular state has successfully neutralized religion and purged it from the public sphere , still saw a great danger in religious life. This is because , he argued , secularism reduced religion into a private matter only insofar as the state is concerned. However , the privatization of religion gave it in effect more influence in the organization of civil society. Even in the United States where religion has been domesticated and individualized to the greatest extent , it continues to divide society into distinct religious communities , thereby allowing for the formation of internal solidarity with a clear bearing on economic life.

Why when we seek to heal conflicts and strife do we turn to a psychology book rather than to 1 Corinthians ? When Paul deals with strife among the saints , he begins at the beginning the gospel of Jesus Christ. His introductory words have already taken us to God and to His sufficient provisions for salvation and godly living. Now , after setting the standard of Christian unity , Paul seeks to correct the ungodly divisions in the church. He does so by turning us immediately to the gospel. Our salvation is Christ-centered and not man-centered. How then can Christians divide themselves from other Christians on the basis of the men whom they have chosen to follow ?

Those who do not love the truth will be taken in by the plausibility of these pronouncements. The dividing issue will be whether Jesus is the Son of God and therefore the exclusive representation of the true nature of God. New leaders will emerge on both sides of this divide. Some of the church will be deceived by the subtlety of this attack. Others will be intimidated by the virulence of the assault against their persons and possessions when they fail to confirm.

Yet , Fine Gael 's turn came in 1983. During a close election campaign , a pressure group forced the political parties to commit themselves to holding a Constitutional referendum. The referendum , if passed , would explictly prevent abortion legislation ever being introduced. Since Fine Gael won the election , it fell to them , rather than Fianna Fail , to live up to its campaign promise. Divergent views within Fine Gael threatened party unity , and a substantial minority of the party were in open conflict with the party leader. Fine Gael split between those who followed conservative " official " church policy and those who took a more liberal view. This tension between the " old guard " and the " young tigers " emerges on other social issues , such as divorce , contraception , and religious control over education , as well. Interestingly , while there are similar tensions within Fianna Fail , disagreement does not take precedence over party unity. Divergent views would not be publicly aired.

Malay and Chinese elites were divided by the structure of educational institutions in colonial and post-colonial Malaya. Sinhalese and Tamil elites were brought together by the educational system in Ceylon. The Malay top elite were segregated in the Malay College at Kuala Kangsar , which was modelled on the British public school. No comparable monoethnic institution existed in Ceylon. The result was that Malay and Chinese leaders were not , at first , on intimate terms , whereas Sinhalese and Tamil leaders frequently knew each other well. There was , in Ceylon , a genuinely intercommunal elite , sharing many common values. The same description would certainly not hold for Malayan elite at independence . </divide.v.963><divide.v.964>Upon the death of the first Maker to die , the trust estate will be divided into a " First Decedent 's Share " and a " Survivor 's Share.

Inspired by the pan-slavic tendencies then prevailing in the tsar 's empire , a sinister watch-word came to the fore : " On to Vienna through Berlin ! " In the same way as it tried to divide up the Turkish Empire , Russian imperialist policy sought to dismember the Habsburg Monarchy , which included a number of different peoples. Russia wanted to place them all under the religious rule of the tsar as protector of the Orthodox Christians in the Balkans. Diplomatically speaking , that meant nothing less than the integration of Bulgaria and Serbia into the Russian monarchy , as well as that of all the West and South Slavic peoples.

The child must be free to make mistakes and learn for itself without the constant fear of being rebuked by an adult.

Further gene sequencing showed that the fission yeast Cdc13 protein is homologous to mitotic cyclin ( cyclin B ) of animals. The fundamental similarity between yeasts and vertebrates was even more dramatically emphasized by a third finding : when mutant yeast cells deficient in cdc2 were transfected with plasmids containing fragments of human DNA , some were rescued and divided normally. The rescuing fragment , when cloned and sequenced , contained a human gene homologous to the fission yeast cdc2 gene . From all this and other evidence , it is clear that in both yeasts and vertebrates entry into mitosis is driven by essentially the same kinase and that , to become active as MPF , this kinase has to be complexed with cyclin.

Those who have had the eyes of their heart enlightened ( Eph. i. 18 ) , still find many difficulties and problems , which we must all expect while in the flesh , and among the many causes of difficulty is the fact that the ministry of Paul has a two-fold aspect; in one case he is seen severed from the teaching of the twelve , while in another he is found working in harmony with them.

For one thing , it was not at first clear whether this activity was to be a singular one or should rather be divided into the several disciplines , as later occured. Nor was it at the outset clear what was the best route to such knowledge , that is , what kind of epistemology would be most fruitful or even legitimate. Least of all was it clear whether the social sciences could in some sense be thought to constitute a third culture that was between science and literature , in the later forumation of Wolf Lepenies.

" Emerson and Smith , who conducted 2 , 000 telephone surveys and 200 face-to-face interviews in preparing this book , argue that evangelicals have a theological world view that makes it difficult for them to perceive systematic injustices in society. In particular , evangelical emphasis of individualism and free will seem to predispose them to believe that most racial problems can be solved if individuals will only repent of their sins. Therefore , many well-meaning strategies for healing racial divisions ( such as cross-cultural friendships ) carry within them the seeds of their own defeat.

At that time , hostel units were often divided amongst the different ethnic groups residing in them. Originally it was thought that factional fighting was due to the workers ' ethnic loyalty. It was not until the late 1970 's that ethnic division in the hostels was abandoned. This decade was a time of great unrest throughout the country. A study of mine conflict of that time period cites three causes of violence : faction fights , wages , working and living conditions , and changes in the employment status of foreign workers ( Crush , et. al. , 1991 ) . By 1976 the violence had abated , leaving 132 mineworkers dead and approximately 500 injured ( Lipton , 1980 ) . A government commission of inquiry into the violence recommended that the mining industry upgrade the hostels , create family units , and abolish ethnic division of workers. While many of these requests were attempted , they had marginal success ( Wentzel , 1993 ) . There was some reduction of the internal violence in the hostels but this changed dramatically in 1990 . </divide.v.1163><divide.v.1164>It ' s important that you consider the tax consequences of any property settlements during a dissolution.

If cell-cell contacts are broken and the proper growth factors are present , the cells will divide. Another mechanism that inhibits endothelial cells from dividing is the presence of transforming growth factor-beta2 ( TGF-_2 ) . This is a protein present in the aqueous humor , a fluid that is in contact with these cells.

In that year it was accepted by the academic community that a third group of living organisms existed - Archaea. This was as a result of two advances in understanding. The first was the discovery of many new microbial forms in unusual places , such as in hot springs , deep underground and in harsh chemical environments such as soda lakes , which had been known of for twenty years. The second was the understanding of the genetic code. Genetic sequencing or genome mapping of different species has given us a better understanding of where individual living things fit on the evolutionary tree of life. Archaea , it was discovered , were genetically different from both bacteria and the animal/plant/fungus kingdom. This has led to problems about how to divide up the Kingdoms.

There is no uniformity amongst breeders in the way these percentage figures are determined , and a breeder can assign percentages to their animals by using several different methods. The most common , which may be termed the " pedigree method , " is to add together the " known " percentages of wolf in the two parents and divide the sum by two to get the percentage of wolf in the offspring. Thus , when a pure ( 100 percent ) wolf is bred to a pure ( 0 percent ) dog , the offspring , an F1 hybrid , will be 50 percent wolf. If this F1 is then bred to another pure wolf , the result would be a 75 percent hybrid . </divide.v.1321><divide.v.1322>They will have to if they hope to keep the White House in the general election.

And so at the local level , whether it be in Chicago or New York , L.A. , Pentecostal pastors , priests , lay Catholic leaders have come together and joined forces to say we as a community may be divided by faith and other areas , but on this issue we 're coming together because we need to take a stand about the dignity of who Latinos are , because they represent a large part of this community , a large part of the society and the contributions that we 're making . </divide.v.1358><divide.v.1359>Yes , I believe Iraq should be divided into three ethnic enclaves.

Processes of individualisation lead to the breakdown of more traditional forms of social group which includes the nuclear family. Manufactured uncertainties about marriage ( high divorce and falling marriage rates ) , childbirth ( decreasing fertility rates ) , sexuality and gender roles , lead to a proliferation of other family and household forms , including increasing proportions of one-parent families , and group and living-alone households. As Beck summarises it : 'Marriage can be subtracted from sexuality , and that in turn from parenthood; parenthood can be multiplied by divorce; and the whole thing can be divided by living together or apart , and raised to a higher power by the possibility of multiple residences and the ever-present potentiality of taking-back decisions.

The performance of the system is determined by the emittance of the material ( s ) , the lower the better , and the size of the enclosed air spaces. The smaller the air space , the less heat will transfer by convection. Therefore , to lessen heat flow by convection , a reflective insulation , with its multiple layers of aluminum and enclosed air space , is positioned in a building cavity ( stud wall , furred-out masonry wall , floor joist , ceiling joist , etc. ) to divide the larger cavity ( 3/4 " furring , 2 " x 4 " , 2 " x 6 " , etc. ) into smaller air spaces.

They will decide if they possess the time , talent , and treasure to help fill this need by volunteering for the chosen project and determine what their opportunity costs will be. Students will distinguish between the natural resources , human capital , and capital equipment needed in the production of a quilt. Students will determine what specialized skills are needed to complete a quilt made from donated student clothing. After researching where the items of clothing were made and how they got to the United States , the class will divide the labor by areas of specialization and produce the quilt assembly line style.

Finally , the laws may change so that your will does not protect your assets as you planned when you executed the will. A good example is the tax law , which is slated to change dramatically in the next few years. It is best , then , to review your will every three years , and every time there is a major change in your family circumstances or assets.

Another method that many people follow is to interpret the -5 as indicating that you must move the decimal place over 5 places to the left. Think of 1.3 as _ _ _ _ 1.3.

Further , they cause acrimonious divisions between a people when some consider themselves superior for having achieved a larger pile of tokens in the bank , regardless of the method used. In a class system , someone who earns uncountable wealth selling pornography is considered to be " above " a humble tailor or carpenter or plumber or writer who does a quality job of his or her task.

Generally speaking , pension benefits are divided as follows : the accrued benefit is calculated as of the time of divorce as if the employee had stopped working on that date and then that amount is multiplied by a number that equals the number of months of marriage divided by the number of months in the pension plan. The resulting dollar figure is the community amount that will be divided.

George Friedman ( founder of Strategic Forecasting , a US-based intelligence agency and author of the new book ' The Next 100 Years; A Forecast for the 21st century ' ) encapsulated where US strength ultimately lies. " There are many answers to the question of why the US is so powerful , but the simplest answer is its military power. The US completely dominates a continent ( South America ) that is invaluable to invasion and occupation and in which its military overwhelms those of its neighbours. Virtually every other industrialised power in the world has experienced devastating warfare in the 20th century. The US waged war , but America itself never experienced it. Military power and geographical reality created an economic reality. Other countries have lost time recovering from wars. The US has not. It has grown because of them.

Strata levels in the primary age category describe lunar/solar intersections using solar-side time splits. Solar-side time splits segregated the elements of the 260-year-Tzolken-sacred-cycle. Adam 's primary 130-Tun-year age designates green shade in the upper right pie section of the second circle ( Figure 18b ) . The upper left pie section is the shaded equivalent 130-Tun-years to juxtaposition an entire 260-year-Tzolken-sacred-cycle within 365-years. The lower pie section differentiates the primary 105-year age of Seth from the 260-year-Tzolken-sacred-cycle intrinsic to 365-years. Seth 's primary 105-year age means the solar-side separation half of 210-years of lunar/solar separation time has been evaluated for each 400-year-Baktun-cycle of the Sun Kingdoms ' Calendar. Two 105-year-solar-side separations divide to get one 105-year-solar-side time split for Seth 's primary age when the first 400-year-Baktun-cycle doubles to reach the second 800-year Generation Cycle following Adam.

In all of these cases , there are external pulls , external influences and especially external fears , such as the fear of the Sinhalese that the Sri Lankan Tamils are really the cutting edge of the invasion of the 50 million Tamils in India - and there is therefore a fear of being swamped by the people across the border.

And as one effect is posterior to this effect , and prior to that , so may grace be called prevenient and subsequent on account of the same effect viewed relatively to divers others. And this is what Augustine says ( De Natura et Gratia xxxi ) : " It is prevenient , inasmuch as it heals , and subsequent , inasmuch as , being healed , we are strengthened; it is prevenient , inasmuch as we are called , and subsequent , inasmuch as we are glorified.

Momentum is always conserved. Kinetic energy is not conserved ( some of it becomes deformation energy ) . The difference between initial combined KE and final combined KE represents the deformation energy applied to the metal , and this can be compared to the area under its stress-strain curve. Alternatively , the reaction force applied by the armour in order to decelerate the impactor can be divided by the load-bearing area and then compared to the ultimate tensile stress of the material. Either way , you ca n't get off the hook for a high momentum collision so easily; if the impact point is small ( as it would be for a metallic spear-point or a bullet ) , then the pressure is high , and the armour will fail.

( A ) All cells have only one bright spot of DNA , indicating that the first division of the chromosomes has not yet occurred in these cells. ( B ) One hour later , there are three cells out of those in the photo that have two bright spots of DNA , indicating that these cells have gone through the first of the two chromosome divisions. ( C ) Six hours later , there is a mix of cells whose chromosomes have not divided ( one spot of DNA ) , divided once ( two spots of DNA ) , or divided both times ( four spots of DNA ) . As expected for a wild-type strain , most have divided twice and therefore have four spots of DNA.

The rest were isolated and picked off one by one. What better illustration could there be of the scenario envisaged by Machiavelli in The Prince : ' it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost , because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.

It is in the nature of politicians to differ in any way they can in order not to share that dizzying prize we call power , and to divide the electorate , even by deceit and untruth , in order to obtain exclusive rights to that power . </divide.v.1780><divide.v.1781>The proposal to divide Jerusalem will or will not come to pass. If the plan doesn ' t go through , the status quo will remain , and prices will be subject to ordinary market trends. If Jerusalem is divided , then the market will be shaped by the attitudes and events that will shape that period. We should therefore continue to conduct business as if the plan was not even a consideration. Sellers who will sell cheap now out of fear that the market will decline , or buyers who will refrain from buying , will probably regret their decisions. People who are afraid to buy or sell anyway , will use this as an excuse to support their procrastination. As a resident of Binyamin , I am proud that the Jewish community here has never ceased to build and invest. Had we stopped development every time the settlement movement was threatened we would all still be living in trailers. I expect that same faith will be expressed in Jerusalem. From Joshua ' s time throughout modern times , Israel was built with faith , and will continue to be built with faith . </divide.v.1781><divide.v.1782>8. For some though , this holy word of God will cause division. Because of the hardness of their hearts and their rejection of Christ 's unifying word , they will sinfully divide and separate themselves from Christ and his Church. They will cause pain , heartache and sorrow , and people will suffer division , families and nations alike. And thus we see the truth of Christ 's wordsthat where Christ is , there is also division. Division caused by sin . </divide.v.1782><divide.v.1783>For over five years I 've been a part of a " common ground " group.

It is a problem in its own right because Arabs and Jews have found no way either to share or divide it. In Jerusalem God and history have made sharing bitterly hard. This is a city in which religions as well as nationalisms collide.

I personally believe that more of the country is coming to the realization that neither one side or the other really has any clue as to how to fix our current situation and so everyone has decided its just better to sit and wait and see how it all pans out. Maybe concentrate on surviving this mess for awhile and try to leave thier fellow man alone since if things get too much worse it could be you end up on the losing end and those that " win " come looking for you to extract a bit of retribution. The country isnt less divided , its just more scared of one another than it has been in the past . </divide.v.1791><divide.v.1792>During the Civil War , Abraham Lincoln gave one of his best known speeches in which he stated that a house divided against itself can not stand. President Obama , during his campaign , alluded to a divide between white-collar and blue-collar Americans. He then painted himself as someone who was more in tune with what it is that blue-collar Americans need in order to get back on their feet and get ahead. He then described John McCain as a white collar sort who was out of touch with anything beneath the upper crust of America . </divide.v.1792><divide.v.1793>If property is held as community property , each spouse technically owns an undivided one-half interest in the property. This type of ownership applies to most property acquired by the husband or the wife during the course of the marriage. It generally does not apply to property acquired prior to the marriage or to property acquired by gift or inheritance during the marriage. After a divorce , community property is divided equally in some states and according to the discretion of the court in the other states . </divide.v.1793><divide.v.1794>Good relationships are essential to life.

But it was God ' s will that the kingdom be divided ( 1 Kings 12 : 15 ) , and the heart of Rehoboam had been hardened; he refused to back off his strong statements. He went so far as to try to compel the ten tribes to return and to submit. He sent Adoniram , the supervisor of his work crews , after them , but the angry Israelites stoned him to death.

You can divide plants to conquer a variety of gardening problems. One of the most common reasons is to create new plants.

The students are expected to be able to divide by 3-digit divisors and treat remainders in various ways. The presentation of the standard algorithm , however , is weak in that students would have a difficult time learning it from the text. On the other hand , if students have experienced the algorithms before the emphasis on the treatment of remainders and the applications of division will be useful extensions . </divide.v.1804><divide.v.1805>The first step is to take $ 100 , 000 and divide it into two parts $ 44 , 945 into a single premium immediate annuity ( " SPIA Income " ) and $ 55 , 055 into a MYGA fixed annuity ( Multi-Year Guarantee Annuity ) . For this example , both of these annuities have a contract term of ten years. The 10-year term SPIA , which generates the same income for either a male or a female , could provide a guaranteed monthly income of $ 456.87 , which is an annual income of $ 5 , 482.44. Eighty-two percent of each monthly payment is a return of premium ( called the exclusion ratio ) and is not taxable with nonqualified funds. This means that only 18 of each payment is considered taxable income , so $ 374.63 of monthly income or $ 4 , 495.60 of annual income is not taxable. The ten-year result is that an individual would be guaranteed to be paid $ 54 , 824.40 , of which $ 44 , 956.00 would be not taxable. The $ 55 , 055* that was put in the MYGA would grow to $ 100 , 000 at the end of ten years.

They know that the other person could have divided the pay equally and perhaps should have - but chose instead to claim the lion 's share for self and offer only a measly sop.

Neither do they respect the autonomy of children in the vital matter of choosing their own religious and value commitments. Religious Education and worship in Church and other religious schools are not generally as broad-based and multi-faith as in community schools , and faith schools discriminate against everyone not of their faith - in their admissions and employment policies , their curricula , and their ethos and assumptions about their religion and the worldviews of others. Some faith schools will not even try to serve the whole community , and will divide children not just by religion but also ethnically especially if Muslims , Sikhs , Seventh Day Adventists and other minority religions and denominations get more than the tiny handful of schools they have now. Northern Ireland and Bradford are examples of what happens to communities where children are educated separately and grow up knowing little of each other . </divide.v.1819><divide.v.1820>" We are concerned that people will not be able to access their land , and their agriculture , " Shearer said.

There are gates , but they are only open during certain times , and for set periods , " Shearer said , " making it difficult to farm the land.

In other words , all property owned by married persons on the dissolution of a marriage , whether by death or divorce , is presumed to be the property of both the husband and the wife. Likewise , any debts incurred during the marriage are presumed to the community debt. This means that the debts are presumed to the owed by both the husband and the wife. Like community property , community debt must also be divided in a divorce. However , since the creditor is not a party to the divorce action , the creditor may still pursue either spouse for collection of the debt , as creditors are not bound by the terms of the divorce decree and the divorce court ' s allocation of responsibility for joint debts. If the divorce court orders a spouse to pay a community debt and he or she does not , the other spouse may file an enforcement action against the non-paying spouse . </divide.v.1821><divide.v.1822>We make our split quarters up in 25 Lb. packages which generally includes steaks such as Porter house , T-bone , sirloin , top round , flank , flatiron , and Delmonico.

The goal-oriented subsidy plan is based on the results of a nationwide survey that the government conducted last year. The government used the survey data to divide the Iranian people into ten distinct income groups in order to calculate the potential effects of decreasing government subsidy allocations. Ahmadinejad plans to soften the blow of increased gasoline prices by giving financial handouts to those in the two lowest income brackets. According to the spokesman of the parliament ' s special commission , Kazem Delkhosh , 50 percent of the extra revenue generated from the implementation of this plan will go to social welfare projects such as health insurance , pension programs , and government handouts for the poor. This leaves approximately $ 17 billion in saved revenue that the regime can divert to other government projects.

The Jerusalem Post reports that , for some Palestinians who are Israeli citizens living in the Israeli Arab town of Umm el-Fahm ( population 42 , 000 ) near Jenin , the barrier has " significantly improved their lives " because , on one hand , it prevents would-be thieves or terrorists from coming to their town and , on the other hand , has increased the flow of customers from other parts of Israel who would normally have patronised Palestinian business in the West Bank , resulting in an economic boom.

If that parent then dies without a will and is not survived by a spouse , the remaining one-half of the estate is divided equally among the two children.

So long as the ultimate distribution of property is fair , it doesn ' t particularly matter who gets any particular item of property.

One example of this therapeutic use is bone marrow transplants. Bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells , which can regenerate all the blood cell lineages. However , the use of stem cells for therapy is limited because there are very few stem cells in tissue. If the cells are plated in culture in hopes that they will divide and form more stem cells , the stem cells tend to lose their " stemmess , " so they are no longer capable of regeneration . </divide.v.1919><divide.v.1920>Oklahoma is among the majority of states which utilize the " equitable distribution " doctrine for property division in an Oklahoma divorce.

Turkey not just has taken away all the means of subsistence from millions of Kurds and made them refugees in their own ancestral land or deported them to elsewhere in Turkey , but also has used food ( as a means of survival ) to divide the Kurds between those pro and those against the state and have them turn their weapons against each other . </divide.v.1922><divide.v.1923>In terms of Hispanics , you know Paul , I know the math.

The line of thought that it is okay to divide on ideas or doctrines or theology is completely unbiblical and heretical. All believers in the Way , the Truth adn the Life are to be unified.

Had I decided to round the number to 1000ths instead of 100ths , then I would look at the fourth digit beyond the decimal point and follow the convention of rounding off.

Equally so , the kids can understand that 1/4 divided by 1/2 is 1/2 of a half because the kids can see that only half of the half is covered by the original quarter. The problem comes in when their intuition goes out.

For example , in Alaska , Arizona , California , Idaho , Louisiana , Nevada , New Mexico , Texas , Washington , Wisconsin , and Puerto Rico , property of a married person is classified as either community property ( owned equally by both spouses ) or is the separate property of one spouse. Either party may be entitled to retain certain assets or either party may be required to pay certain debts that the court considers separate. Since all assets and debts are not deemed community property , each spouse will get personal property , assets and debts whose worth adds up to his or her percentage. In all states , assets and earnings accumulated during marriage are divided fairly , but not necessarily equally.

It ' s not clear to me why picking out the wise as the people with the warrant to rule raises any extra justificatory issues. Estlund seems to suggest that when we pick out the wise , we ' re picking specific people to permanently rule over others in a way that we don ' t with majority rule. But that needn ' t be the case. Sometimes we know , with quite a high degree of certainty , who the majority on any given issue or set of issues are , and so if we institute a system of majority rule we are picking out some specific people to rule over others. Especially in societies divided by one major cleavage , where most political disputes turn on whether you belong to religion X or religion Y let ' s say , it is very easy to predict that a system of majority rule is just a mechanism of handing authority to the majority religious group within that society . </divide.v.2044><divide.v.2045>When dividing numbers written in scientific notation , the exponents will be subtracted. Remember that division can be written as a fraction. For example , 2.45 x 10sup &gt; 1/sup &gt; sup &gt; 2/sup &gt; / 3.67 x 10sup &gt; -/sup &gt; sup &gt; 1/sup &gt; sup &gt; 8/sup &gt; can be rewritten ( formula 05.04.01.01 is available in print form ) . Divide the decimals by hand or by calculator. The result is .67 when rounded to two decimal places. When dividing the powers of 10 , 12 ( -18 ) is 30. This gives .67 x 10sup &gt; 3/sup &gt; sup &gt; 0/sup &gt; . Rewrite .67 as 6.7 x 10sup &gt; -/sup &gt; sup &gt; 1/sup &gt; . Multiplying by 10sup &gt; 3/sup &gt; sup &gt; 0/sup &gt; gives a final answer of 6.7 x 10sup &gt; 2/sup &gt; sup &gt; 9/sup &gt; .

Content in the transcripts was divided into sections that corresponded to the interview guide and automatically sorted. From this first sort , I then created more refined categories and themes; searching for what Strauss calls a core category. Core categories contain several key features such as centrality that accounts for a large portion of the variation in a pattern of behavior , frequency , relatedness to other categories , and allows for maximum variation within the analysis ( Strauss , 1987 ) . Charmaz calls this stage focused coding , which is used to build and clarify a category by examining all the data it covers and variations from it. In this way , category properties and subcategories emerge. Rather than treat categories separately , the researcher connects themes to demonstrate complexity and the relationships between categories to help explain the issues and events investigated ( Charmaz , 1983 ) .

At mitosis , when the nucleus divides , one of the nuclei is transferred to the bud , and then the two cells separate. Both haploid and diploid yeast cells divide by budding. The cell division cycle begins with a single , unbudded cell. This cell buds , the bud grows to nearly the size of the parent cell , the nucleus divides , and the two cells separate into two unbudded cells. The cycle then begins again for both of the cells. The result is an exponential increase in the number of cells with a doubling time equal to the mean cell division cycle time.

If the control system proceeds to its next action before the downstream process is completed , the consequences are likely to be fatal or mutagenic to the cell. Thus , if the cell is driven into mitosis before it has finished replicating its DNA , it will pass on broken and incomplete sets of chromosomes to its daughters; if it progresses into anaphase and starts to divide in two before all the chromosomes are aligned on the mitotic spindle , the chromosomes will not be allocated equally between the daughter cells.

All RBC ' s of homozygous recessive men and women will have a G6PD deficiency. The heterozygote female ( one normal and abnormal allele each ) will present with two populations of RBC ' s : one with G6PD and the other without G6PD. This group will be clinically normal , but with about 50 of the level of G6PD in normal individuals. This disorder is found world-wide and is the most common RBC enzyme deficiency associated with hemolysis. The World Health Organization has divided G6PD deficiency into five classes : Class I is the most severe of hemolytic expressions. Class II hemolytic episodes are mild. Class III presents with mild hemolytic episodes. Class IV does not manifest hemolytic episodes. Class V does not manifest hemolytic episodes.

Religious Zionism , which served as a bond between the two camps , by changing its attitudes on foreign policy and adopting some of the maxims of ultraorthodoxy , abandoned its traditional role of a bridge between traditionalism and modernity. The Israeli political map is divided along a left- right horizontal axis and a secular-religious vertical axis. Shas ( the Sephardi religious party ) and Agudat Yisrael ( AY , the ultraorthodox party ) are in the center in terms of the left-right divide on foreign policy; they lie opposite to Labor , the Civil Rights Movement ( CRM ) and the two Arab parties on the horizontal axis. Hence , instead of cross-cutting cleavages that contribute to stability , the political map reflects a divided polity. The departure of the NRP from the Labor camp to the opposite one created a vacuum that no party has been able to fill. Moreover , this shift created an association of religion with hawkishness in foreign policy , thus reinforcing the two cleavages rather than blending them . </divide.v.2197><divide.v.2198>Extending the length and height of liner 14 in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-2 , 5 and bisecting the width of liner 14 is vertical divider wall 46 which divides the interior of liner 14 into cavities 48.

And while it can be argued that the 33 percent of pro-Vietnam respondents in the 2004 poll still represents a decent chunk of the population , it 's also the case than in electoral terms , 33 percent constitutes a fractional minority.

This is not a trivial question , considering the origin of life may have occurred numerous times ( 15 ) and failed to evolve until both the molecular and environmental conditions were suitable. Bacterial cell division is central to our present understanding of microbiology as well as the origin of life forms capable of cell division. Why a bacterial cell divides is still somewhat of a mystery as complete answers are lacking ( 3 ) . It has been suggested bacterial cells divide because beyond a threshold cell size , cellular life is not possible , as the rate of metabolism is insufficient for sustained life ( 3 ) . The cell avoids this condition by dividing which restores a suitable cell size and surface : volume ratio necessary for normal cell processes ( 3 ) . Also , when the cell size increases the surface : volume ratio decreases ( 3 ) . </divide.v.2304><divide.v.2305>Once cytokinesis is completed , the cell has successfully gone through one turn of the cell cycle and produced two cells from a single precursor. For bacteria or yeast , which are single-celled organisms , this cell division will produce a new and complete organism. In a multicellular organism ( like human beings ) , a fertilized single-celled egg requires many cell divisions to make a new individual. In either case it is the completion of the cell cycle that produces new organisms , a process that can go on throughout life. In an adult human , for instance , adult nerve and muscle cells do not divide at all. Liver cells divide once a year. More than one division a day occurs in blood cell precursors in the bone marrow and in the cells lining the gut. Our survival requires a production of millions of cells a second. This fact was illustrated by the exposure of organisms to massive doses of x-rays that stop all cell division and cause an individual to die within a few days. In the end , it is the cell cycle that ensures life will always be able to produce more life in an organized fashion . </divide.v.2305><divide.v.2306>4. They undermine the monotheistic distinctive of the Christian faith. The only way to limit the use of attributes of one Person without limiting the attributes of all three members of the Godhead is to divide God into three divine Beings for each of the three Persons. Jesus could then suspend His omnipotence , omniscience , omnipresence , etc. , while the Father and Holy Spirit would continue to exercise sovereign dominion over the universe. This view of the Trinity , however , is polytheistic , not Christian. The Christian faith is monotheistic. We believe there is only one God. " Hear O Israel ! The Lord our God is one Lord " ( Mark 12 : 29 ) . The Creed of Athenasius affirms this truth : " The Father is God , the Son is God , and the Holy Spirit is God , but there are not three gods , but one God ...

If deprived of these signals , a typical mammalian cultured cell will come to a halt in a quiescent , nongrowing variant of the G1state called G0 , in which the production of components of the cell-cycle control system - and of many other proteins - is switched off. Important extracellular cues for cell proliferation are provided by protein growth factors.

Because Thales had determined the solstices , he would have known of the number of days between say , summer solstices , and therefore have known the length of a solar year. It is consistent with his determination of the solstices that he should be credited with discovering that 365 days comprise a year. It is also a fact that had long been known to the Egyptians who set their year by the more reliable indicator of the annual rising of the star Sirius in July. Thales may have first gained the knowledge of the length of the year from the Egyptians , and perhaps have attempted to clarify the matter by using a different procedure. Thales certainly did not ' discover ' the seasons , but he may have identified the relationship between the solstices , the changing position during the year of the sun in the sky , and associated this with seasonal climatic changes . </divide.v.2321><divide.v.2322>Yes we are divided and people should stop lookin a blind eye.

If America was already polarized as a result of the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years , President George W. Bush took it to a new level with his divisive language and with us or against us rhetoric. To make matters worse , Americans have been deceived repeatedly on the matter of war. First , Saddam Hussein was ousted and Iraq invaded without a formal declaration of war by Congress. Osama Bin Laden , the master-mind behind September 11 was ignored and allowed to go free while we all bought into the danger that Saddam Hussein posed. On the issue of our illegal war , the resolution that followed the invasion was a mere afterthought and Democrats had no choice but to support the President , to do otherwise was political suicide.

Realism focuses on states as rational maximizers of power in an anarchic system; state behavior is mainly a function of the structure of power relations in the system.32 But this emphasis on states means that theorists tend to see the world as divided into territorially distinct , mutually exclusive countries , not broader environmental regions or systems. Realism thus encourages scholars to deemphasize transboundary environmental problems , because such problems often can not be linked to a particular country , and do not have any easily conceptualized impact on the structure of economic and military power relations between states. Realism induces scholars to squeeze environmental issues into a structure of concepts including " state , " " sovereignty , " " territory , " " national interest , " and " balance of power.

The highland peoples can be divided into the northern ethnic groups , with affinities to peoples in southern China , and the southern highland populations , with ties to the Mon-Khmer and Austronesian peoples of Cambodia , Indonesia , and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. A north-south variation also evolved among the ethnic Vietnamese as they expanded southward from the Red River delta along the coastal plain and into the Mekong River delta. After the mid-19th century , Vietnam was divided by the French into Tonkin in the north , Annam in the center , and Cochinchina in the south.

However , the rate of growth diminished as the cells continued to reproduce by cell division. Eventually the cells ceased to divide and died. This cycle of growth by cell division , and eventual death , was remarkably reproducible. In fact , Hayflick could predict exactly when a cell would die - normally after it divided 40-50 times.

There is evidence suggesting that mycin particular may have a critical role in the normal control of cell proliferation. Cells in which myc expression is specifically prevented will not divide even in the presence of growth factors. Conversely , cells in which myc expression is specifically switched on independently of growth factors can not enter G0 , and if they are in G0 when Myc protein is provided , they will leave G0 and begin to divide even in the absence of growth factors - a behavior that ultimately causes them to undergo programmed cell death . </divide.v.2454><divide.v.2455>We need to divide a large property with five sides and strange angles into 1/2 acre parcels from the top down.

There is a simple and powerful strategy for cloning the normal counterpart of any mutant cdc gene. The mutant cells , which are incapable of dividing at high temperature ( the restrictive condition ) , are transfected with plasmids containing random fragments of DNA from normal cells. Occasional mutant cells will receive a DNA fragment that includes a copy of the normal cdc gene that the mutant lacks , and these few cells will be able to divide under the restrictive conditions. By recovering the plasmid DNA from their progeny , one obtains the cdc gene. It can then be sequenced and characterized , and antibodies can be made against its protein product . </divide.v.2461><divide.v.2462>Central to this chapter is the migration to the United States during the 19th century.

In a new study , David Yencken and I argue the causes lie in the way the present system engages public opinion. The basic problem concerns the way longer-term issues come before the public. This happens through the parliament. As soon as matters enter this environment , adversarialism typically takes over. If the government declares a contentious issue to be white , and public opinion is divided or uncertain , the Opposition almost invariably declares it to be black. Yet in government , the Opposition have often supported a similar approach ( for example both major parties on a consumption tax ) . This is not because the Opposition is perverse or malevolent. It happens because , when public opinion is divided or uncertain , rewards accrue to leaders who champion contrasting alternatives , even if they are hollow or only manufactured for political impact . </divide.v.2500><divide.v.2501>When we put 6 on top of the line , we are saying , in shorthand , that when we divide 21 into 1 , 344 , our initial approximation to an answer is 60.

All four of the groups mentioned by Paul in verse 12 were man-centered. The fourth group was a little more subtle about it , but all of these individuals took pride in themselves , based upon their perceived allegiance. Paul wants to make the point clear and unmistakable : Our salvation is totally about Christ ' s work. Those who are man-centered need to be reminded of the gospel and of their salvation , to recall that salvation is Christ-centered. Christ has not been divided , so how can His body , the church , be divided ? It was not Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or any other mere man who died on the cross of Calvary; it was Christ whose shed blood cleansed us from all sin. Baptism testifies to this fact.

The difference between right and left hemispheres has been puzzled over for centuries.

The left hemisphere is detail-oriented , prefers mechanisms to living things , and is inclined to self-interest , where the right hemisphere has greater breadth , flexibility and generosity. This division helps explain the origins of music and language , and casts new light on the history of philosophy , as well as on some mental illnesses. In the second part of the book , he takes the reader on a journey through the history of Western culture , illustrating the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought and belief of thinkers and artists , from Aeschylus to Magritte.

One may reasonably ask what can be the source of its national identity and how has it managed to survive ? Is it really to be classed as a nation-state ? Swiss do not and can not define their national culture by language though Swiss-German , which is incomprehensible outside Switzerland , is something by which the German-Swiss are satisfied to distinguish themselves from 'other ' Germans. Swiss consciousness must be derived from something else. The solution adopted in Switzerland effectively creates a superordinate Swiss identity for certain purposes , while fully recognising the right of the different language groups to develop on a separate basis. Swiss identity is the result of a voluntary but fragile construction which is seen to be vulnerable to movements towards closer European union . </divide.v.2659><divide.v.2660>Loosen the soil , gently , around the plant clump that you plan to divide.

There are a number of ways to accomplish this. The easiest way is to simply award a larger amount of other property to the other spouse. Otherwise , most pensions can be divided with court orders. For so-called qualified plans ( for instance , 401K plans ) , a special qualified domestic relations order or QDRO is required. For IRAs , the property division can simply be in the Decree. When dividing a pension plan or IRA ( other than a Roth IRA or Roth 401K ) , remember that it has pre-tax dollars. Whoever makes the withdrawal must pay the taxes and penalty , if the withdrawal is made before age 59-1/2 ( there is one circumstance when the 10 penalty may be waived ) .

Another example of the use of such a consent judgment is when it is necessary to divide a military pension ( direct payments under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act are available only with a certified copy of a court order ) or to distribute a private pension ( under the Retirement Equity Act , a Qualified Domestic Relations Order , called a " QDRO " for short , is required to bind the pension plan administrator to the terms of the pension division or distribution ) . </divide.v.2730><divide.v.2731>The answer is Probably not , but maybe. The majority of perennial plants should only be divided in early spring , just as the new growth begins to push up and out of the soil. At that point in time there is not much leafy growth that must be sustained by the root - moisture loss from the leaves is at a minimum. Dividing at that time will still cause some transplant shock ( resulting in smaller , fewer leaves for that season ) , but the root will most likely be able to cope with it and the plant will produce new leaves at its own pace according to the health and vigor of the recovering root system. This is true for most perennials , but there are some that are best transplanted in late spring , summer and fall . </divide.v.2731><divide.v.2732>Glenn Beck has a mental problem , he is unstable , and he is an ignorant divider of the American people.

This anemia is caused by impaired DNA synthesis , which leads to the megaloblastic transformation of erythroid precursors. The defective DNA synthesis retards nuclear maturation and causes abnormal mitotic activity which causes the cells to divide too rapidly. The nuclei tend to be large with loosely arranged chromatin material. It is not unusual to observe satellite nuclear pieces in these cells. The cytoplasm maturates at different rates and hemoglobin synthesis is also affected. This abnormal bone marrow environment is characterized by increased cellular destruction and ineffective hematopoiesis. Cells that are released into peripheral circulation tend to be large and oval in shape. The RBC picture may be featured with poikilocytosis and an increased number of dacryocytes. The immature granulocytic cells undergo significant changes. The metamyelocyte tends to be large with a horseshoe shaped nucleus. Neutrophils present with hypersegmentation. The mega-myelocytes tend to be hyposegmented or the nuclear lobes are widely separated.

All states view property acquired before the marriage or received as a gift or inheritance during the marriage as separate property - it is not shared by the marriage. The states are divided about how to treat marital property - the property acquired or earned during the marriage.

Many times the parties are in substantial disagreement as to how to divide these assets. As a consequence , much valuable time is wasted over such issues as dividing ashtrays , rugs and lamps. It is wise to suggest to the parties that they figure out an easy way of doing this property division , such as the auction method. Using this approach , one party places tags on each item ( or lists prices next to the items on a personal property list ) . The other party then states whether he/she will buy the item for that price or sell the item to the other party at that price. This is a fast and fair way of dividing up tangible personal property . </divide.v.2866><divide.v.2867>Before we go on , why do n't we try this out on me.

The people are evenly divided on whether the president 's plan should focus more on costs ( 41 percent ) or on coverage ( 43 percent ) . But only 18 percent think that his plan in fact gives priority to controlling costs , versus 64 percent who believe it is mostly about expanding coverage. And while majorities favor imposing " play or pay " requirements on businesses and raising taxes on Americans with incomes over $ 250 , 000 to pay for health reform , only 33 percent favor taxing people with " expensive health plans , " and 70 percent say that a broader tax on employer-provided health plan is " not acceptable. " The Pew survey also suggests that , relative to 1993 , there is less support for radical change in the system , more support for cost containment as the top priority , and a decline in support for universal health insurance among both Republicans and independents. In light of these doubts , it is not surprising to discover that while 44 percent approve of the president 's handling of health care , 34 disapprove , while 22 percent remain unsure . </divide.v.2870><divide.v.2871>There are three classes into which all the women past seventy that ever I knew were to be divided : 1.

Christ and Culture in Paradox , the Dualists Theologically this position places emphasis on the tension between God and us. Luther is an appropriate representative of this position. While some have argued that Luther divided the relationship between Christ and culture into compartments , H Richard Niebuhr ( 1952 ) contends that Luther is distinguishing rather than dividing. Luther understood the paradox of his thinking , he considered that although Christ and culture are closely interrelated and constantly interact , confusing them would corrupt them both. Luther ' s dualist position can be illustrated by how he developed his notion of vocation. ( Holl , 1958 ) Luther , considered that a vocation linked to ordinary activities was a superior way of serving God than monasticism. In terms of developing this ( at the time radical ) view of vocation Luther ' s paradox of distinction was crucial , as it suggested that technique and spirit interpenetrate. Luther considered that both Christ and culture were necessary for developing a vocation. Reason and culture have an important role to play in developing the techniques of vocation , as the Christian traditions do not supply these. However , the concept of service inherent within vocation , can not be supplied from secular culture , but requires spiritual guidance from the Christian traditions . </divide.v.2896><divide.v.2897>Divide by zero is yet another meme from the kind pedophiles at 4chan.

The most remarkable and essential evil is a vicious connection between politics and business , resulting in irregularities and corruption. The government-managed economy , in other words , is that the government exerts tremendous power to make a certain industry , business or enterprise a winner in the market , or to punish it , disregarding market competition. In this regard , if you can borrow the governmental power or exert influence on policy , you have a sure and easy way to make money. In that case , excessive dependence on difficult and uncertain ways to make money , winning in cutthroat market competition , can sound silly. Therefore , individuals or enterprises come to try to lobby the government , and in response to that , high-ranking officials provide aid to them , intentionally or unintentionally , giving rise to a vicious connection between the politics and business , resulting in irregularities and corruption. Further , this connection between politics and business will divide social members into those with vested interest and those who are underprivileged , and deny the underprivileged of any opportunity for status-ascent . </divide.v.2913><divide.v.2914>The average person who comes into contact with Christadelphians will have met up with the main , Central body of Christadelphians , numbering about 50 , 000 world-wide.

Additionally , each party 's separate property is before the court for allocation to ensure that both parties receive a fair settlement after a divorce. As discussed above , community property laws do not directly apply in same-sex relationships , but the court is permitted to use them for guidance in determining how to divide " community-like " property when a meretricious relationship ends. Unlike in a dissolution of marriage case , however , the court can not divide any separate property of the parties when a meretricious relationship ends; it is only permitted to divide " community-like " property and debt.

( Courtesy of Guenter Albrecht-Buehler. ) Mammalian cells are not easily accessible to detailed observation in the intact animal. Most studies on mammalian cell proliferation therefore use cells that are growing in culture ( Figure 17-34 ) . This gives rise to a complication , however. When cells from normal mammalian tissues are cultured in standard conditions , they usually can be propagated only for a limited number of division cycles - about 50 for typical cells derived from humans , for example; after this they cease dividing and eventually die - a process called cell senescence , which we discuss later. But during the propagation of some cell cultures , especially those derived from rodents , a few cells often arise that escape senescence and divide indefinitely as cell lines. Although these cells resemble normal cells in most respects , their immortality reflects the presence of one or more mutations that have altered their proliferative properties. Nevertheless , in spite of their slight abnormalities , cell lines are used widely for cell-cycle studies - and for cell biology generally - because they provide an unlimited source of cells of a standardized , genetically homogeneous type . </divide.v.2965><divide.v.2966>A will is a written document which sets out how a person wants their assets divided after their death.

Comparable 20-year cycles evidence 210-days of lunar/solar separation time that also evenly divide by 7-intercalary months using 30-days each. Time splitting attributes 105-days to the lunar-side and 105-days to the solar-side of recognition over a 20-year lunar/solar cycle. Every 365-day-solar-year separately assigns one 260-day-Tzolken-sacred-year. Another 105-day portion completes the 365-day-solar-year.

Each section will be considered a separate basin or pool. Each basin contains a certain amount of water which results in a certain average water level in the basin. The relationship between the quantity of water held in a basin and the resulting water level depends critically on the shape of the basin. A section of river flowing through a swamp will experience only a small rise in water level as the quantity of water held in the basin increases. This is because the new water has a large surface area over which to spread. Channelized stretches of river , such as are created when levees are built along side a river , will rise rapidly when faced with an increasing quantity of water because the water can not spread out ( at least until it breaches the levee ! ) . </divide.v.2989><divide.v.2990>What does it mean that fewer Americans see the country as less divided ?

Although the behavioral healthcare sector is much more effective at treating and curing behavioral disorders , insurance plans require the patient to pay more to obtain treatment within the specialty behavioral healthcare sector. And because insurance plans pay carve-outs a flat monthly fee per insured member regardless of how many patients they treat , carve-outs make more money if patients instead seek treatment within the traditional medical sector , where they typically obtain prescription medication for their disorders. Many of these medications have great promise yet turn out to be ineffectively used . </divide.v.3043><divide.v.3044>4. Groups visiting the park are limited to 60 students and teachers.

Yet , as we examine these issues today , it is clear that our context is very different. We are no longer strangers to one another. Isolation has given way to regular contacts , especially here in North America. The prayer of Our Lord for the unity of his followers ( John 17 : 21 ) rings urgently in our ears.

The trial judge apparently accepted that the division of unadjusted pensionable earnings on the s. 55.1 formula was fair. I do not think that there is any error in that conclusion. However , he apparently also assumed that the effect of the division would be to give the wife the equivalent share of the disability pension. He was not aware that the effect of the division would be to substantially reduce the husband 's disability pension , without transferring the amount of the reduction to the wife. To avoid that undesirable result , the disability pension should be allocated entirely to the husband and the wife should receive her 'share ' of that pension through spousal maintenance. The notional portion of her maintenance which reflects her share of the CPP disability pension should only be payable if she does not elect to divide the unadjusted pensionable earnings before normal retirement. Otherwise the effect of the division will be to eliminate the portion of the disability pension that is the intended source of that maintenance . </divide.v.3046><divide.v.3047>telangana people please dont get swayed away by these politicians words.please think.united we develop , once seperated who knows what maybe the next consequences.forming a new state is not that easy .there are many problems yet to come.because of this parttition of telangana and andhra now rayalseema is asking for a new state.if the condition goes on like this then each and every city may also ask for a seperate state.please dont divide our state.many people sacrificed their lives for the formation of ap not see the partition today.please ... ... ... its really sad that our state is being divided.please ... .the people of ap dont allow these politicians to play their games with you . </divide.v.3047><divide.v.3048>It can also be used to divide a planar surface into smaller pieces to apply point colors using a Point SOP.

Although the aspirant had more votes , the established councillor was able to paint a convincing picture of factionalism and divided loyalties.

If the aspirant had fought this , he would have seemed concerned only with personal ambition ( in contrast with the other 's concern for the party ) .

We need an extra argument to justify others exercising authority over that individual , ( for example , we have such an argument in the case of the parenting of children ) . Similarly , in a group situation , collective decision-making among members is the default position. I don ' t think this argument makes any claims about the details : unanimous consent vs majority rule vs elected representatives , all of these fit the default of a single group exercising authority over itself. If society is broken into two or more political groups ( epistocrats and commoners; nobles and serfs; men and women ) , we would need an additional argument to show why one group has authority over the other.

While this idea works for most of our perennials most of the time , there are , indeed , optimal times to divide various plants. Generally , divide plants when they are dormant or close to dormancy. In our area , this would be fall through spring , whenever the soil can be worked. Avoid dividing in extreme hot or cold weather and in very dry and wet conditions.

According to him will has a free choice between opposites , whereas a natural power acts in only one determined way , in response to something else determining it to act. According to Scotus ( and here he refers also to Augustine ) the intellect is such a natural power. But in the second of these paragraphs he notes that Aristotle seems to divide intellect against nature , i.e. to place intellect and will together on the opposite side of the division to nature. Scotus explains that Aristotle means practical intellect , which involves will : it is on account of the freedom of the will that practical intellect can be divided against nature. Thus a medical doctor can use his knowledge either to cure or to kill -- a power of opposites; but this is because he can choose to use it one way or the other. As a student of medicine , as a purely intellectual discipline , he can not help reaching the conclusions to which the evidence points , which means that the intellect acts naturally , nor voluntarily . </divide.v.3148><divide.v.3149>If members can t keep up with reading that much work per month , then divide it up.

In other jurisdictions , such as Texas , a divorce court may decree an " equitable distribution " of community property , which may result in an unequal division of such. In non-community property states property may be divided by equitable distribution. Generally speaking , the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift , bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property ( i.e. , not community property ) .

The Cave Mountain anticline is asymmetric to the northwest with a slightly overturned northwest limb. Adjacent to this northwest limb is a highly folded and faulted zone that is representative of the designated Blue Rock synclinal " shear zone " complex of macroscale structures between the Cave Mountain and the Wills Mountain anticlines. Furthermore , the Cave Mountain anticline is a doubly-plunging fold showing a culmination at the Lower Silurian strata level near Big Bend in the center of the Smoke Holes.

But if it did , it would only carry fuel from Azerbaijan and perhaps Turkmenistan. So the result of the rapprochement of Russia with the US would ultimately be to destroy the barriers that divide Iran and the EU today. Nabucco would then become a serious competitor to Yuzhny Potok , the Russian pipeline which Putin proposes building along the bottom of the Black Sea , with the aim of selling gas to more or less the same markets as Nabucco. This the Kremlin does not want to do , as far as we can tell from all its recent activities. Putin has staked too much in recent years on this aspect of his gas pipeline policy.

This is correct if the columns are more or less equally loaded and equally spaced , but it is difficult to fulfill this requirement in practice so it is allowed that the column loads and spacings to be varied within 20 . However if the downward loads on some areas are much heavier than on others , it is advisable to divide the raft into different areas and design each area on its corresponding average pressure.

The provincial motto , " Seek ye first the Kingdom of God " must be taken as evidence of the deep significance of religion in the life of the province. Undeniably , prejudice and ignorance were fostered by rigidly segregated denominational school systems. While education was always placed in the context of service to and love for God , too often salvation was claimed as exclusive to one church or another.

Let 's imagine that Larry , Moe and Curly each own a profitable company and offer to sell you a stake. Larry will sell you one share for $ 5 , Moe will sell you one for $ 25 , and Curly will sell you one for $ 1 , 000. Would you automatically buy Larry 's stock just because its price is lowest ? Of course not. Instead , you would ask how successful each business is and how many other stockholders you 'll divide profits with. Otherwise you have no way of knowing how much value underlies the price of each stake. Share price by itself is meaningless. Investing in a stock without doing the homework that lets you arrive at a fair estimate of the value of the business it represents is like buying a house without ever having stepped inside.

Five eagle feathers are woven into the cape and certain magical designs are embroidered into it. The cape is the special focus of the spell and a new special focus is needed each time a cape is made.

Suppose there are two groups , A and B. A is sixty percent , B is forty percent of the population. Each has one party. Party A has a majority in sixty percent of the single-member constituencies in first-past-the-post elections. Elections are held : Party A wins sixty percent of the seats and forms the government in perpetuity. Party B and Group B are excluded from power permanently. As you can imagine , this is a situation fraught with conflict : riots , secessionist violence ( if groups are territorially concentrated ) , and coup attempts ( if group B predominates in the officer corps ) . What to do ? Be careful , because if you split Group A into two equal parts , Party A with thirty percent and Party A1 with thirty percent , then Party B , with forty percent , may win a majority of seats on a mere plurality of votes by repeated victories in three-way contests. The result will be an illegitimate government , because a minority has , only because of plurality electoral rules , captured the state machinery . </divide.v.3379><divide.v.3380>My husband is a physician.

Yet many of the divisions are not absolutely distinct ( i.e. , a precise division without any overlapping transitional features ) . For instance , the Lord tells His Apostles to go to the Jews only ( Matthew 10 : 5 ) . However , following His resurrection ( and Calvary ) , His commission to them includes all nations ( Matthew 28 : 19 ) and every creature ( Mark 16 : 15 ) .

The most popular opinions of denominationalism in American Christianity , both evangelical and liberal , are theologically poor , and getting poorer. Denominational partisanship is losing its appeal , as ecumenists had hoped. Sadly , so is the theological confidence that produced the hard- won strengths of the denominations in the first place. They are being replaced not by Christocentric , evangelical , ecumenical ecclesiology , but by pragmatism , consumerism , pluralism , relativism , and theological apathy. These have little to offer hungry disciples , and even less to offer the unchurched. In their own ways , all such ecumenical heresies accept a divine household divided against itself. They settle either for ecclesiological anarchy , or for a " reconciled diversity " which is institutionalized ecclesiological incoherence and denominational pride. Consequently , afflicted traditions are suffering in every other area of Newbigin 's lifetime achievements as Wainwright chronicles them : Faith , evangelism , ecumenism , Church leadership , mission , dialogue , ethics , liturgical and homiletical power , theology , and apologetics . </divide.v.3396><divide.v.3397>On the other hand , the word equality suggests fairness and equity for all parties involved.

For 1 , 000 miles the river flows towards Kinshasa. At first the river is narrow but soon widens as it enters the alluvial plain. From the point where the river widens , strings of islands occur which divide the river into different arms. The width of the Congo River can vary from 3.5 miles to 7 miles , reaching up to 8 miles at the mouth of the Mongala River. Along the banks of the river are natural levees which have been formed by deposits of silt. When the river floods these levees are washed away and the river boundaries are increased . </divide.v.3444><divide.v.3445>A spouse may elect , with the consent of the plan administrator , to have a pension in a hybrid plan divided as if it were in a defined benefit plan ( FRA , s. 75 ( 2 ) ) . </divide.v.3445><divide.v.3446>While courts will divide disability benefits , or order that compensation be paid for them ( e.g. , Jiwa , supra; McClure , supra ) , many courts , often with little analysis , will reapportion entitlement to provide the member with most , or all , of the benefit.

[ 3 ] Because the relativistic mass is exactly proportional to the energy , relativistic mass and relativistic energy are nearly synonyms; the only difference between them is the units. If length and time are measured in natural units , the speed of light is equal to 1 , and even this difference disappears. Then mass and energy have the same units and are always equal , so it is redundant to speak about relativistic mass , because it is just another name for the energy. This is why physicists usually reserve the useful short word " mass " to mean rest-mass . </divide.v.3448><divide.v.3449>The growth and division of cells ( mitosis ) and the formation of sperm and eggs ( meiosis ) are important for almost all organisms , including humans. We all began as a single cell that resulted from our father ' s sperm fertilizing our mother ' s egg. This single cell then divided by mitosis into two cells ( daughter cells ) which then grew and divided into four cells ( Figure 1A ) . This process of mitosis continued until we were born. It then continued again until we were grown up . It is still happening right now as some of our cells use mitosis to replace old dead cells , such as skin cells. Meiosis , on the other hand , is a special form of mitosis that occurs only in a special subset of our cells to form eggs and sperm. In meiosis , one cell divides twice in a row to form four daughter cells from one cell ( Figure 1B ) . Those cells are then modified to become eggs or sperm. Mitosis and meiosis , then , are similar processes , but result in very different types of cells . </divide.v.3449><divide.v.3450>late 14c. , translating L. artes liberales; the seven attainments directed to intellectual enlargement , not immediate practical purpose , and thus deemed worthy of a free man ( liberal in this sense is opposed to servile or mechanical ) .

Young normal cells can divide many times , but these cells are not cancer cells since they have not accumulated all the other changes needed to make a cell malignant. In most instances a cell becomes senescent before it can become a cancer cell. Therefore , aging and cancer are two ends of the same spectrum. The key issue is to find out how to make our cancer cells mortal and our healthy cells immortal , or at least longer-lasting. Inhibition of telomerase in cancer cells may be a viable target for anti-cancer therapeutics while expression of telomerase in normal cells may have important bio-pharmaceutical and medical applications in cell and tissue engineering. In summary , telomerase is both an important target for cancer and for the treatment of age-related disease . </divide.v.3454><divide.v.3455>Converting a media file with a long duration may take a very long time , and you may only be interested in a part of it.

In many tissues and organs , when cells die , other cells within the tissue divide to replace the ones that were lost. The fact that endothelial cell density ( the number of cells/mm2 ) decreases with age strongly indicates that either these cells do not divide at all or do not divide enough to replace the lost cells. Instead of dividing as a means of cell replacement , the remaining endothelial cells simply enlarge and spread to fill the area where the dead cells were once located. This method of healing the endothelium works well to a point; however , if too many cells are lost and the density falls below a certain threshold ( from the average adult cell density of 2000 cells/mm2 down to 400-500 cells/mm2 ) , there are too few cells to maintain the barrier between the cornea and aqueous humor and fluid freely enters the cornea , causing edema ( swelling ) and corneal blindness . </divide.v.3475><divide.v.3476>How Does Division Work ?

Nobody ever wanted to divide Ireland. The problem was that while the territory was united pre-1920 , the people were already divided.

One of the most important reasons for this was that Ulster , and particularly Belfast , had benefited more from the industrial revolution than had the rest of Ireland. The shipbuilding industry was booming in Belfast and this necessitated good relations and close ties with the rest of Britain and the Empire. At that time , it was also feared that being ruled from Dublin would be harmful to civil and religious liberties.

The embryo continues to divide within the zona pellucida. The more cells that it divides into , the more likely the pregnancy is able to become established. The embryo then has to break out of its own zona pellucida in order to make contact with the maternal uterus. If it is not able to do that this pregnancy will be lost , and it will never have been detectable as a pregnancy. As women age they produce zone pellucidas that are harder for the embryo to get out of. The embryo mass in an aged ovary also has additional problems in getting out of the zona pellucida. This is likely the primary mechanism where by there is markedly decreased fertility in women as they age.

A theory widely accepted in explaining politics in Europe is " consociationalism. " In American terminology , it means power sharing by elites. This arrangement has characterized politics in divided European countries , where elites of opposing camps after elections reach an agreement on how to divide power and thus encourage their respective camps to support state institutions. This arrangement , which characterized relations between the secular and religious camps in Israel , broke down in 1977. With the defeat of Labor , the new coalition was no longer an alliance between two ideologically opposing elites. It was a coalition between parties close to one another , a nationalist party ( Likud ) and a national religious one ( NRP , the National Religious party ) . Though secular , the Likud and its leader Menachem Begin attracted the ultraorthodox parties into the government. In this new government coalition , the elites sharing power did not bring into the arrangement ideologically opposing camps but rather contiguous groups. Indeed , after 1977 the " historical alliance " between Labor and the NRP broke down and has never been reconstructed.

Morphologically , the chromosomes can be divided into three classes. Metacentric chromosomes have the centromere located at or near the middle of the structure , resulting in two arms of equivalent ( or nearly so ) length. These chromosomes appear V-shaped when observed during anaphase. In contrast , a telocentric chromosome has the centromere positioned very near one end and appears to migrate as a single arm.

Generally , a QDRO is written by a lawyer who practices in the area of employment benefits law , rather than by a divorce lawyer. If the non-employee 's share is transferred directly into an IRA , it does not count as a distribution from the plan and no taxes are payable , so no withholding is required. This is possible only with a defined contribution plan. With a defined benefit plan , the QDRO provides that the non-employee spouse will wait and begin to draw a pension later according to the terms of the plan , unless the pension is already being paid and the non-employee 's share therefore can start to be paid immediately. With a defined benefit plan , lump sum payment from the plan of an amount representing the non-employee share of the future pension benefits is not available.

Nevertheless , certain aspects are universal2. This is because every cell must accomplish its most fundamental task copy and pass on its genetic information to the next generation of cells. This requires the replication of the DNA in each chromosome , followed by the acurate separation of the chromosomes into the daughter cells so that each cell receives a copy of the entire genome. Once accomplished , the cell will physically divide to produce two identical daughter cells. Since it is dividing its contents in two , under most circumstances , cells will also double their mass ( including duplicating their cellular machinery ) . This helps cells to avoid the problem of getting smaller each time they divide . </divide.v.3854><divide.v.3855>Children often do not solve division problems until after the primary grades.

Conflict over writing decisions also provides a good teaching tool because the conflict focuses the students ' attention on a writing issue. Logistical Issues : Collaborative writing groups often need to meet outside of class , so groups need to be divided so that this is relatively convenient.

The Waqf are the Muslim trustees to whom Moshe Dayan ( a non-Jewish Jew ) gifted the Holy Temple Mount of King Solomon after Israel liberated the eastern half of Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Days War.

To maximize payout for the group , one hunter should go in each direction. A social group encourages this , by allowing for communication between them. Again we see a use for a hierarchy though. Consider what happens if some directions are better than others. Suppose that if you go north you only have a 1/5 chance of getting an elephant , but if you go south , you have a 1/2 chance of getting an elephant. It 's desirable to go south , but if everyone goes south , they will all eventually starve.

An egg that has left its protected state secretes a protein shell referred to as the zona pellucida. This shell is a major barrier to sperm and has to be overcome by the sperm. However , once the egg has been penetrated by a sperm and fertilization has occurred , the embryo divides inside this shell. The embryo must break out of this shell in order to establish itself as a pregnancy in the mother. As women get older they produce more abnormal shells and their embryos have a greater difficulty in getting out of them.

When using an air curtain for insect and dust control , the directional vanes in the air outlet nozzle should be directed outward not only to repel the insects and dust but to also allow the least amount of air to come inward when hitting the floor. If mounted on the outside of the doorway and used for the purpose of holding in air conditioning when the door is open , the directional vanes should be slanted slightly outward. Mounted on the inside of a cooler , the vanes should be turned slightly into the refrigerated room. It is important to remember that when an air curtain is used for refrigeration or climate control , it is absolutely necessary to adjust the velocity control so the air stream gently hits the floor with the least amount of vacuum reaction , thus pulling the air out of the protected room and defeating the intended function of the air curtain and causes icing on the floor . </divide.v.3916><divide.v.3917>Heading into the first election in which an African-American will be a major-party presidential nominee , Americans are sharply divided by race , with blacks and whites holding vastly different views of Sen.

His enemies pierced that body , but his children sunder the spiritual body in twain and sever it , member from member , part from part , and leave it torn and lifeless without power to save itself or others. In every letter written by the apostles the sin of division is condemned -- the danger is signalled and Christians forewarned against it as the sure premonition of death. The Master and the apostles not only warn against a danger so threatening , and so fatal and fearful in its results , but they give directions how to avoid division , and the way to promote and maintain unity.

The Old City of Jerusalem , the biblical city , fell into the hands of Jordan and Jerusalem became a divided city until 1967.

Then , instruct the groups to divide into clusters that are not so obvious; that is , you may or may not be able to identify how they grouped themselves by looking. The groups will have to talk among themselves to figure out how they want to cluster themselves. Once again , each group tries to guess how the other group clustered themselves. The small groups are allowed to ask yes or no questions of the other group to help figure this out. Questions can be : Can we tell by looking at you how you are clustered ?

To establish the dates of the solstices , Thales probably made repeated observations of the risings and settings of the sun.

Long years of experience with these matters tells us that the longer it takes to get an agreement signed , the less likely it will be that you will get it signed at all. As a general rule , relations between the parties after separation tend to get worse before they get better. We tell our clients that there is generally a small window of opportunity to get an agreement signed - perhaps a couple of months - before the negative psychology of divorce takes over. If the agreement is not signed while this window is open , you may find yourself in a complicated and rancorus and expensive " contested " divorce situation wherein your assets will be divided between your attorneys and not between yourselves. To repeat - GET IT SIGNED NOW ! ! </divide.v.4061><divide.v.4062>The grey matter of the spinal cord is in turn divided into the dorsal horn , which receives sensory inputs , and the ventral horn , whose neurons innervate the skeletal muscles.

For Layout 3 only 9 divided the nodes into two groups; instead 49 divided the nodes into three groups. This suggests that the spatial clustering of nodes , not simply the structure of the graph , is influencing respondents perceptions of the group structure. A chi-square test of independence supports the hypothesis that the number of groups reported by respondents is not independent of layout . </divide.v.4063><divide.v.4064>In this situation , the Act states that the surviving spouse gets a preferential share.

I can not dismiss the important claims that divide the Christian traditions. In fact , now that I understand how division harms those even on the right sides of the debates , I must take them more seriously than ever. The indicative- imperatives Paul applied to the Church in Corinth apply also directly to the Church in Los Angeles , as they apply to the universal Church : Be one , as you really are one ( cf. 1 Cor. 5 : 7 , 2 Cor. 7 : 1 ) . Many of the issues that divide Christians are legitimate issues. Some are crucial enough to warrant prolonging the visible disunity of Christ 's Church until they are settled ( for instance , those facing the Church in Galatia ) .

Everything owned and everything owed during the marriage is community if the asset was acquired through time , effort or skill and if the debt was incurred during the marriage. It does not matter who earned the asset , nor who incurred the debt. This is still true even only one person works or only one person benefitted from the debt. All community assets and all debts are divided equally. Finally , spouses often worry about debts the other party is accumulating after they separate. Those debts would be a separate obligation , and so long as the debt has not been incurred in both parties ' names , they are of no consequence. If the debts were incurred in both parties ' names , they are still a separate obligation , but the creditor will usually not honor this distinction because both parties would have guaranteed payment of the debt regardless of their marital status. In this instance , both parties ' credit could be damaged if the party who incurred the debt does not pay . </divide.v.4073><divide.v.4074>I divide into many different parts whenever I try to look at myself.

This algorithm is significant from a theoretical standpoint not only because it was the first one but also it uses the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The 'Divide-and-Conquer ' is one of the fundamental paradigms for designing efficient algorithms. In this paradigm , the original problem is recursively divided into several simpler sub-problems of roughly equal size , and the solution of the original problem obtained by merging the solutions of the sub-problems. In the divide-and-conquer approach of Shamos and Hoey , the set of sites , S , is split up by a dividing line into subsets SL and SR of about same sizes.

Unless we destroy the root cause of the whole terrorism tree , we will not be able to eliminate terrorism from the region which has been transformed into a centralized processing unit working under an integrated system not conveniently accessible unless Pakistan is divided in at least four parts. It is essential to divide the northern part of Pakistan into two countries that is Punjabistan and Pakhtoonistan. The Punjabistan will be on the eastern side and the present province of Punjab can be converted into Punjabistan while the North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) having its borders with Afghanistan should be made another country called Pakhtoonistan. The new Pakhtoonistan will be a country loyal to the international comity of nations and shall not harbor any terrorists within its geography. Punjabistan shall not have any access to terrorist camps now being run by Pakistan Army in Afghanistan and NWFP as Pakhtoonistan will be a hurdle between Afghanistan and Punjabistan. The Pakistan Army mainly belongs to Punjab and hence the creation of Punjabistan and Pakhtoonistan will break the integrated network between Afghanistan and ISI ( Pakistan Army ) . </divide.v.4182><divide.v.4183>Immediately , people began asking for a twice a month group.

It makes the Berlin Wall look like a back fence. And look at the land it manages to steal in the process " steal " because the wall , the fence , is not being built on the border. If Israel was building its wall on its own borders , then nobody could complain. But here , it 's a land grab , pure and simple. Ever so illogically , though , by the time the wall gets to here , they 're building it smack bang in the middle of the main road that runs north from Jerusalem. Here , the wall divides Arab from Arab. It 's 100 percent Arab on both sides of the wall and all of this is on land that Israel illegally occupies . </divide.v.4192><divide.v.4193>3.

A quadrature signal at one-half of the input frequency is obtained , without the noise associated with the use of latches to obtain the divided signal. In the differential embodiment , a symmetrical circuit is provided , where the paths of the input signals , phase-shifted by 180 , is identical. Because of the reduction of noise associated with the quadrature divider , a homodyne transmitter can be implemented without an extra noise shaping filter for telecommunication standards that require very low noise floor. This leads to cost , area and power reduction with respect to a noisier divider. Moreover the use of a VCO with twice the frequency of the transmit VCO will reduce coupling between the two devices . </divide.v.4194><divide.v.4195>The first day in Base Camp is always a rest day and a good occasion to take a bath and go for a short walk. We will divide expedition loads to carry to the next camp; community gear , fuel , food and individual lunches. Often our loads aren ' t heavier than 50 lbs. Although this may not seem very heavy to you , with the combination of high altitude it can be a considerable challenge to anyone. Make sure your pack is at least 6000 cubic inches capacity since some days you will need this much space for the high traverse ( to the normal route ) for our Traverse expeditions. Often for the descent the packs are huge since we carry everything at once. At this point in the trip our food and fuel supply is low. Everything else that we have been double carrying or cache-ing , including our garbage , has to go down in one carry . </divide.v.4195><divide.v.4196>The death of the Feminist movement has been replaced with bikinis , legal proposition and the low level issue of equal pay is now just a television ticker.

Do not try to make people love each other or at least do not put all your eggs in that basket. Do not try for national unity or national integration or nation-building. There is no short way to get there from here. It took hundreds of years to produce integrated national entities where they exist , and severely divided societies like Northern Ireland can not wait for that. For them , the short-run is crucial . </divide.v.4198><divide.v.4199>How can that be done without reverting to anarchy ? The only way is to revert to the Authority of God. Anarchy is a state without authority. If we accept the Authority of God we are not without authority , but before we can accept the Authority of God we have to get our theology right. We have to be quite clear about what we mean by God. The Christian version of the Holy Trinity - Three Persons in One God - has been corrupted by the State 's misconception of religion into the secular version of Three Faiths in One God , that is to say Judaism , Christianity and Islam. The State hopes they can be relied upon always to treat one another as bad neighbours , and that they never unite to challenge the authority of the State. So long as these three Faiths behave as the State wants them to behave , atheists , for whom the State is all , will go on insisting that as God can not be as He seems to be in our divided and muddled theology , He does not exist at all . </divide.v.4199><divide.v.4200>Representing a cross section of humanity , Bah ' s come from virtually every nation , ethnic group , culture , profession , and social or economic class. More than 2 , 100 different ethnic groups are represented , a demonstration of global unity in diversity. Yet , despite this diversity , the Bah ' community is virtually free of schism or factions. Indeed , among the greatest accomplishments of the Bah ' Faith has been its ability to resist the impulse to divide into sects and subgroups that has plagued every other religion . </divide.v.4200><divide.v.4201>Now , you might think : if any number divided by zero is zero , then that would imply that zero times zero equals any number.

The Mayan version adapts the 104-year Venus Rounds and consequently , two 52-year Calendar Rounds. For comparison , the Judaic version associates a 105-year Venus Round with 50-year Jubilee Cycles. Both cases calculate the cascaded operation of a 364-day-Ethiopic-year by numerically matching 1-day to 1-year. The third 400-year-Baktun-cycle ends at the secondary midpoint age at 1200-l/s-years.

If one does not make a bequest of up to one third of the estate , then all of the estate will be divided between the surviving relatives. The Messenger of Allah ( Allah bless him &amp;give him peace ) forbade from making a bequest of giving one s wealth in charity which is more than one third , and regarding a third also , he stated : And a third is also more ( although permissible ) .

Depending on the real time requirements , the different methods are used accordingly. One of the best ways to calculate the new stock price is to divide the previous stock price by the stock split ratio. For example , if a company adopts 2-1 stock split option , then divide Rs.100 by 2 that will result in Rs.50 per share. For 3-1 stock split option , then divide : Rs.100/3 will result in Rs.33.33 per share overall . </divide.v.4213><divide.v.4214>Often , historians say , walls have the reverse of their intended security effect because they stir animosity amongst those being kept out , or , in the case of the Berlin Wall , kept in. They say walls more deeply divide already divided people and give rise to violence instead of quelling it. CSO itself took a wry look at historical walls and their relative ineffectiveness in Debreifing. And in an excellent 2003 piece on NPR by Debra Schifrin , one expert quotes a Mexican migrant who says that if a cow runs out of grass to graze on one side of a wall , it will find away across to eat the grass on the other side.
