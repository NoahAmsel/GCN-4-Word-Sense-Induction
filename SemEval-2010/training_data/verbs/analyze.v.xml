Innovating firms are increasingly generating new knowledge in collaboration with partners. In this study , we analyze how the knowledge differences between the innovating firms and their suppliers in Canada are likely to result in pioneering innovations. The knowledge difference is decomposed into two dimensions : the inter-industrial dimension and the geographic dimension in national context. Using the Canadian Innovation database , we found the inter-industry difference has an inverted U-shaped effect and the country difference has a negative effect on the likelihood of generating pioneering innovation. The findings of this paper suggest that for generating pioneering innovation , it is important not only to search for suppliers from different industries to get access to various complementary external knowledge sources but also to find suppliers from the same or nearby countries for the sake of communication and coordination . </analyze.v.6><analyze.v.7>This paper contains an investigation on a particular kind of non-linear rational expectations equilibrium in financial markets. By adopting an agent based computational finance ( ACF ) paradigm we will analyze whether using real options theory in financial markets is useful. Do agents who incorporate option value -when forming their trading prices - obtain higher profits ? Real Options based valuation can be a valuable tool when the agents interacting in the market are homogenous in their cognitive abilities to understand and learn market dynamics , even if they are heterogenous in their ideas or ''market theories''. Speed of the learning process is another factor which crucially determines the relevance of an options based approach to valuation. If we introduce a small portion of traders acting on the basis of different strategies , we observe drastic deviations from the rational benchmark. Moreover the profitability of ROV based traders is inferior to random guessing , and to neural network based strategies . </analyze.v.7><analyze.v.8>A media diary is another effective technique for integrating ethical issues within the psychology curriculum. Portrayals of mental health professionals are abundant in film ( e.g. , Analyze This ) , television ( e.g. , Frasier , Ally McBeal ) , and in fiction.

In 1961 however , the New York courts decided Kilberg v. Northeast Airlines. ( 17 ) A plane from New York crashed on Nantucket attempting to land. Kilberg had a round trip ticket bought in New York. On a breach of contract of safe carriage claim the New York courts held that since it was a new York contract , they would not enforce Massachusetts ' low wrongful death limit. This was followed by Babcock v. Johnson , also in New York. ( 18 ) In a car crash in Ontario , Canada , the local law did n't permit a guest to sue a host. The New York court looked at the interests of the various states ( and provinces ) involved to see which had the greatest interest in that particular issue , deciding that New York 's interest outweighed Ontario's. Most other states have abandoned Lex Loci and have some type of interest analysis.

The deep-level transient spectroscopy ( DLTS ) technique is used in this work to characterize the defect properties , yielding relevant information about the defect types , their capture cross-sections , and energy levels and densities in the CIGS cells. Three solar cells developed using different absorber growth technologies were analyzed using DLTS , capacitance ? voltage ( C ? V ) , and capacitance ? temperature ( C ? T ) techniques. It was found that CIS cells grown at the University of Florida exhibits a middle-gap defect level that may relate to the cell 's low fill factor and open-circuit voltage values observed. A high efficiency ( gc &gt; 18 ) CIGS cell produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) was found to contain three minority-carrier ( electron ) traps and a 13 CIGS cell produced by the Energy Photovoltaics Inc. ( EPV ) exhibited one majority ( hole ) trap. The approach followed using the DLTS technique serves as a paradigm for revealing the presence of significant defect levels in absorber materials , and may be used to support the identification of remedial processing operations . </analyze.v.69><analyze.v.70>Methodological triangulation is the use of different research methods to study a single research problem.

Anthropologists generally concentrate in sociocultural anthropology , archaeology , linguistics , or biological-physical anthropology. Sociocultural anthropologists study the customs , cultures , and social lives of groups in settings from nonindustrialized societies to modern urban centers. Archaeologists engage in the systematic recovery and examination of material evidence , such as tools and pottery remaining from past human cultures , in order to determine the history , customs , and living habits of earlier civilizations. Linguistic anthropologists study the role of language in various cultures. Bio- physical anthropologists study the evolution of the human body , look for the earliest evidences of human life , and analyze how culture and biology influence one another.

Teachers do this every time they analyze test scores. A common technique is to measure or determine central tendency. When the teacher adds all scores and divides the sum by the number of students who took the test , he or she finds the mean or average score. The mean is most often used as the central tendency. Other methods of arriving at the central tendency include finding the median and the mode. If scores are organized from the lowest to the highest , or the highest to the lowest , the median score is the middle score. Half of the grades are below this score and half are above.

Concepts such as " mind " or " consciousness " are not used by behaviorists because such terms do not describe actual psychological events ( such as imagining ) but are used as explanatory entities hidden somewhere in the organism. By contrast , behaviorism treats private events as behavior , and analyzes them in the same way as overt behavior.

If these questions interest you , consider checking out consumer psychology. A large part of consumer psychology deals with understanding how consumers process information , form judgments , and make decisions regarding the purchasing of products and services. Consumer psychologists are involved in determining the factors that lead to these decisions. For example , a psychologist might design a study to evaluate which type of cereal box design will most likely influence individuals to purchase a particular type of cereal. In addition to the marketing of products , consumer psychologists are also employed in the area of merchandise sales. Psychologists have extensively studied different types of sales techniques and can offer advice to salespersons as to what techniques have been found to be most effective. Consumer psychologists are also asked to analyze target populations of individuals. Purchasing trends or demographic information may be collected to determine consumer needs and interests.

When the food item is analyzed down to its basic sub-indices , this huge rise in the relative price variability in FBT in 2002 was mainly due to the fresh vegetable and fruit items , which exhibited very low inflation rates compared to the other sub-indices of food that are less affected by the favorable supply conditions . </analyze.v.191><analyze.v.192>Similar issues arise in occupational or organizational practice. For example , a psychologist has been retained by a corporation 's senior management to analyze how they can most effectively rebuild team spirit after a merger and downsizing.

Financial institutions must also file STRs with the BMA , which supervises these institutions. In March 2005 , the BMA started receiving STRs from banks and financial institutions via a secure website. Non-financial institutions are required under a Ministry of Industry &amp;Commerce ( MOIC ) directive to also file STRs with that ministry. The BMA analyzes the STRs , of which it receives copies , as part of its scrutiny of compliance by financial institutions with anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing ( AML/CFT ) regulations , but it does not independently investigate the STRs ( responsibility for investigation rests with the AMLU ) .

Obligated entities ( including financial institutions , institutions regulated by the Superintendence of Securities and the Superintendence of Notaries , export and import intermediaries , credit unions , wire remitters , exchange houses and public agencies ) are required to file suspicious transaction reports with the UIAF , and are barred from informing their clients of their reports. Most obligated entities are also required to establish " know-your-customer " provisions. Exchange houses must file currency reports for transactions involving $ 700 or more.

Because of a lack of a domestic interbank dollar clearing system , even dollar transfers between domestic Angolan banks are logged as " international " transfers , thus creating an incentive to settle transfers in cash. The local banking system imports approximately $ 200-300 million in net cash per month , largely in dollars , without a corresponding cash outflow. Reportedly , local bank representatives have noted that clients have walked into banks with up to $ 2 million in a briefcase to make a deposit. These massive cash flows occur in a banking system ill equipped to detect and report suspicious activity.

The Government is currently in the process of determining how to ensure that casinos and unlicensed remittance agents incorporate stringent anti-money laundering controls. A new asset seizure law has entered into effect , but the legal community questions whether the burden of proof should be shifted to make it easier to obtain ultimate forfeiture. As the law now stands , the prosecution must prove that the defendant knew the assets came from illegal activities in addition to proving the underlying crime. The islands enacted comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation mandating the creation of a reporting center ( MOT NA ) to collect and analyze unusual transactions. There are also know-your-customer requirements as well as reporting and record-keeping requirements. Criminals who would use the Netherlands Antilles to launder money are probably not significantly deterred by the money laundering laws because standards for proving the underlying crime standard are so difficult to meet. The banking community , however , does seem to have changed its practices. Indications are that banks are taking fairly burdensome steps to ensure that they are in compliance with reporting requirements . </analyze.v.206><analyze.v.207>Once in practice , mental health professionals use their knowledge in a systematic manner.

On November 18 , 1997 , the European Union announced its intention to file a complaint before the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , arguing that the United States provided American exporters illegal subsidies by permitting them to use Foreign Sales Corporations to exempt a fraction of export profits from taxation. Share prices of American exporters fell sharply on this news , and its implication that the WTO might force the United States to eliminate the subsidy. The share price declines were largest for exporters whose tax situations made the threatened export subsidy particularly valuable. Share prices of exporters with high profit margins also declined markedly on November 18 , 1997 , suggesting that the export subsidies were most valuable to firms earning market rents. This last evidence is consistent with strategic trade models in which export subsidies improve the competitive positions of firms in imperfectly competitive markets . </analyze.v.224><analyze.v.225>This section of ENL 2022 is designed to provide a semester-length survey of British writers from the Romantic period through the early twentieth century.

The very fact that cognitive processes are going on inside the organism suggests that the cognitive account is closer to physiology than the contingencies of reinforcement studied by those who analyze behavior. But if cognitive processes are simply modeled upon the environmental contingencies , the fact that they are assigned to space inside the skin does not bring them closer to a physiological account. On the contrary , the fascination with an imagined inner life has led to a neglect of the observed facts. The cognitive constructs give physiologists a misleading account of what they will find inside . </analyze.v.254><analyze.v.255>Citing the findings of a GAO study ( link to .pdf ) which in turn analyzes the AMA ' s own statistical data , AAJ notes that : </analyze.v.255><analyze.v.256>A Collegiate Fellows course; see page 3 of this COURSE GUIDE for a complete list of Collegiate Fellows courses. The course will introduce the economic analysis of financial markets and financial decision making. Topics covered will include asset pricing theory , net present value analysis , arbitrage strategies , portfolio management , and financial market behavior. The course will develop a capacity to understand and analyze policy issues relating to financial markets. There will be substantial emphasis on creative use of economic methods to think critically and constructively , through case studies of currently relevant policy problems as regulation of mergers and takeovers and government loan guarantees. Students will work with spreadsheet and financial analysis programs , will experience the feel of the " pit " through experimental computer markets and guest lectures from market professionals , and will keep up with current finance news through daily reading of The Wall Street Journal. There will be a midterm and a final exam.

With the possible exception of Taves 's fine essay at the beginning , it seeks neither to analyze Verne as a writer nor to understand Verne 's Voyages Extraordinaires in the context of world literature or the genre of science fiction. Not surprisingly , therefore , one finds very little bibliographic information about the large amount of literary criticism devoted to Verne published over the past few decades ( even those monographs and articles available in English ) . One reason , of course , is that the main consumer market targeted by this publication is the general public and collectors of Verniana. While it is true that the latter -- probably more concerned with the completeness of their individual collections or the value of their Verne books as objets d'art -- might not have found such a chapter of great interest , an annotated secondary bibliography of this sort , even a brief one , would nevertheless have added greatly to the value of this text as a research tool for all students and scholars of literature . </analyze.v.260><analyze.v.261>Server-side analyzation is currently the most prevalent among custom and third party detection solutions. This is due in part to the consistency and availability of server logs that already track many of the needed data points. However , pure server-side analyzation also does not require front end integration , making 3rd party integration relatively simple. A major downside to this method is that all relevant data is analyzed long after the events have happened which only makes it possible to avoid certain traffic sources in the future and makes it necessary to have a feedback loop which tells the analyzed system to undo charges for clicks hours our days after the events have happened. This not only becomes an accounting nightmare , but also misses the opportunity to catch fraudulent behavior as it ' s happening. Client-side data coupled with server-side data in a realtime system can identify patterns and known behavior models as they are happening , making it possible to stop fraud short in its tracks before large sums of money are wasted on fraudulent clicks and before upstream publishers and advertisers are affected with the same bad traffic . </analyze.v.261><analyze.v.262>The Easterlin Paradox suggests that there is no link between the level of economic development of a society and average levels of happiness. We return to Easterlin ' s question : Will raising the incomes of all increase the happiness of all ? and analyze multiple rich datasets spanning recent decades and a broader array of countries. We establish a clear positive link between GDP and average levels of subjective well-being across countries with no evidence of a satiation point beyond which wealthier countries have no further increases in subjective well-being. Moreover , we show that this relationship is consistent with the relationship between income and happiness within countries , suggesting a minimal role for relative income comparisons as drivers of happiness. Finally , we examine the relationship between changes in subjective well-being and income over time within countries , finding a powerful role for economic growth in raising happiness . </analyze.v.262><analyze.v.263>Psychologists perform a wide variety of tasks and work in a number of different clinical and research settings. Generally , psychologists provide mental health care or investigate and analyze human behavior. They use a variety of diagnostic tests and tools to treat patients including interviews , psychological tests , and other methods that may require a physician. Treatment methods may include psychotherapy , medication , and rehabilitation.

One of the most commonly used methods for qualitative research in educational psychology is " protocol analysis. " [ 29 ] In this method the research participant is asked to " think aloud " while performing a task , such as solving a math problem. In protocol analysis the verbal data is thought to indicate which information the subject is attending to , but is explicitly not interpreted as an explanation or justification for behavior. In contrast , the method of verbal analysis [ 30 ] does admit learners ' explanations as a way to reveal their mental model or misconceptions. Conversation analysis and discourse analysis , psycholinguistic methods that focus more specifically on the structure of conversational interchange ( such as between a teacher and student ) , have been used to assess the process of conceptual change in science learning. [ 31 ] Qualitative methods are also used to analyze information in a variety of media , such as students ' drawings and concept maps , video-recorded interactions , and computer log records . </analyze.v.267><analyze.v.268>Through their interventions , psychologists help people understand , explain , and modify their behaviour to overcome stress and other mental health issues that affect their lives.

In teaching and learning practices , behaviorism centers on students ' efforts to accumulate knowledge and on teachers ' efforts to transmit it. It therefore relies on a transmission , instructional approach which is largely passive , teacher-directed and controlled . On the other end of the spectrum , constructivism stresses that knowledge is seen as relative , varying according to time and space. Constructivism basically means that as we experience something new , we understand it with the aid of our past experiences. A constructivist views learners as actively engaged in making meaning , and constructivist learning design concentrates on what learners can analyze , investigate , collaborate , share , build and generate based on what they already know , rather than what facts , skills , and processes they can parrot ( 2001 ) . </analyze.v.273><analyze.v.274>Every contact can potentially increase or decrease the strength of the relationship that is so critical to your success.

In my current research and analyses ( funded by a multi-year NSF grant under the Human Capital Initiative and now by a grant from the W.E.

Reduction in the occupation or industry detail would be disastrous for this and other similar research in the field because employment segregation is very sensitive to the level of data available. More broadly the extensive and growing research literature on sex segregation has relied heavily on measurement of sex composition at the detailed occupation level. Reducing occupational detail would seriously hinder such research and analyses of trends would be rendered impossible. Similarly , segregation researchers have just recently begun to move beyond black-white-hispanic comparisons to study segregation using more detailed definitions of race and ethnicity.

As a profession , psychology involves the practical application of knowledge , skills , and techniques for the solution or prevention of individual or social problems; the professional role also provides an opportunity for the psychologist to develop further his/her understanding of human behavior and thus to contribute to the science of psychology . </analyze.v.313><analyze.v.314>&lt; b &gt; PhD in Psychology or Psy D 10 years directly related work experience as a practicing licensed Psychologist which includes the testing , assessment and treatment of adolescents.

Using algorithms like ID3 and CART , the task is to determine inductively which features do the best job of discriminating between the various case outcomes that need to be classified and to organize case memory with respect to those induced features. IIT have two advantages. First , they can automatically , objectively , and rigorously analyze the cases to determine the best features for distinguishing them , ( providing the major system-building advantage over rule-based approaches ) . Second , the cases can be organized for retrieval into hierarchical structure that increases the retrieval time by only the log of the number of cases rather than linearly. Retrieval time can be an important factor when using libraries of cases numbering in the thousands. To performs induction , however , the system needs a reasonable quantity of cases to generate accurate discriminating features and it can take a lot of upfront time to perform the inductive analysis , which is inductive indexing 's primary drawback . </analyze.v.318><analyze.v.319>Graduate and undergraduate students who wish to get involved in the work described above should email Professor Dunning at dad6 cornell.edu.

This econometric study related changes in productivity trends ( which are equated with technical progress ) , in different sectors of the US economy , to price changes in the different inputs. Although energy productivity did improve when energy prices rose , this was more than offset by reduced productivity growth in other factor inputs at the same thile. They found that overall. " technology change has been negatively correlated with energy prices . . . if energy prices increase , the rate of productivity growth will decrease. " However , such results may be very sensitive to the model specification , and as argued in Grubb ( 79 , Chapter 3 ) , the transition from " has been " to " will " in this excerpt conceals the importance of innumerable extraneous factors in the years analyzed , most notably the macro-economic impact of the sudden and externally imposed oil price shocks.

Both books describe and analyze the same concept and provide examples , often the same examples. For instance , both books assert that terrorist attacks of an 11 September 2001 magnitude were foreseeable. Both books point out that many analysts who closely followed terrorism predicted it was a matter of time until such attacks occurred , and yet our strategic leaders were unable to prevent them. The books also explore coming surprises and again use some of the same examples , such as global warming and America 's looming fiscal crisis. For those who may be reluctant to pick up this book because they have already read Inevitable Surprises , it should be noted that the Bazerman and Watkins book has added utility. While Inevitable Surprises addressed the root causes of predictable surprise and strategies to deal with them , it did so in a passing fashion.

Additional controlled studies on a large scale are needed to assess the efficacy of LSD as an adjunct to psychotherapy with a satisfactory degree of scientific accuracy.

The first is that one must be able to understand statistics in order to read psychology research articles. The field of psychology is based on research findings which are found using statistics. Most classes one will take in the field of psychology will use research findings as examples or to illustrate the issues being discussed. If you can not understnad the statistics involved , then one can not completely understand the issue being discussed. A second reason why statistics is important for becoming a psychologist is that one must be able to understand statistics if they themselves are going to do any sort of research. At some point in their school careers , those preparing to become psychologists must do some sort of research , especially in graduate school. A understanding of statistics will also allow one to better analyze research results. A third reason the knowledge of statistics is important for psychology is that it helps to develop ones analytic and critical thinking. If one does research , they must know how to analyze and interpret their data . </analyze.v.379><analyze.v.380>Says Peter G. : " When I find myself awake and ruminating over some problem at 2 a.m. , I grab a sheet of paper , analyze my troubling thoughts and come to the conclusion that everything is n't perfect in the universe but I can be happy.

This paper analyzes high school athletic participation in the United States and how sports offerings for boys and girls changed subsequent to the passage of this legislation. Girls ' sports participation rose dramatically both following the enactment of Title IX and subsequent to enhancements to its enforcement. Approximately half of all girls currently participate in sports during high school , however , there remains a substantial gap between girls and boys participation in many states. States ' average education level and social attitudes regarding Title IX and women ' s rights are correlated with this remaining gender gap. Examining individual high school students , sports participation is seen more frequently among those with a privileged background : white students with married , wealthy , educated parents are more likely to play sports. This finding points to an overlooked fact while Title IX benefited girls by increasing the opportunity to play sports , these benefits were disproportionately reaped by those at the top of the income distribution . </analyze.v.408><analyze.v.409>Right now , as an individual investor you can discover DISTRESSED , and UNDRERVALUED stocks today.

We examine aggregate data that captures the response of U.S. multinational firms to the formation of the ASEAN free trade agreement. Observed patterns guide the development of a model in which heterogeneous firms from a source country decide how to serve two foreign markets. Following a reduction in tariffs on trade between the two foreign countries , the model predicts growth in the number of source-country firms engaging in foreign direct investment , growth in the size of affiliates that are active in reforming countries both before and after the tariff reduction , and an increase in the extent to which the sales of affiliates in reforming countries are directed towards other reforming countries.

Since that time , a number of approaches or perspectives in psychology have developed. Even individuals with no training in psychology are familiar with Sigmund Freud 's psychodynamic perspective and the behavioral perspective represented by Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner. Today , the cognitive perspective focuses on how we organize and store information and how we solve problems and make decisions.

The structural psychology of sensation , e.g. , undertakes to determine the number and character of the various unanalyzable sensory materials , such as the varieties of color , tone , taste , etc. The functional psychology of sensation would on the other hand find its appropriate sphere of interest in the determination of the character of the various sense activities as differing in their modus operandi from one another and from other mental processes such as judging , conceiving , willing and the like . </analyze.v.442><analyze.v.443>So , we have no argument with communicating with " spiritual beings.

Automata theory plays a vital role in modeling behavior while Z notation is an ideal specification language for describing state space of a system. Consequently , integration of automata and Z notation will be a useful tool facilitating and increasing modeling power for complex systems. Further , nondeterministic finite automata ( NFA ) may have different implementations and therefore it is needed to verify the transformation from diagrams to code. If we describe formal specification of a given nondeterministic finite automata before implementing then confidence over transformation can be increased. In this paper , we have combined NFA and Z and a linkage is established between these approaches. At this level of integration , we have given a formal procedure to transform NFA to Z. A string accepter is designed and then extended to the language accepter. Finally , NFA accepting union of two regular languages is constructed by describing formal specification of their relationships. The specification is analyzed and validated using Z/EVES tool . </analyze.v.468><analyze.v.469>Developmental Psychology : This field of psychology attempts to analyze the behavioral patterns of individuals in different age groups.

By combining data on US outbound FPI and FDI , this paper analyzes whether the composition of US outbound capital flows reflect efforts to bypass home country tax regimes and weak host country investor protections. The cross-country analysis indicates that a 10 decrease in a foreign country 's corporate tax rate increases US investors ' equity FPI holdings by 21 , controlling for effects on FDI. This suggests that the residual tax on foreign multinational firm earnings biases capital flows to low corporate tax countries toward FPI. A one standard deviation increase in a foreign country 's investor protections is shown to be associated with a 24 increase in US investors ' equity FPI holdings. These results are robust to various controls , are not evident for debt capital flows , and are confirmed using an instrumental variables analysis. The use of FPI to bypass home country taxation of multinational firms is also apparent using only portfolio investment responses to within-country corporate tax rate changes in a panel from 1994 to 2005.

The population is separated into two groups , Thai and Burmese. Each population is divided into susceptible and infectious subclasses. The loss of immunity by individuals in the infectious class causes them to move back into the susceptible class. Standard dynamical method is used to analyze the behavior of the model. Two stable equilibrium states , a disease free state and an epidemic state are found to be possible in each population. A disease free equilibrium state in the Thai population occurs when there are no infected Burmese entering into the community. When there are infected Burmese enters into the Thai community , the epidemic state can occur. It is found that the disease free state is stable when the threshold number R0 is less than one. The epidemic state is stable when ( where these threshold numbers are for the individual populations ) are greater than one. The numerical simulations of our model illustrate what the results would be for our theoretical model . </analyze.v.497><analyze.v.498>In line with the Education Departments model of the professional educator as scholar/decision-maker , we have attempted to design a graduate course in Educational Psychology which takes the masters level student beyond familiarity with basic psychological theories and principles to a level in which they can apply and use these theories to inform and improve their classroom performance.

This is a common mistake made by the hobby ghost hunter who is not trained in audio recording , editing and analysis. This is where the equipment comes in and the knowledge of how to use it. We don ' t just simply use our ear. We use our equipment which tells us the frequency of all background noise , the frequency of each of the individual ' s voices who are at the location and therefore , the frequency of anything that technically shouldn ' t be there. In most instances of recording EVP , our ear is the last in the line of tools which are used.

It consists of philosophical , psychological , cultural , esthetic , social and political and historical writings. His psychological production consists of contributions to theoretical psychology , personality psychology , experimental psychology and social psychology. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the experimental psychology papers written by Kaila. Two papers are examined more closely : one discussing binocular depth vision ( 1919 ) and another one discussing the infant 's perception of the adult face ( 1932 ) . The former paper was commented on favorably by Kurt Koffka ( 1930 ) , the latter one by Charlotte B hler ( 1935 ) , and later on , by John Sants ( 1980 ) . One can see how Kaila gradually changed his approach from association theory to an integration of the developmental and Gestalt approaches . </analyze.v.503><analyze.v.504>Students learn about the realities of working as a psychologist , in order to prepare themselves for practice.

Oftentimes forensic psychology is confused with forensic science. The two may be very similar but there are also many differences. The main difference is that forensic psychologists deal with vast psychological perspectives and then apply them to the criminal justice system. Forensic psychologists also deal with legal issues such as new laws , public policies , competency and , when a crime occurred , if the defendant was insane at the time. All of these issues help to weave together law topics and psychology and are essential elements in the forensic psychology arena. The knowledge that comes with being a forensic psychologist takes on a variety of different forms such as consulting with attorneys about jury selection , treating mentally ill offenders , trying to analyze a criminal ' s mind and intent as well as practicing within the civil arena . </analyze.v.506><analyze.v.507>The fourth section of the paper will analyze the safety of the main components of Red Bull , the market leader in energy drinks , and it will consider the most significant research on these substances : first the section will examine caffeine; then the section will discuss taurine.

This may be crucial in the treatment. For instance , how your parents behaved toward one another may become the model of how you behave toward your lover. Fine if their marriage was a great success , but few of us , come from such model families. Identifying with parental marriage styles is one of the most common causes of conflict in gay couples. If your mother , for instance , was a nag toward your father , you may ( quite unconsciously ) take on the nagging role toward your lover. " You 're just like your mother , " is an accusation that illustrates identifying with parental marriage styles , and a sadomasochistic attack all at once. Its purpose is to hurt one 's lover -- which it will do -- especially if it 's true. But it 's effect is to put another nail into the relationship.

They identify failure to prevent predictable surprise as occurring on three levels : cognitive , organizational , and political. Cognitive failures are rooted in a variety of human biases. The authors also explore four types of organizational failure , including failure to scan the environment to identify threats and failure to integrate and analyze information from multiple sources. They then analyze several political factors that contribute to the likelihood of a predictable surprise , various forms of special interests that cause individuals or groups to act out of self-interest with little regard for the effects of their actions. Their analysis is compelling and seems complete. By examining the root causes of surprise , the authors are postured to draw conclusions and make recommendations designed to help leaders with future crises . </analyze.v.513><analyze.v.514>So , Casey , I suggest you take a different tone and fully understand what you are saying.

" Mr. Green 's thought , shared by his superior , Mr. Bacon , was that the SSS would gather information on activist and ideological groups , analyze the information to determine if tax questions or violations were present and refer the information to the field for whatever action the field deemed appropriate. 146 The organization was to have no authority to initiate investigations or audits , but was merely to gather and disseminate information. One of the main reasons for not giving the organization line authority was the concern that the members of the organization would develop a non-tax orientation as a result of the considerable contact it was anticipated it would have with the FBI , the Internal Security Division of the Justice Department , and other intelligence organizations concerned with subversives . </analyze.v.520><analyze.v.521>Cognitive and psycholinguistic psychologists are research-oriented psychologists with a focus of study comprising a number of characteristics. First , they study the behavior of knowing , as opposed to responding. They are concerned with finding scientific means for studying the mental processes involved in the acquisition and application of knowledge. Second , they emphasize the study of mental structure and organization. Finally , these psychologists view the individual as active , constructive and playful rather than a passive recipient of environmental stimulation. Study of this area arose from the areas of linguistics and computer simulation : An information-processing theory evolved that resulted in a framework whereby human thought ( cognition ) and human language ( linguistics ) can be studied , analyzed , and understood.

He has been a leader in psychotherapy , behavior genetics , the philosophy of science , and forensic psychology , authoring over 160 publications. One of his first major studies was published in Modern Learning Theory in 1954. In 1958 Meehl published What , Then , Is Man ? Active as a Lutheran layman , he co-authored this monograph exploring the relationship between behavioral science and Christian faith. Three of his works published in the 1990s reflected his current area of research. As Meehl himself noted , that work covers three areas; first , the development of testing of taxometric ( assigning objects to appropriate classes ) statistical procedures for the classification and genetic analysis of mental disorders and personality types , second , cliometric ( the use of mathematical and statistical methods , often using computers , in order to analyze historical data ) metatheory , and third , philosophical and mathematical contributions to the significance test controversy.

Whichever rule is used is inaccurate ( by definition indirect costs can not be clearly be associated with a particular cost center ) but the actual process of allocating overheads makes everyone aware of their importance and of the need to monitor and control them. Furthermore , provided the rules are not changed over time , managers will be able to analyze the trend profit figures for different departments , products or regions.

We separated the children into three groups based on Mean Length of Utterance in Words : 1.5-1.99; 2.0-2.99; 3.0-4.99. Our cross-sectional data demonstrated that Portuguese-speaking children increased their use of subjects from 28 in the lowest-MLUW group to 57 in the highest-MLUW group. The children in the highest-MLUW group almost perfectly matched the adult speakers in the study on every measure. The increase in the children 's use of subjects was primarily due to an increase in the use of pronominal subjects. A comparison between Portuguese- and English-speaking children suggests that adult competence about the status of subjects is present at the onset of combinatorial speech , as shown by differential production of subjects. Each group also experiences performance limitations , as shown by the increase in subject use as development proceeds . </analyze.v.529><analyze.v.530>The case study , for instance , is designed something like a funnel , in which " things are open at the beginning ( or top ) , and more directed and specific at the bottom " ( Bogdan &amp;Biklen , 1982 , p. 29 ) .

He decided that this was more interesting than the chemistry of saliva , and changed the focus of his research , carrying out a long series of experiments in which he manipulated the stimuli occurring before the presentation of food. He thereby established the basic laws for the establishment and extinction of what he called " conditional reflexes " , i.e. , reflex responses , like salivation , that only occurred conditionally upon specific previous experiences of the animal.

This paper analyzes the relationship between the domestic and foreign operations of American manufacturing firms between 1982 and 2004 by instrumenting for changes in foreign operations with GDP growth rates of the foreign countries in which they invest. Estimates produced using this instrument indicate that 10 greater foreign investment is associated with 2.6 greater domestic investment , and 10 greater foreign employee compensation is associated with 3.7 greater domestic employee compensation.

The Statement of Cash Flows examines the changes in cash resulting from business activities. Cash-flow analysis is necessary in order to make proper investing decisions , as well as to maintain operations. Cash flows , although related to net income , are not equivalent , This is because of the accrual concept of accounting. Generally , under accrual accounting , a transaction is recognized on the income statement when the earnings process has been completed or an expense has been incurred. This does not necessarily coincide with the time that cash is exchanged. For example , cash received from merchandise sales often lags behind the time when goods are delivered to customers. However , the sale is recorded on the income statement when the goods are shipped . </analyze.v.565><analyze.v.566>This is in contrast to quantitative research methods , where the purpose is to draw conclusions from a sample population that can be generalized to the population as a whole.

" is a question often discussed within the Quantitative Modeling ( QM ) community. The formulation of the question seems simple , but the concepts and theories that must be mobilized to give it an answer are far more sophisticated. Would there be a selection process from " many models designed " to " few models used " and , if so , which particular properties do the " happy few " have ? This site first analyzes the various definitions of " models " presented in the QM literature and proposes a synthesis of the functions a model can handle. Then , the concept of " implementation " is defined , and we progressively shift from a traditional " design then implementation " standpoint to a more general theory of a model design/implementation , seen as a cross-construction process between the model and the organization in which it is implemented. Consequently , the organization is considered not as a simple context , but as an active component in the design of models. This leads logically to six models of model implementation : the technocratic model , the political model , the managerial model , the self-learning model , the conquest model and the experimental model . </analyze.v.567><analyze.v.568>I found the process of board certification to be very interesting and rewarding.

Such knowledge is essential if socially responsible and ethical individuals are to protect themselves and their organizations against manipulation. Babiak and Hare analyze the interpersonal strategies that psychopathic individuals frequently use to gain access to positions of power and influence within corporations and other business organizations. Their impersonal , matter-of-fact , predatory social nature allows them to skillfully manipulate , mislead , and defraud others to achieve their own ends. Babiak and Hare are leading authorities on psychopathic personality disorder assessment. They have blended their extensive and complementary corporate and clinical perspectives on the disorder to produce a reference work of great insight and lasting value.

It presents strategies for accomplishing the major purposes of planning evaluation including the provision of an explicit , replicable basis for public assessment in alternative ways. Growing demand for public involvement and for accountability in decision making requires better means for accommodating a broad range of concerns in planning evaluation. Methodologies examined include effectiveness-cost and multicriteria analysis , and the book explores how these have been applied in practice in developing special-issue plans , complex regional development strategies , and efforts to analyze the environmental justice implications of major infrastructure projects.

The Gestalt movement arose in part as a reaction against such psychologists as Wundt and Titchner. Titchner argued that individuals perceive on the basis of the stimulus impinging on the sense organ but that they interpret them in accord with what they have learned. To avoid confusing interpretations with true sensations , Tichner wanted to train experts to observe their sensory experiences. This was not accepted by Gestaltites.

Although similar in some aspects , forensic psychology is different than forensic science. One major difference is that forensic psychologists look deep into the immense psychological perspectives associated with the crime and apply them to the case so that justice might be served. They frequently deal with legal issues such as news law , and public policies , and are asked to determine the mental state and competency of the defendant at the time of the crime , and throughout the legal proceedings. Each of these issues blends law topics and psychology together , and is essential to the field of Forensic Psychology. Forensic Psychologists also use their knowledge of psychology to analyze a criminal ' s mind and intent , treat mentally ill offenders , practice within the civil arena , and consult with attorneys . </analyze.v.617><analyze.v.618>In the case of 21st-century China , nationalism is perhaps the dynamic most difficult for Americans and others to gauge or comprehend. This is despite a veritable cottage industry that has sprung up in seeking to identify , describe , and analyze this force and determine whether it is benign or malignant. Some Sinologists argue that China possesses a confident , stable kind of nationalism that is not something to be feared , while others contend it is a more insecure , worrisome , and volatile nationalism. China 's New Nationalism , written by a member of the younger generation of China scholars , tends to fall into the latter category. Nevertheless , Peter Gries wisely argues for a more nuanced understanding of Chinese nationalism : the author contends that this nationalism is not simply a product of Chinese elite politics , nor merely of domestic political forces , nor can it be classified as either rational or irrational . </analyze.v.618><analyze.v.619>In order to give a numerical example of the analytical power of Quantile Regression and to compare it within the boundaries of a statistical application with OLS the following section will be analyzing some selected variables of the Boston Housing dataset which is available at the md-base website.

It has also delegitimized the authority of the police and LRTB ( Goldstone , 1993 ) . As with disputes in other spheres of conflict , relationships with the South African Police are a source of deeply entrenched conflict. While communities are starting to address the issue of rebuilding police community relations , this will take time. In taxi conflicts , there are a few things that could be done to encourage this relationship. If the LRTB would make permit allocation records public , a fact-finding capability would emerge. This would allow independent bodies to analyze allocation records to determine if certain taxi associations were given greater access to markets. In addition , there are allegations that police members own taxis and that their harassment campaign is designed to hold up competing taxis during peak hours of operation. This allegation of a conflict of interest would either be confirmed or proved unfounded if the permit process were made public . </analyze.v.620><analyze.v.621>As I review the integration literature , I find it relatively easy to discover which model different proponents of integration seem to be following.

First , schools should be enjoyable places that students want to attend rather than places they endure as part of their journey toward assimilation into the job market and the adult world. Second , schools should be places where students participate in and prepare for intelligent , creative , and effective living. This type of living includes learning how to analyze , criticize , and select from among alternative sources of information and courses of action; how to think effectively about unpredictable personal and interpersonal problems; how to live harmoniously with one another while remaining true to one 's own emerging system of attitudes , beliefs , and values; and how to confront , clarify , and act upon problems and situations in constructive and creative ways. Finally , authentic learning is important because our society and democratic way of life are dependent upon an unlimited reservoir of creative and effective people who know how to put knowledge to work in real-world situations . </analyze.v.623><analyze.v.624>The economic costs of CO2 abatement policies have only been partially analyzed at this time. Edmonds and Reilly , Kosobud et al , and Nordhaus , each using a different model , indicate that the reduction in aggregate GNP associated with even stringent punitive strategies is not large , usually only a few percentage points. Lovins et al argued that the costs might actually be negative. This assessment explores the subsequent development , deepening , and broadening of these research veins , focussing on the past five years of research on the costs of limiting CO2 emissions. While other gases are relevant ( 15 ) , 2 as invited by Annual Reviews we focus on fossil CO2because this forms the bulk of projected radiative change over the next century , because debates about the economic impact of limiting greenhouse gas emissions have focussed on fossil-fuel CO2 as potentially the most expensive , and because data concerning fossil CO2 sources are good and the relevant research base is rich and deep. We recognize the potential role of forests as a " sink " for CO2 emissions as a significant but currently separate issue which is beyond the scope of this paper . </analyze.v.624><analyze.v.625>HOW DO WE KNOW IF A DRUG WORKS ?

This made me think about every answer I gave and taught me to analyze everything I thought and to change my thought process to a more psychological way. He also asked me to analyze myself and to acknowledge my own issues so I can better work with other people. At first this was really hard for me but once I was able to identify my own personality in its entirety I became aware of how my own issues affected many of my interactions and now if I feel that I need to change something about myself I know how to start.

Needless to say , mind stands for mental and behavioral phenomena whereas brain stands for the nervous system. The mind-brain controversy refers , therefore , to arguments about how psychological and behavioral phenomena relate to the activity of the nervous system. As we analyze this controversy , we will be able to detect three epistemological obstacles to the progress of physiological psychology , namely : organicism , mentalism , and psychophysical complementarism . </analyze.v.629><analyze.v.630>Hawala was the primary means by which money was moved by the alien smugglers , and the hawala operators assisted them with laundering the criminal proceeds and the arrangements for payment of alien smuggling fees.

Suppose , for example , that we make a product aimed at older consumers , a growing segment. A competing firm that targets babies , a shrinking market , is likely to consider repositioning toward our market. To assess a competing firm ' s potential threat , we need to examine its assets ( e.g. , technology , patents , market knowledge , awareness of its brands ) against pressures it faces from the market. Finally , we need to assess conditions ( the marketing environment ) . For example , although we may have developed a product that offers great appeal for consumers , a recession may cut demand dramatically . </analyze.v.636><analyze.v.637>Consider a career as a school psychologist.

Fraud 's cyclical nature , coherent elements and direction imply that even partial detection , via professional skepticism as SAS No. 82 describes , can uncover all of its drives , intents , actions and objects. Moreover , an actual fraud event , as an effect with circumstantial causes , renders fraud predictable by projection ( the macro cause ) and by similarities among fraud cases ( the micro cause ) . The proposed comprehensive structure , encompassing intentional and unintentional irregularities , can help contain and prevent fraud even at its inception stage. To demonstrate how the comprehensive structure can help explain fraud 's intricate elements , we analyze seven prominent fraud cases into their cyclical components and their implications to independent auditors.

We use 'quality ' to mean the effect of a unit of FDI on economic growth. However , this is difficult to establish because it is a function of many different country and project characteristics which are often hard to measure. Hence , we differentiate " quality FDI " in several different ways. First , we look at the possibility that the effects of FDI differ by sector. Second , we differentiate FDI based on objective qualitative industry characteristics including the average skill intensity and reliance on external capital. Third , we use a new dataset on industry-level targeting to analyze quality FDI based on the subjective preferences expressed by the receiving countries themselves. Finally , we use a two-stage least squares methodology to control for measurement error and endogeneity. Exploiting a new comprehensive industry level data set of 29 countries between 1985 and 2000 , we find that the growth effects of FDI increase when we account for the quality of FDI . </analyze.v.719><analyze.v.720>This course equips students with the tools that they will need to analyze qualitative data that program.

Patricia M. Wallace uses established psychological research - where it applies - to lay the foundation for understanding Internet psychology. Wherever possible , she cites contemporary Internet psychology research in presenting her opinions and conclusions; the problem is that there is n't any. She finds very few compelling Internet research studies , and she 's the one who knows where to look. This book is just a little early out of the dock. The Internet is evolving so quickly that discussion of research conducted on Usenet groups already seems quaint. We [ ... ] recommend this book to people who want a general psychological review of the impact of the Internet. However , the same lightening-fast change that makes these questions so fascinating also makes it very difficult to pin down the answers . </analyze.v.736><analyze.v.737>Investors can access foreign diversification opportunities through either foreign portfolio investment ( FPI ) or foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . The worldwide tax regime employed by the U.S. potentially distorts this choice by penalizing FDI , relative to FPI , in low-tax countries. On the other hand , weak investor protections in foreign countries may increase the value of control , creating an incentive to use FDI rather than FPI. By combining data on U.S. outbound FPI and FDI , this paper analyzes whether the composition of U.S. outbound capital flows reflects these incentives to bypass home and host country institutional regimes. The results suggest that the residual tax on U.S. multinational firms ' foreign earnings skews the composition of outbound capital flows-a 10 decrease in a foreign country 's corporate tax rate increases U.S. investors ' equity FPI holdings by approximately 10 , controlling for effects on FDI. Investor protections also seem to shape portfolio choices , though these results are not robust when only within-country variation is employed . </analyze.v.737><analyze.v.738>When conducting qualitative tobacco control research , you are trying to produce significant findings about this topic. Once all the data is collected , it is often a challenge to make sense of all the information. Like other aspects of qualitative research , there are no firm rules for how data should be analyzed.

It then estimates the parameters of the model using U.S. data on five key macroeconomic time series. It finds that information stickiness is present in all markets , and is especially pronounced for consumers and workers.

Multi-site clinical trials pose special challenges for IRBs because a single IRB is unable to review and evaluate adverse event reports for these trials. Even if local IRBs were to receive all adverse event reports from all institutions with complete information in a timely fashion , and even if each IRB , through its membership or the use of consultants , had the expertise to analyze these events , it would be inefficient to have hundreds of local IRBs duplicatively perform this meticulous and time-consuming task ( Prentice and Gordon 1997 ) , when one complete and reliable analysis should be sufficient.

We must always begin with such an analysis where we want to understand an individual. To be sure , the work of the causal and of the purposive psychologist may move along parallel for a time.

Gaining research experience as an undergraduate student is important for several reasons. One , it provides an excellent opportunity to become a relative " expert " in a particular topic. Two , learning how to design and conduct a research project enhances critical thinking skills. Three , participating in research allows one to experience firsthand how scientists attempt to understand behavior and advance the knowledge in the field. Four , graduate schools in psychology often require or look favorably upon research experience when reviewing applicants for their programs. For these reasons , student research assistants in my laboratory learn the relevant literature on which their research project is based.

At the same time , hydrogen is expected to be a future clean energy. With this background , research and development of a hydrogen-fueled co-generation system is planned to be carried out. A closed Diesel engine system operated with stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen combustion in a working fluid of Ar gas or superheated water vapor is proposed as the power generation portion. A hydrogen injection system and combustion control method are the major key technologies. The object of this program is establishment of the necessary technology to analyze and evaluate the hydrogen co-generation system. We are planning to find out the optimum condition of the mixing and the spark-ignition with visualization of the mixing process during the hydrogen injection and with using laser-ignition technique. ] </analyze.v.793><analyze.v.794>Social worker.

Many studies focussed on the options for limiting anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse- related gases and managing the consequences of global warming and climate change. Making appropriate policy choices requires information on both the costs and benefits , as they occur over time , of policy interventions , and an increasing number of studies have sought to quantify the costs especially of limiting CO2 emissions , as the dominant anthropogenic source. Such analyses now form an important part of overall policy assessments and influence international negotiations on policy responses. However , these studies are not well understood. In this paper we seek to analyze the literature on the costs of CO2 abatement . </analyze.v.799><analyze.v.800>John Brown was a scourge to many , but to those who appreciated him as a hero , Brown was a man of goodness and many strengths. From a psychologist ' s point of view , Brown was a man with an extremely interesting personality , filled with many weaknesses but also great strengths , a conflicted individual and a delight to analyze. Freud would probably have jumped at the opportunity to analyze such an extraordinary personality using his theory of psychoanalysis. Freud believed that childhood events had a major impact on the person throughout life , because personality is formed at an early age , through object cathexis and the resolution of the Oedipus complex. John Brown ' s strengths therefore must be examined as the result of some childhood incidents . </analyze.v.800><analyze.v.801>The affective words on photographic images were analyzed and a model was structured. Based on this model , the effects of color on the affections were studied. In study 1 , the photographic images with various materials and techniques were presented and the affective responses are collected. The factor analysis using principal axing method showed that the variance of the affective words could be explained about 42 by the three factors. These are named positive-negative , dynamic-static , light-heavy , respectively. In study 2 , the effects of color on the affections were evaluated on three basic dimensions. Ninety representative color images were converged black-and-white images , and each of 180 images was rated on the three affective scales. The t-test showed that the effects of color are statistically significant on the three affective scales , respectively.

In study 1 , we did factor analysis of affective evaluations of the faces , and about 65 of the variances are explained by only two factors. Two factors were named 'sharp ' and 'soft ' , respectively. In study 2 , the correlation between facial beauty and affective evaluations was analyzed , and the correlation between facial beauty and sharp factor was significant. In study 3 , we made the new images by morphing and warping the faces : 'average ' , 'high-ranked ' , and 'exaggerated'. The participants evaluated the 'high-ranked ' face more beautiful than the 'average ' face , and the 'exaggerated ' face more beautiful than the 'high-ranked ' face. The rating of affective words on the faces showed that the 'average ' face was related to 'soft ' impression , the 'high-ranked ' image to 'sharp ' impression , and the 'exaggerated ' face might have double impression. These results might support the directional hypothesis for the facial beauty . </analyze.v.803><analyze.v.804>Multiple insurance retail branch managers report to the state sales manager.

Although encapsulated modules are stable , extended exposure of unencapsulated cells to damp heat ( 144 h , 264 h and 438 h ) at 858C and 85 humidity leads to a reduction of the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage. We further analyzed these changes by applying admittance spectroscopy , deep-level transient spectroscopy and current-voltage measurements. Damp heat stress reduces the net doping concentration of the absorber material and shifts a dominant defect state close to or at the buffer/absorber interface to higher activation energies. By comparing experimentally observed changes with the SCAPS device simulation program several possible causes for the observed changes in electrical properties are discussed : decrease of ZnO resistivity; decrease of the density of interface states; increase of shallow acceptor concentration and the introduction of deep acceptors in the Cu ( In , Ga ) ( S , Se ) 2 absorber . </analyze.v.812><analyze.v.813>StatDoctor tracks the most common statistics such as handicap , greens in regulation , fairways hits , and putts plus up to 25 other statistics.

The concept of the medical model has acquired a certain degree of currency and is now discussed in introductory texts and articles on abnormal psychology while at the same time the implications of the concept are almost totally neglected. In failing to recognize the implications of the concept , the issues of the controversy have been largely obscured in the derived meaning of the term " medical model. " Discreet aspects of this concept have been discussed in a global or uni-dimensional fashion , resulting in considerable confusion. Such confusion has been described as " the blind man and the elephant " phenomenon ( Brown and Long , 1968 ) . The purpose of this communication is to analyze various parameters of the medical or illness model and its implications through the study of ( a ) its historical development; ( b ) the logical fallacy inherent in the concept , ( c ) the institutional and structural developments that grew out of this concept; ( d ) the medical model and its implications in community psychiatry , and ( e ) conclusion . </analyze.v.816><analyze.v.817>They seem to stay a little longer if I point this fact out when I notice myself doing this , and we analyze their historical patterns for sticking with things.

They analyze the behavior of exchange rates , reserves , the monetary aggregates , interest rates , and commodity prices across 154 exchange rate arrangements to assess whether " official labels " provide an adequate representation of actual country practice. We find that , countries that say they allow their exchange rate to float mostly do not -- there seems to be an epidemic case of " fear of floating " . Since countries that are classified as having a free or a managed float mostly resemble noncredible pegs -- the so-called " demise of fixed exchange rates " is a myth -- the fear of floating is pervasive , even among some of the developed countries. They present an analytical framework that helps to understand why there is fear of floating . </analyze.v.829><analyze.v.830>Will They Tape Record The Sessions ? I Want Privacy.

For this reason , it is important to analyze the extent to which nanoparticles penetrate the human body , and the health consequences that can be expected. At present , there is a general consensus that the smaller the nanoparticles , the more pronounced their toxic effects. However , it is not only the size but also the shape and the chemical composition of nanomaterials that play an important role in inducing effects. It is known that nanoparticles can cause inflammation in the lungs , and one study reported the induction of lung fibrosis. There are some indications that nanoparticles penetrate the vascular walls , causing certain dysfunctions , or interact with the heart-circulatory system. A recent study showed in an animal model that needle-shaped asbestos-like nanotubes induce chronic inflammations. Only little data is available regarding the effects within the gastrointestinal tract , in the nervous system , and about transport of nanoparticles through the skin into the blood stream.

From there we analyze several ways in which the real world deviates from this model , including monopoly and other forms of imperfect competition , information problems , minimum wages and other price controls , taxes , and government regulation. Along the way we will explore public policy problems such as pricing the environment , winners and losers from international trade , health care costs and insurance , and the high price of textbooks.

The analysis shows how three kinds of educational activities were taking place : outsiders educating insiders , us educating each other , and us educating others. The analysis also shows how outsiders educating insiders did not occur in the relational and critical categories , suggesting that if relational and critical knowledge are sought , the researcher can not remain an outsider , but must become co-learner and co-researcher with group members . </analyze.v.1004><analyze.v.1005>[ Outline of Research : Animal robot has been developed as Mental Commit Robot in order to investigate human-robot interaction.

Now , after a person has been apprehended , a report of the person ' s criminal profile will have to be written by a criminal psychologist. This report forms a part of the overall investigative report , and can be used to explain why these specific methods were adopted to catch the criminal. Once the criminal is questioned and formally charged with crimes , the criminal psychology theory behind the capture is evaluated for any misconceived objectives and faulty approaches. Such an evaluation of the criminal psychology that was used during a crime will serve both the psychologist and the police to analyze and improve on their methods on a continuous basis.

Using information on individual loan contracts between banks and companies , I analyze the consequences of banking consolidation on banks ' credit policies. I find that ( i ) in-market mergers are beneficial to borrowers if these mergers involve the acquisition of banks with small market shares. In these cases , interest rates charged by the consolidated banks decrease , consistently with the view that horizontal mergers generate efficiency gains. However , as the local market share of the acquired bank increases , the efficiency effect is offset by market power; ( ii ) mergers have different distributional effects across borrowers of different sizes; ( iii ) small borrowers of target banks are less likely to borrow in the future from the consolidated bank than borrowers of similar banks not involved in mergers. The decision to deny credit to small borrowers does not seem to be based on the quality of the borrower , confirming potential adverse welfare effects of the banking consolidation on the availability of credit to small businesses . </analyze.v.1039><analyze.v.1040>Research guidance : aiming at cultivating student capacity to identify one 's own issues and to acquire solutions through quantitative analysis of the issues.

Game theory has become an important technique for studying competitive and cooperative phenomena in economics and the social sciences. Traditional economics emphasizes the two extremes of economic decision-making : perfect competition , in which no firm can affect market prices , and pure monopoly , in which one firm has complete price-setting power. Game theory is a technique which allows intermediate situations to be analyzed : for example those that arise during wage negotiations or in price wars between two large firms. The same principles that govern the strategic interaction of players in parlor games like Chess or Poker turn out to be widely applicable to a whole range of such phenomena in economics , biology , and political science. The current course will explore the beginnings of the subject using simple illustrative examples. Some calculus and matrix algebra will be needed , but the mathematical requirement is more for some sophistication in methods of argumentation rather than for specific techniques.

Engendering real peace means taking on this difficult problem. In some disputes , intervenors have worked with banks to rescheduled loans. While this is a very innovative solution , it still does not address the fundamental issue of economic viability in the taxi service industry. Without tackling this , taxi operators will continue to overload their minibuses , engage in unsafe driving practices , fight over more profitable routes and attempt to enter markets that can not support the current supply of taxis. Both the August 1993 Taxi Indaba in Johannesburg and the 1993 Goldstone report on taxi violence underscored the need to train taxi operators in basic business management. Goldstone found that few taxi operators had the business knowledge necessary to analyze potential markets. There is little understanding of how healthy competition can sustain a market and keep it profitable. When competition is encountered , the response is usually to eliminate it. Business education of taxi operators would help promote realistic expectations of business opportunity in this tight market . </analyze.v.1057><analyze.v.1058>First , judges need to become more scientifically literate , so they can critically analyze expert witness testimony and spot junk science.
