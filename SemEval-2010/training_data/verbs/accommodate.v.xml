The warehouse eventually terminated their jobs because they had not fully recovered and therefore could not resume their loading duties.

At the same time , Ernest ( 1995 ) notes that , of seven paradigms of constructivism , the positions are all variants of radical constructivism. The outstanding consideration , however , concerns the need as Ernst sees it : " to accommodate the complementarity between individual construction and social interaction " ( p.483 ) . Whether knowledge is seen as socially situated or whether it is considered to be an individual construction has implications for the ways in which learning is conceptualized. From the radical constructivist perspective , how can their theory encompass both the collective activity and the individual experience to take into account the important classroom social interactions that are so much a part of the entire educational process ? Such questions underlie the complexities involved in translating the diversity of perspectives into a common set of principles that can be operationalized. Yet , as Ernest claims in relation to the varying constructivist perspectives : " there is the risk of wasting time by worrying over the minutiae of differences " ( p.459 ) . Perhaps then , the optimal starting point for understanding the constructivist perspective to teaching and learning is to consider what constructivism is not . </accommodate.v.14><accommodate.v.15>Space - Assuming that the hotel can room 600 students , the issue of space relates to meeting space.

If all Senators took full advantage of their rights under the rules whenever it might be in their immediate interests , the Senate would have great difficulty reaching timely decisions. Therefore , the Senate has developed a variety of practices by which it sets aside some of its rules to expedite the conduct of its business or to accommodate the needs and interests of its members. Some of these practices have become well-established by precedent; others are arranged to suit the particular circumstances the Senate confronts from day to day and from issue to issue. In most cases , these alternative arrangements require the unanimous consent of the Senate the explicit or implicit concurrence of each of the one hundred Senators. The Senate relies on unanimous consent agreements every day for many purposes purposes great and small , important and routine. However , Senators can protect their rights under Senate rules simply by objecting to a unanimous consent request to waive one or more of the rules . </accommodate.v.20><accommodate.v.21>This meeting room ' s windows look toward the central commons area embraced by Lloyd Hall and the Sally Borden Building , and can accommodate groups up to 30.

This is because the Court has held that , in the absence of legislation to the contrary , the duty to accommodate applies only in cases of adverse effect discrimination. By contrast , to defend against a claim of direct discrimination , an employer need only prove the existence of a bona fide occupational requirement , without accommodation , to allow the rule or practice to stand. Readers should be cautioned that distinguishing between direct and adverse effect discrimination is not always a simple matter. However , for provincially-regulated employers in Ontario , the distinction between the two forms of discrimination is of less importance because certain provisions of the Human Rights Code , such as s. 17 which applies to disability , make the duty to accommodate applicable to both direct and adverse effect discrimination . </accommodate.v.23><accommodate.v.24>Above is a picture of the Smoking dining room.

Repair businesses and dealers would be exempted from the prohibition to facilitate their modification of motor vehicles so that persons with disabilities can drive or ride in them. The exemption would permit modifications that have an unavoidable adverse effect on safety equipment or features installed pursuant to some , but not all requirements of the Federal safety standards. The requirements tentatively selected for inclusion in the exemption were chosen after carefully balancing their safety significance against the types of modifications needed for persons with disabilities. By specifying which modifications may be made , the proposal rule would provide universal , comprehensive guidance to all modifiers and would thereby enhance the safety of vehicles modified to accommodate people with disabilities . </accommodate.v.37><accommodate.v.38>This internship is unpaid.

Accommodation of conscience and religion is a Charter Right within Section 2 ( a ) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. According to Iain Benson , legal academic and constitutional lawyer , this sets out a positive duty for all law ( and Codes of Conduct for professional bodies as well ) to recognize the place for individual conscience and religion and to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship these beliefs. The test , according to Benson , is not , that the officiating body agree with the position of the person opposed on conscientious or religious grounds. In fact , religious beliefs or conscientious beliefs are to be respected without a weighing of whether the body agrees with them or not.

However , the purpose of the duty to accommodate is not to completely alter the essence of the contract of employment , that is , the employee 's duty to perform work in exchange for remuneration. The burden imposed by the Court of Appeal in this case was misstated . The test is not whether it was impossible for the employer to accommodate the employee 's characteristics.

Many in Pakistan believe and quite rightly so that the Americans had decided to get India on their side and they are doing everything to accommodate India in one form or the other.

The interpretation has mainly been credited to the Scottish theologian , Thomas Chalmers , who began to preach it back in the early 19th century. However there is documented evidence that there were theologians who also held this view long before Chalmers ' days. Contrary to Young Earth Creationist allegations , Chalmers did not invent the Gap Theory as a compromise of the Word of God to accommodate science. That gap has always been in the Scriptures since the day Moses penned the book of Genesis. However , only in post New Testament times , and only after man 's knowledge about Earth 's natural history increased greatly , has the Spirit opened people 's eyes to its existence.

Weight capacity and dimensions of your TV stand are also very important. The material of the stand should also be of good quality.

This system is a " water shedding " roof panel and generally requires a minimum of 3 : 12 slope to function properly , therefore requiring a waterproof membrane under the metal panels. Another shortcoming of this roof system was its nonstructural shape which requires a solid substrate for support. Again , DMW Design , Inc. had the vision to see a need and set about filling it. There was a need to curve a " waterproof " panel. There was a need for a structural standing seam panel that could install over open framing.

Characteristics of ADHD include hyperactivity , fidgetiness , and/or squirming , which can make it difficult to stay on task , remain still , and focus on schoolwork. That can be a major challenge for some children with ADHD , who need to move more , and perhaps even learn more , while moving. Think about how difficult it would be if you were told to keep moving for 8 straight hours and not allowed to stop until you were completely exhausted ! Similarly , ask a child with ADHD to sit for a few hours at a time : you 'll see how difficult that can be for someone who inherently wants to move. You may as well have asked the child to stop blinking. There are inborn needs that require many children with ADHD to be constantly on the move , and while it 's not possible to accommodate every child who has to move often , it would be good for teachers to understand how to build in more physical activity throughout the day to accommodate the need to be kinetic rather than sedentary . </accommodate.v.161><accommodate.v.162>RRST - 1 rooms in the hotel -578 sq.

Garvey , 109 F.R.D. 323 , 332 ( N.D.Cal. 1985 ) , set out a multifactor test for determining whether inadvertent disclosure is a waiver.

The rule does not explicitly codify that test , because it is really a set of non-determinative guidelines that vary from case to case. The rule is flexible enough to accommodate any of those listed factors. Other considerations bearing on the reasonableness of a producing party ' s efforts include the number of documents to be reviewed and the time constraints for production. Depending on the circumstances , a party that uses advanced analytical software applications and linguistic tools in screening for privilege and work product may be found to have taken reasonable steps to prevent inadvertent disclosure.

This made it very difficult for him to take blood samples from patients at the clinic , which was a central part of his work. To address the situation , the employer first gave him part-time work , and eventually moved him to another job that did not require him to take blood samples but that paid $ 5.00 less an hour than before. The adjudicator found that this did not meet the duty to accommodate and that " moving an employee to a lower paid job is not accommodation. " The adjudicator also took into account evidence that suggested that , in the case of other employees , the employer had found accommodation that did not entail a reduction of salary. For example , one lab technician was assigned to do " media preparation full-time " to accommodate his inability to do other lab work . </accommodate.v.250><accommodate.v.251>In the case at bar the Board of Inquiry found as a fact that concerns of cost , disruption of a collective agreement , employee morale and interchangeability of work force did not pose serious obstacles to accommodating the complainant 's religious needs by permitting him to be absent on Monday , April 4 , 1983. Indeed , it would be very difficult to conclude otherwise in light of the existence of a contingency plan for dealing with sporadic Monday absences. If the employer could cope with an employee 's being sick or away on vacation on Mondays , it could surely accommodate a similarly isolated absence of an employee due to religious obligation. I emphasize once again that there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Monday absences of the complainant would have become routine or that the general attendance record of the complainant was a subject of concern. The ability of the respondent to accommodate the complainant on this occasion was , on the evidence , obvious and , to my mind , incontrovertible. I therefore find that the respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proving that it accommodated the complainant up to the point of undue hardship . </accommodate.v.251><accommodate.v.252>7 Your client should lie on a massage table or therapy couch with a pillow supporting the head for comfort.

A hybrid or Blended Fee arrangement is one that attempts to reconcile a client ' s capacity to pay legal fees , with the firm ' s ability to accommodate the client ' s limited financial resources. Under a blended fee arrangement , a client may be asked to pay a reduced retainer in exchange for agreeing to a contingent fee in the event the law firm recovers on behalf of the client. For example , instead of requiring a client to remit a retainer of $ 7 , 500 for a given matter , the firm may request a retainer of $ 4 , 000 plus one third of the amount recovered on behalf of the client , with a credit to the client in the amount of $ 4 , 000 or the total amount previously advanced by the client.

Perhaps some are so apprehensive of another Galileo incident that they bend over backwards to accommodate evolution theory to religion. Thus the compromise of " theistic evolution " is embraced , whereby God somehow used or permitted evolutionary descent to be the mechanism of creation. Speculation along this line of thought is permissible to a believing Catholic , as detailed in the encyclical Humani Generis issued by His Holiness Pope Pius XII. The encyclical explains that in light of the current ( 1950 ) state of opinions on evolution by scientists and theologians , it is permissible to discuss and explore the possibility of " the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God.

In our desire to accommodate the need for families to be at their loved one ' s bedside have we acted in our patient ' s best interests ? In order to heal , patients need rest. That need is even greater for brain injured patients. Sleep disruption and deprivation are particularly prevalent in the critical care environment. Several studies over the past twenty years have demonstrated that critically ill patients have frequent awakenings and arousals and little to no REM sleep. At a time when critical patients need the most rest , the ICU environment deprives them of it. It is a common perception that the loss of sleep increases an individual ' s risk for infection and disease. Optimizing patient comfort and ensuring that patients get the rest they need is a difficult task in the ICU.

However , at the last moment , someone asks the first person to come away for the weekend , making it impossible to give provide the ride for the second person. Imagine that there would be a slightly greater balance of gain overall if the promise were broken. Ross ' s point is that consequentialism says one should break the promise even if the overall gain is only slightly greater. But this seems to imply that consequentialism can not accommodate the point that one is obligated by the promise , and a slight gain in overall pleasure does not seem to trump this obligation . </accommodate.v.317><accommodate.v.318>Our Harbor View Deluxe Rooms are elegantly furnished and feature a spectacular view of Victoria 's Inner Harbor.

He assumed both observations to be correct , and formulated his theory , based on these assumptions , by simply altering the Galilean transformation to accommodate the lack of addition of velocities with regard to the speed of light.

The first is that the system has a significant degree of flexibility and resilience under existing operating rules , allowing managers to handle additional burdens on the system , be they from present conditions , or from new and unforseen circumstances. A second assumption however is that this resilience is finite and that at some point it will not be possible to accommodate additional stress on the system under present operating rules. In other words , it is possible to conceive of future changes ( be they from additional population and water demand , or from altered climate scenarios and altered water supplies ) that will be beyond the ability of the managers to cope , while still complying with all of the operating requirements presently in place. This leads to the final assumption that if and when such conditions arise , the rules ( i.e. , the institution that governs the Rio Grande System ) will have to change at levels above the operational level in order to accommodate the new demands on the Rio Grande . </accommodate.v.337><accommodate.v.338>Our clients can choose to receive their Lakepoint report either monthly or quarterly.

The role of the instructor is not to drill knowledge into students through consistent repetition , or to goad them into learning through carefully employed rewards and punishments. Rather , the role of the teacher is to facilitate discovery by providing the necessary resources and by guiding learners as they attempt to assimilate new knowledge to old and to modify the old to accommodate the new.

Canadian National Railway Co. is correct in so far as it states that accommodation is not a component of the BFOQ test and that once a BFOQ is proven the employer has no duty to accommodate. It is incorrect , however , in so far as it applied that principle to a case of adverse effect discrimination. The end result is that where a rule discriminates directly it can only be justified by a statutory equivalent of a BFOQ , i.e. , a defence that considers the rule in its totality. ( All human rights codes in Canada contain some form of BFOQ provision. ) However , where a rule has an adverse discriminatory effect , the appropriate response is to uphold the rule in its general application and consider whether the employer could have accommodated the employee adversely affected without undue hardship . </accommodate.v.363><accommodate.v.364>CrossKeys is bringing its " Dyband " edge management solution to market after four years of development efforts aimed at providing a software system that would work with cable as well as DSL , Getz says.

The University refused to provide him with the level of interpretive services necessary to complete his teaching certificate. The Council of Human Rights found that a university education was a service customarily available to the public and that sign language interpreters are an accommodation required by deaf students to enable them to use the University 's educational services. Finally , the Council concluded that the University failed to accommodate the complainant to the point of undue hardship. The Council agreed that absorbing the cost of the interpreter would have some impact on the University 's budget , but that there was no evidence that providing an interpreter for the complainant would cause more than a minor interference with the operations of the University . </accommodate.v.368><accommodate.v.369>On-site is our Caf 10-2-1 , serving breakfast , lunch and dinner in a casual atmosphere.

In the early 1980 's , when the federal deficit was this size , the household savings rate was 9 percent.

While a sidewalk may be wide enough to accommodate pedestrian movement , it may not be wide enough to simultaneously accommodate seating , trees , bus shelters and other appropriate amenities. Once the desired width of the walking space is determined , it is necessary to consider what kinds of amenities are needed , where they are needed , and how much space they require.

The end result is that where a rule discriminates directly it can only be justified by a statutory equivalent of a BFOQ , i.e. , a defence that considers the rule in its totality.

In some cases , the Chief Counsel of NHTSA has issued letters stating that the agency will not institute enforcement proceedings against the motor vehicle dealer or repair business for modifying a particular vehicle to accommodate a person 's disability. Such letters also caution that only necessary modifications may be made and that the person making the modifications should consider the safety consequences of the modifications. While this approach eliminates the risk of civil penalties , it still leaves vehicle dealers and repair businesses in technical violation of the make inoperative prohibition.

We would ask that you consider opening the policy to include at least one additional pick up and drop off point for parents to aid in balancing the needs of work and family and to better accommodate custody arrangements. In today 's economy , more than ever , it is essential that both parents be available to add income to the family.

The consequent lack of competition has contributed to high prices. Most of todays spare productive capacity is located in Saudi Arabia. And Saudi Arabias high , and growing , level of production and the lack of significant spare unutilized capacity outside the kingdom have spotlighted that countrys critical role in determining the state of current and future oil markets , in turn creating unique political pressures. Iran and Iraq accuse Saudi Arabia of seeking higher production rates to accommodate the economic interests of the United States , Japan , and Europe at the expense of the needs of local populations , creating internal pressures in the Arabian Gulf region against a moderate price stance. Bitter perceptions in the Arab world that the United States has not been evenhanded in brokering peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have exacerbated these pressures on Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) countries and given political leverage to Iraqs Saddam Hussein to lobby for support among the Arab worlds populations . </accommodate.v.503><accommodate.v.504>These two standards assume that the vehicle uses the type of steering system typically installed in a vehicle : the steering column longitudinal axis points toward the driver and a steering wheel , mounted at the end of the column , is used by the driver to steer the vehicle.

To accommodate certain disabilities , some modifications are made to the method by which the vehicle is started and the transmission gear is selected. A common modification is the attachment of an extension lever to the column-mounted gear selection lever in a passenger car to permit left-handed gear selection. NHTSA is unaware of any modification which would need to change the transmission gear selection sequence , disable the starter interlock , or disable the lower forward drive gear ratios so there is no longer a low gear.

This will require significant changes to existing policies within the Force which , currently , only provide that a member with a disability be considered for positions for which that member is fully qualified. There is nothing in existing Force policy that provides for alternate measures such as investing in training and professional development to prepare a member for an existing position , or alternately to create a new position for which the member would be q qualified.

An accommodation that would jeopardize the safety of employees will often constitute undue hardship. But if only the safety of the employee in question is concerned , then the employer might have to assess the willingness of that employee to assume the risk to their own safety. In the Bhinder case ( Bhinder v. Canadian National Railway Co. [ 1985 ] 2 SCR 561 ) , the Supreme Court pointed out that " since no greater danger would be caused to others because of his non-compliance , any decision to accept greater risk should be left to Bhinder himself. " This type of rationale is evident in the Ontario Human Rights Commission 's Policy and Guidelines on Disability and the Duty to Accommodate , which provide that " Where possible , persons with disabilities should be allowed to assume risk with dignity , subject to the undue hardship standard. " Thus , an employee who is willing to accept a certain measure of risk , in order to continue working , could be accommodated , particularly if there is no risk to the health or safety of others . </accommodate.v.562><accommodate.v.563>The Gibson Energy Ltd.

Instead , an alternative approach which involves the incorporation of the duty to accommodate into the b.f.o.q. defence will be examined. There are two approaches to the b.f.o.q. defence which have been recognized in Canadian law thus far. The first approach requires an employer to make an individualized assessment of an employee in order to justify a b.f.o.q. The second approach allows an employer to justify a class-based b.f.o.q. where the class is defined by reference to one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination , in situations in which it is impractical or impossible to assess employees individually. Although existing law is somewhat ambiguous on the point , there is support for the proposition that an individualized b.f.o.q. is generally to be preferred and that a class-based b.f.o.q. will be recognized only in cases where public safety and the " risk of unpredictable human failure " are involved.

Standard No. 210 is a vehicle standard that establishes strength and location requirements for seat belt assembly anchorages.

The standard also ensures that the restraint anchorages are strong enough to withstand the force of a crash. Compliance with the criteria is fairly simple to measure. Traditionally , NHTSA has said that a vehicle may comply with Standard No. 210 as manufactured or as modified. The agency does not believe , therefore , that exemption from make inoperative with respect to Standard No. 210 is necessary. If belt anchorages are moved , or otherwise modified , to accommodate a person with a disability , NHTSA believes measurements , calculations , or engineering judgement can be used to ensure that Standard No. 210 is met in the new position . </accommodate.v.655><accommodate.v.656>The Yuha Kids Suite offers a bedroom with one king bed and a separate room with a full size sofa sleeper bunk bed.

To reduce the frequency and severity of neck injuries in rear-end and other collisions , Standard No. 202 requires each front outboard seating position in all vehicles to be equipped with a head restraint that meets specific size and performance requirements. Vehicles may be modified to accommodate a wheelchair seated driver or right front seat passenger. Such a modification requires the removal of the OEM seat and , as a consequence , the head restraint. NHTSA is aware that some wheelchairs are equipped with head rests or positioning devices and that some vehicles modified to be driven by wheelchair seated drivers are equipped with swing-away head rests. Although the agency does not know for certain , it doubts that the head rests installed on some wheelchairs or the swing away head rests attached to vehicles comply with Standard No. 202.

With respect to the framing of an innocent man in order to prevent a riot , a rule Utilitarian will reason that a society in which people adhere to the rule " don ' t punish the innocent " is bound to be better that a society in which this rule is not followed. The rule " don ' t punish the innocent " produces greater overall good. Punishing the innocent man is wrong because it does not accord with the rule which would bring about the best consequences overall. Secondly , the rule consequentialist may accommodate intuitions about special obligations by arguing that the consequences of following these sorts of rules will tend to be better than those generated by not adhering to agent relative duties. It seems reasonable to think that rule consequentialism will generate moral prescriptions quite closely in accordance with those of common sense . </accommodate.v.697><accommodate.v.698>In order to understand the Gap Theory , we must clearly understand what it proposes.

The purpose of the supposed Gap Theory is to accommodate the supposed millions of years required for evolution to supposedly occur , and it was proposed by Christians who were not scientists who believed science had proven the universe was millions or billions of years old.

Professor W. Pentney , in Tarnopolsky and Pentney , Discrimination and the Law , Fifth Cumulative Supplement ( September 1989 ) , agrees with the logic of this approach. After reviewing the implications of this Court 's reasons in O'Malley and Bhinder he points out at p. 28 that different considerations are relevant to the BFOQ and duty to accommodate concepts. For example , the economic considerations that are factored into the determination of whether accommodation imposes undue hardship will rarely be germane to a BFOQ defence. Similarly , the good faith of the employer is a central concern where the rule singles out a particular group for adverse treatment. There is less reason to be suspicious of the employer 's motives in the case of a rule which is neutral on its face and generally applicable to all employees. Professor Pentney concludes that direct and adverse effect discrimination ought to be distinguished for purposes of determining the appropriate response to a prima facie case of discrimination . </accommodate.v.753><accommodate.v.754>The court has adopted three new Standing Orders to implement Interim Federal and Local Rules.

A significant re-write in 1866 by H C A Harrison 's committee to accommodate rules from the Geelong Football Club made the game , which had become known as " Victorian Rules " , increasingly distinct from other codes. It used cricket fields , a rugby ball , specialised goal and behind posts , bouncing with the ball while running and later spectacular high marking.

He argued that the EMS was sufficiently flexible to accommodate differing policy goals noting that France had chosen to stay within EMS in 1982 in order to take advantage of the Bundesbank 's credibility. The ideal would be for the EMS to function as a permanent supranational institution , actively working to maintain agreed rates of exchange during the periods between regular meetings of its member states.

( citing the judgment of McIntyre J. in Bhinder ) ruled that the employer had no duty to accommodate once the BFOQ defence was established. He also held that in any event the employer had reasonably accommodated the religious beliefs of the employee. Mr. Christie , on the other hand , had failed to take reasonable steps toward accommodating the employer 's needs in that he " did not make diligent and complete inquiries of his church representatives to determine whether satisfactory solutions could be found " . In coming to this conclusion , MacNaughton J. relied on evidence from a witness ( who was also a member of the same Church as Mr. Christie ) that " if the requirement to work on holy days is an ongoing situation , a person has the responsibility to seek , over time , other employment which will allow observance of holy days " . The witness was of the view that Mr. Christie 's present occupation would present an ongoing conflict with his religious obligations . </accommodate.v.785><accommodate.v.786>Cost of inculcating counter-intuitive rules proves very important to Mulgan 's discussion of public policy regarding intergenerational justice as well. Mulgan considers a set of intuitively plausible reproductive public policies , including rules requiring consideration of future generations ' interests; leaving future generations no worse off than yourself and , if possible , better off; and not depleting resources they will need. He also tries to accommodate intuitively plausible personal and group liberty constraints on those obligations , so long as this is not too burdensome for future generations. Maximization of the size or happiness of future generations is not required. This set of intuitions regarding reproductive public policy and intergenerational justice is accommodated by rule consequentialism largely because the costs of inculcating counter-intuitive rules is deemed too high to make doing so worthwhile. Perhaps that is true but , as argued , it is not easy to persuade the reader of this without considerable evidence. It is also not especially surprising to find that a theory that rejects counter-intuitive rules can accommodate most of our current intuitions . </accommodate.v.786><accommodate.v.787>Congress Plaza Hotel , a historic Chicago hotel on Michigan Avenue , was originally designed and built to accommodate visitors to the World 's Columbian Exposition in 1893.

The boys might therefore dismiss as frivolous the constant paradoxical bantering ( boutades ) of their classmates , while their classmates , for whom the human mind is not just a data processor but a way of looking critically at so-called data , might find the boys dull if not stupid and their down-to-earth conversations as prosaic , although expressed in grammatically perfect and pragmatically appropriate French.

He states at p. 589 : </accommodate.v.802><accommodate.v.803>The minority of the Court reasons that the duty to accommodate must be read into the defence of bona fide occupational requirement whether the bona fide occupational requirement discriminates directly or through adverse effect. To use the bona fide occupational requirement defence successfully , an employer must show that there was no reasonable alternative to the impugned rule which would not cause undue hardship to the employer. If an employer fails to provide an explanation as to why individual accommodation can not be accomplished without undue hardship , this will ordinarily result in a finding that the duty to accommodate has not been discharged , and therefore that the bona fide occupational requirement has not been established . </accommodate.v.803><accommodate.v.804>The hotel was beautiful , the room was comfortable and the friendliness and willingness of the staff to accommodate us in every way was perfect.

Goldman adds to this the further condition that the relevant causal connections obtaining between the state of affairs p and one 's belief must be 'correctly reconstructed by inferences , each of which is warranted'. This further condition is designed to accommodate the fact that causal chains can sometimes take very unexpected routes. If the route is unusual enough , then even though it results in a true belief that p , it does not provide knowledge. For example , suppose that Sally is perceiving an object only through a complex network of mirrors , or via some holographic imaging device which produces a very realistic image of the object.

This transfer is seen as problematic since pedagogy imported from abroad conflicts with the social , cultural , and physical conditions of the recipient countries ( Holliday 1994 , Pennycook 1989 ) . However , abandoning CLT in the English classroom in countries such as Vietnam or China seems not to be a viable measure , given that the ultimate goal of English teaching in these countries is to help learners acquire a good working command of English. The solution , therefore , appears to be a modified version of CLT , made appropriate to the local condition. For this , a deep understanding of CLT theory and its implications for classroom practice is important ( Thompson 1996 , Sato and Kleinsasser 1999 ) . This article defines the theoretical essentials of CLT and characterizes the issues that commonly arise when CLT theory is put into practice , aiming to offer suggestions to help EFL teachers in non-Western EFL settings develop appropriate CLT practices for their classrooms. Finally , the article identifies the need to redefine CLT to accommodate the theory to differing local conditions . </accommodate.v.876><accommodate.v.877>Oppikoppie sounds like a built-to-order group getaway.

We have chosen these three examples to illustrate , first , an instance in which successful changes were gradually made over time to accommodate changing economic and political circumstances , second , an instance in which the outcome of even greater efforts at changing institutions in the face of political demands was a resounding failure , and , finally , an instance in which , despite the apparent economic desirability of a change , none has even been attempted. The success story is the marked change that has taken place in the sharing of the personal income tax between the federal and the provincial governments. The failure is the unsuccessful attempt to amend the Constitution Act of 1982 to satisfy the demands of Qu bec , the majority francophone province in Canada. Finally , the story that has not happened is the creation of a national securities commission to replace the existing provincial commissions . </accommodate.v.917><accommodate.v.918>Please make reservations early !

It outlines a way to incorporate both postmodernism and liberal democracy into a leftist , quasi-marxist politics. One of the principal goals of this politics is to accommodate the new social movements that marxism had previously excluded. But even at this early stage the potential problems inherent in their enterprise are evident. Laclau and Mouffe reject several of the central tenets of marxism while nonetheless claiming a marxist inspiration. The privileged standpoint of the proletariat , determination by material conditions , and the centrality of class conflict are all jettisoned. They further incorporate a concept that has been the object of marxist critique since its inception : the liberal notion of individual rights. Finally , they embrace a position , postmodernism , that denies the legitimacy of both the marxist and liberal projects. Laclau and Mouffe are aware of these tensions from the outset and seek to resolve them in subsequent work. But whether such a resolution is even possible is surely in question . </accommodate.v.955><accommodate.v.956>This Best Western hotel in Ketchum , Idaho offers cozy accommodations and deluxe amenities for travelers coming to the Sun Valley area.

If such a new system may be useful to other customers with some modifications , we discuss that intent with the customer who is paying for the development. If the customer is willing to let us adapt the new system for other uses later on , we will design the new system with the necessary flexibilty to enable that. Some systems that are now part of the ICommander packages started out that way. Any such system will always work the best for the customer that drove its development but the building block approach used in ICommander System Development enables structuring even a custom system to be adaptable. That adaptability often proves valuable to the customer who paid for the initial development as their own needs change over time. Instead of additional costs for new flexibilty , we can often just vary some options to accommodate the customer 's new needs . </accommodate.v.1060><accommodate.v.1061>930 m modular room ( 37.5 x 39.5 m ) with a 2.5 m ceiling.

The committee considered and granted requests from three agencies for extensions of time to adopt administrative rules. An extension of time was approved for the Secretary of State to adopt rules to govern methods for signing , subscribing , or verifying documents filed by electronic means. Because of the scope and importance of these rules , additional time was required to allow involvement of affected state agencies and the public. An extension was approved to accommodate a change of personnel in the board office for the Board of Animal Health to adopt rules relative to primates , wolves , and wolf hybrids under 1997 legislation.

But now the Shroud , based on the decay of vanillin in the linen , is at a minimum 1 , 300 years old , well beyond the time when a glass plate could have been manufactured to accommodate Wilson 's theory . </accommodate.v.1117><accommodate.v.1118>I read this as a clear attempt to accommodate multiple theories and conceptual models for designing sound instruction.

In light of the legislative history indicating that one of the intended purposes of the exemption was to accommodate persons with disabilities , NHTSA interprets this limitation as requiring that an exemption not lead to any unnecessary reduction in safety. A stricter reading of the limitation would defeat the goal of allowing those modifications necessary to facilitate the mobility needs of those persons. Although some modifications to a vehicle may result in a decrease in safety to the vehicle 's occupants , without such modifications , persons with disabilities often can not use their vehicles . </accommodate.v.1119><accommodate.v.1120>When visiting one of the Minnesota cities in Roost I was presented with a Nag screen that said I must agree with the MLS Terms of Service.

The intention was to enable gamers to recreate very large battles without getting bogged down in extraneous details more appropriate for regimental-size skirmishes -- indeed , the normal command per player in most games is a corps or two : two to six infantry divisions. Extensive morale and fire modifiers , multiple movement and fire opportunities , and national or troop type nuances have therefore been kept to a minimum in the interest of finishing a reasonably faithful approximation of a large historical battle in an afternoon. A half-scale variant of the basic rules enabled smaller engagements to be fought simply by doubling the number of stands per unit in 1870 and 1859 , while even smaller engagements are possible in 1864 using a quarter-scale version . </accommodate.v.1150><accommodate.v.1151>An exceptional ground-floor space to accommodate the most demanding production requirements.

This tends to reinforce group cohesion and solidarity. The style of speaking will identify me as being in or outside the group. The converse of this will also operate , i.e. if the group wishes to actively keep others at a distance and restrict access , the language and speech developed may be so esoteric that it is difficult , if not impossible , for outsiders to accommodate the style of speaking. In summary , the particular style of speaking , as identified by syntactic , morphological , lexical ( i.e. vocabulary ) and phonological choices , is one of the strongest indicators of affiliation to a particular social group . </accommodate.v.1152><accommodate.v.1153>A unique disposable hygiene protection product , namely a feminine hygiene protection pad that includes a longer design to accommodate the need that full-figured women have for a feminine hygiene napkin that covers more area than the current smaller designs.

While general public interests - such as the public interest in the unfettered dissemination of works and the free flow of information - are obviously accommodated in the statutory exceptions , the more specific public interest in censoring immoral works or in publishing works that serve to protect the public can not be said to be the focus of the fair dealing defences. Universally conferred , copyright creates a formidable property right in a work that can be abused. It can be used to enable a creator to reap monetary rewards for an immoral or repugnant work , which is contrary to notions of morality and public interest , or employed as a weapon to prevent the revelation of material that is not itself protected subject matter. It is this notion of the 'public interest ' - as a protector against the abuse of copyright - that is not accommodated by the fair dealing exceptions , and therefore justifies a separate defence . </accommodate.v.1157><accommodate.v.1158>Welcome to FIRST LIGHT CHARTERS.

From straight utilitarian position a right should be upheld only when it brings about the greatest amount of utility , that is happiness. Mill , however , argues that society should defend one ' s moral rights in order to promote overall utility , ( not because of common attributes that all humans posses , as had been previously argued by natural rights theorists ) . He defends this stance within rule utilitarianism , in which if individual rights produce the greatest good for the greatest number , then as rules they are to be preferred over anything else. Furthermore , Mill ( expanding on Kant ) maintained the rights are directly connected to perfect duties ( duties that must be performed ) . Mill ' s view is not widely held and most agree that utilitarianism is not equipped to accommodate a theory of moral rights , indeed some of the most fierce opposition to moral rights came from utilitarianism. A more accepted form of justifying rights through consequentialism is maintained by contemporary Interest Theory ( section 3 ) . </accommodate.v.1428><accommodate.v.1429>Living room design can be difficult because the room must accommodate many activities and appeal to all members of the family.

The Court ruled that the complainants suffered discrimination because the system failed to ensure that they benefited equally from medical services offered to everyone. In ruling that the government had not accommodated deaf persons to the point of undue hardship , the Court determined that : effective communication was a necessary part of the provision of health care; the cost of accommodating deaf persons was very small compared to the provincial health care budget; and the potential ripple effect of other disadvantaged groups seeking similar interpretive services was not a factor for determining the point of undue hardship . </accommodate.v.1475><accommodate.v.1476>Unbound Philanthropy has approximately 600 square feet for desk licensing on the 3rd floor at 120 Wooster Street in Soho.

Little attention has been paid to the significant influence that large areas of asphalt paving have on the environment. In the 1950 's and 1960 's most parking lots were contiguous seas of asphalt , interrupted only by parking lot lighting fixtures. In the 1970 's emphasis was placed on landscaping and living plant materials as a required part of commercial development. Also this time , nationwide , was the start of the environmental movement and the Environmental Protection Agency. Many local , state and federal laws , have been enacted to mitigate the negative influences of humans on the environment. Large paved areas , especially black asphalt , have a tremendous influence on the environment. They contribute significantly to creation of 'heat islands ' , stormwater runoff , and pollution of surface runoff water. The City of Sunnyvale recognizes the need for parking lots but also recognizes that such parking lot can be designed and created to be much more environmentally friendly as well as more pleasant places for cars and people . </accommodate.v.1543><accommodate.v.1544>Our Toronto Airport hotel has 179 well appointed suites.

It is intended to put pressure on 1AR. Sure , the speaker has to refute the new plan attacks.

The Affirmative side has already staked out a position on those arguments in 2AC. Some leeway will be given to accommodate the Negative extensions , but the Affirmative can not bring up any novel substantive positions. And that ' s what makes this strategy so fiendishly effective ! If , for example , the chief 2AC argument against a shell D-A was that it has a weak impact , and then 2NC extends the initial argument to demonstrate a strong impact , 1AR can only reply by trying to reaffirm the " weak impact " claim , which is no longer credible . </accommodate.v.1554><accommodate.v.1555>At a mutually acceptable interval , the client and their Client Advocate confer by phone , email , or even face to face , with the intent to discuss the client ' s exceptional issues and to establish a solution course.

If a business can , without undue hardship , offer the employee a variable work schedule or lighten his or her duties or even authorize staff transfers to ensure that the employee can do his or her work , it must do so to accommodate the employee. Thus , in McGill University Health Centre ( Montreal General Hospital ) v. Syndicat des employ s de l'H pital g n ral de Montr al , [ 2007 ] 1 S.C.R. 161 , 2007 SCC 4 , the employer had authorized absences that were not provided for in the collective agreement. Likewise , in the case at bar , Hydro-Qu bec tried for a number of years to adjust the complainant 's working conditions : modification of her workstation , part-time work , assignment to a new position , etc. However , in a case involving chronic absenteeism , if the employer shows that , despite measures taken to accommodate the employee , the employee will be unable to resume his or her work in the reasonably foreseeable future , the employer will have discharged its burden of proof and established undue hardship.

This typically occurs when business processes become convoluted. For example , WFM software can easily run and manage a shift bid within set parameters. Add business rules and exceptions , such as the need to accommodate agents outside the offered shifts , and the capability of the system to effectively handle the bid rapidly declines. Time-off requests also suffer from this type of problem. WFM software is often used just to record time-off because a center estimates the amount of time-off allowed or allows too many overrides. Overly complex routing or shift design can cause what-if scenarios and multiskill-routing scheduling to slow to a crawl. If your WFM system is not performing as expected , consider how your rules may be contributing to the problem. If you 've created the rules for sound business reasons , you may have to do without the functionality. But often , if the WFM vendor can not accommodate your rules , the WFM system may not be doing you as much good as you think . </accommodate.v.1565><accommodate.v.1566>The cosy Jakub 's Park holiday flat is located at the Jakubovo ( Jacob ) Square , a quiet residential area just a 10-minute walk away from the historical Old Town.

I can not think of any project that was built the way it was originally designed without any changes made to the original. The problem of change becomes more evident in complex projects involving a lot of business logic , which keeps changing based on external circumstances. Sometimes the business rules have changed even before the project goes into production causing untold , mass rework to accommodate the changes. A good example is the insurance industry , new laws or market economics force changes , which can not be foreseen and planned for during design. The solution for a dynamic environment like the above is to have a rules engine. Rule engines allow the business users to change rules without affecting the overall running of an application. The rules are defined separately from the application , and the logic to deal with the rules is built in during design.

In Residents of Rosemont [ v.

The court specifically rejected Metro 's argument that a determinative need for housing could be established solely by reference to areas in close proximity to the preselected site of the proposed UGB expansion without any consideration of other parts of the regional planning territory. Here , pre-determining the subregion without evaluating whether other areas in the region could reasonably accommodate the need removes the UGB analysis from the regional context.

In the absence of government spending , unemployment arises when the private sector , in aggregate , desires to spend less of the monetary unit of account than it earns. Nominal ( or real ) wage cuts per se do not clear the labour market , unless they somehow eliminate the private sector desire to net save and increase spending. Thus , unemployment occurs when net government spending is too low to accommodate the need to pay taxes and the desire to net save . </accommodate.v.1629><accommodate.v.1630>Welcome to Faith Financial Group , Inc. where we offer over 39 years of experience in the commercial lending industry in Apple Valley , Minnesota.

One class of examples is generated by the phenomenon of causal overdetermination. Suppose Alfred comes to believe that there is a sheep in the field by hearing a recording of the sounds normally produced by sheep while also looking at a distant boulder that looks like a sheep in the field. Even if there is a sheep somewhere in the field not seen by Alfred , he does not know that one is there. Later , should he come to perceive the real sheep , he would come to know that there is a sheep in the field. The problem for the causal theory is that Alfred 's later perception of the real sheep would not cause his belief in an appropriate way , because his belief already exists. The causal theory would incorrectly deny that Alfred has knowledge. This kind of case can be accommodated within the general spirit of the causal theory by allowing as 'appropriate ' the relation of causal sustaining , a very weak form of causal connection . </accommodate.v.1703><accommodate.v.1704>In some ways , these structures and systems are reminiscent of Parsons in that they provide an all-encompassing theoretical framework that can be used to analyze various aspects of social organization and social change.

By 1991 this system is projected to shift the balance between satellite and cable traffic to 56 per cent satellite and 44 per cent cable ( Federal Communication Commission , 1986 ) . Further , the configuration of this cable provides valuable insights concerning the emerging pattern and location of economic activity. While the initial Hawaii Transpac cables were oriented towards national security interests with direct links from Hawaii to Guam , Figure 1 shows how the new HAW 4-TTC 3 cable is designed to accommodate both economic and military linkages. After stopping in Hawaii , the cable extends far into the Pacific and then branches in two directions : the national security link runs to Guam and then on to the Philippines via a branch called GP-2; the economic and trade connection extends directly from Hawaii to Japan. By 1990 , other key Pacific Rim centers will be linked via a ring that will connect Guam , the Philippines , Hong Kong , Korea and Japan.

Consequently , due to the wide range of disabilities and the various modifications needed to accommodate them , it would be difficult for the agency to attempt to develop a regulation that lists each type and level of severity of disability and that specifies the particular set of standards that may be adversely affected by the modifications suitable for each of those listed types and levels of severity of disability.

Second , such a theory is scientifically impossible when we consider the geologic record. If the world was reduced to being " formless and void " with Lucifer 's flood how could that have produced such a relatively ordered fossil record ? This would also mean that Noah 's flood left no record in the fossils.

That is , it injects credit markets with new money so as to relieve the upward pressure on interest rates that Treasury borrowing would otherwise entail. And with telling exceptions , the Federal Reserve maintains an easy-money policy in the year-and-a-half before each presidential election. ( 7 ) The so-called political business cycles have now become a integral part of the macroeconomic landscape. Further , the Federal Reserve is called upon to deal with other real or perceived problems having little to do with macroeconomic stability. It is expected , for instance , to lower interest rates when the housing market is in a slump and to strengthen or weaken the dollar in response to movements in exchange rates or trade flows. All these attempts to manipulate employment rates , interest rates , and exchange rates interfere with the Federal Reserve 's ability to achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability or even to refrain from inducing instability.

In later stages the focus tends to broaden to account for a wider range of consumer choice and consumer protection interests , as well as those of producers. This may occur through changes in the emphasis of implementation or through new legislation ( as recently in India ) . Similarly , industrial policy aims to promote dynamic efficiency first for the selected economic agents and second for the economy as a whole , where the efficiency should be interpreted in terms of achieving the designated long run socioeconomic goals at minimum cost , measured in present value.

The theory has been flexible enough to accommodate political , military , and social change , and still retain its relevance. There is no doubt in the minds of many that the issue of war and the Christian conscience has been a long-standing problem. When asked about war some would allude to the Just War Theory. Just war theorists trace the beginnings of the theory to Augustine ' s idea of normative political order. His dualistic philosophy imagined two worlds , the civitas terrenae and the civitas dei , the City of Earth and the City of God. The former , flawed by human weakness and characterized by disorder and strife , is organized around cupiditas , or egoistic love. The latter , the ideal civitas dei , is achieved through the transformation of cupiditas into caritas , which is love directed toward God. The goal of history , according to Augustine , is the realization of this ideal state of being characterized by Christian love.1.

However , when that power is translated into policy decisions that align governments against a majority of public opinion or that actively disregard the interests of large segments of society , it may rightly be considered a threat to democratic values and the ability of governmental institutions to respond effectively to the needs and interests of the citizens they are meant to serve . </accommodate.v.1947><accommodate.v.1948>A double room is designed to accommodate two people only.

Under this approach , even small projects can be an opportunity to make meaningful improvements. In repaving projects , for example , an edge stripe can be shifted to create more room for cyclists. In routine work on traffic lights , the timing can be changed to better accommodate pedestrians walking at a slower speed.

The gravamen of our decision , however , was that , because the seven factors in Goal 14 concern the regional need for additional lands and whether lands within the existing UGB can accommodate that identified regional need , Metro must evaluate all of the factors in Goal 14 in the context of its existing regional UGB. Our decision in Residents of Rosemont is consistent with the purpose of Goal 14 , which is " [ t ] o provide for an orderly and efficient transition from rural to urban land " and with one of the requirements in Goal 2 and in ORS 197.732 ( 1 ) ( c ) ( B ) that , before a jurisdiction may amend its UGB , it must determine , among other things , that " [ a ] reas which do not require a new exception can not reasonably accommodate the use. " Thus , consistently with Residents of Rosemont , we conclude that , in determining whether there is land within the existing UGB that could accommodate a need or whether the UGB must be expanded to include additional lands , Goal 14 requires a jurisdiction to consider and evaluate the locational factors in the context of the entire region . </accommodate.v.1985><accommodate.v.1986>A good consultation room serves one primary function : to facilitate effective communication between patient , caregiver and partners in care.

The prevailing trend in the cases is that , in matters such as employer benefit contributions , vacation entitlement , and service accumulation as it relates to compensation , legitimate distinctions may be drawn based on the employee 's actual attendance at work. One arbitrator has reasoned that the Code treats compensation differently from access to employment : where the issue is one of participation in the work force , equality means implementing special measures to accommodate the disabled; but in matters of compensation , disabled employees may be treated the same as those who are able-bodied . </accommodate.v.1991><accommodate.v.1992>Again , remember the fact that when Thomas Chalmers began to preach about the Gap in Genesis ( in the early 19th Century ) it was well before Charles Darwin even published.

First , if I understand Minto 's thesis ( and I may not ) , the three aforementioned " findings about the way the mind works " seem to refer far more to the subconscious than to the conscious mind. If so , I question how Minto 's highly rational approach to writing clear business documents can accommodate the need to communicate effectively in non-verbal ways ( e.g. body language and tone of voice ) . Minto 's approach requires completing a rigorous , disciplined , and focused process ( a geometric progression , really ) that presupposes that the recipient of the given document will absorb and digest ( not merely organize ) the material in a comparable manner . </accommodate.v.2003><accommodate.v.2004>Large corporations , for example , would find it hard to prove undue hardship on the basis of cost alone , as would federal departments and agencies.

The Bible gives no specific time when God first created the heaven and the Earth ( Genesis 1 : 1 ) , but it does give the time when the Earth is found in this desolate condition and for the start of the seven , literal , 24 hour days. That time was , indeed , geologically very recently. In this respect only is the Young Earth Creationist fully correct. This is the context for the " gap " on which Ruin-Reconstruction doctrine is based.

In a general sense this is a look at physical/structural and institutional resilience. Ultimately the model is intended to determine the ability of the Rio Grande system to accommodate stresses induced by a variety of possible future circumstances. Rules have been articulated in such a way as to be included in the simulation model for the Rio Grande system in the form of decision tree structures which determine particular actions under specified conditions. In this way the model is equipped to assess situations which will require changes in the operational or implementation level rules in order to allow additional , unanticipated stress to be accommodated. While the institutional side is in many ways much more complex than thephysical system , this analytic framework makes it manageable . </accommodate.v.2019><accommodate.v.2020>Our extensive line of Goodyear belts and Gates belts and hoses include serpentine belts , timing belts , v belts and hoses to accommodate your every need.

Hardison , [ 432 US 63 ] 432 U.S. 63 ( 1977 ) . Hardison was brought under section 703 ( a ) ( 1 ) because it involved facts occurring before the enactment of Section 701 ( j ) . The Court applied the Commission 's 1967 Guidelines , but indicated that the result would be the same under Section 701 ( j ) . It stated that Trans World Airlines had made reasonable efforts to accommodate the religious needs of its employee , Hardison. The Court held that to require Trans World Airlines to make further attempts at accommodations -- by unilaterally violating a seniority provision of the collective bargaining agreement , paying premium wages on a regular basis to another employee to replace Hardison , or creating a serious shortage of necessary employees in another department in order to replace Hardison -- would create an undue hardship on the conduct of Trans World Airlines ' business , and would therefore , exceed the duty to accommodate Hardison . </accommodate.v.2025><accommodate.v.2026>The U.S. Postal Service is sending a letter to postal customers today that says it will defer mandatory implementation of its August 1999-2000 CASS address-quality initiatives until July 31 , 2000 to accommodate USPS customers who are planning to freeze computer systems this year as part of their Y2K programs . </accommodate.v.2026><accommodate.v.2027>Accordingly , in developing this proposal , the agency has sought to accommodate the mobility needs of people with disabilities , while preserving safety to the extent possible.

Accommodating Mr. Renaud 's religious beliefs would have required allowing him to work hours different than those specified. The respondent school board and union could not agree on a means of accommodating Mr. Renaud and as a result he was dismissed from his job. The B.C.

In this paper , the canonical graphs are represented as conceptual graphs ( CGs ) , a formally defined version of logic that has the same model-theoretic foundation as Common Logic ( ISO/IEC 2006 ) . Equivalent operations may be performed with any notation , but examples shown as graphs are easier to read. No formal logic can be vague , but the axioms of a theory may be underspecified to accommodate multiple options in the subtheories.

We show that , with some restrictive conditions , the welfare level of a small country under the managed floating is possibly higher than that under other regimes.

Feminists , ecologists , proponents of identity politics rooted in race , ethnicity , or sexuality have failed to find a theoretical home in marxism; they have instead articulated an independent theoretical position. The rise of these movements and their apparent incompatibility with marxism has revealed an important lacuna in marxist theory. Despite its sensitivity to the role of social and material conditions in constructing social reality , traditional marxism is silent on an issue that dominates contemporary theory : the cultural construction of race , gender , ethnicity and sexuality. Traditional marxist theory focuses on a single factor : material/economic conditions. It is the clash of classes defined by the ownership of the means of production that drives marxist theory; there is no room for differences of gender , class , race and ethnicity. This has created a peculiar dilemma for contemporary marxists. The new social movements identify themselves as oppositional , resistance movements; they thus fall under the traditional purview of the left. Yet marxist theory can not accommodate these movements without violating its basic tenets. The most that can be accomplished is an uneasy theoretical and practical accommodation . </accommodate.v.2048><accommodate.v.2049>Whether you 're organising a meeting , conference or wedding the Old Manor Hotel is dedicated to providing a venue that will accommodate your every requirement.

As such , it contains no new material for distinction or long remembrance; but it does reflect the current state of instruction of basic circuit theory in Electrical Engineering ( EE ) departments in the United States. And this is a state of transition. This transition is brought about by the necessity to introduce new topics into the undergraduate electrical engineering curriculum in order to accommodate the important recent developments in electrical engineering. This can be accomplished only by restructuring classical courses such as the basic circuit theory. As a result , there is increasing pressure to find new ways to teach basic circuit theory in a concise manner without compromising the quality and the scope of the exposition of this theory. This text represents an attempt to explore such new approaches . </accommodate.v.2063><accommodate.v.2064>With all of those hard-nosed rules , remember this third point : sometimes , things change.

Under GATS , a member country must publish rules regulating practice by foreign lawyers within its geographic boundaries. That process raises particularly complex issues in the United States , say experts on the agreement , because the legal profession is regulated primarily by the states. That means the U.S. standards for practice by foreign lawyers will somehow have to accommodate the rules of practice in place at the state level . </accommodate.v.2081><accommodate.v.2082>The types and number of surgeries that can be performed using minimally invasive or laparoscopic techniques are increasing every year.

J.J.C Smart ' s ( 1978 ) formulates the problem for consequentialism with respect to justice as follows : The most poignant sort of case , of course , is that of the punishment of an innocent man. Suppose that in order to prevent a riot in which thousands would certainly be killed a sheriff were to frame and execute an innocent man. On utilitarian principles would not the sacrifice of one life in order to save thousands be justified ? ( Smart ' s discussion is with particular reference to Utilitarianism , but , again , Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism. ) The point of the example is that if the sheriff frames the stranger he will bring about more good consequences than bad consequences. One may simply stipulate that this is so. According to consequentialism , therefore , this is the right action to perform. However , an innocent man does not deserve to be punished. So , it seems , consequentialism does not accommodate justice . </accommodate.v.2114><accommodate.v.2115>Reserve One of our Corpus Christi , Texas Hotel Meeting RoomsAt the Radisson Hotel Corpus Christi Beach , we offer an ideal meeting venue with 10 , 000 square feet of flexible event space.

The first discusses the economics of marriage; it starts with an analysis of the marriage market and goes on to consider what marriage is and why it exists. The second part of the chapter is devoted to the economics of altruism : the analysis of rational behavior by an individual who values the welfare of another. It demonstrates that altruism , which one might think of as outside of economics , actually fits neatly into economic theory. The result is not merely to accommodate the theory to an important feature of the real world but also to use economics to derive some surprising results about the consequences of altruism . </accommodate.v.2163><accommodate.v.2164>These facilities are recommended for designation as National Historic Landmarks because they illustrate the extensive ground support testing facilities needed to accomplish the American unmanned space programthe exploration of the near and deep space environment.

He assumed both observations to be correct , and formulated his theory , based on these assumptions , by simply altering the Galilean transformation to accommodate the lack of addition of velocities with regard to the speed of light.

In its analysis , the Court ignored the debate that ensued during the passage of the CDPA over the inclusion of a separate public interest defence in addition to the fair dealing exceptions. Although a concession was granted in terms of section 171 ( 3 ) , the extent and tenacity of the campaigning is indicative of the fact that some users of copyrighted material , most noticeably the newspaper publishers , regarded the fair dealing defences an inadequate. Furthermore , the Court ignored the fact that the fair dealing defence excludes photographs and unpublished works and is restricted to current events.

It is hard to avoid the conclusion that people do sometimes act on ethical values , and it is hard to see how the selfishness of the ( probable ) majority can " cancel out " this self-sacrifice. It seems that we really have to modify the assumption of self-interest in order to accommodate the evidence. People often do act on non-self-interested values -- but when they do so they act on their own values , not those of the government , some philosopher , or ( most important ) the observing economist. We might call this assumption " rational individualism " rather than " rational self interest.

To prevent this point from arriving , the conditions of production must be altered. These change , of course , in the very process of accumulation. There is , however , no reason to assume that the conditions of production will always change so as to accommodate the need for capital expansion , the less so because the former are the general social conditions of production and the latter a particular need bound only to the exploitative capital-labor relationship. And though it is true that social demand , by affecting the distribution of social surplus-value via the competitive establishment of an average rate of profit , sets or removes limits to particular capitals , this social demand does not represent the realities of social conditions but is itself largely determined by the production of capital . </accommodate.v.2229><accommodate.v.2230>At the request of a significant number of our investors and analysts , we have rescheduled our earnings conference call to accommodate an industry event on the same day.

He wants the U.S. to become energy independent , and he views nuclear power as a crucial part of the mix. Adopting the nuclear option may accommodate an economic truth , but Tsongas has been quick to recognize a different , political truism : the fact that many Democratic voters abhor nuclear power. His speeches these days downplay nuclear 's role in achieving energy independence , but on paper Tsongas notes that America 's 112 nuclear plants produced the energy to cut the U.S. oil-import bill by $ 4.7 billion in 1989. On the basis of these figures , substituting nuclear power completely for oil imports would require more than 1 , 000 new nuclear plants. Even that estimate is low , since Tsongas calls for building 300-MW-to-500-MW plants rather than the current 1 , 200-MW models . </accommodate.v.2248><accommodate.v.2249>At first glance , the second use of the theory may seem unrelated to design. We believe , though , that a descriptive approach , while not offering a direction path to action , holds some advantages for thinking about design. First , as Greeno has shown , a descriptive use of SitCog can more easily accommodate a variety of conceptions and purposes for instruction. Because such a view does not attach itself to a clear set of instructional methods , it will likely be relevant to more learning situations. Second , because descriptive critiques start with the given situation , designers and participants may more clearly see a path toward improvement. This may help to mitigate the concern expressed by some practitioners that ideologically based approaches are just too extreme or idealistic to adopt wholesale. Finally , a less prescriptive approach will likely be more respectful of participants ' values and concerns. Communities of practice represent diverse interests and political beliefs. Any learning environment meant to reflect that diversity would need to be able to incorporate varied methods , approaches , strategies , etc . </accommodate.v.2249><accommodate.v.2250>NCALLs Growing Your Money Financial Literacy Program provides households seeking improved housing and financial management goals and the planning skills needed to succeed.

That evidence does not prove that global consistency is impossible , but it suggests that a modular approach is easier to implement. A lattice of theories can accommodate both. It permits the development of independent modules , but it includes all possible generalizations and combinations.

Removal of the liquidity from the financial market in a timely manner is as important as its timely injection. The failure of the Federal Reserve to move against an increasing V that characterizes the end of the liquidity crisis accommodates the Treasury and puts upward pressure on prices. Possibly more critical are the repercussions of the excess liquidity in international money markets. Overaccommodation can weaken the dollar. If this weakness is perceived as the beginning of a trend , the result may be heavy selling of dollars and dollar-denominated assets. Thus , a botched attempt to deal with a liquidity crisis can provoke a currency crisis. The Federal reserve must somehow defend the real economy against this double-edged sword.

Plotting many systems in simple graphs revealed that often there seems to be some kind of situation that the system tries to achieve , an equilibrium of some sort. For instance : imagine a city of 10 , 000 people. In order to accommodate these people , the city will spawn one supermarket , two swimming pools , a library and three churches. And for argument 's sake we will assume that this setup pleases everybody and an equilibrium is achieved. But then the Ben &amp;Jerry 's company decides to open an ice cream plant on the outskirts of the town , opening jobs for 10 , 000 more people. The town expands rapidly to accommodate 20 , 000 people; one supermarket is added , two swimming pools , one library and three churches and the equilibrium is maintained. That equilibrium is called an attractor . </accommodate.v.2296><accommodate.v.2297>In the late 1980s , the City of Texas City realized the necessity to diversify and stimulate its economy and began to aggressively develop an economic development strategy. The strategy contemplated having a versatile inventory of integrated economic development vehicles available to exploit the City 's numerous assets and accommodate any economic development project requirement. Accordingly , several local government corporations , that have specific economic development missions and resources , have been created to interact , share resources and collectively pursue economic development projects. Other vehicles have also been implemented to provide a holistic approach to economic development within the City. The strategy is working and the City is proactively achieving its goals . </accommodate.v.2297><accommodate.v.2298>Increased concern about seismic risk has led to more stringent requirements that can negatively impact historic buildings. Un-reinforced masonry construction , common to many historic buildings and structures , is particularly susceptible to damage in seismic events. The challenge of seismic upgrades in historic buildings is to accommodate strengthening in ways that do not interfere with the building fa ade or the volume and features of significant public spaces. For these reasons the input of qualified structural engineers with knowledge of and experience in preservation of historic buildings is essential. ( Refer also to WBDG Seismic Design Principles ) .

A sidewalk without curb ramps is useless to someone using a wheelchair. A street with an awkwardly placed public transportation stop without safe crossings is dangerous for riders. A fast-moving road with no safe space for cyclists will discourage those who depend on bicycles for transportation. A road with heavy freight traffic must be planned with those vehicles in mind. Older adults and children face particular challenges as they are more likely to be seriously injured or killed along a roadway. Automobiles are an important part of a complete street as well , as any change made to better accommodate other modes will have an effect on personal vehicles too. In some cases , like the installation of curb bulb-outs , these changes can improve traffic flow and the driving experience . </accommodate.v.2302><accommodate.v.2303>Cognitivist teaching methods aim to assist students in assimilating new information to existing knowledge , and enabling them to make the appropriate modifications to their existing intellectual framework to accommodate that information. Thus , while cognitivists allow for the use of " skill and drill " exercises in the memorization of facts , formulae , and lists , they place greater importance on strategies that help students to actively assimilate and accommodate new material. For instance , asking students to explain new material in their own words can assist them in assimilating it by forcing them to re-express the new ideas in their existing vocabulary. Likewise , providing students with sets of questions to structure their reading makes it easier for them to relate it to previous material by highlighting certain parts and to accommodate the new material by providing a clear organizational structure . </accommodate.v.2303><accommodate.v.2304>To accommodate the Capital Health Regional Simulation Centre 's need for more space it is being considered for relocation in order to support the growth of the program.

Marxist theory has been unable to accommodate three significant intellectual movements in the last decades of the twentieth century : postmodernism/poststructuralism , theoretical articulations of the " new social movements " such as feminism , ecology and identity politics , and a revitalized theory of liberal democracy. The postmodern/poststructuralist attack on metanarratives , totalizing theories that purport to explain the whole of social reality , is equally applicable to marxism and traditional liberalism. But this critique has been focused on the left because many postmodern/poststructuralist theorists are former marxists; liberalism is rarely deemed worthy of their attention. The upshot of the critique , thus , has not been so much to question the viability of any foundationalist politics , but , rather , specifically to problematize marxist/leftist politics . </accommodate.v.2313><accommodate.v.2314>Discover your inner celebrity in this exclusive 550-square-foot King Suite designed for two.

NHTSA is not aware of any modifications that are made to hood latch systems when a vehicle is modified to accommodate a person with a disability. NHTSA is aware that a modification to the method of unlatching might be necessary to allow a person with reduced range of motion or strength , or seated in a wheelchair to open the hood. NHTSA does not believe , however , that a modification to the method of unlatching would require the elimination of the second latch position; thus , the agency does not believe a make inoperative exemption for Standard No. 113 is warranted.

Building codes ensure safe construction to protect health and safety of the public. Low flow plumbing devices have been a State requirement for years. As additional building standards are put in place to accommodate the requirement to conserve water , it is likely that the application of International Building Codes ( IBC ) and inspection procedures will be extended throughout the Sierra Vista sub-watershed to permit the County to check that these measures are being complied with when performing code-related inspections. Additional staffing will likely be required to accommodate the additional reviews and inspections. The Board of Supervisors expects to consider the expansion of the area of application of building codes in the sub-watershed as part of the normal planning process.

Economic growth does involve price deflation in a literal sense ( the price level falls as output increases ) but does not involve any macroeconomic malady that is commonly associated with the term " deflationary pressures. " In effect , by distinguishing between malignant and benign deflation , free banking provides a much stronger check against inflation than that provided by the simple monetary rule. ( 6 ) It would be misleading to classify free banking in terms of malady and remedy because the malady never gets a chance to show itself.

This study , undertaken at the request of the Senate Committee on the Budget , assesses the needs of seven infrastructure systems and the costs of meeting those needs. The primary focus of the analysis is on the cost effectiveness of infrastructure investment , a concern made particularly pressing by the constraints now affecting the federal budget. In this context , the paper considers how current federal policies and funding levels may or may not mesh with infrastructure needs anticipated over the coming decade , how possible policy changes might bring about improved cost effectiveness , and how changes at the federal level could affect state and local governments and the private-sector beneficiaries of infrastructure services . </accommodate.v.2391><accommodate.v.2392>That said , strong arguments can be made for special tolerance of good-faith revisions to expert testimony.

QFT is the most fundamental physical theory and provides the answers to questions about the basic structure of the physical world. However , the way QFT describes the world is so different from the way our senses present it to us that it requires an overhaul of philosophic categories and arguments. How can we know the microscopic world without a satisfactory measurement theory ? What are the general conditions of the world that make possible such knowledge ? What are the presuppositions of physical theories ? Dr.Auyang argues that the current relational- substantial debate on space- time is inadequate and the observer- observed distinction in quantum interpretations illusory becouse they are hampered by philosophical constructs too narrow to accommodate the complicated structures of modern philosophical theories. Modern physical theories have incorporated many presuppositions of empirical knowledge , and consequently the theories inform us about the general nature of the world and out relation to it , in addition to information about elementary particles. The conceptual structure of QFT is extracted and articulated in common- sense terms , and used to answer many longstanding philosophical questions </accommodate.v.2410><accommodate.v.2411>These can range from small groupings of six for a very comfortable breakfast seminar , to the basic boardroom and U-shape meeting styles.
