The official was walking to the Swarm bench to grab a stick. He reached for Sharp 's stick which , from what I was told , was very close. Sharp did n't know if his stick would pass. At the last second , Talbot stuck his stick out and told the official to take his. Talbot 's stick was very close also. Talbot knew this but he thought his stick had a better chance than Sharp's. The official took Talbot 's stick and made the check. When the official came back to the bench he had a few words with Talbot. When the official walked away , Talbot turned towards the bench facing us and his facial expression told all of us just how close his stick was to failing. He made a HUGE sigh of relief and then a big smile appeared on his face . </stick.v.8><stick.v.9>Glue the end of the wing with the popsicle sticks to the center of one side of the balance beam.

The Original stick draws about 20 milliamps from fresh batteries , but modern brand-name alkalines can deliver something like 2800 milliamp-hours of capacity at that low drain level.

This is due to the vast array of new styles , designs and concepts that are being used for USB sticks and this inevitably filters into the promotional USB sticks market. The quirkiness of these new styles and designs lends them perfectly to the promotional world and should really help firms and businesses spread the word about them. It used to be that colours would be the most eye catching element of a product but with leather and wood being just two of the fabric choices available for the modern range of USB sticks , the sky is the limit.

Part of the problem is that he 's popping up a ridiculous number of pitches. His infield flyball per total flyballs is at 30.8 -- or about 4 times higher than it was last season and the season before that. He 's hitting more line drives than in the past and walking at a higher rate than ever before. The thing that sticks out to me the most though is that his homerun per flyball rate is about 80 of what it was last season. That 's a number that really is n't going to fluctuate a great deal once you 've identified the player 's true talent level and Duncan 's hitting well below the previous two seasons numbers. In summary , he 's popping some pitches up but everything else points to more power than his .424 SLG would lead you to believe . </stick.v.42><stick.v.43>Phil Garner has a bad habit of fixing something that 's not broken.

If this becomes a real problem , you can turn the burner down to medium , but you must remember to turn it back to high for the rest of the cooking. Some of it will stick to the wok , but should release easier after it cooks a bit. After it cooks a bit , turn it again. Repeat this several times. You may have to scrape some off the wok with the paddle if it sticks. If it gets too sticky , it 's also time to remove it. Just before taking it out of the wok , splash some soy onto the rice to make it a light brown. This will give it the browned fried rice color and add a lot of favor. It will likely take a tablespoon or two. Do not put the soy on the rice until you are ready to remove it from the wok , or it will stick badly and cause a mess . </stick.v.80><stick.v.81>Crowds gathered for hours around booth 1854 , hidden way back deep in the barrio , far from the bright lights and pretty girls ( they call them reps ) , to see the father and son team stick their invention to golf clubs , snow skis , drift wood , squirrel cages , Styrofoam balls , wine bottles and even a swinging tennis racket !

There are hundreds of PSA ' s , or pressure sensitive adhesives. That means that they don ' t need to be licked or have glue slopped on them to get them to stick , they just need to be pressed on firmly. Permanent , removable , and ' all temp ' are the broad categories of adhesive properties. Hot melt , emulsion acrylic , and solvent acrylic are the pressure sensitive adhesive systems that are generally used for device package labeling. The key to labeling of course , is the actual sticking to the package.

This is even better proven by the fact that it will stick to the person who threw it if it bounces back at them ( such as hitting a wall ) .

Before you go shopping , decide how much money you can afford to spend on gifts and other items. Then be sure to stick to your budget.

Mysterio was understandably upset , calling it a set-up , but Guerrero managed to get Mysterio to go to the back to talk about it , while Guerrera went forward with trying to keep the Cruiserweight Title away from Kidman. However , an upset Mysterio came out later on and helped cause Guerrera to lose , giving Kidman the title. After the match , the rest of the lWo came to the ring , with Eddie Guerrero trying to keep everyone cool. He told Mysterio that he needed to choose one way or the other who he was with. Guerrero warned Mysterio , when he started to take off his lWo shirt , that he 'd better think about it , but Mysterio finished leaving the lWo , causing Guerrero to yell " Get him ! " The lWo chased the speedy Mysterio to the back , creating another major feud. Later in the night , Eddie joined the rest of the lWo in competing in the 3-Ring Battle Royal , but they were unable to stick together and work like the nWo , with everyone being eliminated. Kevin Nash went on to win the match . </stick.v.304><stick.v.305>PixFix can erase. When we delete a photograph on our computer or media , it can often be recovered.

The rear emblem is stuck on with double stick tape. If it is n't a hot day when you do this , you might want to use a heat gun to warm up the adhesive on the double stick tape. You can then take 10 pound test fishing line and slide it behind the emblem like dental floss. If your emblem has been on for many years , you can peel up the rubber edging a little and spray some bug/tar/adhesive remover behind the emblem. This will start the unsticking process. The emblem will come right off. It was 95 degrees out the day I removed the emblem and I just peeled mine off without any fishing line or adhesive remover. Remove the rest of the double stick tape with your fingers and then clean the area with the bug/tar/adhesive remover.

It has a three-second fuse that counts down at the point of activation. A manual activation via a small button or a stimulated activation , such as another explosion or gunfire , will set the detonator and start the countdown. Delayed activation can also set the detonator after it either sticks to a target or otherwise comes to a rest. It is possible to tell if the grenade has been activated. A densely small and bright cloud of plasma emission will leak around the grenade as the explosive reaction takes place inside. This cloud will gradually grow to a larger diameter after each second of the countdown. A low sound is emitted by the grenade when activated , followed by two rapid beeps and a high-pitched whine just seconds before the explosion. This is the plasma grenade 's standard process of detonation . </stick.v.329><stick.v.330>The plan GGYC is sticking to is the grammar of the Deed of Gift , which at this point has been beaten to death.

I do n't like using an isolator because I like all the juice to come evenly out of the batteries , and to charge the batteries equally. What will sometimes happen with isolators is that the current flow will slowly drain off the " isolated " battery even while you are using the other. Remember that the current flow for your vehicle ( neg earth systems ) flows from ground ( earth ) to positive , just like lightning !

( From anyone witnessing the body change there will have taken no time at all , from the real series point of view. ) The Tardis , being protective , has of course come with him. Imagine the opening scene , the Doctor wondering what is happening , not exactly being in a body he expected , and the Stickstart crew arguing so they do n't notice the blue box they are about to run into. Crash ! And the doctor sticks his head out the door and yells; " Hey , watch where you going ! Bloody Sunday drivers.

To simulate this I used some light thread with the join hidden in a piece of shrink wrap insulation. Once the Superglue on this joint has set , the ends of the thread sticking out from the insulation can be carefully cut off. The shrink wrap can then be hauled to the top of the mast to represent rigging blocks . </stick.v.372><stick.v.373>Sticking the welding rod is where the rod instead of melting like it should , sticks to the base metal. There is not enough current to melt it , but enough for it to stick. One way of getting it loose is immediately jerking the rod away from the base metal. If that does n't work , you have to unclamp the rod , and then break it off . </stick.v.373><stick.v.374>Up until now , Ford was using a Japanese ( Aisin ) 6 speed tranny , the same company that provides Toyota 's trannies. Sorry , but if its good enough for Toyota its good enough for Ford. GM 's RWD 6 speeds are flawless in terms of shift quality based on what I 've read. I am tired of excuses made to support the " Japan is always better " mentality. When domestic lacked 6 speeds people complained about their lack of sophistication , now I am reading that the of gears isnt important because shift quality and smoothness is important. If that be the case than GM might as well stick with their 4 speeds. BTW , as far as I know no one does smooth shifting transmissions better than GM , that is usually their strong suit . </stick.v.374><stick.v.375>The loop on the free end goes around a pushpin stuck in the drywall of any suitable wall space ( inside closets is good and does n't look visually unappealing ) .

If the product contains anything else , they are keeping it a closely guarded secret as I could find no information on their website ( www.desolveit.com ) - but they do boast that it is a natural solution ' , so one must assume there are no harmful chemicals although on the bottle there is a warning that if swallowed it may cause lung damage ( so , I 'd stick to the Vodka if I was you ) . </stick.v.376><stick.v.377>Oil change stickers or oil change labels are made from premium static cling.

As I went around the channel with the new butyl , I stretched and stuck , stretched and stuck , until the entire channel was lined with butyl tape , most of it the correct diameter. Remember to default to too little stretch , rather than too much. You can always squish it flat if the tape is too big , but you 'll have trouble getting the plastic to stick if there 's not enough tape . </stick.v.378><stick.v.379>The mesh is cut to 2 times the size of the tank that you want the moss wall to be in. You would need to fold the mesh in half and stuff the moss in-between. Cut some holes on the perimeter of the mesh so as to stick in the suction cups. For my demonstration , it 's for a small 1 ft tank , hence one suction cup is sufficient. If you are doing a large wall , you will need to put in more suction cups especially on the 4 corners , and also some suction cups around the centre of the mesh to prevent warping when the mesh is in the tank . </stick.v.379><stick.v.380>I 'm a techie junky and looking forward to my HD upgrade.

We 're going to pay off some bills , stick a bit in savings , and hopefully have enough left over to replace my aging laptop for my final two years of school. I 'm still having the internal debate over whether or not to get a sub-notebook like the Dell Inspiron 700m , or a TabletPC like the one I fell in love with while on loan from HP.

For fear of being branded as pass  by the hip police that prowls your website ? Maybe wall decals are a valid form of decoration , art , and expression that 'll ( pun intended ) stick around for a long time. It just seems a little disingenuous to trot out that phrase every time you talk about these things. Get over it , sometimes wall decals are really cool , sometimes they 're not , but constantly qualifying any reference to them undermines the point of talking about them in the first place. You would n't say " we keep saying we 're so over painting your walls , but ... " </stick.v.387><stick.v.388>More than just letting them stick to the keyboard , I wanted to design for failure. In fact , I want my players to fail. If they can play through a whole level the first time and get a medal , then I feel like I did a really crappy job designing that level. This goes back to challenge I ' ve played too many games with 50 or 100 levels that I never finish. If I don ' t get a level that I fail on before I get up to level 10 or 15 , I ' ll stop playing a game. If there ' s no difficulty , it ' s just an activity I might as well flip on the TV at that point. It ' s by overcoming those failures that getting a bronze , a silver , or a gold medal actually assumes some meaning. There ' s a chance that I ' ll turn off a lot of players who get frustrated before getting that first medal , but my hope is that those who make it through will feel like they ' ve accomplished something . </stick.v.388><stick.v.389>So what is going on here ? RAK must have received assurances that the RAK venue choice would stick or it never would have invested $ 120 million in the venture.

It must not have liked what it saw in SNG 's opening brief. Enter new blue chip counsel to try to salvage the appeal and the $ 120 million. Will it work ? Probably not , but you can never tell until the decision is handed down.

Since the PSP uses standard Memory Stick Duo format chips , if you have a digital camera that uses MS Duo sticks , you can simply slap the stick from your digicam into the PSP and browse to your heart 's content.

There are different combinations of colors and patterns that will give you the widest variety of colors and patterns in the litters. This might be something to think about.

For example , many radio stations run promotions where you could win a prize if your car is spotted sporting their bumper sticker.

This protects the tendon as it heals. You will probably start a gentle exercise program soon after surgery. Exercising your finger as directed by your doctor or therapist is very important. Surgery creates scar tissue inside the finger. Without regular exercise , this tissue will stick to the tendon and the bone , then you wont be able to bend your finger easily. As the tendon heals , youll slowly begin to strengthen the tendon and muscles and move your finger more.

You have to waste an entire stick of wax before the remains of hot glue have been cleared from the glue gun. Basically , you have to use up two Sealing Wax sticks to get one stick 's worth of seals.

Some cooks like non-stick cookware for it ' s easy cleanup. The non-stick coating means that foods aren ' t stuck to the cookware after you are done cooking which in turn means you won ' t need to wear out your elbow scrubbing away stuck on food. Another trait that makes the non-stick style of cookware popular is its capability of cooking non-fat meals.

This dish is often served on a dim sum menu , but may be offered independently. The filling for this dish usually contains pork ( or chicken ) , cabbage , scallions , ginger , and sesame seed oil. The mixed filling is sealed into a dumpling wrapper , steamed in a wok , and then fried to crispness on one side in a shallow frying pan. The effect of the one crisp side of the dumpling is where it gets its English name of potsticker as it appears to have been stuck to the pot in which it was cooked.

The term Stickies stuck , though pinnies ( and pinheads ) disappeared , in favour of the nickname " Provos " and for a time , " Provies " . The paper-and-pin Easter Lily of the IRA was the traditional commemorative badge of the Easter Rising [ 10 ] , whereas the self-adhesive Easter Lily of the Officials was a novel invention , symbolic of the divergence of opinion between them . </stick.v.438><stick.v.439>Wipe down the surface where you plan to attach your stickers with a dry cloth.

If a woman wears a high-heeled shoe it changes the apparent musculature of the leg so that you get an effect of twanging sinew , of tension needing to be released. Her bottom sticks out like an offering. At the same time , the lofty perch is an expression of vulnerability , she is effectively hobbled and unable to escape.

After a few passes , we transitioned to low-altitude pop attacks. Completing our runs , we left 500 feet and began to climb out for the transit back to Oceana. Climbing through 3 , 000 feet , I tried to bring the jet right to head toward home. The stick appeared to be stuck in the neutral position , and the jet was unwilling to turn. Another attempt to turn the jet with a little more stick pressure yielded the same result. We were wings level and climbing away from the ground. I put both hands on the stick and tried to arm wrestle with it. The stick definitely did not want to go right , even when I used both arms , so I decided to try to go to the left . </stick.v.455><stick.v.456>That said; I 'd like to keep Capuano and welcome Turnbow back at the closer role.

This takes some practice , one the stick is stalled , throw one of the hand sticks in the air so it spins vertically a few times and the n catch it and kick the stick back up to yourself. If you can stick with only one hand stick , then purposely act like you could n't catch the hand stick you threw in the air , to make people think you could n't do it. Then smile and say " not a problem " kick the stick up to yourself and start sticking with only one handstick. They 'll get a kick out of it.

This is often mistaken as being a feature of the automatic choke but the problem will occur long after the engine has reached operating temperature. This is usually down to the throttle end of the cable which gets wet in the rain. Some owners have had the throttle body replaced under warranty. some dealers provide a quick fix by putting another turn in the throttle return spring but this extra strain can distort the throttle body and cause the problem to reoccur at a later date . </stick.v.461><stick.v.462>Here I was just talking about content really comics that stick to the page-by-page approach and the underlying assumption that there ' s some design virtue in an upright rectangle.

The right handstick flourish is spun in a clockwise direction , looking down on the handstick. You need to stick your thumb straight up in the air as the handstick spins around it. Also , to get the momentum of the spin , use your wrist not your arm motion. After each flourish you may need to adjust your grip on the handstick because it tends to crawl down the handstick with each spin. It is possible to spin the handstick in both the CW and CCW direction around your thumb. However , I find spinning the stick around the outside edge of the thumb quite a bit easier than spinning it around the inside edge . </stick.v.475><stick.v.476>Once the Post-9/11 G.I.

I don ' t live there because the Richmond definition of loft has almost nothing to do with the New York/New Jersey definition of loft.

When somebody in a domestic violence situation hits a woman so hard that damage-blood and a wound-is caused , make sure that the police charge them with actual bodily harm , because they do not do so at the moment. They charge common assault , because it does not go to the Crown court , so they get a quick guilty plea and a lesser sentence. Very nasty violence is not being dealt with in the courts as it should be due to under-charging. The problem is endemic among police forces in the south-east , as far as I can see. We need to stick to what works , and the Minister should know that I have my doubts about the efficacy of the new domestic violence protection orders . </stick.v.478><stick.v.479>Continue offering your toddler a variety of foods.

Stick the end of the tape roll on the top of the shaft. Then unwind approximately eighteen inches of tape and then spin the tape roll so that it causes the unwound tape to tighten and for a " rope " . Starting at the top wind the " rope " around the shaft of the stick down as far as you like it. This " rope " will provide the grip on the stick shaft. When you get down to the point on the stick shaft where you want to end , then wind tape off the roll over the " rope " all the way back to the top of the shaft. At the top of the shaft create a knob by wrapping tape around the top of the shaft.

A team with a dedicated focus on winning and a drive to accomplish a lot , Red Bull have proved to be the one to watch in the last few seasons , building from success to success and are now really in the hunting for a title in the season looming ahead. I think Christian Horner has been sensible and very mature in sticking by his drivers and stands a very real chance on building on his success in 2010 if , and I say if tentatively , he can overcome his engine reliability issues this season. As yet I have not heard of any change of engine for the Red Bull team , so let ' s hope that the engine they unveil for their 2010 car can lose some of that unreliability that dragged possibly the fastest car on the track in 2009 down. I am also really keen to see what Sebastian Vettel will pull out of the bag when put up against the one and only Michael Schumacher.

The best way to get over a plateau in either case it to shock the body. This means changing you 're routine totally to something different whether it be all new exercises or the number of reps per exercise. You need to wake up the body from the normal stress that it is use to. It is the difference is you 're routine that will do this. For example , if you normally do benchpress and dumbell presses for chest , change up and do enormous sets of benching only and combine with mega-sets of pushups after each set of benchpress. This might sound awkward but it definetly works , try it yourself just once. You 're body will respond because it is something that it is not use to . </stick.v.529><stick.v.530>A life coach is a consultant with only you and your goals in mind.

If the weight is so far away that the magnet can not pull it back up once it is magnetized , adjust the supports to bring it closer. Be careful when adjusting the supports , since they may be quite hot. Also be careful to move the candle so as not to burn yourself on the candle flame.

To understand this you only have to place yourself into the position of the customer who receives the promotional good. If you were offered something that has no benefit or value to you , you would receive it gratefully but you would not keep it in a prominent position. This means that it would not be in a position to remind you of who gave it to you and the intended purpose would be lost.

This is perfectly legal until the first stoppage of play , at which time the goaltender must have one of his teammates bring him a new goaltender ' s stick from the players ' bench.

Other events for which people may decide to design labels for are parties , as this would also give a party a more personalised look . </stick.v.582><stick.v.583>Once thrown , the spike grenade will use its spikes to stick onto whatever it collides with , whether the object is a wall , vehicle , personnel , or otherwise.

It was a game of throwing accuracy designed to improve the boys ' ability to kill small game birds or rabbits. A stick of 6 to 8 inches was carved and decorated with feathers by young boys of the Tribe. The boys would place their sticks at different distances from a line. Numbers or points were awarded to each stick with the closest stick having the smallest score and the farthest stick given the highest score. The boys would stand behind a line then throw a set number of rocks at the sticks. If a rock hit a stick directly , it would make the stick jump and the points for that stick were awarded. The sticks could be laced on the ground or stuck into the ground so one end would stand up. Both methods were used . </stick.v.584><stick.v.585>And to Teebz : I was always told that in hockey , there are pluses and minuses for both righties and lefties. Thus , in an ideal world , kids would start with flat blades and pick their shooting direction. Personal example : I ' m a righty for most applications , including shooting pucks. If I were a lefty hockey shot , I would have better stick control , but as a righty shot ( read : weak hand on butt-end ) , I always felt my wrist shots got higher , quicker , and my passes , crisper. The only given in hockey-handedness is this : if you ' re raising a goalie , figure out his baseball handedness so the catching is consistent . </stick.v.585><stick.v.586>Building Wrap Vinyl is a great choice for covering otherwise difficult surfaces such as concrete , cinder block , brick and stucco.

First of all , gay people as a group are highly educated and very politically active I am not saying all are radical activists- but they vote in huge numbers , know their rights , won ' t hesitate to bring law suits , and know how to apply political pressure. That ' s why the police are going daintily with them to avoid these kinds of headaches. And Mary I tell ya , the LAPD would have a closet full of excedrine headaches if one of these activist got the slightest boo-boo from a cop. Politicans are scared to death of these activist .especially ones who are on the down low.

The Crested Gecko 's 'eyelashes ' and triangular head are perhaps its most distinguishing features. Being semi-arboreal , the Crested Gecko is equipped with sticky pads called 'lamellae ' on each of its toes and the tip of its tail. These lamellae are made up of thousands of microscopic hairs called 'Setae ' , which then divide even further into 'Setules'. These hairs use simple form of molecular attraction called 'Van der Waals ' forces to stick to any surface they come into contact with. The beauty of this design is that the gecko can break the attraction simply by altering the angle of its foot , so it can move effortlessly along vertical surfaces . </stick.v.590><stick.v.591>I was stuck between the fat lady and the little boy with a big wad of chewing gum in his mouth.

Why people like him , Lindbaugh , Hannity , etc. ( and at least D ( bson has an education ) have such followings is beyond me. people are free to think as they wish , but I have trouble with so many people being led like so many lemmings. Perhaps this will be a chance for them to do some independent thinking. For his part , maybe this will give him some time to think over and repent for all of the damage he has done and the people he has hurt.

Early people would thrust a stick , cut to a standard size ( usually about the length of the forearm ) in the ground and then measure the shadow length , usually hand-widths. They knew how many hand-widths corresponded to local noon for their area , so they could predict how much of the day was left before sunset.

I have a bunch of persistent memories from my own childhood ( a giant wooden dragon in the children ' s section of the public library , walking through a tall maze of translucent plastic at an art fair , building forts in the woods , working on a collaborative clay castle-sculpture at a craft show ) which convince me that Sunday ' s memory of building giant structures out of boxes will stick with some of these kids for the rest of their lives.

A cat 's whiskers are roughly as wide as his body -- sort of a natural ruler. The whisker tips are sensitive to pressure. You 'll probably see a cat stick his head in and out of an opening before he puts his body in. He 's judging the width of the opening , and is determining if he can fit into it. An interesting note : cats do n't have a true collar bone , like humans. This allows them to turn and twist their way through very narrow openings . </stick.v.655><stick.v.656>The transition from lunch to a 'wrapping ripping frenzy ' was quite seamless. The next thing I remember , was a house full of screaming kids , young and old. As the ribbons and wrappings were torn asunder , we discovered a trove full of fantastic gifts. I attempted to record the events on a video camera , but the results were nothing short of complete chaos. Looking at the film later , I realized that an unattended static tripod mount could n't possibly capture the chaos that ensued. Next time I 'll stick with standard camera shots. Kim and I ( like everyone else ) , raked in a fair share of loot ( my favorite : An iPod Shuffle engraved with a special message ) . Thank you very much to Santa , and all the others who showered us with gifts.

When you hold it and turn it upright , beads or very small pebbles inside move down the tube , making a wonderful sound , that sounds like rain. Buying rain sticks can be very expensive but here 's a fun and easy way to make them at home. With items you probably already have lying around and lots of imagination , you will have your own decorated rain stick. Your children will love making these and they 're a great homemade gift idea. So when you and your kids are stuck inside on a rainy day , why not try this simple way to make homemade rain sticks ? </stick.v.662><stick.v.663>There are very few ways to diagnose encephalitis other than through the symptoms ( you do n't stick a needle in the head ) .

After sandblasting , you may have to re-tape , then paint. Finally , you must remove and clean the adhesive that will be stuck to the grooves of the raised faces. The Stick-On Guard is applied by pealing the paper backing , pressing firmly onto a clean , dry surface. After sandblasting and/or painting , you simply peel off and throw away the shield , with no adhesive clean-up required . </stick.v.664><stick.v.665>I try not to buy stuff with excessive packaging. I save tissue paper and gift bags to use next year. About a month before the holidays I start saving small boxes to reuse for gift wrapping. Wrapping paper gets recycled , as well as , packaging. I am happy that my kids are getting older and not every toy comes wired to that clear plastic. Old batteries get recycled too , although , we are having less and less of those too because I started to invest in rechargeables. Our tree gets reuse in the spring. We delimb it and use the trunk for our May pole. Food gets eaten ! by us or by our chickens. I save the holiday cards we receive every year to use them the next year for package tags and when the kids were younger I would put tape on the back of them and let them stick them to the walls as part of our decorating . </stick.v.665><stick.v.666>What I do is use the Reimond 's alternate procedure above. I cut the mats first , then cut an even bigger piece of mount board , I place the art on the mount board and mark it 's location. Then I cut a piece of reposition able adhesive slightly bigger than the art and laying it on the mount board in the right spot , I squeegee the glue onto the mount board. It sticks perfectly every time to mat boards and almost always to foam core boards. Then I lay the art onto this glue , put the release paper on top and squeegee the art down onto the glue. Then I remove the release paper and place the finished cut top mat on top in the correct place , the extra glue around the edge of the art holds it there. I trim around the edge of the mat board and everything is automatically done , simply , neatly and with no glue mess. Studying the pictures will explain this procedure easy enough once you also try it out . </stick.v.666><stick.v.667>is it me or did the guy he stick with the glowing blue spider have a sword on his back ? some peeps really blew through the game knocking out all those achievements and skulls in short order ...

The reason the plasma grenade , sticks to vehicles and characters may be due to an ability to sense Body heat and the heat from vehicles engines is most likely what causes it to stick. Since a " dead " wall does n't emit heat , it will; however , stick to the " living " walls of a Flood Hive. One problem with this theory is that it will stick even to exposed skin ( on Grunts , Jackals , or Marines as an example ) even though there is no metal to fuse to - it would be nearly impossible to fuse the grenade to flesh using heat alone . </stick.v.673><stick.v.674>Other than Jack Cafferty , Roland Martin , Suzanne Malveaux , and occasionally Carville and Begala , CNN 's Election Board is the only thing of value , it 's fascinating to watch.

The vantage point I have from my seats in Reliant allows me to see the faces of all the players close up , before and after games. Dunta is one of the guys most fired up and most amped up before a game , and after a loss is the guy who is the most dejected. To me as a fan , that means something. He takes losing personal and as much as I enjoy the game as a fan , I can relate with Dunta because I could see it in his face that he was n't just there collecting a paycheck. You never see him stick around after a loss high fiving fans or signing autographs. Rubbed some people the wrong way , but to me it made me admire him even more. Taking losses personally is a healthy thing , folks. Football is just as much emotion and determination as it is skills and X 's and O's.

Gyllenhaal turns in a solid performance as well , although he seems to be reprising essentially the same brooding , alienated outsider role that he 's already played several times now , most recently in the sadly overlooked Donnie Darko. The smaller roles taken by the likes of Reilly , Nelson and Zooey Deschanel ( as an off-kilter Retail Rodeo co-worker ) are the best things about the movie. None of the parts are large enough to really stick in our minds , however , and consequentially do n't make much of a difference . </stick.v.689><stick.v.690>Henderson said : " AP will ride whatever Barry does n't in the Champion.

Does my dog , operating in an integrated mental state , have a voice in his head that he thinks of as his guardian angel , telling him don ' t stick your head in there because last time you almost got stuck , or some such thing ? This is what Jaynes proposes and that civilizations from even a few thousand years ago were still built by human beings who acted in that integrated mindset , reporting any important decisions for action that were actually based upon memory or intuition to be advice from the gods . </stick.v.692><stick.v.693>EZ Stick is the cost-effective alternative to double-sided tapes , liquids and hot melt adhesives.

I am a sucker for stories that focus on voodoo and I commend Lori for going the non-traditional route and including a delightfully different supernatural story , unlike most fantasies today that pretty much stick to the European version of supernatural mythology.

The first condition that must be met is the metal must be lower than the freezing point ( 0C , 32F ) . The lower the temperature , the faster and stronger your tongue will stick. Metal has , what is called , high thermal conductivity. This means it transfers temperatures very fast. The thermal conductivity of your tongue and the water in your saliva is much less than the metal. This means , when you touch the metal with your tongue , the temperature of the metal quickly transfers to the moisture on your tongue , freezing it faster than your body can warm it up again. Because your body can not transfer heat faster than the metal , your tongue stays frozen unless the metal is warmed up through another source . </stick.v.706><stick.v.707>Snow can also build up on a dog 's ears , tail , and belly.

The new notes ' sticking ability is the result of years of research and testing. To ensure its reliability , the new adhesive was tested on doors , windows and cardboard pizza boxes and left for days. Not only do the new Super Sticky notes stay put; when they are finally removed , they still leave no scars or tears on anything they are adhered to. This no-residue aspect was particularly crucial . </stick.v.719><stick.v.720>*Taking a few seconds to scuff ( make lots of tiny scratches on ) the smooth plastic where the glue will stick helps the glue stick better. This is particularly true of the plastic ends. Use any scrap of sandpaper. Or just take a bit of gritty soil and rub it where the glue will go. A common complaint of plastic windows is that they scratch much easier than glass -- but that 's an advantage when you 're trying to get hot glue to stick . </stick.v.720><stick.v.721>Support a Catholic Speaker Month : Raymond Arroyo The term Renaissance Man is coined for many , rather flippantly , I am afraid.

Against one end of the toggle stick the bait stick is placed so that its farthest end presses against the lowest cross bar.

Do n't confuse this with the " logical " 4-way operation of some 4-8 sticks with a reversible bush. When used in 4-way mode the bush on some types is designed to prevent two switches from being operated together in the corner positions. This does n't really have any benefit in MAME anyway and has nothing to do with the feel of a real 4-way stick , which is a mechanical issue rather than electronic. In an original Pac-Man machine , for example , you would always find a proper 4-way stick with a restrictor plate so you can slide the stick across the diagonals rather than get stuck in the corners. All these 4 sticks are capable of reproducing this feel as they physically prevent the stick from being moved into the corners when in 4-way mode . </stick.v.737><stick.v.738>Black cast iron skillets were the original non-stick frying pans.

Youth in Revolt is filled with scenes featuring the destruction of property and disrespect for the establishment and authority figures , and it has a rebellious lead that will have you laughing along with his quest for a tomato to stick his filthy dick into ( which will make more sense once you ' ve seen the movie ) but is it enough to make this a classic of the teenage rebellion genre ? </stick.v.747><stick.v.748>D.

I have been able to use the extra weight to get my sticks to do things that I could never do with my lightweight flower sticks. In addition , the middle tape marker on the main stick has been incredibly useful. I think that half my problem with my other sticks was that I was hitting them off center and hence throwing them off; the middle marker has certainly improved my aim !

If your primary focus is on skinny water , though , the options for anchoring your boat have in the past ten years especially improved dramatically. The change has come in the form of what we call stick anchors . The reason we call them stick anchors is very simple; they ' re sticks that hold the boat in skinny water without the need to drop that big heavy piece of metal off the side of your boat.

He is awful defenseively , hits with no power , little speed and an abysmal OB .

The reason this works is because with the puck at the mid-point , you can accelerate it quicker since the middle of the stick is moving through the water faster than the stick location next to your knuckle.

The basic necessities are a hot glue gun , clear glue sticks , colored glue sticks an any type of embellishment or stamp you prefer to use. A heat resistant surface is also necessary , as well as some type of release agent. I tend to use a large ceramic tile , tap the top if it with a clear embossing pad , then squeeze a puddle of melted glue onto the tile. Embellish as desired , let cool , then peel it off the ceramic tile.

We don ' t need government to recognize marriage at all , but that ' s a difficult point to get across : But his roommate just simply could not see it. She could not understand that a marriage could be a marriage without a license from the government. She could not understand that society doesn ' t require government to stick its grubby fingers into every one of our institutions to give them some sort of legitimacy.

I use standard-thread 4 1/2 " galvanized bolts and 1/2 " flat washers , lock washers , and nuts that go with them -- -common items at the hardware store. The door and batts add up to 3 " of thickness , so 3.75 " or 4 " bolts work out perfectly because the washers and nuts also take up space on the bolt. For a sizable door ( eg. 44 " X 80 " ) , the nuts and bolts will total 12-13 pounds ! Before painting them with metal spray paint ( I recommend " Rustoleum " ) , I soak them for a minute in Jasco metal-etching solution so the paint will stick better. It 's cheap and available at most paint stores. Some people use vinegar , but I 've found it 's not very effective in preventing paint from peeling off over time.

Apparently , GGYC has enough confidence in its grammatical and statutory construction arguments that it does not employ the fall back argument of the existence of contemporary evidence which was not considered , because no one argued that the language was ambiguous , which should be considered on a remand if the Court of Appeals agrees that " having " is ambiguous. Instead it argues that the Appellate Division , " inexplicably ignored key extrinsic evidence of the settlor 's intent " that nobody brought to the Appellate Division 's attention.

When a piece of bamboo has been badly broken it will probably be a splintery split rather than a clean break. A wooden rod or dowel inserted through the Huddle of the bamboo will strengthen it so that you can tidy up the break and stick the splinters down again ( see Fig. 4 ) . The hollow bamboo is blocked at each ring and a hole will have to be bored right through so that the dowel can pass along. If you don ' t possess a long enough bit , a red-hot iron or steel rod will burn a hole through , but be careful not to set die whole thing alight . </stick.v.1072><stick.v.1073>Well , let ' s see If Obama loses it will be because of racism and/or voter fraud.

If the cake is left longer than that time , condensation will develop between the bottom crust of the cake and the interior bottom of the hot pan , which will moisten the crust of the cake and will cause the cake to stick to the pan , defeating the purpose of using a non-stick spray. Another thing to consider when using a non-stick spray is that during baking , the edge of the side of the cake will become a little deformed : lopsided.

Corrosion increases the dimensions of the part , thereby reducing the valve stem-to-guide clearance. The high stem temperatures , combined with a design which allows more combustion products into the guide bore , create a corrosive environment which is seldom seen on Continental engines. Lycoming TIO-541 engines installed in the Beechcraft Duke use an oil-cooled exhaust guide. Cooling oil circulates in a groove between the exhaust guide and the guide boss. If this groove cokes up with oxidized oil and becomes blocked , the exhaust guide and valve overheat and stick. If you have a stuck exhaust guide on this engine , be sure to check the oil passage by blowing compressed air through the oil fitting in the cylinder head. Proper valve guide cooling , valve rotators , proper metering of oil through close valve-to-guide clearances are engineering elements which reduce the tendency for valve sticking . </stick.v.1134><stick.v.1135>Sorry.

The problem , of course , is that he has changed over a dozen positions in the last couple of years - certainly within the time he began eyeing a run for the presidency. Sorry Romney suporters , but the flip-flop label will stick because he not only has conveniently changed a huge number of his policy positions to mirror the policy preferences of the majority of GOP delegates , but he has done it in such a reckless and sloppy manner that you have to question either his intelligence or the quality of his campaign handlers . </stick.v.1178><stick.v.1179>Frankly I happy to see VP Cheney out there.

Instead I 'd recommend using the surgical tubing on only one layer ( the outermost door layer is the easiest one to get right ) and use plastic V seal tape around all 4 door edges on each layer. You can buy this V tape at Home Depot - it is self-adhesive and comes in a flat roll - you 'll find it with weather stripping. You cut it to size , fold it into a V and stick it onto the door frame using the self-adhesive half - allow for about 1/8th inch ( ~2mm ) clearance on each side of the door for the tape. I also used regular weather stripping draft excluder around the inner frame of the jamb - like you would on the inside frame of an exterior door.

The latex material will not deteriorate when being chewed and while not intended to be ingested , it is constructed of non-toxic material and is not harmful if swallowed. The latex chewing material will not stick to any surface or any other item. The material is not water soluble and is sugar free and salt free. Use of the latex chewing material or item will assist in keeping the teeth clean , promote healthy conditions of the teeth and gum by massaging the gums and providing exercise normally associated with mastication. In addition , the use of the latex chewing material will enhance the overall health and hygiene of the oral cavity by stimulating saliva secretions thereby decreasing the potential for bad breath . </stick.v.1216><stick.v.1217>People have known about electricity for thousands of years.

If the door is not hanged off the door off the fixed panel you want to install the fixed panel as a Dry-set panel. You install the U channel the same for both types of installations. On the Dry-set you put your setting block in the channel so that the glass is not setting on the metal , and then put the panel in place. There is no silicone inside the the channel ( Dry-set ) . With this type of install you can make minor adjustment to the panel after your door is installed. With the panel just setting in the channel it will probably rattle. Do n't worry about this because the final seal will make everything solid. After everything is perfect you want to seal the fixed panels as shown below. Make sure that the glass , tile and U channel are clean and dry. If you are sealing the panels with clear silicone ( recommended ) you will be able to see anything you cover up.

West Brom , Boro and Hull have stuck with their managers and are really making the best of it but just are n't good enough. Hull made a great start but were always going to suffer towards the end of the season owing to their small squad. The stark reality of the Toon is that they are just a basket case even though I will support them to my dying day. However whether they stay up or do down , if they stick with Shearer ( and he decides to stay ) , long term stability might just begin to turn this great club in the right direction. West Brom , Hull and Boro have what appear to be good managers too so the bottom line IMO is resources.

Each tiny horseshoe magnet has a north pole and a south pole. They are lined up to form stripes of magnetism. The stripes alternate , north pole , south pole , north pole , south pole , etc. That is why two magnetic sides stick to each other. The north stripes stick to the south stripes on the other magnet. The " other side " is like the back side of a horseshoe magnet. It does not have much of a magnetic field , so it does not stick to the refrigerator. As you slide one magnet across the other , the stripes alternately attract and repel each other , so it jumps and sticks , jumps and sticks.

There are one or two small points of differ- ence. The edges of broken glass are very smooth and some roughing up with a diamond scratcher will give the adhesive a better key. Gum strip is used to put tension across the joins as described in the section on sticking china. This is very important when mending glass as a very tight fit is essential to ensure adhesion. When the adhesive leas set , surplus which has squeezed out is removed by rubbing it down with steel wool , not glass paper as this would scratch the glass.

The walking sticks are then sanded and re-sanded , polished , and then coated with a minimum of five coats of urethane , with more sanding between each coat. This treatment highlights the natural diamonds which give these walking sticks their beautiful appearance. A copper ring is also added to the tip of each walking stick to prevent splitting and adds to the durability of each walking stick.

If the old wallpaper is vinyl , you will probably need to use vinyl-to-vinyl paste on the back of the paper , even if it is prepasted , to make sure it 'll stick and remain stuck. And for that , see the question and answer below about pasting prepasted paper. Think of removing wallpaper as building character and stamina.

They are attempting to change what had become the new balance of power in lacrosse. The lack of stick specifications as they had been made for a game that in fact tilted the field decidedly in a direction that favored the player carrying the ball , or the offense , as if the game doesn ' t already give the offensive player enough advantage. They wanted to make it more possible for a defender to knock the ball out of the stick. The rule changers surely took note of the fact that great checks by great defensemen were going unrewarded.

Absolutely wicked experience - the views over Lantau and the airport were brilliant. Got a bit rocky and blowy at certain high points but i beat the queues and had a car to myself.

Chewing gums are provided with various flavoring agents , sugar in some instances , and other additives to enhance the taste and other characteristics. However , the basic ingredients of chewing gum include chicle and other insoluble materials which , after being chewed , are quite sticky which causes a disposal problem. Chewing gum that has been chewed is frequently disposed of by placement under ledges and other downwardly exposed surfaces which creates an unsightly and unhealthy condition. If previously chewed gum is disposed of on a sidewalk , street or similar surface , it frequently will stick to the shoesoles of a person walking in that area and thus can be tracked onto floor surfaces , carpets and the like. Also , the natural material forming the basic ingredients of chewing gum and the additives incorporated therein are , in some instances , believed to be the cause of increased incidences of dental caries . </stick.v.1366><stick.v.1367>Joe didn ' t try and make Ben stick around for less money.

Tell the students that there is only one common kind of metal that magnets stick to ~ metal iron. Sometimes iron is mixed with other metals to make steel.

The remaining deposits push the valve over to the opposite side of the guide and cause rapid , uneven guide wear. The valve stem may stick or it may cause rapid guide wear where the stem is forced against the guide material opposite of the deposit buildup. Each time the rocker arm tries to open that stuck valve , you risk catastrophic engine damage. The rocker arm tries to push the valve open. With a stuck valve , the valve does n't want to move. Tremendous valve train forces develop as the camshaft lobe tries to force the valve open. When operating normally , the highest loaded surfaces in the engine are the camshaft follower and lobe , and additional loading may induce failure. Damage to these surfaces occurs because of increased loading caused by the stuck valve. A damaged camshaft lobe requires complete engine removal and disassembly. The camshaft lobe pushes the cam follower up , the cam follower pushes on the push rod , the push rod pushes on the rocker arm and the rocker arm pushes against a valve which will not open . </stick.v.1383><stick.v.1384>When you rub a balloon against your clothes and it sticks to the wall , you are adding a surplus of electrons ( negative charges ) to the surface of the balloon.

Since Purdue we have gone backwards. The big mistakes and sloppy play are inexcusable BUT , you all need to reset your expectations. Not for ND football overall , but for this year. I called 7-5 this year , and its still what I expect. I am a lot less pissed than most ND fans I know bc I expected it. Why ? bc teams just don ' t go from 3-9 to 9-3 in a year very often. Especially not when all the leadership ad talent comes from Frosh and Sophomores. After purude I leaned toward 8-4 , but stuck with 7-5. After last night I lean to 6-6 , but stick with 7-5. Turarounds take time. The mistakes last night on offense , and the up ad down character of this team overall this season , are largely a function of it being a young team.

Since I had the iron and plastic wrap already out ( I do n't use freezer paper , but plastic wrap and cheap butcher paper ) I decided to do some more tissue paper.

There were narrow places between each strip that were n't covered , so I used a glitter pen to make stripes between the ribbon strips ... nice ! Then I found some fairly large scraps of satin fabric that I bonded. It took quite a bit more heat to get it to stick , but worked great.

We adopted the " what sticks " terminology from one of our favorite authors , Malcolm Gladwell.

Why did Hush Puppies experience a rebirth ? Why did crime rates abruptly plummet in New York City ? Why did the book Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood catch on ? The Tipping Point has three sections. The first addresses the need to get the right people , and the third addresses the need for the right context. The middle section of the book , " The Stickiness Factor , " argues that innovations are more likely to tip when they 're sticky.

This could mean that the Plasma grenade can not stick to a high level electrical pulses , such as the ones that are in Jackal Gauntlets , but have sufficient energy to stick to low to medium power energy shields as well as vehicles.

Do this with each screw head that is rounded out and remove the cover or whatever part the screw is holding on. Now you will see the shaft of the screw sticking out.

Deadlines , pressure and inflexible insistence on the letter of agreement simply don ' t work in Sudan. The US line was that there could be no renegotiation of the DPA : not one word could be changed. For Majzoub , the text was only as good as the political pressure to stick to it and he was ready to reinterpret any provision he liked whenever he liked. Overwhelmingly , the Darfurians wanted it changed. Minawi had the most riding on the agreement : if Abdel Wahid got some extra concessions , his earlier signature would look foolish. But he too was unhappy and increasingly isolated , and publicly announced on 15 May that he was working with his ' brothers in the SLM ' to improve the text.

Measuring fuel economy in terms of carbon dioxide rather than mileage has many advantages as it makes no prescription concerning fuel or technologies , so we will stick to measuring fuel economy like that.

I am probably being too hard on myself , I will be happy if a handful of people use it , blogging isn ' t for everyone but we shall see if it sticks . </stick.v.1601><stick.v.1602>Given its young-male appeal , the edge has to go to ''Stuck on You , '' the latest comedy from the Farrelly Brothers , featuring Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as conjoined twins who have excellent adventures in Hollywood.

Using the widest measurement , allow an extra 25mm for turning on to the next wall. Cut a length of paper to this width , reserving the off-cut for papering the first length of the adjoining wall. Paste and hang the length , butting the paper to the edge of the previous strip. Align the pattern at eye level and allow the extra 25mm to stick lightly to the next wall. Use a paper-hanging brush to smooth the paper into the internal corner . </stick.v.1622><stick.v.1623>For cyclists the best paster setup we have seen is a hand made oversized pannier on the back filled with posters and the bucket and brush in a handlebar basket. The paste has a chance of spilling when the lid is off but a plastic shopping bag conceals and protects it from the eyes of the cops and catches the spillage. You will have to learn how to balance the handlebars , grab a poster , paste up the wall , and stick it up without making a huge mess , but once you get it down you will be unstoppable ! </stick.v.1623><stick.v.1624>Hockey sticks come as either 1 piece sticks with the blade permanently fused to the shaft , or as 2 piece sticks where the blade and shaft come as separate pieces.The advantage of a one piece hockey stick is that you do n't have to assemble it , it is ready to go right from the hockey shop.

And I just tell people that she has been good for this district. She has helped to bring a tremendous amount of resources here. And I think people respect that , Mr. Towns said.

Which is fine by me. Its one of those records you never mind hearing. And it 's one of those records that 's succeeded in sticking around. Like Chris Rea 's Driving Home For Christmas. Bit of a flop on first release , but it 's stuck around. It 's hard to pinpoint why some records stick around and some - more dazzling in their day - don't. A good example is The La 's There She Goes : not much of a hit in its day but it stuck around in a way the much-more-talked-about contemporaries The Stone Roses never did . </stick.v.1629><stick.v.1630>Although we went to school together my clearest memories are from our days together at St Albans City Youth.

I did the easiest bit , which was to give the wall a good clean wipe. YinLeng then started on sticking the main branch. The squeegees given to press the decal against the transfer paper were hard paper cards , which weren ' t really sturdy enough , and we didn ' t find them particularly useful for the application. We decided to use my ALL-IT Hypermarket member card and an RHB bank card instead. Applying the decals didn ' t seem as straightforward as it should have to us as we were extremely vary of air bubbles , sticking it incorrectly , pulling the transfer paper incorrectly etc. In truth , you don ' t need a very steep learning curve to do it as we found out after having stuck on several pieces of the decal. It becomes somewhat intuitive after a while and we were well on our way to getting the entire Sakura tree stuck up on the wall . </stick.v.1638><stick.v.1639>That scene out of the popular holiday movie , A Christmas Story , is no fiction. If it is cold enough outside and you lick a metal pole , your tongue will stick to it.

Just last year , in Hammond , IN , the fire department and police department had to be called in to free a boy who foolishly decided to test the theory. The year before , a young girl had the same problem. Many more incidents go unreported. I have to admit , I ' ve tested the theory myself but was able to pull myself free after a scary 10 seconds of being stuck.

I also believe we have n't heard the last from Sinorice Moss - I think he can contribute if given a chance. He can get open because of his quickness - he gets seperation from the DB.

Now gently place a strong magnet on the side of the cup. It should stick to the side as it attracts the ore. The ore should become quite stiff.

That is likely , since the parties behind the bill -- the United New Democratic , Grand National and Democratic Labor parties -- have a comfortable margin of seats.

Across-the-board training is required for the medical profession , professions allied to medicine and those involved in social care , because no one can be sure when they will be the one who will be accountable for a dying patient. The wrong words can stick like a cracked record in the minds of grieving relatives for years afterwards , not to speak of the hurt that the patient may take to the grave.

Plan your lunch and main meals carefully , that way you can make the most of seasonal foods which are less expensive and you also get a feel for your grocery bill before you head out shopping. The added advantage of this method is that you are likely to stick to you grocery budget and be less tempted to impulse buy additional food items or opt for unnecessary offers. The more times you plan your meals the more recipe variations or meal ideas you will generate.

A manual activation via a small button or a stimulated activation , such as another explosion or gunfire , will set the detonator and start the countdown. Delayed activation can also set the detonator after it either sticks to a target or otherwise comes to a rest. It is possible to tell if the grenade has been activated. A densely small and bright cloud of plasma emission will leak around the grenade as the explosive reaction takes place inside. This cloud will gradually grow to a larger diameter after each second of the countdown. A low sound is emitted by the grenade when activated , followed by two rapid beeps and a high-pitched whine just nanoseconds before the explosion. This is the plasma grenade 's standard process of detonation . </stick.v.1691><stick.v.1692>Hornby 's stalking-horse , Rob Fleming -- a bright-not-brilliant university dropout whose Championship Vinyl deals " punk , blues , soul , and R &amp;B , a bit of ska , some indie stuff , some sixties pop -- everything for the serious record collector , as the ironically old-fashioned writing in the window says " -- does n't have big enough ears to suit me.

The exceptions say something for him -- whatever his limitations , Rob Fleming listens more adventurously than the soul stick-in-the-mud Frith is n't alone in painting him as. But even if Fleming were a pop polymath he 'd be stuck in the same developmental cul-de-sac.

The best advice I got was from the Frugal Gourmet ( aka the anal retentive chef ) . Clean your skillet any way you choose ( I used a drill with a wire brush attachment on some of the nastier pieces ) . Heat it on the stove on high until very hot. Pour a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil ( or bacon grease if you have any-reduce , reuse , recycle ! ) into the pan and swirl it around. It will smoke so have an open window or dash outside to avoid setting off fire alarms. Let it cool so you can pour and wipe out the residue. Repeat twice and you will have a bomb-proof skillet. The only time you may need to re-season is if you often cook with very acidic foods like tomatoes. Even when food does end up sticking I can soak it in hot water , scrub it with a brush ( NO SOAP ) and it comes clean.

I cut out a template 18mm wide from plastic scrap and used this to make sure the sides of the ladders stayed parallel and laid the ladders on a flat surface to set.

To preserved the molded details , the ink maker place the ink sticks onto the thick layer of white ash , the by product of the extraction of the soot. The ash yields enough to preserve the molded details , but the ink stick will bend or sag. Therefore virtually at daily intervals the ink sticks are turn over to counteract the bend. They are usually kept on separate drying trays , held suspended , with good ventilation. No heat is applied , and they let nature take its course. This process takes a few weeks.

The reason the Plasma Grenade sticks to vehicles and characters may be due to an ability to sense body heat and the heat from vehicles ' engines. Since a " dead " wall does n't emit heat , it will , however , stick to the " living " walls of a Flood Hive. One problem with this theory is that it will stick even to exposed skin ( on Grunts , Jackals , or Marines as an example ) even though there is no metal to fuse to - it would be nearly impossible to fuse the grenade to flesh using heat alone . </stick.v.1818><stick.v.1819>Steven Taylor : Earlier in the week I wrote that it seemed to me that many boosters of the war have made General David Petraeus into some sort of magic general who , if we would just stick with him , will lead us to victory in Iraq ...

It was the day after a cold front had moved through and the day 's forecast was for mostly sunny , highs in the upper 70 's and wind 5-10 mph. The wind certainly was higher with wind gusts over 30 and large rollers out on the broads. With the combination of the waves from the high wind and the heavy weekend boat traffic we ended up with a couple of broken boats by the end of the day. Still all 63 anglers came in by the 3 : 30 return time to weigh-in their catch.

Luckily , new types of adhesive have been invented which will literally stick anything to anything. The strength of the stuck joints is also very important , and modern adhesives are so efficient that stuck joins can actually be stronger than any other kind of jour , and where , in the old days the glueing of joins of all kinds was used in conjunction with other fixing methods , dowelling etc. , sticking alone is nowadays often sufficiently strong. Adhesives have become so strong as well as water and heat resistant , that it is really no longer necessary to rivet ceramics , and almost totally invisible stuck joints can be made in china. Adhesives mixed with colouring matters , pigments and powders , are used as Hers , thus becoming dual purpose materials ( see under Cements and Fillers ) . Most modern adhesives have many uses and will stick a very wide variety of substances , but some are better than others for particular kinds of work . </stick.v.1822><stick.v.1823>But around a week later , the opening of the head of my penis started to stick to my underwear.

As such the western media keep misrepresenting the views of the majority of South Africans.In subsequent elections since 1994 , the western media has always predicted a reduced majority for the ANC. Again and agin they have been proven wrong. Wonder why ? Because they always get views of the minority white community.The reason blacks stick with the ANC is because they feel the ANC is delivering.

But other criteria also come to bear. Sexual preference , obviously -- the disco world , a rock subculture even if the schism it embodies seems absolute to all but a few ins and outs , is almost as gay as Rob 's is het. But a subtler factor counts for more here -- the way congruent romantic structures stick together. Partly this is just social convenience -- couples mix more easily with couples , singles with singles. But it 's also about character formation. In or out of relationships , swingers feel stifled by committed monogamists , who reciprocate by half-consciously concluding that a roving eye signifies feckless or creepy.

Then he set up Randolph for a three point play , dished to Ewing for a couple of threes and a later basket on a cut , and even got struggling Shelden Williams an easy hoop. Chris also stuck a 10 ' jumper and hit a late three that started a run that gave Duke a huge advantage towards the end of the first half. Amazingly , he played through his wrist injury and played well for a while , but the pain of the injury started to show in the second half when he started missing easy shots. Going just 1-5 from three clearly frustrated him despite the other positive things he was accomplishing , probably because he knows he needs to become a more consistent scorer this year. The other negative is that every now and then Chris is careless with the ball -- he bounced one ball off of his foot and out of bounds.

Wall decals will stick to these surfaces. When applying lettering it can be a little fiddly. Often the letters will want to remain with the backing paper they are supplied with , rather than attaching to the wall. To fix , you will need to hold the decal onto the wall as you remove the supporting backing paper. Once the backing paper is removed , then you can press the design into the wall. It will stay on the wall. Because of the texture , you can sometimes lift the decal off and reposition before firmly pressing into wall . </stick.v.1958><stick.v.1959>Things that should be considered when pricing a woman ' s lacrosse stick are : Number one , the player ' s age and ability.

Some sticks are more flexible in the head and may not be proper for a defender. Whereas other sticks may be offset more and will provide more accuracy and shooting power. Number three , how much dedication the player has to the sport.

If Fifa so wished it could use the video referees only for world cup qualification and finals games. This would limit the logistics needed for lower grade games.

Note that the label is sticking to the paint and not to the metal ! Certain polyolefins ( such as polypropylene or polyethylene ) have a very low surface energy ( 20-30 dynes ) and they require a much softer adhesive. The softer adhesives will stick well , yet give you a much lower ultimate shear strength. Teflon is another plastic with a low surface energy ( 18 dynes ) and , understandably , it is difficult to develop an adhesive to stick to it . </stick.v.2054><stick.v.2055>pogo ... ..thanks for the melancon guitar link ... ..it is indeed a pretty instrument ... ...

It has a three-second fuse that counts down at the point of activation. A manual activation via a small button or a stimulated activation , such as another explosion or gunfire , will set the detonator and start the countdown. Delayed activation can also set the detonator after it either sticks to a target or otherwise comes to a rest. It is possible to tell if the grenade has been activated. A densely small and bright cloud of plasma emission will leak around the grenade as the explosive reaction takes place inside. This cloud will gradually grow to a larger diameter after each second of the countdown. A low sound is emitted by the grenade when activated , followed by two rapid beeps and a high-pitched whine just seconds before the explosion.

Abrading the surface will allow a label to stick even to a transformer having Teflon flow agents in the paint. Also , consider using a premask. This is a very easy and inexpensive step that ensures that you can apply the label without bubbles. The premask allows you to put a great deal of pressure on the label with a hard squeegee and still not mar the surface.

Not much equipment is needed , just a clear quart-size glass jar and some cuttings from your favorite rose. For you modern sodapop lovers , a 2-liter plastic bottle with the bottom cut off will work just as well. Cut a piece of rose stem about 6 inches long , remove the bottom set of leaves , and just stick the stem into the ground ( or into a pot ) a couple inches deep , and cover with a jar or bottle. You will need to periodically water the soil around the jar , otherwise the rose stem will dry out. It will take a couple of months for the rose stem to take root and begin leafing out with its new growth. The best time of year is spring or early fall. If you live in a mild climate , then winter and summer can also be successful for rooting roses. Intense summer heat of 100 degrees is not conducive for taking cuttings , nor are 32 degree or below winters . </stick.v.2184><stick.v.2185>No matter how it is distributed , the client will take it home and stick it in a prominent place.

And when it 's ready to be returned to the wild , I will take some photos and stick it on this page in the hope that somebody , somewhere , will realise it 's just what they have always wanted. Of course some sticks are , sadly , beyond help. But even these have their uses to a stickmaker. A stick with half a broken handle may still have a nice , usable malacca , ebony , mahogany or rosewood shank; one with a broken shank may have a good horn handle or silver knob. A downright badly-made stick might still yield a useful piece of antler or horn to make something completely different.

It has been interesting to hear Government members say that part of what they are trying to achieve here is to encourage a bit of shifting between different retailers. They are going to encourage consumers to shop around , particularly through an annual $ 5 million contestable fund , levy-funded to facilitate switching between retailers. I had to ask somebody recently what retailer I would be with if I had never changed since Southpower stopped selling electricity in Christchurch. They said that I would be with Meridian Energy. Meridian Energy is my power company because I , like most New Zealanders , am the target of any sort of programme that requires people to do nothing. That is what most people do.

Sticks range in flexibility from medium to extra stiff. The adult player is better off at the flexible end of this spectrum as it make hitting an effective slap shot much easier. This is because the flex of the stick will allow more margin for error in striking the ice behind the puck and the stick " whip " will propel the puck with minimal effort.

You might need another nail 6 to 12 inches above or below that spot.

Born with hardly any , grow older , become a hippy , then as the hair falls out your head it seems to stick and take root in your back , chest , rear end , ears , nose and any other place that hair doesn ' t seem so appealing. Why does nose hair have to grow so long , when I was younger it didn ' t grow outside of the confines of my nostrils , now it ' s trying to see the light. Fortunately I ' m young enough to notice this and get the buggers before they escape , but once a certain age is reached , it seems acceptable for them to flow and even join together across the filtrum , like a nasal beard. Ear hair is another thing that ' s not high in the I find attractive list by women , but yet it still gives it some effort from some people , oblivious to the bonsai garden erupting from their wing-nuts.

You do n't want to press down too hard , or it will make a gluey mess , just a light gliding of the stick is all that is needed. I can see the purple on the surface I desire to glue , so I know where I 've applied the glue. The thing is , this stuff dries super fast ! The purple starts to disappear almost instantly. So I end up reapplying to those areas , wondering if it is still sticky enough. From what I have noticed , if you do n't see the purple when you 're ready to attach the item to something else , it wo n't stick well. I find that I must put more glue on one spot than I would have guessed in order to get the desired adhesive qualities. This is somewhat disappointing , and seems a bit wasteful. I do n't use it for photos anymore , I use regular Elmer 's white squeeze glue.

It 's great for ultra fast drying gluing if you can get the blob of glue onto your embellishment and stick it immediately - and I mean immediately ! There is no time for any re-consideration of the placement of your embellishment - know where you want it to go and stick - NOW. It 's no good for a line of glue , such as on a pipe-cleaner , as the glue will have set before you 've finished applying it. No good for hard metal items such as coins as the coldness of the metal makes the glue set before you 've had time to place it.

What you say in your information section is totally correct they are a hybrid of the two , kinda a mix. I love it ! Regular devil sticks ( with the tapered ends ) are so much heavier and really require a completely different method of sticking. When learning them I was very frustrated , but stuck through it. After becoming proficient with them I found myself going back to other designs such as yours. I ordered a pair of customized ( AWESOME Option ) Premium Design sticks and LOVE them. The rubber handles are incredible; I always hated how sweaty my hands got after sticking for long periods of time.

Be careful not to wrap it too tight because some 13mm motor are fatter than others. Also be careful not to glue the motor tube to the casing. Cut another strip of index card 0.75 " x 3 " . Make two lines across the card one inch apart. Cut off on end on the line. The result should be 0.75 " x 2 " piece of index card with a line down the middle shortwise. Glue the two left over pieces of popsicle stick to the index card with the end against the line. Do n't worry that a part of the sticks will stick out over the end of the index card.

The edge will be inline with the rotation of the knife so damage is minimal. A side effect of this grip is that depending on how far the blade tip goes past the base of your thumb , you can easily vary the distance of one rotation. For the beginner this is disaster , but to a more experienced thrower it opens new doors. Often at competitions the given distances are varied ( especially when the competition is designed by sadists. ) Adjusting your grip along the blade to vary rotation distance is your key to sticking the knife. This requires a degree of familiarity with yourself and the knife not often seen in SCA competition. If this not only sounds like a challenge but a cheap attempt to raise the standards here in the East , I 'm glad you were paying attention . </stick.v.2360><stick.v.2361>The directions for the use of this product are as follows. You take the reposition able glue paper and place your art on top of it. Then you place a sheet of release paper over the picture and squeegee over the art using the squeegee tool and this forces the glue to stick to the backside of your art. Then you slowly peel your art away from the paper containing the glue and the glue should remain stuck to you art. After you remove the art from the sheet of reposition able tissue , place it onto the mount board. Then again placing the release paper over the art , you press the art onto the mount board. Sometimes photographs were not done using this method very often because when the photo was lifted off the tissue , many times there would be spots left on the photo where the glue did not stick to it. This could cause a bubble later. The glue on the reposition able paper gets stronger as is sets up . </stick.v.2361><stick.v.2362>Visit sites which will stick your identity on their page once you land on it.

It ' s not complicated , but the system requires memorization. After you make the hand signs your ninja starts charging their chakra. A little meter over their head indicates how strong the attack is going to be. If you hold down the L trigger the attack can power up three times at the expense of more chakra and time.

This is a common thought process shared by many anglers and manufacturers , but it has it ' s limits. I ' m going to recommend you do the complete opposite and get a stout leader. Trout are spooky part of the time , but they can also be quite aggressive. They often chase down and devour good sized prey , even on small creeks. Sometimes the smallest of flies is in order and sometimes large streamers are the choice of the day. A person can unknowingly limit themselves by sticking to small flies and light leaders.

It can not be used around corners well , as it does not bounce , nor does it roll. A player wearing a fully charged Overshield may be capable of surviving the blast even when stuck. Also , if a smart enemy is stuck when they are too close they can simply run toward you to catch you in the blast zone. In Halo 2 and Halo 3 , a primed plasma grenade in flight can be detonated mid-air by another explosion. Weapons capable of this include the Rocket Launcher , Brute Shot , Missile Pod , Frag Grenades , other Plasma Grenades. The Plasma Grenade will not stick to certain types of armor such as that of a scarab or a Brute Chieftain's. When thrown at them , the grenade will fall to their feet , and they will probably notice it and move out of the blast radius. Ballistic or explosive weapons such as a shotgun or brute shot will remove the plating allowing the grenade to stick . </stick.v.2529><stick.v.2530>" I bet he Apparated someplace far away , " Albus replied , " He 's not going to want to stick around and get caught.

The truth is that that Second Life , while being largely for entertainment purposes , has a lot more to offer its so-called residents.

But the vast majority of criminal defendants do n't have a prayer of winning a diminished responsility case , and , in any event , most defendants , unlike prosecutors , do n't have the resources to bring in a parade of charlatans and hired guns.

You don ' t want to change your look too drastically because then your customers won ' t be able to identify you as easily , he says. It is important to create brand recognition and loyalty. Wickham contends that his label has evolved over time as well , but he stuck with the same image. Our logo is associated with the name of our village , Tularosa. People associate Tularosa with roses even though that ' s not technically correct. Originally , we had a big rose on the label , but later we wanted to subdue that and make it a bit more upscale looking. We went with an artist who made the first two letters of the words ' Tularosa ' and ' Vineyards ' with an entwined rose that went around them. Then we wanted to make it a bit more eye-catching , so we decided to change the gold ink used for the lettering to foil. Foil reflects a little bit of light.

The typical greasing and/or flour technique may produce a gummy layer; the grease and flour does n't cook well and the batter may stick to the pan.

Another way is to set an electricity bill target ( say , £ 100 below the average ) and tell staff that anything charged below that will go into their tip pot - win win !

You might in fact sense derision or scoffing ... or in fact outright cynicism. Dear friend , if you are a newer acquaintance of the stock market you would indeed believe it is somewhat of a level playing field , with a small advantage to the big boys ( like the folks in Vegas ) . But the longer you stick around - the more you see the games that are played. I 've been having fun in the Wild Wild West atmosphere since the mid 90s and each year that goes by , with all I 've seen , the lack of sheriffs is quite startling. Unfortunately , it is the only game in town so this seedy underbelly is all we have , even as it is paraded ( most years ) as glitzy and glamorous. Indeed , under the surface is a convoy of snake oil salesmen duking it out with used car salesmen in their Armani suits. Actually , that is a dismissive comment to those professions ... snake oil salesmen and used car salesmen have far higher morals; I apologize . </stick.v.2593><stick.v.2594>So , yes , Ron Paul will vote against his own bill , but for the reason that it has been mingled together with something else Ron Paul doesn ' t believe in.

For growing players , the top of the nose is a good place to cut the stick. This should get them through a season. When playing , the top hand should cover the end of the shaft.

The reason why Windows is so much more popular than Mac is not because Windows is better. It 's because that is what people are comfortable and familiar with. The average consumer would rather stick with what they know they can make work , rather than try something that may or may not be better. I honestly do n't know that much about OSX; in fact I may even agree that the OS is simpler if I ever did use it. However , because businesses are not likely to switch from Windows anytime soon a huge portion of the population will stay with Windows if only because that 's what they are used to working with . </stick.v.2600><stick.v.2601>And yet , for all of Witch Amusement ' s flaws there are so many I can ' t hate it.

Plus , while some dramas are bad in that they are annoying or obnoxious , and may make you want to stick forks in eyes or hands or other body parts ( theirs , not your own , of course ) , Witch Amusement is merely bad in that it ' s stupid.

Cardboard boxes and the like not only soak up water but the cardboard itself will bleed off impurities when wet and the yellowing will be carried by the water to stain everything thing else around.

Another method for breaking up the reflection of glass is to stick large sheets of food wrap across the middle of your windows. Saran wrap and its cousin products can serve this purpose. If you have trouble getting the wrap to stick , spray a light coating of vegetable oil or water on the window before laying down the wrap. The wrap 's surface does not reflect the surroundings as the glass does . </stick.v.2610><stick.v.2611>Glue ( Glue ? ) , not to be confused with Paste is a chemical element which , if it was one of the fake elements , would be underneath the bottom row of the periodic table where it could not be seen.

This thought-process goes back to Starcraft , with its three very different races. In both games , it 's a completely new experience to play a new class ( in Warcraft ) or race ( in Starcraft ) . The desire to stick to this core concept eventually lead to the addition of paladins to the horde side and shamans to the alliance side - Blizzard felt that in order to maintain balance , they were being forced to make the two classes more and more similar . </stick.v.2612><stick.v.2613>It ' s about time some of the superdelegates provided a clear , rational account for sticking with a candidate.

They say : " Yes , it is difficult , but it is possible. We said we 'd stick together through thick and thin and we can. And you can , too. " Do we feel any admiration for Guy Ritchie and Madonna for parting ? No , we don't. We just feel it 's awful that , with all their religion and money , they ca n't be bothered to put aside their differences for the sake of their natural child , not to mention the poor child they adopted . </stick.v.2617><stick.v.2618>Butt Seams are recommended and can be prepared by overlapping the ends of two adjoining pieces , placing a straight edge over the two pieces and cutting through both sheets simultaneously. When you want to make a mitered or butt seam you will need to leave the backing paper on both surfaces otherwise the surfaces will stick together when you cut across them. Also the ends may be butted together leaving as little space between them as possible and decorative cover strips can be cut and applied over the seams . </stick.v.2618><stick.v.2619>Cavallaro wears his influences on his sleeve , the biggest being Kevin Smith ( make sure you freeze frame on the " autographed letter " when it comes up. ) What 's nice is that Cavallaro does n't rip off Smith , he just uses his films as a springboard. Stuck Like Chuck is definitely its own movie. Now , I 'm not going to say the film is perfect; there are a few minor flaws ( many of them clearly due to budgetary constraints , such as the sparse sets ) , but writer/director Cavallaro has a clear sense of humor ( make sure you stick around for the end credits and read them ! ) , the film is well shot and well edited , and I was never bored while watching the movie. That 's the number-one flaw with so many indy movies; they 're boring as hell. Stuck Like Chuck isn't. If you ca n't get behind a movie in which a director wears the t-shirt of Director 's Cameo Magazine during his own director 's cameo , you 're missing out . </stick.v.2619><stick.v.2620>He currently breeds Highland cows crossed with a Hereford bull. The result is a fairly hairy looking Hereford which he hopes the meat trade will accept well. He tells me he is particularly hard on his bulls in the winter - " I get them from a guy in Montana who makes them live quite a tough life and forage for what they can get. And then over the winter I will stick them on some of my grazing pastures and they just hasve to stick it out. If they die , they die. I 've got to breed strong enough for this type of system because I do n't want the costs of winter feeding etc. The Highlands are particularly well adapted to this system as well as mothering well and being calm enough to corral once or twice a year. He expects his cows to last about 20 years , calving each year . </stick.v.2620><stick.v.2621>One thing I am always wondering why some firms are doing just fine in different business and some others are not , yet others are specifically created as conglomerate , such as DHR , GE. So when Comcast wants to invest in Disney , Starbucks wants to be in film business , how we know they are not going to be successful ? I guess that the key is to see if those managers are a good at allocating capticals. We usually assume that they are not good at it ? Suppose they are not going into other businesses , they stick to what they know , have more pipelines , what if the no major block buster drug came out from the pipeline ? Would it better for pfe to extend such a way as JNJ did in 80s so that their revenues can be hedged in long run ? </stick.v.2621><stick.v.2622>Decide how you want the top.

However energy prices are affected by a lot of factors like weather , exports , imports , labor costs , resources , etc. To avoid such fluctuations , many people prefer selecting capped tariffs which saves them from the ever changing prices and allows them to stick to their original rates . </stick.v.2632><stick.v.2633>Want to own the high-tech house on your block , with the latest solar technology ? Try this on for size : solar roofing tiles that can generate up to 90 percent of your electricity. Unlike solar panels that stick out like some giant radar antenna , these tiles blend in seamlessly with the roof. And you 'll enjoy paying just a fraction of what you used to pay on electricity. Although initial installation costs are higher than a standard roof , your local utility may help to foot the bill . </stick.v.2633><stick.v.2634>- Incentives there ' s little to choose between most current accounts and as the EU commission report found many current accounts are so complex that most of us just stick with what we have rather than deal with the hassle but incentivized switching should make it a much sweeter experience for example , cash back incentives or free travel insurance or breakdown cover which could mean you save in other areas of your finances. However if the account offers these little extras in exchange for a monthly fee then you need to carefully weigh up how much you need these extras and if you can buy them separately cheaper. For example , there is little point purchasing annual travel insurance in a package with your current account , if you only go away once a year . </stick.v.2634><stick.v.2635>The Spike Grenade is believed to be the Covenant Loyalist counterpart to the Covenant Separatist Plasma Grenade , being mostly favoured by the Brutes. The Spike Grenade is most notable for its adhesive properties , similar to the Plasma Grenade , but with a different sticking mechanism. This weapon uses its spikes to stick to the target , and soon after being attached , it will detonate , turning the spikes into lethal projectiles. The Spike Grenade 's initial explosion is the least powerful of all the grenades in Halo 3 , although the explosion is not meant to be lethal. The explosion is meant to scatter the spikes at a deadly velocity , impaling enemies within range or wounding them enough for the user to finish them off. The spikes used in the grenade are similar to those used in the Brute Spiker . </stick.v.2635><stick.v.2636>The biggest challenge is to get hubby to stick to his allowance.

Form a cone like an ice cream cone , and tie strips of inner bark around the cone to keep it together. Score a pine tree by cutting off a 4 x 4 inch square in the bark , until you can see the inner bark. The sticky sap will flow out. Take a stick and get a good glob of sap , then smear it onto the inside of your cone. Using whatever the birds - like grouse or pheasants - are feeding on ( berries , corn , etc ) , make a small trail leading into the cone , and fill the inner cone with the bait. The bird will eat the bait and follow the trail right into the cone ! Once they stick their head in , the pinesap will stick to their feathers. The bird is now blind. But , just like a bird in a cage that you place a cover over , these trapped birds will lay down , thinking it is night time , and go to sleep.

Unfortunately , many players made the switch w/out realizing that any of their handywork leads to damaging the stick before they even use it. Especially since the tolerance/exact specs of the composite sticks are nearly perfect. If the player could get over the mental superstition aspect of it , if you design your blade and shaft correctly , every stick will be ready to use out of the box . </stick.v.2655><stick.v.2656>These are very quick and useful for sticking embellishments such as buttons and resins.

This move allows the dancer to twirl the glow sticks very close together and can look much more difficult than it actually is. To do the move , practice making a figure eight with your leading hand. Hold your arm out with your elbow slightly bent , and move only your wrist. Imagine the face of a clock , and , starting at 12 , move to the following numbers in this order : 1 , 2 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 1 , 2.

The grip was made out of thread. In the past 15 years , however , manufacturers have started reinforcing the wood sticks with fiberglass , carbon , Kevlar and Dyneema. Composite sticks are made from a mold , so every stick of a certain model is the same. There are also different kinds of heads ( shortis and midis ) , used by forwards and mids for better ball control. And then there are goalie sticks , which are used more for deflecting the ball than for hitting it . </stick.v.2733><stick.v.2734>Pull the vinyl over your pod , the ADOS will stick really well so be sure to get it where you want it.

As the material insides the harvester rolls around , the larger or wetter particles will form into balls , like making a snowball. When these reach the end of the Harvester and get into the cone , the increased slope of the sides of the cone cause them to roll out quickly. The worms tend to stick to the metal of the cone , and do not roll as easy , and therefore will stay in the cone longer. Since the cone is rotating , the longer something stays in it , the further over to the side it will come out. The longer a cone is , with the same slope , the further to the side the worms will go , and the better the separation you will get. The output cone on a WW-Jet Harvesters has been designed for optimum worm separation . </stick.v.2741><stick.v.2742>Ordering was easy and fast.

Perhaps someone will say to me : " Oh , you talk like a convert ! America is America. It 's full of Protestants and unbelievers , and the Orthodox will always be a little minority of people who stick to themselves and have no influence on the rest of America. " Well , I 'm not saying that we Orthodox will " convert America " -- that 's a little too ambitious for us. However , St. Herman himself did have such a dream. He wrote a letter after participating in the first " missionary conference " on American soil , when that small band of missionaries divided up the vast land of Alaska and argued over who would get the most land to cover.

Next is the aircraft , or hollow core shaft , a shaft built from smaller strips of wood , that actually leaves hollow spaces in the core.

The Gen Y 's who are sticking with a company are doing so because they continue to be offered multiple opportunities to learn , grow and " build out their career " .

The easiest way to tell if this is your problem is to check the TV pressure as described in our TV linkage adjustment page . </stick.v.2797><stick.v.2798>hey hey ! i 'm beaming over the news that project runway 's legal battle has finally ended ( at first i thought this was an april fool 's joke - but thankfully it 's not ( kudos to popsugar for their trick rob pattinson post - i totally fell for it ! ) although i would have preferred to watch the 6th season of the show on bravo - it was lifetime that won out in the end ( the show will air in the summer ) perhaps this can help give the channel 's image a makeover ( without completely disenfranchising their built-in mom crowd - they need TV too ! ) after the news broke - bravo released more details on their new ( rip-off ) show the fashion show ( debuting may 7th ) with isaac mizrahi and kelly rowland ( meet the contestants ) i do n't think i 'll be tuning in for that - one fashion design show is enough ( however i might change my mind ) i 'm going to have to stick with tim gunn and heidi klum - even if they are switching networks ! \n </stick.v.2798><stick.v.2799>This can be a warm bath , a bedtime story , a cuddle - make it something you will be able to stick to.

In a nutshell it allows one memory chip to be accessed while another is already performing a read/write operation. Think of it as RAID 0 ( striping ) for your memory. Since memory ( apart from RDRAM ) is now sold in DIMMs ( which are really two SIMMs stuck back to back ) they can do two way interleaving already.

Looks very nice and added the smallest bit of mint to the flavoring. Not enough to scare away those who don ' t like mint. However , I found the peppermint sticks didn ' t want to stay standing up right away. To fix this , I stuck the batch in the fridge and checked it every 5 minutes or so to reposition the sticks. After that , I let it finish setting up at room temperature to prevent the candy canes from getting too brittle . </stick.v.2809><stick.v.2810>How sinks work can now be understood. As Lara reaches a corner she will stick if a sink trigger is further downstream. So you need another sink to gently pull her away from the corner and back into the main ' flow ' .

The House , a large and some times fractious group , tends to operate from the top down , and there is little legislative overlap among the committees. This year , the House leadership allocated the drafting of farm bill policy to the Agriculture Committee and raising needed additional funds for the bill to Ways and Means and expected the the committees to stick to their assignments , which is what happened. And , no doubt making it easier for Ways and Means to avoid the temptation of drafting its own farm bill policy provisions is the fact that the district of its chairman , Rep. Charles Rangel ( Dem.-NY ) , is smack in the middle of New York City where farm policy is not of great interest to constituents . </stick.v.2813><stick.v.2814>Wang is the OWNER of the Islanders , not the GM.

Apply general-purpose cement mixed with broken glass for heat retention. These first layers are applied gradually building up a lining to the container. You will have to apply very little to start with to ensure the cement sticks to the sides. Once you have a thin film of hardened cement firmly stuck to the sides you can apply larger amounts. You should not have to lie the drum on its side. Providing you apply the concrete in thin layers , allowing time for them to harden before applying the next layer , you will have no problems with the concrete sticking to the sides of the drum . </stick.v.2820><stick.v.2821>Schumer 's argument was worse and not even very political : he was worried that the Shrub would appoint someone worse if they turned Mukasey down.

For the most part , the 2002 farm bill did not directly provide funding for the energy title , making the baseline for this farm bill 's energy title effectively zero; and the just-completed congressional budget resolution requires the Agriculture Committee to stick to the 2002 farm bill baseline in drafting the new farm bill. Thus , in several instances , the proposal contains language providing that funding will be contingent on ways being found to reduce spending or raise revenue in other areas so as to offset , or make " budget neutral , " the new spending . </stick.v.2823><stick.v.2824>I just want to bring something out.

Has it reached the point where Apple turns to AT &amp;T ( T ) and says , Darth Vader-style , " You have failed me for the last time " ? Gruber thinks not , if only because AT &amp;T so desperately needs the iPhone that Apple can extract far better terms from them than it ever could from Verizon ( VZ ) . So he takes Tim Cook at his word when Apple 's COO tells analysts that the company has reviewed AT &amp;T 's plans and is going to give it time to work out the kinks.

My point again if you can ' t convince me ( and I ' m hardly a dinosaur ) , and others like me working in print and broadcast , isn ' t it time to rethink ? Isn ' t my opinion valid , or only that of those who share yours ? Those who challenge the merits of SM are treated with utter disdain , and that I think is a huge problem going forward as there is increased uptake.

One of O'Reilly 's pet peeves besides the evils of Hollywood is NBC , which happens to be the employer of his nemesis Olbermann.

" ) However , as as pointed out in the forums , this count was filed in two separate complaints : one by Blank Rome and the other by Judge Moore himself. Since Tunis already found Thompson guilty in Moore 's filing , there was no reason to find him guilty for the exact same thing in Blank Rome 's filing. Hence the " not guilty " verdict in the latter ( Again , as pointed out in the forums , to do so would fall into the realm of " double jeopardy.

With the exception of a few players , most people play the game the same way , which is doing what is in their own self-interest and gives them the best chance to remain in the game the longest. The main difference is circumstance most of the heroes were in circumstances in prior seasons where doing the right thing happen to coincide with the right strategic move , and most the villains were in circumstances where doing the wrong thing was their best or only strategic move. Also , the villains generally tend to be more disparaging ( and IMHO funnier ) in their solo interviews and/or in the game itself ( e.g. Randy , Jerri ) . The main players that stick out to me as not fitting these molds are Colby he will do the right thing even if it ' s bad strategically ( e.g. Tina over Keith ) .

Since the two balls that are stuck together have twice the mass of the left-hand ( blue ) ball by itself , after the collision the speed of the two must be one-half of 120 km/hr , i.e. 60 km/hr. Since for the first observer the two balls are stationary after the collision and the second observer is moving to the left at 60 km/hr , we can predict that after the collision the two balls will be moving at 60 km/hr relative to the second observer.

In a nutshell , the label needs to stick to the packaging component substrate and stand up to the abuse of sterilization , shipping , handling , and storage until it gets thrown away.

This shot strikes me as Bitton ' s confession of faith and also her self-critique. She , too , has made a work of art out of the wall. Rather than address it through an expos or polemic , she has approached it almost as an object of contemplation , in the conviction that art is a refusal of despair.

If the fixtures are only brass plated , you can do the same , but you run the risk of taking off some of the plate to the steel , which will then rust.

If the bolt comes to rest too far forward , the stem ledge will not seat firmly against the o-ring and gas will leak around it and down the barrel. If you look at an 68AUTOMAG sear , you 'll notice that it is angled back such that when you pull the trigger , it actually forces the bolt further back against the o-ring before releasing the bolt. Thus , if the bolt rests too far back with respect to the o-ring , the trigger pull will feel overly stiff , and in severe cases can actually shove the wider part of the bolt stem through the o-ring. When this occurs , you get a condition called " bolt stick " wherein the bolt stem is stuck so tightly in the o-ring that even though the trigger is pulled and the sear no longer holds the bolt back , the gas pressure behind the bolt can not blow it forward . </stick.v.2965><stick.v.2966>Victor : S , s he probado ...

Still using a standard tomahawk , 18 to 20 feet is the correct distance for two rotation. The only difference is the amount of strength needed since you 're throwing the ax further. The same thing applies for three rotations , the maximum you 're likely to throw at a range ( 25 to 28 feet. ) Multiple rotations are possible with any weapon that normally rotates when thrown. What must be remembered is that one rotation at twelve feet does n't mean two rotations is twenty four feet. A good starting point is to add 50 of your one rotation distance for every additional rotation ( i.e. : one rotation at 12 feet , two rotations at 18 , three rotations at 24. ) If you do n't normally step while throwing you may find a step helps add inertia for longer distances . </stick.v.2979><stick.v.2980>Glue the third popsicle stick to close the V and make a triangle , but do this about an inch down from the top so the tops of the V stick up ( like antlers ) and the sides of the third popsicle stick stick out ( like ears ) .

She proposes rather that practical rationality has multiple facets and aims , and that failure in one respect or along one dimension does not automatically justify the especially severe form of rational criticism which we intend by the term irrational. For example , consider an agent who succumbs to contrary inclination of exactly the type expected when the time comes to act on a truly stupid resolution. ( Holton gives the example of resolving to go without water for two days just to see what it feels like : Holton 2003 , p. 42. ) There will indeed be a blemish on this agent 's rational scorecard if he eventually gives in and drinks : he will have failed in his attempt at self-management.

So people have resorted to expensive custom made sticks from companies like ArcadeInABox.com or doing warranty voiding modifications of their sticks. The custom sticks can be a bit more flexible , but are really on the high end of the price scale and low on features available to the larger licensees of Microsoft and Sony . </stick.v.3077><stick.v.3078>I stick it to you and you stick with me , baby.

Use for card , paper , mulberry paper , flat paper flowers , fun foam and other embellishments where you have a reasonably sized completely flat surface. Cut it to size and stick it to one surface and then lift up the corner with the point of a craft knife to remove the backing. It can also be stuck to the back of a sheet of thin card , paper or even embossing foil before punching or cutting out shapes so you will have a ready-made sticker when it 's cut. Do n't use it on embellishments if your sticking surface is uneven as there wo n't be enough contact with your card blank to keep the item stuck firmly . </stick.v.3084><stick.v.3085>Now libs can lecture us on how TEA party candidates are kooks and we need to stick with the RINO we know.. is Hayworth a DNC double agent , or what ? </stick.v.3085><stick.v.3086>The survey also highlights that the risks , while real , are not massive. Just 6 percent of businesses surveyed said they had suffered a confidentiality breach. I 'm not saying in any way that I want to be one of the people whose information is misplaced by that 6 percent , but it does mean that 94 percent of businesses have n't had that problem. Evidently staff in most companies have better things to fill their USB sticks with , like dodgy videos of Paris Hilton doing what comes naturally . </stick.v.3086><stick.v.3087>This is like an energy powered stick grenade.

I 'm on my way to work , and I 'm a very busy lawyer. I had no time to pause , no time to anything but get to my job , where I am hated but a very important " cog " in the " machine " . When I get into my office , I take off my shoe to see what 's sticking to it. It 's my discarded sense of humor.

Its simply too easy to improve or invent new things. Another thing that i dont like is the filler episodes - there is simply too many of them.

Because of the sheer volume of material to be handled , it is recommended that after putting the film into a basin filled with cold temperature ( distilled ) water that the services of a photo lab be sought out within 72 hours. Do not remove the film rolls from their boxes : try holding the cartons together with string or a loose rubber band. Once the film has been washed , stabilized and dried it is important to store it properly , even temporarily , such as in a sandwich bag or other archival material . </stick.v.3092><stick.v.3093> 2 - throttle stuck in high - my throttle keeps on sticking on high. again tried to clean and lubricate , but not sure if i 'm focussing on the wrong parts or places. pic 3 is the throttle linkage . </stick.v.3093><stick.v.3094>Inez stands at the sink , nothing more than a hole at the bottom of a trough , a hose sticking through the outer wall.

The only problem is being stuck in traffic as far as I am concerned but what i would do is not take it out of first gear unless I had to so I am not shifting all the time. I would only let it rev so much and go with the traffic flow and only switch to a higher gear when needed which is usually not in stop and go traffic. Currently , I am waiting for a Honda 5 speed , seems they either cant keep them on the lot or no one wants them. I am getting mixes messages but I am willing to wait ! </stick.v.3095><stick.v.3096>You people are putting way too much hope into lawn signs. But I guess it is understandable when you consider you don ' t have much else to pin your hopes on. The right tends to be more obstinate and opinionated so more apt to stick up those in-your-face lawn signs.
