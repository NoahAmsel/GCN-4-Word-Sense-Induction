Oath-taking , the Reformers contended , is biblical. To this the Anabaptists replied , by implication , that taking oaths may be biblical , but it ' s not Christian. The Old Testament texts are clear , but so also is Jesus who says But I say to you. The Old Testament is as a shadow compared to the brilliant light that came with Jesus. The Anabaptist writers pointed out that in his epistle James ( 5.12 ) underlined what Jesus had said; and Menno pointed to the early Christian fathers for evidence that the early Christians had forbidden swearing. Upon the Reformers ' second concern , that oath-taking is necessary , the Anabaptists stated a different perspective. Oath-taking , they were convinced , isn ' t necessary; it makes for problems. It leads to an abuse of power , to a lack of truthfulness , and to a proliferation of perjury which infects and corrupts society. What would happen , the Anabaptists pondered , if Christians , instead of swearing oaths , would repudiate oaths and tell the truth ? What if Christians would have just one level of truthfulness , not two ? </swear.v.4><swear.v.5>Since Najib appears to have this hang-up on swearing on the Quran , and since he was the mastermind behind the idea to get Saiful to do the same , why not he now swear on the Quran that he DID NOT sign this letter below ? We shall not go into details of what this letter is all about because it is already self-explanatory. And Najib knows what letter we are talking about because it is his handwriting and signature on that letter . </swear.v.5><swear.v.6>The circumstances of this case are unique. Although it is clear that the envelope provided to the requester contained personal information as defined by section 2 ( 1 ) , I am not persuaded that this personal information was actually disclosed to him. Based on the information provided by the London Police and the contents of the requester 's sworn affidavit , in my view , it is reasonable to conclude that the requester did not view the personal information contained in the records. The envelope containing this information was in his exclusive possession during the short period of time between its release to the requester and its return to the London Police. The requester is the only person who could potentially have viewed the personal information during this time period , and he swears that he did not. It appears that the requester cooperated fully with the London Police , and that the error on their part was corrected quickly , without compromising the privacy interests of any other individual . </swear.v.6><swear.v.7>Ooooh I swore at my horse yesterday ! I was tempted to beat the living daylights out of him , but decided to settle for saying 'Canto , you are such a f****** t*** ! You horrible horse ! ' in a growly mean voice I think it was deserved though as he was being very naughty ! Tbh , I 'm not entirely sure he even realised I was swearing ... . </swear.v.7><swear.v.8>Underlying these concerns is the Anabaptists ' frequently stated assumption - the teaching of Jesus is practicable and socially relevant. Of course in the Old Testament Law swearing was commanded. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus recognized this ( Matt 5.33 ) : you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times . As Menno put it : Christ ' s position and doctrine is that Moses has commanded not to swear falsely , but Christ had gone further : under the New Testament one should not swear at all. 37 Jesus , Menno contended , had gone beyond Moses. Imperfection has been superseded by the dispensation of perfectness. Christians are called to follow Jesus , to walk as he walked , to obey him regardless of the cost , even persecution . </swear.v.8><swear.v.9>2. Remember that the Lord thy God swore by himself , because there was none greater : but by the greater shalt thou swear , even by God Almighty , and by him whom he sitteth at his right hand forever; and whose is the Kingdom under the whole heaven. Thou shalt not swear by the name of any other God. ( 56 , 231 ) </swear.v.9><swear.v.10>In this instance I would not make a stand about it because it is job related , and could have career implications. I would make a stand under almost any other circumstance. I would probably phrase my objection as : " Excuse me your honor , but I really must know to which god this statement refers before I would be willing to swear my willingness to having him or her assist me in telling the truth; although I feel compelled to point out that I do not require anyone 's assistance to tell the truth in this court.

I think there was nothing wrong if Mr President is supposed to swear in somebody and delegate me to swear in that person on his behalf. Had it been that there is no law , and we decided to do it like that it would have been fair. Also , the only thing is that the CJN should do it while he is still in office. That was why we brought it back a day earlier instead of 31 December , we did it on 30th December 2009. This was done in order not to give room to the press as they were saying that there were two CJN. I retired on 31 December , I therefore swore- in the new CJN on 30 December when I was still the CJN . </swear.v.12><swear.v.13>We should do what Australia did.

They do not solemnly swear allegiance to support and defend large international corporations and certainly not to large special interests , lobbyists and political donors ! </swear.v.14><swear.v.15>Some people who habitually swear have the ability to monitor when or where you swear; avoiding bad language in front of children , on the job , on public transportation , in classrooms , on TV and so on. Many people do not. That ' s unfortunate for the rest of us . </swear.v.15><swear.v.16>Each succeeding degree has a similar horrible oath and penalty connected with it. But Jesus commanded His followers to " not swear at all " ( Matthew 5 : 34; James 5 : 12 ) . In addition , Jesus would never sanction these required oaths , for He said : " I have said nothing in secret " ( John 18 : 20 ) . Masonry claims to have found the truth , and yet demands that its members swear never to reveal and always to conceal its teachings ! -- How unlike true Christianity in which believers are commanded to " go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation " ( Mark 16 : 15 ) . Masonry 's methods stand condemned by the Word of God.

So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief [ Gk. : apisteo ] . " This passage is referring to Israel 's disobedience to God by not going into Canaan to conquer it. Israel is used as an example ( Hebrews 3 : 9-11 , 16-19 ) to warn the Christian not to have an " unbelieving heart " ( Hebrews 3 : 12-15 ) . The message given to the Israelites did not profit them " because it was not united by faith [ Gk. : pistis ] " ( Hebrews 4 : 2 ) . They failed to receive God 's reward because they did not have a faith that would bring them to obedience. Hebrews 4 : 6 says that they failed to enter God 's rest " because of disobedience " [ Gk. : apeithia ] . The writer of the book of Hebrews appealed to Christians not to follow their " example of disobedience [ Gk. : apeithia ] " ( Hebrews 4 : 11 ) . The KJV unjustifiably translates forms of apeitheo " unbelief " instead of " disobedience " in Hebrews 4 : 6 , 11 , and as " believeth not " in John 3 : 36 . </swear.v.24><swear.v.25>The bigger question is not that I have the right to swear , but why swear ? What is your motivation behind swearing ? Many times we swear out of anger ( which is a sinful response to a situation ) or as a verbal filler ( which is what the Bible calls filthy language ) . Either way this type of language the Scripture says we are to put away , and replace with language that encourages and builds up ( Colossians 3 : 8-17; Ephesians 4 : 25-32 ) . </swear.v.25><swear.v.26>However , I have two big problems with Mr. Ellison 's swearing in ceremony. First of all , I think it is an affront and a disgrace to swear an oath to America on the Qur'an. The Qur'an teaches that it is not merely permissible , but appropriate , for Muslims to murder all " infidels , " that is , anyone who does not conform to the Muslim faith. The bottom line is : a truly devoted Muslim is one who will declare personal war against those who are non-Muslim. For many within Islam , a non-Muslim directly translates to Westerners , Americans , and Christians. There are many leaders in America today who try to be " politically correct " and insist that only the " fringe " and " radical " persons within Islam would try to wage their " jihad " or " holy war " against Westerners. We may call such persons " fringe " or " radical " as much as we desire , but the plain fact is , any Muslim who reads , believes , and devotes himself completely to faithful practice of the teachings of the Qur'an will become a " radical " bent on working violence , even murder , in order to spread Islam. If Mr. Ellison practices " peaceful Islam , " he is not adhering devoutly to the very religion which he professes . </swear.v.26><swear.v.27>" They swear by Allah that they said nothing ( evil ) , but indeed they uttered blasphemy , and they did it after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out ...

The will or codicil is at that stage in the court 's possession and can not be handed out of court for use as an exhibit to the witness statement or affidavit , so that the attesting witness has to attend at the Royal Courts of Justice . </swear.v.28><swear.v.29>Verse 34. - 35.

Charles , however , did not turn back -- -once war was declared -- -until he had exhausted King Desidarius by a prolonged siege; then forced him to surrender unconditionally. He also drove his son Adalgis , the last hope of the Lombards , not only from his kingdom , but from all Italy. He likewise restored to the Romans all they had lost; crushed Henodgans , Duke of Friuli , who was scheming revolt; reduced all Italy to his sway , and set his son Pepin over it . </swear.v.33><swear.v.34>Well , we know that Jesus was teaching that a Christian 's word should be his bond. If we speak the truth , swearing , or taking an oath , is totally unnecessary. However , it seems when God swears , He does so to reveal His holy seriousness to His people. Many of His special covenants are even accompanied with this mark and seal. Therefore , as the Lord promises to judge His people for their sins in this text , He confirms it with an oath . </swear.v.34><swear.v.35>In my current story , my protag swears alot.

Shevu'ah , on the other hand , is generally translated as " oath , " implying a promise to abstain from doing something ( " I swear to stop smoking " ) .

In my view the failure or refusal of this applicant to swear an affidavit verifying the facts relied upon by him require this application to be dismissed. His conduct has meant that the requirements of Order 53 have been flagrantly breached; it may betoken as I said earlier a lack of interest in the proceedings or refusal to depose on oath or both; and it has led to the solicitor being unable to fulfil the undertaking she gave in her own ( sworn ) affidavit . </swear.v.44><swear.v.45>There are differing conventions about the decision to affirm , rather than to swear. In some regions , it is assumed that someone will swear , and when the text of an oath is read out loud , or affirm may be left out. If someone wants to make an affirmation rather than an oath in these cases , he or she must inform the person administering the affirmation before it takes place. In some regions , someone must also provide grounds for preferring to affirm rather than swear.

Even if it was " acceptable " to swear only when injured , it may not have the same effects. The possibility is that the mind may not think about the pain as much if the person is worried that they will " get in trouble " if someone hears them swear. People grow up learning that some words are swear words and you do n't say them , and will get punished if they are said. If you take that away , the pain threshold may not be increased at all . </swear.v.74><swear.v.75>Nick Cohen : The cranks who swear by citronella oil This article appeared on p12 of the Main section section of the Observer on Sunday 28 October 2007.

Whoever swears fidelity to his lord should always have six things in mind : safe , secure , honest , useful , easy , possible. Safe , namely , lest he injure his lord with his own body. Secure lest he not injure his secret interests or his defenses through which his lord can be secure. Honest lest he not injure his lord ' s justice or in other matters which seem to pertain to his honesty. Useful lest he injure his lord ' s possessions. Easy or possible , lest that the good , which his lord could easily do , he would make difficult , and that what would be possible , he would make impossible for his lord.

It was Bush , not Carroll , who sprinted down the field , risking life and limb for the sake of USC glory. Pete Carroll didn ' t make a single catch , block or carry , and I could verify this fact. For some reason , no one at the NCAA would listen , as they insisted that Bush ' s family had done nothing to earn the financial benefits he received for his performance.

What was on the surface a generally placid meeting of elected representatives was marked by many strong undercurrents. The most crucial of these is the future of a house that seems headed along a path of open conflict with the presidency. The reaffirmation by the outgoing speaker , Chaudhry Amir Hussain , on a pointed query by a PPP-member , that oath would be taken under the relevant clause in the 1973 Constitution indicated how determined the PPP-PML-N-ANP coalition is to reject extra-constitutional steps taken by President Musharraf with the president 's November 3 declaration of emergency rule. This clear-cut strategy was confirmed by the declaration by Mian Nawaz Sharif that the 30-day countdown to the restoration of the judges had begun with the swearing in of parliament. Sharif also met with key legal advisers and a retired judge immediately after the swearing in. He , obviously , is eager to bring back the deposed judges without losing any unnecessary time . </swear.v.115><swear.v.116>Mr. Obama is a Christian. He is the one being sworn in.

[ 160 ] It is most likely that Washington borrowed this practice from the English coronation ceremony , where the new King would kneel at the altar , place his hands on the Bible , swear the oath , and then kiss the Bible.

Or , two years earlier , did you watch as President Bill Clinton began his testimony to the Starr Commission : I swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help me God ? What was going on in this swearing was not unrespectable; it was as respectable , as solemn , as the USA can get. That ' s the swearing we ' re going to talk about.

Yet this went down smoothly as an Oath in fashion , a testimony of Loyalty , and none adventuring freely to debate the matter , the humor of the Age like a strong Tide , carries Wise and good Men down before it.This Act is of a piece , for it establisheth a standing Army by a Law , and swears Us into a Military Government . </swear.v.138><swear.v.139>Meanwhile I have been instructed to inform you that you can either collect your prize in person that is you can come to UK ( London ) and visit our Issuing Bank or it can be sent to your Bank Account through key telegraphic transfer ( KTT ) which will reach your account within 72 hrs from the date of transfer but for this you Will need a clearance from the British Ministry of Finance ( EXCHANGE CONTROL DEPT. ) as you will be receiving your fees in a foreign currency , and AFFIDAVIT which will show that you do n't have any bad record whatsoever in Britain or in your country this can be obtained by swearing an affidavit on your name at the high court here which will be used to obtain the Clearance certificate and your Lottery winning certificate which is needed and the only documents needed for your transfer to be effected . </swear.v.139><swear.v.140> I swear by God this sacred oath that I shall render unconditional obedience to the President of the United States and Leader of the Liberated , Barack Obama , supreme commander of the armed forces , and that I shall at all times be ready , as a brave soldier , to give my life for this oath. </swear.v.140><swear.v.141>It is illegal under the Criminal Code to cause a disturbance in or near a public place ... by fighting , screaming , shouting , swearing , singing or using insulting or obscene language.  </swear.v.141><swear.v.142>In public swearing is used as a form of aggression : people think it 's tough to swear in front of others.

The Levitical priesthood was founded without God swearing an oath to anyone. But God swore an oath to Melchisedek that his priesthood would be eternal , and Jesus is part of this priesthood started with an oath from God. He has become the guarantee of a better covenant than the first. Why ? Because the new covenant is not hindered by death , Jesus lives forever to metaphorically appeal on everyone 's behalf ( metaphorically in the same way that the Aaronic priest appealed for the people while he lived ) . Everything here is in analogy to the functions of a priest . </swear.v.143><swear.v.144>This was the only pro-Union state capitol occupied by the Confederate army during the Civil War.

The " obligation " specifically mentions murder and treason as excepted , but then the oath goes on to assert that the concealment of murder and treason is " left to my own election. " This brave disclosure made Captain William Morgan a loyal American in safeguarding this nation from enemies foreign and domestic. It revealed Masonry as a menace to the United States Constitution and to it 's people. The Masonic Menace , exported from Great Britain , had been dealt a blow. Many Masons in America left the Order and an Anti-Masonic Party was formed. Investigations into the " Craft " produced staggering results , not only in what was confirmed as to Captain Morgan 's disclosures , but in further revelations , and in a demonstrated and manifest obstruction of investigations by the Masonic Order. The inimical power of Masonry was extensive , at times even preponderant . </swear.v.146><swear.v.147>I find swearing useful for releasing anger if I drop something etc in the house.

Andrew and I never swear in normal conversation , although a mild expletive has been known to escape both of our lips on rare occasions when we are frustrated. But neither of us ever uses that word in that way. I didn ' t think we were letting Lily watch any adult shows that included such language , but it ' s almost certain that she heard it from some TV show or movie at some time ( unless her preschool teacher has a really nasty mouth ) . I mention this incident not because I am worried about my children being verbally corrupted by watching TV , as I believe that they learn appropriate language from their parents ' example more than any other source , and even then , in the grand scheme of things , I don ' t think swearing is really high on the list of terrible sins , but because it really reminds me how even the most careful parent can ' t completely protect their children from all negative wordly experiences. It ' s a little bit scary . </swear.v.149><swear.v.150>Once you have completed all the court documents , you must swear or affirm that the information that appears in the Affidavit and the Affidavit exhibits is true.

When Inauguration Day has fallen on a Sunday , the Chief Justice has administered the oath to the President either on inauguration day itself or on the preceding Saturday privately and the following Monday publicly. Eight presidential deaths and Richard Nixon 's resignation have forced the oath of office to be administered by other officials on other days.

It is reinforced by the company we keep , the people we are trying to identify with ( e.g. the " in-crowd " ) , parental examples and workplace behaviour. Parents must be extra careful to curb their swearing tendencies because children follow what they hear parents say , and will also begin swearing. If you do not want people to get the wrong impression of you and you are tired of swearing instead of speaking clearly , then this is a short guide to helping you to think about why you swear and how you might be able to curb the habit . </swear.v.154><swear.v.155>Or do we ? Former PM H.D. Deve Gowda was expected to apologise for calling Karnataka CM Yediyurappa a ' bloody bastard ' in public. Curse words are banned in the media.

To swear an oath , like Peter , is fairly normal in everyone 's life , even if it is simply " ouch ! " Any word inserted out the normal makeup of a sentence is then , my necessity , an explitive; therefore in the purest sense - any misspoken word is an explitive. So , the problem comes , where is the line ? Can we as Christians tolerate foul language , or even mis constructed English ? My feelings are that we are bound , obligated , held to the necessity , to avoid any negative admonition with the name or referal to our Lord God Jesus Christ. As for explitives that do not carry such verbage , I believe it colors the outward perception of an individual. To my ear , the gutter language of the street , without foul explitives is just as offensive as the often inserted " four letter word. " </swear.v.158><swear.v.159>Again , it is plead that as the constitution makes provision for its own alteration , the oath may be sworn to support it with a view to its amendment. This is a subterfuge unworthy of a guileless disciple of Christ. What ! swear to a sin , that we may thereby have an opportunity to accomplish its reformation ! On this creed , one might swear to all the idolatries of Rome , or Hindoostan , and to the delusions of Mahomet , because , he would thus , by becoming incorporated with those systems , acquire facilities for their reformation. This is " to do evil that good may come , whose damnation is just. " </swear.v.159><swear.v.160>Jewish law also recognized the need for oaths when in front of a beit din ( rabbinic court ) , but the procedure for swearing in witnesses was quite different. During the time of the Sanhedrin , the method deemed most effective was solemnly reminding the witness of the sin of lying , and particularly of bearing false witness. In criminal cases , witnesses were reminded that if their testimony was proved false they would receive the same punishment that the defendant would have received on the basis of their testimony. In contemporary Jewish courts , witnesses are not sworn in but are obligated by Jewish law to tell the truth . </swear.v.160><swear.v.161>Swearing , that is. If someone says a word they feel uncomfortable with , then it sounds bad. If their delivery is natural and without self-consciousness , however , I 'm okay with it. Personally , I swear with relish unless I know it 's going to bother someone. But it 's funny , growing up we were n't allowed to say " pee , poop , piss , butt , gut , crap or lie. " And to this day , those words bother me and I never use them. On a note about swearing in your nonnative tongue : I had a roommate from Italy who thought nothing about saying " shit " very heartily , but she was under the impression that if you call someone a jerk , you were saying something really , really bad ! I finally set her straight on that , and we had a good laugh . </swear.v.161><swear.v.162>I really like that idea. In fact that should be the oath right there.

But there is a great deal more to the question than what is stated in these references. First of all , note that swearing an oath was permitted under the Old Testament Law. Take oaths in His name ( the Lord your God ) Deut. 6 : 130. Num. 30 : 2 If a man swears an oath ... he must not break his word ( Num. 30 : 2 ) . You shall not swear by my name falsely ( Lev. 19 : 12 ) . Now notice Deut. 23 : 21-23. When you make a vow to the Lord your God , it will be a sin if you do not pay it. If you abstain from vowing , it will not be a sin to you. You must do what you have voluntarily vowed to the Lord your God , what you have promised with your own mouth. But do these Old Testament references have any bearing upon the Christian ' s life ? </swear.v.163><swear.v.164>I honestly did not notice a change , so if you think they are using too many cuss and swear words , then my friends would make you blush.

Why do you love vanity ? [ Ps 4 : 3 ] . Therefore , he who swears to commit a sin , takes the name of his God in vain. Justice consists in doing good and avoiding evil. Therefore , if you take an oath to steal or commit some crime of this sort , you sin against justice. And although you must not keep this oath , you are still guilty of perjury. Herod did this against John [ Mk 6 : 17 ] . It is likewise against justice when one swears not to do some good act , as not to enter a church or a religious community. And although this oath , too , is not binding , yet , despite this , the person himself is a perjuror . </swear.v.176><swear.v.177>OMG , swearing is ESSENTIAL for those going through failed infertility treatments and/or miscarriages.

During 542- 1565 AD , Vijayanagara Rama Raya , the king of Bijapur , used the oath taking practice in the presence of the holy Quran. In order to reconcile his ministers and nobles so that they are obedient to him , he placed a Quran in front of him when they came to pay him respects.

If it 's first person , then that is the voice of the character , and if my character just has the personality that causes her/him to drop in a few explicatives , then so be it. The novel I 'm working on right now ... my main character does n't swear so much , especially not now at the point I am in the story. However , one of her younger sisters has absolutely no filter and pretty much says whatever pops into her head , which usually means that she swears a little. I think it all has to do with the characters ' personalities. You have to be true to your characters , otherwise it 's two dimensional and maybe not as believable . </swear.v.183><swear.v.184>There is no reason to swear off soy entirely or panic because you have been consuming soy-based foods or drinks.

Many religious believers , including some Christians , object to swearing oaths to God and would prefer to affirm that they will tell the truth.

He should not swear to do evil , abandon an obligatory act , or perform a prohibited deed , such as severing ties with one 's families and relatives. If he swore to commit an evil deed , he should not carry out the deed , but instead make expiation for this oath. The Prophet ( Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam ) said : " Sometimes I swear an oath but I see that it is rather better to do something else. Therefore , I do this better act and expiate for my oath " . Allah says which translates as : " Let not those among you who are endued with grace and amplitude of means resolve by oath against helping their kinsmen , those in want , and those who have left their homes in Allah 's cause : let them forgive and overlook : do you not wish that Allah should forgive you ?

Either kids have meaner attitudes today or teachers are comprimising their principles and becoming big whiners who ca n't handle the same attitudes that teachers before them could. In either case , the proper solution is to allow teachers to swat students with a meter stick. If the kid gets violent then the teacher can put the kid in a headlock and make him tell the class who his daddy is.

He asserts that a failure to swear the jury in a criminal case qualifies as " structural error " because it " deprive [ s a ] defendant of the substantial right to a trial by an impartial jury. " Defendant does not develop the argument or offer any principled analysis to support it. Nor does the state assist us by responding to the point. We reach the argument , however , because defendant 's claim is , in effect , that a verdict by an unsworn jury is a nullity and therefore is void.

The current 24 hours is the only period the A.A. can do anything about as far as drinking is concerned. Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow never comes. " But today " the A.A. says , " today , I will not take a drink. I may be tempted to take a drink tomorrow - and perhaps I will. but tomorrow is something to worry about when it comes.

Those who sin against this commandment are those who swear while knowing that they lie or who believe that they lie : they are faithless , because God can not be taken as witness for falsehood. It is acceptable to conceal the truth but not to tell a lie and be faithless. All those who do that are very despicable sinners. Strong laws and statutes are decreed by princes and prelates against such people , and the judges are very guilty when they do n't apply them. Merchants , men as well as women , and those who are quick-tempered and become heated when they play dice or other games , and are drunk , as well as generally all those who are accustomed to swear easily , should be extremely careful not to fall into this sin.

Bart drew up a list of Articles and each man had to swear on the Bible that he would adhere to them.

From this passage , it appears that the Pharisees thought that one could swear as often as he wished as long as he did not do so falsely and as long as he did not swear in the literal name of God. Christ 's opponents appeared to swear frequently and round-aboutly. Christ attacks both of these errors head on by showing the Pharisees that heaven , earth , Jerusalem and even their own heads have their ultimate reference point in God : heaven is the throne of God; the earth is His footstool; Jerusalem is the city of the Great King; and it is that King who controls even the hair on one 's head ! In other words , when they swore by heaven , they swore by the God of heaven because the universe and everything in it is stamped with His glory. [ 10 ] By swearing in those ways , the Pharisees failed to see that one still takes the name of God in vain no matter how he wishes to dress up his words.

If you 're a compulsive swearer , the first thing you should know is that there are a lot of people who can live without uttering a swear word. Compulsive swearing , like many other compulsions , is a problem that you have to admit to yourself. There is no excuse for excessive and habitual swearing. The first step is to admit to yourself that you have a problem with excessive swearing. Swearing hampers your ability to communicate clearly , and is offensive to other people.

But this , the Anabaptists were convinced , is superficial. Oathtaking is not Christian; it ' s Christendom. It doesn ' t go to Christianity ' s deep roots , to Jesus and the early Church. There was no swearing for Christians until Christendom came about , and Christianity became compulsory and then the oath proliferated along with other deviations from early Christian practice. And then , as Matthean scholar Ulrich Luz of the University of Bern has pointed out , Christian biblical interpretation changed : scholars attempted to remove the sting of the text and to make its demand easier or to evade it. 38 318 In Christendom , Christians began to devote their intellects to justifying what Jesus had forbidden and to explaining away what he had commanded. Christendom of course is a many-faceted phenomenon , with its glories as well as its perversions; but the Anabaptists were convinced that on many issues Christendom represented a structural inversion of Jesus ' teaching and the Early Church. In certain key areas , Christendom took Jesus ' teachings , turned them upside down , and called the result Christian . </swear.v.321><swear.v.322>The widespread habit of swearing is also clearly forbidden in Scripture.

You should be very careful not to use any form of bad language. Not only is it sinful; it can very easily become a habit , and such bad habits are much harder to stop than they were to start. Not only is swearing itself wrong; so is using any crude expressions. We read that , when Lot was in Sodom , he was , " vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked " , and I am afraid that much of the conversation you hear from worldly companions may be described in this way.

According to the Mishna , the Jewish commentary on the Law , " Oaths may only be taken about what can be defined according to size , weight , or number. " In other words , binding oaths could only be backed by something tangible. Further , " If a claim concerns these , no oath is imposed : bondsmen , written documents , immovable property , and the property of the Temple.

And I swear by God who has no partners that God will not punish anyone after repentance and seeking forgiveness except due to his bad opinion about God , insufficient hope in God , bad behavior , and gossiping about believers. I swear by God who has no partners that there are no believers who have a good opinion about God and receive anything less than they expect from Him. This is so since God is Benevolent and has authority over all that is good , and is ashamed of one of his servants having a good opinion about Him and He acting otherwise.

However , the last one generates considerable controversy in certain Christian circles. In understanding why this is , we should note that a vow is the same a swearing that one will fulfill a promise , either in word or deed. Which means that people are going to look at you funny if you refuse to swear in court , or upon entrance in government service. ( By the way , just how many government officials have broken their oaths of office ? ) Whether people consider one odd or not , is not the issue here. What is the issue is why we should , or should not swear , and what God does in response to someone swearing an oath whether they are His child or not.

Unlike the closed-door meeting earlier , this time the candidates were not asked to swear by the Quran. Apparently , the public oath was done in front of party workers to ensure that the candidates after elections would be under moral and political pressure not to change their loyalties.

Common sense dictates clearly that the Chief Justice of Nigeria can only swear in all the other judicial officers listed in Section 2 except the Chief Justice of Nigeria. This is because for a person to occupy the office of the CJN , his term of office must not have expired and if that is the case then the moment he swears in another before the expiration of his term there would be in existence at the same time two CJNs.

Some countries require no oath or declaration at all from prospective citizens. France since the time of the French Revolution has had 2 kingdoms , 2 empires and 5 republics , and presumably there is not sufficient agreement about what should be in such an oath for it to have an oath of any kind.

The Patriarchs generally are a pretty unimpressive bunch. Jacob cheats his brother out of his birthright , Abraham passes his wife off as his sister to save his own skin , Sarah gets her slave to have a child with her husband then sends her out into the desert once she has one of her own. Yet in this bit of the story , Abraham is commended : " I swear by myself , declares the LORD , that because you have done this and have not withheld your son , your only son , I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies , and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed , because you have obeyed me.

If the Clerk insists you go elsewhere to swear your affidavit , such as to see duty counsel , insist in a pleasant way that it is the Clerk 's job to swear documents.

Using curse words can make you feel powerful , but this kind of language is defensive and belligerent. And if you use profanity to make someone feel bad , you are completely missing the point of manners in the first place. Manners are about putting someone before yourself and making him or her feel important. Swearing at or near someone will usually have the opposite effect . </swear.v.484><swear.v.485>If anyone is swearing an oath it should be done on what that person holds most sacred.

But older children who use foul language are well aware of the meaning of the words and the impact they have. So how do you deal with the older child who swears ? Dr. Briggs believes that " if they 're older children , swearing and trying to shock , you should simply say " I do n't like that. I ca n't do anything about how you talk away from me but when you 're with me I 'd prefer you not to talk like that and if you have to talk like that , I 'd prefer that you go someplace else to do it.

Probably quite " realistic " that their characters should use that kind of language . </swear.v.490><swear.v.491>To be clear , yelling and swearing directed at a child can be considered emotional and verbal abuse. It teaches the child that it ' s OK to be unkind to others and out of control of their emotions. As most parents know , two year olds are already good at the latter and don ' t need more lessons. Yelling and swearing at children is not a good idea , and really can harm the child. But the harm is largely or entirely due to emotional stress coming from a hostile environment and particularly from feeling disliked by a parent , not due to colorful vocabulary that quite frankly is likely to not be new to your child anyway . </swear.v.491><swear.v.492>have confidence or faith in.; " We can trust in God "; " Rely on your friends "; " bank on your good education "; " I swear by my grandmother 's recipes " </swear.v.492><swear.v.493>Meanwhile , I was AMAZED to discover this was a " mock " swearing in , as I saw an article that did n't even mention that it was n't real.

Its criteria were flexible , and soon oaths were being sworn all over society. In Christendom you simply couldn ' t get away from the oath. The oath was omnipresent. According to one authority , the oath became a factor in almost every social relationship. 21 Christians swore oaths in lawcourts to validate truthfulness. They swore oaths in cities; many cities had an annual Swearing Day , when everyone gathered in front of the city hall and swore obedience and loyalty to the urban community and its rulers. They swore oaths in the countryside , where serfs swore loyalty to their masters and vassals swore fealty to their lords. They swore oaths in the marketplace to vouch for the honesty of weights , the fairness of prices and the integrity of contracts. They even swore oaths in the universities , where students upon matriculation swore to obey statutes of the university.22 </swear.v.496><swear.v.497>Stevens ' strict interpretation of the Matthew and James verses above is called " wooden literalism , " a concept rejected by all but the most extreme legalistic Christian Reconstructionists. Apparently someone forgot to tell the Apostle Paul and the Seventh Angel that they would be condemned to hell for swearing to tell the truth before God. Either that , or Stevens does n't know any more about the Bible than he knows about Freemasonry . </swear.v.497><swear.v.498>Natural allegiance is therefore a debt of gratitude; which can not be forfeited , cancelled , or altered , by any change of time , place , or circumstance , nor by any thing but the united concurrence of the legislature. An Englishman who removes to France , or to China , owes the same allegiance to the king of England there as at home , and twenty years hence as well as now. For it is a principle of universal law , that the natural-born subject of one prince can not by any act of his own , no , not by swearing allegiance to another , put off or discharge his natural allegiance to the former : for this natural allegiance was intrinsic , and primitive , and antecedent to the other; and can not be divested without the concurrent act of that prince to whom it was first due. ( Blackstone ) </swear.v.498><swear.v.499>In addition to the holy ritual gesture , in swearing there is customarily a second ingredient - a holy object. In President Bush ' s case , it was George Washington ' s Bible; in the Middle Ages it might have been a relic , a crucifix , or a book with intrinsic retributive power.6 As the person swearing the oath puts his or her left hand on this , a third ingredient comes into play - the holy words , which often refer to God , and which must be said precisely . </swear.v.499><swear.v.500>He saw these Christians binding themselves with an oath not to commit any sin or crime. Now the Latin term is sacramentum. What is it that the Christians are binding themselves to when swearing not to sin ? The sacramentum is , of course , the Eucharist which they receive and celebrate there on a Sunday morning after they sing the Psalms and songs of praise to Christ as God. In other words , when we look a little closer at the ancient meaning of sacramentum as oath , I think what we see is that we may be holding the key to understanding the sacrament , but we might be holding it upside down . </swear.v.500><swear.v.501>How about the $ 4 odd billion for community service ?

To get more information about this swap Paribas applied for a Norwich against various members of the Group which was resisted on grounds inter alia that it would be too expensive ( ie around £ 250k ) for the Group to comply with the order. The Judge rejected this argument and held that cost of compliance was no bar to making the order requested although he did refuse to make Kvaerner swear an affidavit in the form requested by Paribas . </swear.v.509><swear.v.510>10.

His plan called for a pardon to any Confederate who had not held civil office and would swear to support the Constitution and the Union; states would be readmitted to the union once 10 of their population took such an oath.

Ask your children to find more inventive ways of expressing their feelings. Ask them to communicate more clearly.

What it does not permit is false oath-taking. Let me go further : God Himself swears - God swears ! In Genesis 9 and 11 God swears never ever to bring a universal flood upon the earth , and He gives a promise of that oath - He puts it in the sky as a rainbow. In Luke chapter 1 and verse 73 we have there recorded by Luke the doctor that God swore that He would provide and send a redeemer to the Jews. In Acts chapter 2 and verses 27 to 31 you have him quoting the Old Testament Psalms where God swore that He would raise His Son from the dead , He would not let Him see corruption.

Someday , a fundamentalist Muslim may be elected to Congress and questions will again be raised about serving two masters and whether or not someone who believes in the efficacy of Sharia law can serve after swearing allegiance to the Constitution. I don ' t think that day will come anytime soon. But when it does , I hope the hysteria can be kept to a minimum and we can examine the issue with reason and tolerance.

Nor have I seen any evidence that at the time of the framing , the religion clauses would have been interpreted in a way that differs from this consensus. And the text of the establishment clause suggests that the oath should be an oath not just of a federally establish [ ed ] religion ( a religion given favored legal treatment by the government ) , but rather the oath that binds the particular officeholder to support this Constitution. </swear.v.540><swear.v.541>There are many people who will swear that when they were ill , prayer helped them.

When men decide to swear off smoking , they choose the opening of a new year when many other new things are being started; they make solemn promises to themselves , to each other , and finally to their friends.

It is being suspected of falsehood that leads men to swearing. Let it be known that your keep to truth , and are firm to your word , and by this means you will find there is no need to swear to what you say.

When a person swears to facts past or present , this is called an assertory oath; when one swears that he will perform a certain deed or deeds in time to come , this is called a promissory oath. An oath may relate to matters civil or ecclesiastical , and , according to its matter , may be denominated a civil or ecclesiastical oath; but to whatsoever matter it may be applied , the oath itself retains its high place among the solemnities of religion . </swear.v.550><swear.v.551>In 1992 , after the country 's first multiparty elections - before then Kenya was a one-party state - the opposition refused to swear an oath of allegiance to then President Daniel Moi.

Again , in such a matter as this , it might be acceptable to simply cross out the offensive wording , and sign it as an ordinary agreement.

Gordon had not only to command , but to execute also. His troops , the most miserable , disorderly , thievish and disgraceful set of vagabonds , were one day swearing their loyalty and the next day plotting his destruction. The slave dealers , on the other hand , had a great army of well-armed and courageous soldiery , schooled to danger by the raids they were employed to make , and brave because they knew the temper of those whom Gordon commanded. It was a terrible condition. Two hundred well-armed , well-drilled and stout- hearted soldiers might easily defeat 20 , 000 of such cowardly curs as composed his army . </swear.v.571><swear.v.572>Even if your three year old swears occasionally , it ' s not that unusual.

Does breaching her oath mean that she no longer possesses the executive authority that she never had in the first place ?

Lalor , rifle in hand jumped on a stump and asked those present to swear on oath to the new flag. Lalor took off his hat , knelt and swore the oath on behalf of the assembled miners.

At a pre-arranged signal , the would-be protectors open fire on the men , and the Paiutes attack the women and children , while other members of the Mormon militia turned on the wounded men who were in a separate wagon , thus killing all the settlers except seventeen children under the age of seven. The killers swear an oath of secrecy , and immediately begin a campaign of misinformation that persists to this day. Since many accounts come primarily from those who did the killing , sorting out what happened and why , means sifting through contradictory stories , justifications and deliberate obfuscation.

The average person will most probably swear off stock market speculation forever if he was to lose his entire fortune in the endeavor , but not so for Livermore. Of course , he was depressed. Any emotional being would be depressed on losing his entire fortune. But this unfortunate development only motivated Livermore to study his mistakes more carefully.

Involuntary certification only allows a person to be assessed and does not allow treatment. This person is legally an adult. If they are not certifiable and they are competent , you can not make them do anything. Instead , build an alliance for when they are ready to accept your help. Supporting parents or other caregivers by educating them about symptoms of depression and what to watch for. Providing useful information pamphlets and internet sites may be the most that you can do. You can also encourage the parents to pass along the information about depression to the 17-year-old patient in hopes that he will become contemplative about his symptoms and possibly allow himself to be seen for an assessment . </swear.v.606><swear.v.607>But literally swearing ( cursing , exclaiming ) by using the name of a god etc. in an oath ( what my grandparents might have called taking the name of God in vain ) is to my ears a different context.

I say to you , swear not all; neither by heaven , for it is God ' s throne , nor by the earth , for it is His footstool  ( See Matthew 5 : 33-37 ) Associating great things with what we say to lend integrity to our words is an indication of how little we value our words.

Years ago Christian artist Barry McGuire pointed out that Satan seeks to degrade the name of Jesus , dragging it into the mud , and so has turned Jesus ' name into a worldwide term of cursing. Even in India when people swear they curse by the name of Jesus our God , not theirs. Hindus don ' t say Oh , Krishna or Oh , Buddha when they swear : they curse using the name of Jesus Christ. Barry saw it as an ironic testimony to the truth of Christianity and the reality of the spiritual conflict it represents.

This is the Christianity of the common law , incorporated into the great law of Pennsylvania , and thus , it is irrefragably proved , that the laws and institutions of this state are built on the foundation of reverence for Christianity ... On this the constitution of the United States has made no alteration , nor in the great body of the laws which was an incorporation of the common law doctrine of Christianity , as suited to the condition of the colony , and without which no free government can long exist. Under the constitution , penalties against cursing and swearing have been exacted. If Christianity was abolished , all false oaths , all tests by oath in the common form by the book , would cease to be indictable as perjury.

The federal government was only ever given the right to collect customs and excise taxes and only ever given the power to create laws extraterritorially. So why are they ruling our country ? One should remember from the MP Littlechild case that MP ' s do not represent Canadians. Of a certainty they are chosen in a democratic election , but a ' democratically elected ' tyrant is still a tyrant. The judge in the MP Littlechild case told the MPs constituents that the MP represented parliament , not them. Who are these pretenders for the Crown ?

But once that time was up she was not allowed to worry again until the next day 's worry rock session. And when worries came to her through out the day she would push them aside until it was her designated time to worry.

Certain strong emotions can most adequately be conveyed with blunt old body-function Anglo-Saxon. But there 's no excuse for children to swear. They should n't be exposed to it at home , if their parents have any concept whatsoever of raising children , and even if they are , it should be educated out of them at school.

He called God as witness to the truthfulness of his words. Did he sin in swearing in this way ? God himself swore by himself , sealing His own words with an oath. Heb. 6 : 16-18 and 7 : 20-21.

Well , what about Jesus before the high priest when He was arrested and charged with blasphemy ? </swear.v.652><swear.v.653>When we swear an oath , we swear it upon something grater than ourselves. For example , there was a time when an oath taken by a witness at a court hearing , the witness would place his hand upon the Bible and swear that he would tell " the truth , the whole truth , so help me God " . Of course that is no longer politically correct so the witness must now solemnly promise that he will tell the truth upon fear of conviction for perjury. When the President of the United States is sworn in , he places his hand on the Bible and swears before God. When an officer is sworn into the military he swears " so help me God. " When we sign a contract , our oath to abide by that contract is enforceable by law so our oath is upon the law. In each and every case mentioned above , the oath takers swear or affirm their oath by something greater than themselves. But there is none greater than God. He could not swear upon something or someone greater , so He swore upon Himself ( v.13 ) . </swear.v.653><swear.v.654>On the other hand , I swear to God is an oath taken by people who are called to give testimony in court. Typically , in order to make the oath even more solemn and binding , a person is asked to place their left hand on the Bible , once almost universally considered to be the word of God , raise their right hand to Heaven and to God , and say I solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help me God. Our entire system of law and justice is dependent upon the truthfulness of witnesses during testimony. To violate this trust , and to violate one ' s oath before the court and before God is called perjury. It is such a serious matter that it is punishable by imprisonment . </swear.v.654><swear.v.655>George Washington added the words , " So help me God , " and every subsequent president has followed suit. If the Chief Justice administers the oath of office properly , he will say , " You , Barack Hussein Obama , do solemnly swear that you ... " and so on , using " you " and not " I " . Mr. Obaman will then respond , I , Barack Hussein Obama , do solemnly swear that I . . . " and so on. And properly , the person administering the oath should not add the words , " So help you God. " That addition should be up to the choice of the individual. As best I can recollect , the last CJ to administer the oath of office properly was Earl Warren. A small point , I grant you , but this is the most solemn oath administered in the United States.

The following detailed explanation by George Fox completely explains the background and rationale of Christ 's command to " swear not at all. " Fortunately the courts of Europe and North America today recognize the Christian 's refusal to swear , but to still be held to the same accountability of truthful testimony as someone who does swear. In Fox 's 17h Century , refusal to swear was an automatic prison sentence; thousands of early Quakers went to jail and had their property , ( homes , crops , livestock , even children ) , seized by the religious authorities. Their persecution and patient suffering eventually persuaded the authorities to cease treating them as criminals for refusal to swear; and the laws were amended , resulting in the heritage , which we enjoy today as privilege to comply with Christ 's command without threat of imprisonment. In lieu of requiring people to swear , for the last 300 years , courts have allowed of substitutions a statemenst such as : " I [ named person ] do solemnly , sincerely , and truly declare , and affirm.

It did n't matter much whether it was the passionate nihilism of the Sex Pistols or the passionate idealism of the Clash as long as it was fervent and deeply felt.

Ms Follett is right to deduce that people should expect that members of parliament would be swearing or affirming their allegiance to the members of the community from which they have been elected and which , in a sense , they serve and which is responsible for re-electing them. It is perhaps surprising , to a person who looks at our present oath or affirmation , to see that there is not a provision available at the moment to have a person indicate their allegiance towards the people of the Australian Capital Territory. Members are obliged to uphold the law and to swear allegiance to the Australian head of state , as she is now designated , but are not obliged to swear allegiance to , in a sense , the interests of the people of the ACT. That is a matter that Ms Follett 's Bill properly attempts to remedy . </swear.v.732><swear.v.733>Now we , the people of God , called Quakers , can not swear at all , because Christ forbids it , and said , ' let your yes be yes , and no , no , and whatever is more than this cometh of evil; ' and the apostle James likewise exhorts ' not to swear at all , ' but to keep to ' yes , yes , no , no; least we fall into condemnation.

My parents slipped quite a few times. I just remember when I was about 7 , I was riding in the car with my mom on our way home from getting pizza from Pizza Hut. I was really hungry so I started eating on a cheese stick and I decided I wanted some marinara sauce to go with it. Well , I took a bite of my cheese stick and I do n't know what it was , but that sauce tasted awful. I looked at my mom and said , 'Mommy , they gave us the wrong damn sauce. ' Then I covered my mouth. My mom was fighting laughing and said , 'Erin , sweetie. Do n't say those words. They are mean. ' I never said a curse word again until I turn like 14 and started high school. I 'll use the occasional 'Damn it ' 'S**t ' 'Hell ' and even 'B***h ' , but I 'm not one that goes around swearing every three words that come out of my mouth . </swear.v.829><swear.v.830>The use of such words in the context of swearing actually admits that they signify something immoral or obscene. Swear words are swear words because they describe something that people know is morally wrong , so swear words are used to describe getting drunk , or high , or abusing the appearance of people ( particularly women ) , or performing some other vulgar act . </swear.v.830><swear.v.831>The oath of office , the trustworthiness of witnesses , the stability of society in terms of a common regard for truth , and entire structure based on any theory of obligation , all hinge on the concept of the purity or truth under oath ( or affirmation where oath is seen as swearing in contradiction of the instructions of Christ ) . Where there is no regard for truth , when men can subscribe to oaths with no intention of abiding by their terms , then social anarchy and degeneration follow. When there is no fear of God , then the sanctity of oaths disappear , and the foundations of society shift from the truth to a lie . </swear.v.831><swear.v.832>In view of the conclusion reached in respect of count I , I am satisfied that the amount declared in the Bill of entry B 3479 is much lower than what was actually paid to the exporter. Since the Bill of lading MISC 27100037250 produced to the Customs does not indicate the name of the Delphis Bank as the ' consignee ' , the irresistible inference is that it was the intention of the Importer Sea and Air Traders to conceal that fact and to evade the payment of duty. In the circumstances , since Accused No 2 averred that he imported the goods as per the invoice annexed and that the goods were correctly declared at the price paid for same; the only conclusion is that he knew that he was swearing a false affidavit . </swear.v.832><swear.v.833>" He that offers an oblation , not restoring that which he had unjustly taken away , does not do that which is his duty.

When you swear , you 're actually saying very little and are doing nothing to improve the situation. Become a problem solver by expressing your true feelings and you 'll gradually reduce the tendency to use swear words . </swear.v.840><swear.v.841>1.

Can we spend our time on serious issues ? If Obama WANTS to add the utterance , and it 's not required , what would propose that we do ? We already have the litigious atheist asking a Federal Judge to , in effect , enjoin Obama from exercising free speech at the very moment he is swearing to defend the Constitution. What we 're talking about here is a man 's personal choice , and some traditions that do n't bind anybody. The next President is free to dispense with the Bible and to punctuate the required oath however he sees fit. As our current President has shown , Presidents can pretty much do whatever pleases them ! </swear.v.843><swear.v.844>7. Bully sticks - This is a smoked , dried bull 's penis ( really , I swear ! ) .

Jesus made it clear his followers were not supposed to swear in any way : </swear.v.848><swear.v.849>Now , everyone who belongs to anywhere would swear by the food they get back home and the speciality of the corner shop.

As far as I understand , people can use whatever book they like with the oath-taking. I suppose a congressman could pronounce his oath of office over a copy of Leaves of Grass if he wanted to. If he were Dennis Prager , he could hold his hand over the passage that reads , " Do I contradict myself ? Very well , I contradict myself. " Re your question of swearing or affirming , the Constitution says that a president may swear or affirm.

They see and hear people using profanity everywhere. As a result they feel the words are not taboo and are using them regularly in situations that may not be appropriate. Often I hear people peppering communication with swears as if they are adjectives for every sentence , i.e. " I f***in went to the f***in store to f***in get some f***in candy. " I believe it is one part of the dumbing-down of our society. Lazy frequent swearing goes hand in hand with the instant gratification of the " twitter " generation. People are just spouting out random thoughts without filtering. It makes people seem less caring and more self-centered , as well as ignorant . </swear.v.855><swear.v.856>This oath , as well as Franco 's right to nominate new Bishops , is part of the accord which Franco made with the Vati can in 1941.

However , before the initiative can be approved for circulation , LeBaron must first acquire 25 sponsors in the state. [ 1 ] LeBaron says his measure is a " wonderful opportunity ... for the legislators to brag about the fact that it is the most transparent , most accountable , and most responsible state in the nation. " However , some lawmakers disagree. Rep. Al Carlson called the measure unnecessary and argues that the state of North Dakota is already " a very open , transparent system of government. " In addition to reading the bills , lawmakers would be required to swear to not being influenced by bribes or " vote trading.

Oaths of secrecy , oaths swearing penalties of death for breaches of secrecy , oaths swearing to obstruct and pervert justice , oaths swearing to cover-up crimes of fellow Masons , crimes not excepting murder and treason , had defined an esoteric , inner value system , veiled by exoteric principles of charity and brotherhood. The " blue code of silence " which has even in modern times eaten away at America 's law enforcement community , countenancing drug dealing and even murder by sworn officers of the law , in principle has reflected Masonic code subverting justice , not exepting murder , not excepting even treason . </swear.v.859><swear.v.860>Actually I do n't see anyone else swearing to Egwene now that she 's instated in the WT.

Many adults routinely swear , making curse words commonplace in their homes. Unfortunately , children are the best little mimics and will certainly pick up the words that they hear their parents using. Swearing as a reaction to a disappointing or stressful situation may seem harmless enough to adults , but every time that a parent curses about traffic or a tight deadline at work , their children get the impression that such language is acceptable . </swear.v.861><swear.v.862>Sit and listen to a group of teenagers talking. Watch their facial expressions , their hand movements , and their body language. When they get riled up about something , do their voices get louder ? Softer ? What about their faces , do they look angry ? Take notice of their language. I do n't mean do they speak Greek or Italian etc. , - it 's more their usage of language. For instance , do they use street speak ' or is their vocabulary more refined ? Do they swear a lot , or are they noticeably aware of members of the group dislikes when it comes to bad language . </swear.v.862><swear.v.863>Objection 2 : Further , virtue is not contrary to virtue ( Categ. viii , 22 ) . Now an oath is an act of virtue , as stated above ( Article [ 4 ] ) . But it would sometimes be contrary to virtue , or an obstacle thereto , if one were to fulfil what one has sworn to do : for instance , if one were to swear to commit a sin , or to desist from some virtuous action. Therefore an oath is not always binding . </swear.v.863><swear.v.864>The general concensus seems to be that it ' s okay to swear in certain situations and company. A good manly man , is always a gentleman. I won ' t sit on my high horse and say I don ' t drop an expletive every now and again , but I believe it to be unmanly and simple. A distinquished gentleman and manly man is smart enough to put together a sentence without such words. It shows you have little to no respect for the other people in the room . </swear.v.864><swear.v.865>I believe that our country was founded on having GOD included in our courts.

Other times it 's between a boss and subordinate . </swear.v.872><swear.v.873>After handing a summons to an accused , or leaving it with someone at the accused ' s residence the police officer will notify the court that service was affected. This notice is provided in accordance with s. 509 ( 3 ) of the Criminal Code. Most often the officer will swear an affidavit of service. Once that is done , a notation is made on the court records indicating that the accused was served with the summons and the matter will be put on the court list for the date stated on the summons. This process will be followed whenever the police officer swears that service was made , regardless of whether service was perfect or defective. In other words , it does occur that matters are put on the court appearance list even though service was defective . </swear.v.873><swear.v.874>Swearing has become apart of my speech pattern. Well not so much speaking , thinking and typing. I do n't go long without swearing. I 'm not proud of doing it , but I do n't swear as much verbally as I do online. I wo n't swear in front of children or my parents , I do n't want my cousins picking up the language from me lol , and do n't think my parents mind so much , its just impolite to do so . </swear.v.874><swear.v.875>Objection 1 : It would seem that no one can dispense from an oath. Just as truth is required for a declaratory oath , which is about the past or the present , so too is it required for a promissory oath , which is about the future. Now no one can dispense a man from swearing to the truth about present or past things. Therefore neither can anyone dispense a man from making truth that which he has promised by oath to do in the future . </swear.v.875><swear.v.876>I tend to take more offence to how a word is spoken rather than what the word is. If someone stubbed their toe and said sh*t I probably would n't even bat an eyelid. If someone told ME I was sh*t then that would be a different matter. That being said I would hate my children to walk around swearing their heads off ! </swear.v.876><swear.v.877>It 's an anachronism that needs to go , imho. It 's already been established that the oath is symbolic - perjury is perjury no matter what the witness 's faith. The USSC heard arguments in the Pledge of Allegiance case last week. I 'd guess that if they eventually hold in favor of the challenge , we will start to see other religious vestiges such as the court swearing on the bible and the " before God " swearing in of government officials. unfortunately , it is currently a grey area . </swear.v.877><swear.v.878>What is the proof that a promise is being inherited ? The writer uses an illustration from the past to prove his point. He says that when God made the promise ' ... to Abraham , since He could swear by no one greater , He swore by Himself , saying 'I will surely bless you , and I will surely multiply you. ' And thus , having patiently waited , he obtained the promise. ' Two aspects of God 's promises are brought out in this passage : ( 1. ) God 's promises are firm and reliable. ( 2. ) Those who believe God 's promises will experience the fulfillment of those promises . </swear.v.878><swear.v.879>The MP ' s and MLA ' s commit treason by swearing allegiance to the Anglican Church British Crown; a foreign power.

The next day , Feb. 27th , a committee representing the black community visited Purman who lay in his bed , clinging to life. The committee men - " armed to the teeth " - informed Purman that they had assembled six hundred to eight hundred men ready to " come in and sack the town that night. " ( This " assembling of an unlawful mob of armed citizens " was confirmed by the circuit court grand jury 's presentment later than spring ) . Purman later testified that he had begged the delegation to desist from their threatened plan , and coaxed them to swear that they would call off their men and order them to return to their homes. A Marianna resident confirmed that " but for Major Purman 's influence , the town would have been destroyed by the excited colored population , over whom the Major has complete control.

Boy , did my husband laugh. I guess I deserved the comeuppance , though. So , the swearing jar is going to be set up for all three of us.

Their own king mercifully covered their shame  Tarry ye at Jericho until your beards be grown  but war answered the insult.

M. ordered me and five other cadets to arrest the Baltimorean. He immediately placed himself in a defensive position , and drew a knife , swearing at the same time that he would cut the first man that dared to come near him. Lieut. Col. Weller then approached and ordered us to " stand back " when all party got to fighting. So you see we have had one fight at least . </swear.v.888><swear.v.889>The Australian legal system gives everyone the right to choose between " swearing an oath " and making a declaration. A declaration is a solemn promise that omits any mention of God. For all purposes , including the law of perjury , a declaration is treated as equivalent to an oath. If an atheist does swear an oath , the Evidence Act stipulates that no one can object to the oath on the basis that the person swearing lacks the relevant belief . </swear.v.889><swear.v.890>I have faith in my fellow countryman , far more faith than I do in my foreign controlled government.

Basically , we do n't think that you should always tell the truth anyway ( citing Jesus on this would be good ) . Thus , swearing to tell the truth is like saying , " Okay , I know that I 'm not supposed to lie , but now I 'm definitely not lying ... not that I would have anyway ...

Of course it 's fine for me to say to my best mate , " I got f***ing drunk last night " but not , for example , in front of his mother.

That is the question. The truth is that swearing is so ubiquitous in society today , it inevitably trickles - or sometimes floods - through to schools. The evidence is all around. From Hugh Grant 's ode to " fuck it " in Four Weddings and a Funeral to French Connection 's advertising slogan , FCUK , and Gordon Ramsey 's television show , The F-word - swearing is omnipresent in modern Britain.

[ 2 ] </swear.v.1046><swear.v.1047>But when taking an oath a person needs to consider the seriousness of such a solemn act. And they ought to swear to nothing unless they are fully convinced that it is the truth. And they should make sure that what they are binding themselves to is good and just. And they need to be convinced in their own minds that it is good and just. And finally they must swear only to that which is in their power to carry out. So , in a word , to enter into an oath is to seriously swear to do something you are able to do , something you know to be good , just , and true . </swear.v.1047><swear.v.1048>And when the proconsul yet again pressed him , and said , " Swear by the fortune of Caesar , " he answered , " Since thou art vainly urgent that , as thou sayest , I should swear by the fortune of Caesar , and pretendest not to know who and what I am , hear me declare with boldness , I am a Christian. And if you wish to learn what the doctrines of Christianity are , appoint me a day , and thou shalt hear them. " The proconsul replied , " Persuade the people. " But Polycarp said , " To thee I have thought it right to offer an account [ of my faith ]; for we are taught to give all due honour ( which entails no injury upon ourselves ) to the powers and authorities which are ordained of God.

The censor board is clearly on the side of mixing realism with shock value and that goes to its credit. When Slumdog Millionaire was released in India , it had an A certificate for its English version full of curse words. And U/A for the Hindi version , where the profanities were edited out. But Omkara , Dev D and Ishqiya were cleared. Does this high-on-obscenities-Hindi lend us new insights into whether we really need verbal catharsis or is it a paucity of original expression through language is worth debating.

I discovered that I had a talent for languages as well as for music. The rapidity and ease with which I acquired Spanish astonished my associates. In a short time I was able not only to understand most of what was said at the table during meals , but to join in the conversation. I bought a method for learning the Spanish language , and with the aid of my landlord as a teacher , by constant practice with my fellow workmen , and by regularly reading the Cuban newspapers , and finally some books of standard Spanish literature which were at the house , I was able in less than a year to speak like a native.

Since Christ calls us to be holy and pure both inside and outside , we are guilty of sin if we only do a halfway job. If you swear in order to avoid the sin of hypocrisy , you are not avoiding one sin but are actually committing a double sin , since you have trespassed in both thought and word together.

The reason we have such strong hope and consolation is for two reasons : 1. ) God can not lie.

Obama is swearing to protect the constitution which expressly forbids the government endorsing any particular religion or religion in general. By turning the ceremony into a religious ceremony he is making a mockery of the oath. I think even Christians should understand this and should realize why it is wrong.

Christ Himself spoke under oath ( 26 : 63 , 64 ) . And the law prescribed oaths in certain circumstances ( e.g. , Num. 5 : 19 , 21; 30 : 2 , 3 ) . What Christ is forbidding here is the flippant , profane , or careless use of oaths in everyday speech. In that culture , such oaths were often employed for deceptive purposes. To make the person being victimized believe the truth was being told , the Jews would swear by " heaven , " " earth , " " Jerusalem , " or their own " heads " ( vv. 3436 ) , not by God , hoping to avoid divine judgment for their lie. But it all was in God 's creation , so it drew Him in and produced guilt before Him , exactly as if the oath were made in His name.

Unfortunately , you were far too drunk to remember the questions either; you still can't. Your friend the Rabbi informed you the next morning that he was awake through the whole thing , and what actually happened was that the barmaids had carried a mop and a bucket through the dining room of the inn.

Normally , we swear by the name of something much superior to us , such as we swear by God or by the name of our father ( who is considered senior or superior to us ) . But we never swear by the name of something inferior to us. Here in the Quran swearing fashions of Allah ( God ) by moon or stars hinting us that Allah considered these things superior to himself. And this makes us to think ( otherwise ) as to who actually acted as Allah in Quran ? However , in his explanation of why the Qur ' an swears by the moon in Surah 74 : 32 , Nay , verily by the Moon , Yusuf Alli comments , The moon was worshipped as a deity in times of darkness ( fn. 5798 , pg. 1644 ) .

However , to many who think that some form of nation-state is necessary for individuals to coexist peaceably , the Constitution lays out a set of ideas and rules that are tough to improve upon in toto. Arguably , anyone who runs for office at the federal level accepts both of those ideas.

For , if they observed faithfulness , as they ought , in their words , there would have been no necessity of so many superfluous oaths.

It is widely believed to have been written by Hippocrates , the father of western medicine , in Ionic Greek ( late 5th century BC ) , [ 1 ] or by one of his students , [ 2 ] and is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus. Classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein proposed that the oath was written by Pythagoreans , a theory that has been questioned due to the lack of evidence for a school of Pythagorean medicine. [ 3 ] The phrase " first , do no harm " is often , incorrectly , attributed to the oath. Although mostly of historical and traditional value , the oath is considered a rite of passage for practitioners of medicine in some countries , although nowadays the modernized version of the text varies among the countries . </swear.v.1180><swear.v.1181>4.

This thesis alone might have occasioned censorship but Feuerbach unwisely appended a series of satiric epigrams and aphorisms making fun of popular religious doctrines. The book was confiscated.

Swearing in public is usually frowned upon , and mostly people do know when and where it is appropriate to swear. Naturally the language we use changes depending on who we are talking to. As noted before , swearing has many social functions , and for instance in the movie " The Big Lebowski " it seems to serve as an expression of solidarity , since everyone uses the language similarly. Foul language is often associated with lower classes and the edges of society , including the young. Swearing can be a way to rebel against various authorities in society , and this must be the case in the movie , too : it is written to be so excessive with swearwords to make a point on the characters ' " resistance " .

If everything is in order , the grant of probate will be made within ten days or so.

Washington placed his hand on the opened Bible and recited the Presidential oath , adding the words , " I swear , so help me God ! " He then bent down and kissed the open Bible.

Unlike Greek where a promise was just a statement of intent , in modern English a promise is considered the equivalent of making a vow . </swear.v.1204><swear.v.1205>When an apprentice became a journeyman , he was allowed a membership inthe guild only by swearing a secret oath to the guild.

He bound himself for life to never be a servant , save to the very benevolent master : gold ! ( Incidentally , the Order of Free and Accepted Masons is a remnant of one of these guilds.

The most visible , outspoken , and effective proponents of Islam think it does. Other interpretations are therefore irrelevant as a practical matter at the present time.

However , the text uses two very different terms here to make its point.

Shevu'ah , on the other hand , is generally translated as " oath , " implying a promise to abstain from doing something ( " I swear to stop smoking " ) . In each case , as soon as it is uttered , the promise is considered binding. A man must carry through what ever he states. And the text does refer to men here. The passage continues to discuss what happens when a woman makes a vow or an oath. In that case , an unmarried woman 's father or a married woman 's husband can annul her vow if they object to it as soon as they hear about it.

He , and Franklin , were active participants in outreach campaigns which bridged the gap between established Christian churches and smaller congregational parishes. Both men knew that the only difference was that of doctrine. Both men were influenced largely by political conventions which occurred during their lifetime. With Benjamin Franklin , he was living in the Colonies after the end of the Seven Years War. A result of the newly conquered land was the Quebec Act of 1774. Among all the provisions which established governing practices , there was a clause which made the pledge of allegiance for that area generic in theology. This meant that one would not have to swear allegiance to a Protestant religion in order to be loyal to their government. It also allowed Catholics to practice their faith freely. Pope John Paul II was present at a similar event which encouraged religious toleration , and that was the well-known Second Vatican Council . </swear.v.1237><swear.v.1238>" I wo n't cuss , swear , use bad language or tell dirty jokes.

Raising the hand to say something is also associated with swearing. It is just another form of swearing to say , I affirm to tell the truth so help me God , Also to say , I promise to tell the truth would be swearing. We are already commanded to tell the truth under penalty of the lake of fire according to the scripture in Revelation 21 : 8 KJV </swear.v.1244><swear.v.1245>I curse all the fucking time , but around kids I just automatically default into watching my mouth -- it just seems to be basic manners to me.

If you swear to God on a Bible when you do n't believe in either , then you doing the opposite of what you are supposed to. You can not reliably promise to tell the truth in a ceremony where you are lying about your beliefs and commitments.

" The 24 hour program " is a phrase used to describe a basic A.A. approach to the problem of staying sober. AA 's never swear off alcohol for life , never take pledges committing themselves not to take a drink " tomorrow " . By the time they turned to A.A. for help , they had discovered that , no matter how sincere they may have been in promising themselves to abstain from alcohol " in the future " , somehow they forgot the pledge and got drunk. The compulsion to drink proved more powerful than the best intentions not to drink. The A.A. member recognizes that the biggest problem is to stay sober now ! The current 24 hours is the only period the A.A. can do anything about as far as drinking is concerned. Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow never comes. " But today " the A.A. says , " today , I will not take a drink. I may be tempted to take a drink tomorrow - and perhaps I will. but tomorrow is something to worry about when it comes.

Ms. Mateen is a Muslim resident of Guilford County who appeared as a witness in district court in August 2003. She requested to be sworn on the Quran , butthere was no Quran in the courtroom. Since Ms. Mateen would not swear on the Bible , she affirmed without the use of a religious text.

This official said that she was willing to state in writing and swear an oath ( called swearing an affidavit ) that in the area where logging had already begun , she knew that a female spotted owl was in residence. She also stated that if logging continued , the spotted owl could face extinction. This was a particularly serious matter because this official said that she had raised her concerns with her employers , the Ministry of Forests , and they had ignored her.

Yes , this would be painful for the Aes Sedai , but it might become necessary.

Often people call " affirmations of duty " or " affirmations of truthfulness " an " oath. " This is probably a poor choice of terms to call these affirmations an oath. Since they are not swearing on one 's " head " then the cost of one 's physical or spiritual safety as related to the " oath " is never in question. We affirm an " oath " of sorts when we repeat the Pledge of Allegiance at the presentation of our country 's flag here in the United States. Though it may be questionable to some Christians to do so , we also merely affirm to tell the truth in court proceedings when the judge instructs that a witness be " given the oath " or " sworn " in. Though lying in a court case can bring the penalty of perjury into play , Christians should confidently tell the truth in ever occasion for to do otherwise is obvious sin. Thus , in the case of what to do before taking the witness stand in court we are merely affirming to do what we would be doing anyway - regardless of any act of the justice system which " swears " us in before we testify . </swear.v.1274><swear.v.1275>The Code recognized the importance of intention. A man who killed another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally , and was then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not say what would be the penalty of murder , but death is so often awarded where death is caused that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional , the assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor 's fees. A brander , induced to remove a slave 's identification mark , could swear to his ignorance and was free. The owner of an ox which gored a man on the street was only responsible for damages if , the ox was known by him to be vicious , even if it caused death. If the mancipium died a natural death under the creditor 's hand , the creditor was scot free. In ordinary cases responsibility was not demanded for accident or for more than proper care. Poverty excused bigamy on the part of a deserted wife . </swear.v.1275><swear.v.1276>For those of you trying to raise your vibration , you may notice you need to clean up a few of your personal habits for that level to keep rising. I decided I wanted to stop swearing so much. I went to a very small primary school , where nobody dared use the F-word it just wasn ' t done. When I got to high school , it was apparently really cool to use it constantly in everyday speech.

While in no position to force others to swear during ping-pong , you are well within your rights to encourage others to swear while playing ping-pong.

It is a belief that the Oaths we swear mean exactly the words we swore , and are not merely words we mouth to get our regalia and title. For damned good reason the Crown of the King of Caid is ingraved on the inside with , where only someone putting it on will be able to read , the words " You rule because they believe " .

Should such an official " fail " toperform his lawful duties , he 'd evidence in that omission that his oath was false. To swear a false oath is an ACTION.

That 's a question linguists have pondered since 18th-century sailors started using the name for the evil spirit of the sea or the deadly depths of the ocean. Some claim the original Davy Jones was a British pirate , but there 's no evidence such a person actually existed. Others swear he was a London pub owner who kept drugged ale in a special locker , served it to the unwary , then had them shanghaied to sea. But the theory considered most plausible is that the " Davy " in " Davy Jones 's locker " was inspired by St. David , the patron saint of Wales , who was often invoked by Welsh sailors.

' But I say to you , Do not swear at all. . . . Let what you say be simply 'Yes ' or 'No '; anything more than this comes from the evil one.

However , children will repeat what they hear , and what they 're hearing can be a bit confronting when you examine it.

You can benefit from some wrapping action in your manicure by coating the tips and underside of your nails with a bit of polish as well. This will protect the tips of your nails and seal the polish so that it does not chip as easily.

There were two ways to nullify the marriage ( in essence , arrange a divorce ) - Henry had not consented to the marriage ( this was proved by his failure to consummate it ) and Anne had not consented to the marriage ( this was proved by Anne 's precontract to the duke of Lorraine. ) Henry had long been concerned with the latter problem - but had been assured that the contract was completely repudiated. Still , the day before his marriage to Anne , he called the Clevian ambassadors to him and raised the issue. They were astonished , and rightly so , and offered to remain as prisoners in England until the formal repudiation papers were delivered from Cleves. Meanwhile , Thomas Cranmer told the king that Anne could simply swear that the betrothal had been repudiated - no official documents were necessary. His friend Cromwell 'travailed on him [ Henry ] to pass the matter over '; he hoped that once Henry was married to Anne , the king would resign himself to the marriage . </swear.v.1325><swear.v.1326>All you hear out of the girls mouth is *eff* this and *eff* that.

We are agreed as follows concerning the oath : The oath is a confirmation among those who are quarreling or making promises. In the Law it is commanded to be performed in God 's Name , but only in truth , not falsely. Christ , who teaches the perfection of the Law , prohibits all swearing to His [ followers ] , whether true or false , -- neither by heaven , nor by the earth , nor by Jerusalem , nor by our head , -- and that for the reason which He shortly thereafter gives , For you are not able to make one hair white or black.

Because the cost of violence runs into the billions but the personal cost is countless. The cost to our children , to our families , to our society in general is infinite. It has to be stamped out.

A person habitualy doing so either out of ignorance or even intentionally , should hold Allah in reverence and piety and abandon whatever acts that do not conform with Islamic beliefs. Returning to the true path is a virtue , while doing evil throughout is a vice. We ask Allah to show us the right path and help us follow it , and point out to us what is wrong and help us avoid it.

We do n't lower his reputation to the same level as our own deception and fraudulent behavior. This , I believe explains why the oath is meant to strengthen the promise.

This way you do n't have to contact witnesses at the time of death . </swear.v.1362><swear.v.1363>\ " Would they use the bible if we wanted to be sworn into office over in Iran/Iraq. not on your life\ " \n\nUm ... . actually , in both Iraq and Iran , it is considered a useless oath if you swear on any book you do n't personally believe/have faith in. While Christian and Jewish members of government are in a vast minority , the governments do not require these members to swear on a Koran - they are encouraged to swear by their own holy scriptures , because they recognize the oath would be useless otherwise.\n\n </swear.v.1363><swear.v.1364>Again you have heard that it was said to those of old , " You shall not swear falsely , but shall perform your oaths to the Lord. " But I say to you , do not swear at all : neither by heaven , for it is God 's throne; nor by the earth , for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head , because you can not make one hair white or black. But let your " Yes " be " Yes , " and your " No , " " No. " For whatever is more than these is from the evil one . </swear.v.1364><swear.v.1365>No matter what pile of paper , holy or not , someone swears on , they can still lie.

What does seem particular to her books , however , is the high school setting. At least , it ' s new to me. When Edward refrains from ravishing Bella and making a feast out of her , it comes across as a metaphor for a teenage boy working to control his raging hormones. Vampirology frequently has sexual intercourse as the underlying theme. Edward ' s bloodlust is representative simply of lust. And to it ' s immense credit , this is a chaste romance . </swear.v.1367><swear.v.1368>I 've read some of the books the hunters claim are from the devil 's own hand and I swear I read a different book than they did. I 'm well-acquainted with Richard Foster 's Celebration of Discipline and questioned some of the practices in the Meditation section long before the heretic hunters made Foster a whipping boy. But when an all-out assault on spiritual disciplines occurred earlier this year on some of the heretic-hunting sites , I had to question if the hunters had even bothered to read any of Foster beyond the few quotes they all seemed to be shunting around from one of their sites to another . </swear.v.1368><swear.v.1369>I was worried when we got to our table and there was a small dish of those little devil balls ... olives. Damn olives. I swear , I want to love them , but they make me want to hurl. Sick little salty balls of sick. I hate 'em. But , I took a deep breath , positioned them out of my range of sight , and busied myself with wine consumption. Ooooh , my boyfriend picked out a wine called " Delight " ... and I was thusly distracted ... ( Oh yes , BYO , do n't forget that lovely little treat . ) </swear.v.1369><swear.v.1370>Second , they would also read that " swearing " is against every concept written in the book , yet in the US , we require folks to take an oath ( which most break ) with their right hand ( another Biblical concept ) on the Bible ( including Torah ) and swear. Has always sounded more like an anti-G-d action to me . </swear.v.1370><swear.v.1371>I agree with mariosuperlative. I like what he said in that speech.

You get the same story from the judges and lawyers that are running the legal scams . </swear.v.1373><swear.v.1374>Many Friends suffered for keeping this commandment. While we should continue to be prepared to suffer for faithfulness , most civil authorities routinely allow a non-ceremonial affirmation or written statement of one 's intention to be truthful even though one declines to swear. These provide legal alternatives to swearing and still subject one to civil punishment for intentional untruthfulness ( that is , " perjury " ) . These legal alternatives should not be used as a way of avoiding suffering for faithfulness to Christ 's command , but as an opening to be an even greater witness for Christ. Friends should understand and be prepared to share the scriptural basis of this testimony. But , most importantly , Friends need never be anxious when brought before the civil authorities , but rather mindful of Christ 's promise for such situations that , " the Holy Ghost will teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say. " Luke 12 : 12 . </swear.v.1374><swear.v.1375>If your child does carry on swearing , one approach would be to ignore it. To do this , remind your child that the word they 've used is not OK and then stop paying them attention until they stop swearing. This is easiest at home and you 'll need to be confident that you can carry on ignoring the swearing , no matter how hard your child tries to get your attention. Once they 're using polite language , give them plenty of attention and praise them for speaking nicely. If you 're out and your child swears , it may be easiest to take them aside for a few moments and let them know the word was not OK . </swear.v.1375><swear.v.1376>Initially , Lincoln hoped to offer an olive branch to the defeated states by suggesting a no-revenge policy towards the Confederacy. When his forgiving tone enraged radical Republicans , Lincoln backed off. On the issue of slavery , he first talked about colonization as the best solution , and he funded projects in Central America and Haiti , both of which never got off the ground. Concerned about the election of 1864 , Lincoln hoped to appeal to border state Democrats with his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction , which he issued in December 1863. According to its terms , Lincoln offered a presidential pardon to all southern whites ( with the exception of government officials and high-ranking military offices ) who swore an oath of allegiance to the United States and accepted the abolition of slavery. Additionally , if the number of white males swearing allegiance to the Union equaled 10 percent of the voters in 1860 , that group could form a new state government . </swear.v.1376><swear.v.1377>Your oath is not a mere formality; you do not swear this oath to someone unknown to you. You do not swear in hope , but with certainty. Fate has made it easy for you to take this oath without condition or reservation. Never in history has a people taken an oath to a leader with such absolute confidence as the German people have in Adolf Hitler. You have the enormous joy of taking an oath to a man who is the embodiment of a leader. You take an oath to the fighter who demonstrated his leadership over a decade , who always acts correctly and who always chose the right way , even when at times the larger part of his movement failed to understand why . </swear.v.1377><swear.v.1378>Next , the students practiced their communication and persuasion skills in a 15-minute presentation to the principal and superintendent of schools.

What has happened is perhaps best illustrated by an analogous depredation known as the first-degree initiation into Jewish Freemasonry. The initiate is hoodwinked , a noose , or cable tow , placed around his neck and asked to swear a blood oath with a blade pressed to his naked breast. He is told afterward that had he balked and run the noose would have strangled him and he would therefore have been the architect of his own demise. Yes , it is easy to see how the culprit that placed the noose there or held it was not in the least bit culpable , if you are a complete dunce . </swear.v.1379><swear.v.1380>If USCIS finds that you are unable to swear the Oath using the words " on oath , " you may replace these words with " and solemnly affirm.

Over at the Greensboro News &amp;Record Doug Clark makes this point : </swear.v.1381><swear.v.1382>I saw this guy trying to get old astronauts on camera , swearing on the Bible , to say that they did in fact land on the moon in the Apollo missions.

Described as " saving time and money for both the user and the courts " this may sound like a bright idea for cutting down on paperwork - but has anyone in Government bothered to think through the implications of removing these formalities ? Swearing an affidavit in front of a Commissioner for Oaths is , intentionally , a solemn and formal procedure which is much harder to take lightly than filling in a form at home. Likewise , serving divorce papers by email - quite apart from the privacy and security implications - trivialises an important step. Making justice " accessible " is one thing. Making family break-up the kind of thing you can fit into your lunch hour is quite another . </swear.v.1383><swear.v.1384>Similarly , Jay Sapovits , a sales executive who wo n't swear in certain environments , distrusts other salespeople who never find occasion to swear. " There 's an inherent element of dishonesty with people who are in a situation where a swear is warranted and they do n't swear , " he says.

Is it normal procedure to swear in every person who testifies in front of a committee , the way it is with any witness in court ? Or is it up to each committee chairman at his discretion ? If in fact it is a matter of routine that every witness gets sworn in , then it strikes me that the Republicans have some serious explaining to do as to why they chose to change that in these two cases ( and perhaps others we are unaware of ) . If the practice is more haphazard and up to the discretion of each chairman , then it 's a tempest in a teapot at best . </swear.v.1386><swear.v.1387>Why did Mr. Gribbin swear the affidavit in the first place ? Would n't it have been better if he had sought the assistance of Magistrates Association to make forceful representations on Ms Thacker 's behalf , to Ms. Fingleton ?

During the time of the Sanhedrin , the method deemed most effective was solemnly reminding the witness of the sin of lying , and particularly of bearing false witness. In criminal cases , witnesses were reminded that if their testimony was proved false they would receive the same punishment that the defendant would have received on the basis of their testimony. In contemporary Jewish courts witnesses are not sworn in , but are obligated by Jewish law to tell the truth . </swear.v.1388><swear.v.1389>Many people are still deeply offended by the use of 'extreme ' swear words .. and more so , when the swear words punctuate every second word of a sentence. It behoves you as a parent to show your children that swearing is still largely unacceptable in the largest part of our more refined section of society - and that swearing needs to be reserved for those periods when frustrations come to the fore , and listeners are known to be not offended by swearing . </swear.v.1389><swear.v.1390>That Sunday all the day the cardinal travailed in riding from the one host to the other gladly to agree them : but the French king would not agree without he might have four of the principallest of the Englishmen at his pleasure , and the prince and all the other to yield themselves simply : howbeit there were many great offers made. The prince offered to render into the king 's hands all that ever he had won in that voyage , towns and castles , and to quit all prisoners that he or any of his men had taken in that season , and also to swear not to be armed against the French king in seven year after; but the king and his council would none thereof : the uttermost that he would do was , that the prince and a hundred of his knights should yield themselves into the king 's prison; otherwise he would not : the which the prince would in no wise agree unto . </swear.v.1390><swear.v.1391>The Canadian public were justly outraged by the sight of Bloc Qubecois Separatists taking the MPs ' oath to the Queen at the beginning of the present Parliament with the apparent intention of breaking it. Some people naively think that if we had oaths to Canada instead of to the Queen , this would not have happened. They imagine the BQ MPs might have decided not to take their seats if they had to swear loyalty to Canada . The answer to that is of course quite simple. A number of MPs in the present and previous Parliaments have been open republicans. The fact that they had to swear true allegiance to the Queen whom they wished to eliminate did not deter them for a second from taking the oath and assuming their seats. Justifying to one ' s conscience the breaking of a more undefined oath to Canada would be even easier than doing it with the present one . </swear.v.1391><swear.v.1392>I think the issue of swearing etc is more about what is acceptable to others than us , as parents. We may take no issue with our children using insulting , offensive or blasphemous language , however others will.

He continued , If Congress were indeed to take the view that ' If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book [ the Bible ] , don ' t serve in Congress , ' it would be imposing an unconstitutional religious test ... .

" </swear.v.1396><swear.v.1397>How far does your swearing go ? You see , I 'm always a bit sceptical of those who say they never swear. I wonder what they use for expletives , out of earshot , when the hammer hits the thumb. And there is surely some point to letting out a noise with a word attached to it. As long as you do n't go too far. I know quite a few people who say it does them a lot of good. It is an honest , gut response to how they feel. Even in such a grey area , it really is fascinating what you can do with the twenty-six letters of our alphabet.

It was not until Adolph Hitler forced the nation ' s officers ( under pain of death ) to swear allegiance to him that things really went downhill. When one man , in this case Hitler , determines what is lawful and what is unlawful , then orders mean nothing.

It is difficult to envisage , in the circumstances of this case , of a more suitable person to swear the affidavit on behalf of plaintiffs , who could not themselves swear to it , than Mr. Harkness , who was the manager of the Standard Bank , one of the plaintiffs , and who had personal knowledge of at least some of the relevant facts and who would be intimately concerned with the accounts of the parties in the Standard Bank. It is to be noted that according to his affidavit the amounts lent by the plaintiffs were credited to the account of the Sisal Co. in the branch of the Standard Bank of which he was manager. It was also urged that the affidavit did not distinguish clearly between those facts within the knowledge of Mr. Harkness and those facts stated on information and belief , nor did it set out Mr. Harkness 's means of knowledge , nor the grounds for belief on matters stated on information and belief. I do not agree . </swear.v.1402><swear.v.1403>The big problem is that if the men do not say even one tiny bad word here or there , it is hard to cast them as believable alpha males in macho occupations. I know a very tolerant lady who says she had to beat up on her husband when he came home from the Navy; he was swearing a blue streak , as was typical of servicemen. And although she was willing to accept a certain amount of bad language in her home , the Navy level was way over the top. So , why do romances about Navy SEALS sanitize their probably rough language ? Because , for one thing , nobody really wants to hear it in a romance. For another , these instances of bad language no longer have much meaning . </swear.v.1403><swear.v.1404>I like your style. The substance also has meat.

St. Augustin once mentioned that , if one was forced to swear , then under these circumstances has not sinned. The jurisdiction now respects your right not to swear.

One is uttered a simple contestation or calling God as witness : and this kind of oath , like faith , is based on God 's truth. Now faith is essentially and chiefly about God Who is the very truth , and secondarily about creatures in which God 's truth is reflected , as stated above ( Question [ 1 ] , Article [ 1 ] ) . In like manner an oath is chiefly referred to God Whose testimony is invoked; and secondarily an appeal by oath is made to certain creatures considered , not in themselves , but as reflecting the Divine truth. Thus we swear by the Gospel , i.e. by God Whose truth is made known in the Gospel; and by the saints who believed this truth and kept it . </swear.v.1408><swear.v.1409>The other thing to be considered is on the part of the man , whose assertion is confirmed by oath. For a man 's assertion needs no confirmation save because there is a doubt about it. Now it derogates from a person 's dignity that one should doubt about the truth of what he says , wherefore " it becomes not persons of great dignity to swear. " For this reason the law says ( II , qu. v , can. Si quis presbyter ) that " priests should not swear for trifling reasons. " Nevertheless it is lawful for them to swear if there be need for it , or if great good may result therefrom. Especially is this the case in spiritual affairs , when moreover it is becoming that they should take oath on days of solemnity , since they ought then to devote themselves to spiritual matters. Nor should they on such occasions take oaths temporal matters , except perhaps in cases grave necessity . </swear.v.1409><swear.v.1410>I regularly mention my mom and how I was raised when I make comments on these things.

In the same way God , desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose , interposed with an oath , so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.

The 1954 addition of the phrase " under God " converted the Pledge from what had been an affirmation of future allegiance to the Republic into an affirmation of religious belief that the nation is " under God " and was founded " under God. " ( 120 ) Notwithstanding the characterization by Justices Black and Douglas that the Pledge in Barnette was a test oath , ( 121 ) it would be more accurately described then as a general loyalty oath. The Pledge in 1943 was normative : It expressed an " ideal " and did not describe the " present order " or " political history " of the United States. ( 122 ) To recite the Pledge was to swear allegiance to the American aspirational ideals of unity , indivisibility , liberty , and justice. Since 1954 , however , to recite the Pledge is also to swear belief in God. Congress unequivocally intended that the addition of " under God " was to " acknowledge the dependence of our people and our Government upon the moral directions of the Creator.

Let 's see what happens when I say it. Making adults laugh or angry or upset is an enormous power to possess when you 're very small.

The term used here as Spirit of Prophecy actually means the personage of Ellen G. White , the prophet of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. Here you are asked to give your destiny into the hands of a prophet about whom you to this time have heard very little. What you may have heard at this point seems very impressive. Not until you climb out of the tank are you to be indoctrinated with her teachings. In the case of the jailer , we did n't find Paul asking him to swear that he believed Moses to be a true prophet before he was allowed to be baptized.

And that ' s how God operates in the covenant with us my friends. God owes us nothing. God owes us absolutely nothing. We have no claims on God but in God ' s grace when He embraces us , when we are united with Christ , when we trust in Him alone for salvation , then God says to this my child , I swear by Myself that I will reward you in the covenant.

Although I don t buy into the theory that children will always turn out just like their parents or do things simply because their parents do; it does make sense that if they hear something constantly at home it will begin to urge complacency on their part and they will quickly forget that it is wrong. This will seep into their growing years. The biggest mistake with allowing children to swear at home is that it can heighten the chances that a word or two will slip out of their mouths at school when they drop their milk carton on the floor in the middle of the cafeteria.

When our boys were under the age of 10 , we tried allowing swear words but after a few days resorted to our usual ban because every other word was the s*t word followed by lots of giggles.

Our son was shocked when we told him he was n't in trouble for swearing but was in trouble for getting caught. We explained to him that there were more intelligent ways to express one 's self but it was most important to know when and where it was ok to swear and that he had better never swear at Grandma 's place . </swear.v.1519><swear.v.1520>( Gen 22 : 16 KJV ) And said , By myself have I sworn , saith the LORD , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son : There is none greater than God in the universe and when He made a promise to Abraham , He had sworn by Himself that everything that he told Abraham would come to pass. To swear is to take an oath and God takes oaths very seriously. An oath is a courtroom or business procedure designed to show the gravity of the matter at hand. The oath was not for God ' s sake because He does not need to take an oath for His word is as it has already happened but it was for the sake of Abraham to give him confidence that what God was telling him would come to pass without any hesitation . </swear.v.1520><swear.v.1521>The alternative , which is slowly replacing the Christian tradition , is European style secularlism which in the end is bankrupt and empty of value.

The " wagon " in " on the wagon " refers to a fixture of America 's past , the water wagon. Before roads were routinely paved , municipalities would dispatch horse-drawn water wagons to spray the streets in order to prevent the clouds of dust that traffic would otherwise cause. Anyone who had sworn abstinence from alcohol ( and would presumably be drinking primarily water from then on ) was said to have " climbed aboard the water wagon , " later shortened to " on the wagon.

For a good example of this , let us return to the Very Beautiful Exposition of the Oath which we have already looked at.

I believe that too many commentaries that attempt to " read " deeper then what Jesus specifically said is something we should all learn to avoid. Let your yes be yes and your no be no -seems simple enough to me.

I have no problem saying " I swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help me god.

This may vary in other constitutions , but before you say Aha ! So some masons do swear bloody oaths ! , bear in mind that freemasonry is very traditional and loves to keep to the wording of the ceremonial that was used in the era in which it evolved the 17th and 18th centuries. In those times it was common for someone swearing a legally-binding oath to express the wish that some bloody penalty would be conflicted on him him/her if he/she failed to keep to the terms of that oath.

A quiet , loving person may begin to swear when upset , or insult family and friends for no obvious reason.

The person you care for may begin to make hurtful or mean comments towards others or use profanities regularly. These outbursts may be a way to express the frustration they are feeling towards others who misunderstand them and their resentment of the loss of their independence. Sometimes these feelings may escalate to physical aggression , usually towards the caregiver. The person you care for may not know how to dress or act appropriately for the situation.

Specifically what Leviticus 19 is talking about , and what our Lord is alluding to , is to swear solemnly. In other words , to swear solemnly in the Old Testament was to appeal to God as your witness , but to forswear meant to swear falsely - to state that black was white and white was black.

Now , it 's kind of ironic that John Quincy Adams , being such a religious man , would not have used the Bible , but he said that he thought the Bible should be reserved for strictly religious purposes. So he took the Oath of Office on a book of laws , the Constitution and American laws.

At first people found it quite amusing and thought the idea was a bit of a joke.

Like most corporations who entered the virtual 3-D world , the brand was irrelevant. It turns out that the creative and imaginative capacity of the tools give people interesting lives , and once in the virtual world are far more interested in gaining access to other fascinating people. That renders inert most typical notions of materialism , branding , and prestige. That capacity to demonstrate one ' s creative powers to thousands or millions of people internationally constitutes a new social capital that upends traditional social structures. Hence , the proverbial unkempt bachelor living in Mom ' s basement can be a land baron or venerated warrior in virtual environments , a reality that is establishing a parallel hierarchy of meta-cachet in the metaverse.

When they swear , they implicitly swear by serfdom and the primacy of the authoritative. It goes without saying that the DNI can not approve of the perpetuation of these practises and of this symbolism ( or rather antisymbolism if forced upon citizens or people who want to obtain citizenship ) . Yet , the DNI does allow declarations or promises , and serious or 'solemn ' declarations or promises at that.

But the writer of Hebrews says God has no one greater than Himself by which He can swear.

It 's doubtful that the shy girl with mild epilepsy was looking for a sadist to love , but if she had been , she could n't have done any better than Cameron. Charming on the surface , Hooker was a dyed-in-the-wool sick fuck , who subjected his young girlfriend ( by now his wife ) to hanging , whipping , choking , beating , sensory deprivation and death threats , telling her all the time that this was normal. His sexual experiments grew more frightening and bizarre , and after years of suffering his brutal scenes , Janice agreed to help him find another victim , on two conditions : Cameron had to swear to abstain from intercourse with the other woman , to preserve their sacred union. And he had to let Jan 's body heal , so that she could have their baby . </swear.v.1800><swear.v.1801>And what about Hebrews 6 : 13-17 : For when God made a promise to Abraham , because He could swear by no one greater , He swore by Himself , saying , ' Surely blessing I will bless you , and multiplying I will multiply you. ' And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise. For men indeed swear by the greater , and an oath for confirmation is for them the end of all dispute.

A " United States person " is defined as any citizen , legal resident alien and various corporate entities. Both have to swear under oath that " there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party ... . " More importantly , even if they can order the eavesdropping due to a true emergency , they still have to seek a warrant within 72 hours from the FISA court. In all other cases , the definitions contained in the first section of FISA make it mandatory that if a US citizen or legal resident alien is acting as an " agent of a foreign power " within the United States , they must seek a FISA court order prior to beginning such surveillance.

Other than that , plans were quickly and conveniently made to accommodate the new Congressman 's request. On Thursday morning , January 4 , the new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi swore in the young Minnesota Democrat on two leather bound volumes of the Qur'an , held by his wife.

Every time you feel the urge or the compulsion to swear , look at this knot to remind yourself that you should stop swearing . </swear.v.1831><swear.v.1832>It appears , however , from this passage , as well as from the ancient writings of the Jewish rabbins , that while the Jews professedly adhered to the law , they had introduced a number of oaths in common conversation , and oaths which they by no means considered to be binding. . . . So long as they kept from swearing by the name Yahweh , and so long as they observed the oaths publicly taken , they seemed to consider all others as allowable , and allowedly broken. This is the abuse which Christ wished to correct . </swear.v.1832><swear.v.1833>The oath is taken to uphold the Constitution , but what makes the oath count is the weight behind it.

A child who grows up not knowing the difference between swearing and ordinary language will not be employed by anyone who does know the difference , and there are still quite a lot of people like that , although their number might be declining.

It does n't just stop there. They have to say that they renounce the allegiance that they had and they swear to uphold this new allegiance. It 's not a matter of turning your back on where you came from. It 's more a matter of since the beginning of our country , we have said that new citizens should be proud of where they come from but prouder to be an American. We 've also added something new , and that 's to ask them to support and defend the Constitution and bear true allegiance to the same , to learn our common language , English , and our common American History . </swear.v.1843><swear.v.1844>When I ask parents and children questions like , " how much do you feel trusted " or " how much do you feel trusting " I am making use of the principle that simply by tracking something we tend to improve it. For example , I heard of research which showed that if we simply write down something like how many times we swear each day , we can reduce our swearing , even if we do nothing else besides chart our actual swearing history. So my theory is that when I ask Anja Lea how much she feels trusted I am calling her attention to the topic. Then when I ask if she thinks she can raise it up a notch or two , ( and I never ask if someone can go from a 5 to a 10 in one big jump ) I suspect that I am letting her consciously or subconsciously set an attainable goal for improvement . </swear.v.1844><swear.v.1845>8th Query.

Swearing once scandalous and vulgar is fast becoming a very common part of everyday language. Cursing ' s recent movement from the fringes of society into the mainstream means that it ' s finally being examined by some sociolinguists , although they ' re still nowhere near understanding everything about it. Researcher and linguist Ruth Wajnryb takes a good look at bad language in her 2005 book Expletive Deleted , and linguist Steven Pinker devotes a chapter to the theories and functions of swearing in his latest work , The Stuff of Thought. However , both writers point out the major problem with writing about obscenities : no one ' s really bothered to study them , despite how prevalent they are in our language today . </swear.v.1846><swear.v.1847>" That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes. " Both these words that are translated truth are the Hebrew word [ amen ] . Thus it is declaring by the God of Amen , Jehovah God who can not lie ( Titus 1 : 2 ) . In this context this word is expressing God 's faithfulness. That He alone is the Amen , the God of truth. Indeed , the Lord is the very essence of truth. So by comparing scripture with scripture and allowing it to be it 's own dictionary and interpreter , we can come to sound conclusions about what words really mean in scripture. Amen is thereby defined as truth. And not only in the Old Testament , this understanding of the word continues to be made manifest in the New Testament . </swear.v.1847><swear.v.1848>Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ? Why place our hand on the Bible ( at least historically ) , and swear by Almighty God ? Most people in the witness stand are not Christians or Jews , except in a nominal sense , so why that classic question ? The answer is because there is nothing known to mankind in the heavens above , or in the earth beneath , or in the waters under the earth that remotely compares to the greatness and magnificence of God Himself. " For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse " Rom. 1 : 20 . </swear.v.1848><swear.v.1849>I love , love this study.

When one of you is near to death and makes a will , two just men from among you should act as witnesses; or , if you are travelling when the misfortune of death occurs , two men who are strangers to you. You should detain them after prayer and , if you are doubtful , they should swear by Allah : 'We will not sell it for any price , even to a near relative , and we will not conceal the testimony of Allah. If we did we would indeed be wrongdoers. ' If it then comes to light that the two of them have merited the allegation of wrongdoing , two others who have the most right to do so should take their place and swear by Allah : 'Our testimony is truer than their testimony. We have not committed perjury. If we had we would indeed be wrongdoers. ' That makes it more likely that they will give their evidence properly or be afraid that their oaths will be refuted by subsequent oaths. Have fear of Allah and listen carefully. Allah does not guide deviant people. ( Surat al-Ma'ida , 106-108 ) </swear.v.1850><swear.v.1851>Consequently , we conclude that defendant 's claim in this case should be held to the same standard that is applied to other " fair trial " objections , in particular those involving the qualifications of the jurors and the fairness or integrity of the jury 's deliberations. In the absence of a timely objection , the failure to administer an oath to the jury , without any other showing of juror misconduct or prejudice , will not serve as a ground for overturning an otherwise lawful verdict. A defendant may not obtain an automatic reversal of a conviction by raising an objection to the court 's failure to swear the jury only after an adverse judgment has been returned and the jury has been discharged. Instead , such an objection , like others that also seek to ensure defendant 's fair trial interests , must be raised timely , and prejudice must be shown , for a defendant to be entitled to relief.

Of course it is constitutional , but Prager 's argument is that our traditions are important and to go against the tradition of swearing in on the Bible is not good for our country. This is NOT bigoted , it is an opinion based on a love for the traditions of our country. No one else has ever sworn in on anything else , so if we are to change this tradition we are saying that the book that has been honored by our country for over 200 years is not important.

Now nothing is confirmed save by what is more certain and more powerful. Therefore in the very fact that a man swears by God , he acknowledges God to be more powerful , by reason of His unfailing truth and His universal knowledge; and thus in a way he shows reverence to God. For this reason the Apostle says ( Heb. 6 : 16 ) that " men swear by one greater than themselves , " and Jerome commenting on Mt. 5 : 34 , says that " he who swears either reveres or loves the person by whom he swears. " The Philosopher , too , states ( Metaph. i , 3 ) that " to swear is to give very great honor.

Rather , the question is , does God permit this kind of oath ? " Nor shall you make an oath by your head , for you can not make one hair white or black.

They understood they would eventually have to give an account to God for the things said in sworn testimony. A lie on the witness stand was a lie in the face of God Himself. Once upon a time , the ninth commandment was common knowledge : You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

Abraham " patiently endured " and then " obtained the promise.

Similarly for public office- despite being a local government administration , it IS still part of Florida , which IS still part of the union.

Make them ( and you for that matter ) ante up in a jar every time they are caught saying a word. You will be surprised how fast quarters add up ! Implement a punishment that every 2 swear words equal an extra chore or a half hour lost of television or Nintendo time. Move up bedtime every time they curse. Little kids can do well sitting in time outs for bad language so that the signal is very clear from a young age just how you feel about bad words . </swear.v.1921><swear.v.1922>D - Use age appropriate rules. When children are developing their language skills they usually do not realize that 'swear ' words are bad. Giving out to them when they use them will have little benefit. The best way to deal with this is to ignore it. Keep it simple. If your child has more developed language , a simple explanation why they should n't use that word should solve the problem. Something as simple as that word is not nice we wo n't use it in this house. Common source of objectionable words are TV , video games , movies and music. Your child may not know exactly what he is saying. Simply state your objection and suggest a substitute phrase. Use age appropriate discipline. Older children who know the difference between swear words may need some form of discipline when they use them. Depending on their age different discipline methods can be used i.e. time out , taking away privileges , grounding or swear jar. Also consider the context in which the swearword was used. Calling a person a 'bad ' name is far more hurtful than swearing if you fell and hurt your elbow . </swear.v.1922><swear.v.1923>There are many who swear because they do n't know any better.

Later the participants submerged the same hand again , this time repeating a word they would use to describe a table. When people were cursing , they kept their hand in the water for 40 more seconds than they could otherwise. So what were the words that made that possible ? Turns out they were different for everyone. " We decided at the outset that people would give us their own swear words , " Stephens said.

You should be able to work this out ahead of time with the courthouse staff.

If he can ' t command forth God , after judging that God has made an error in judgement in the first place , it is going to place him in an interesting position isn ' t it ?

Is this in accordance with Munbaz , who holds that such an ignorance be considered , and not in accordance with the rabbis , his opponents ? Nay; this may even accord with the latter , as they differ with him only in all other cases of the Torah , but not in this case , for it is a novelty , as we do not find anywhere in the Scripture that one should be liable to a sin-offering for a negative except in this case , in which , therefore , the rabbis , too , agree with Munbaz . </swear.v.1957><swear.v.1958>Eat less meat.

If true allegiance is given to an organization in opposition to the laws and principles of the United States Constitution , it should be quite obvious how allegiance sworn to the U.S. Constitution in which it stands in opposition is respectively characterized , particularly by such manner of emphasis. Swearing to conceal crimes , not excluding murder and treason , comprises a sworn declaration in opposition to the laws and principles of the U.S. Constitution.

( The judge could not , but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment. ) Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the United Kingdom now has the right to make a solemn affirmation instead of an oath.

He steals a purse , and finds himself on the run from soldiers. He gets held up by a highwayman , who turns out to be an injured girl , and they become friends. This was a very captivating book , and it was extremely well written. It brings up interesting questions of what is right and wrong. At one point in the story , it swears , but otherwise there is no foul language. There are some mildly questionable ( sexual content ) parts near the beginning and when the soldiers find Bess and Will , but nothing descriptive or too suggestive.

Rioters at his concert at Peekskill , New York in 1949 smashed the stage , torched chairs , attacked concertgoers , and threatened Robeson 's life. His outspokenness about human rights and his pro-Soviet stance made Robeson a prime target of militant anticommunists. In 1950 the State Department revoked his passport , thereby denying his right to travel and , ultimately , to earn income abroad. Robeson fought this injustice for years vigorously but with no success. He repeatedly applied for reinstatement of his passport but was turned down. He filed a lawsuit against the State Department and faced discouraging delays , adverse decisions , and rejected appeals. Yet Robeson stuck to his principles and refused to swear an affidavit that he was not a Communist. " Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant , " he told the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956. " The question is whether American citizens , regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies , may enjoy their constitutional rights.

So treatment for eating disorders tends to take longer than for other disorders. Furthermore , people with anorexia often deny they have a problem , so convincing them to begin treatment , or to realize that they need help , can be very difficult.

He speaks about blind guides who swear by the temple and swear by something that is in the temple , who swear by the altar , and who swear by something that is upon the altar. The scribes and the Pharisees were masters in the art of evasion. So an oath was binding upon them , they thought , if the name of God was involved , but an oath was not binding if the name of God was not involved. In other words a person ' s word didn ' t really mean anything , providing he didn ' t mention the name of God.

Freemasonry is a religion. Its buildings are temples , hymns are sung , there is a Chaplain , an altar , a Volume of Sacred Law , and prayers are offered. Although I can not answer for other jurisdictions , in the Grand Lodge of Washington our buildings are Masonic Centers; Masonic lyrics are sung , some to common hymn tunes that all the Lodge organists , know; there is an altar on which is placed the Holy Bible , there is a Chaplain , and prayers are offered before and after the meetings. The Congress of the United States is opened each day by a Chaplain , prayers are offered , and its buildings are often called " hallowed halls , " but that hardly makes the US Congress a religion. Presidents and Vice Presidents all swear an Oath of Office on the Bible , but that does not make the Office of the President a religion. What separates the Presidency , the Congress , and Masonic Lodges from being religions is that there are no worship services , and they fail the truest test of all : none of them qualify as tax exempt religions . </swear.v.2045><swear.v.2046>I have literally only ever heard my dad swear once in my whole life and that was an extemely emotional time for him and he said ****.

I remember them getting their mouth washed out with soap once and they never did it again. Do n't get me wrong , I can be a potty mouth if I get really provoked , but I try really hard not to in front of C. I would be horrified if he started swearing.

' But I say to you , do not swear at all : neither by heaven , for it is God ' s throne; nor by the earth , for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King.

It used to be standard practice to ask a person to " swear an oath of honestyso help you God " before they provided testimony. It is often perfectly acceptable now to offer to " agree to tell the truth " in front of the court based on religious grounds.

For when in any dispute or quarrel , or ambiguous cause , one swore by the temple , and was afterwards convicted of falsehood , he was not held guilty. This is what is meant by that , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing , that is , he owes nothing , But if he had sworn by the gold , or by the money which was offered to the Priests in the temple , he was immediately compelled to pay down that by which he had sworn.

He recommends 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 milligrams a day. " That 's what I recommend if you have outbreaks every six to eight weeks , " says Dr. McCune.

You will have to forgive me because it has been awhile since I took physiology , but I remember learning why we rub a " boo-boo , " and that it confuses our brains. Essentially , that both impulses are not traveling at the same rate of speed and receiving the sensation of the rubbing decreases the sensation of the discomfort and/or pain.

Of course , in this stage , it is possible that man in front of the storming impulses , sometimes does wrong. But , he at once , feels ashamed and scolds himself. He decides to stop sinning and washes purifies his heart and soul with the water of repentance. In other words , in this battle between mind and soul , sometimes Aql wins and sometimes soul. But in either case , the side of Aql and Eemaan is weightier. Yet for reaching this stage effort and striving is essential. In Islam such training and exercise is provided by the Words of God and the Prophet and the Imams and religious leaders. It is the same stage by which the Holy Quran has vowed in Surah Qiyamat. Such a vow indicates its greatness : Nay ! I swear by the Day of Resurrection. Nay !

The New Testament fully recognises the importance of Jerusalem in God 's plan. Jesus forbids swearing by Jerusalem because it is the city of the Great King ( Mt 5 : 35 ) .

Truthfulness is the glue that holds our justice system together. When people believe that the President of the United States can lie , commit perjury , and get away with it , what are they going to say the next time they have to go to court -- and thousands of them do every day in this country -- and they 're expected to tell the truth when they get on the witness stand or face the crime of perjury ? </swear.v.2081><swear.v.2082>[ The president was asked : ] Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this matter will be the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ?

Then the defendant was called to testify , there being no right to refuse to witness against one 's self. He refused to accept the administered oath.That refusal on the record , the court instantly judged him guilty. Took all of 10 minutes.

It 's to swear an oath , but literally , it 's to curse oneself. In other words , you directly curse yourself. It 's almost like -- do you remember when you were kids ? I remember when I was a kid , I went down to Florida and I came back and I had caught a red snapper out in the Gulf.

Even if what you say is true or you will honor what you promise , you should not swear if swearing is unnecessary ( Ex. 20 : 7 ) . Scripture forbids all superfluous oaths ( Matt 5 : 33-37 , 23 : 16-22 ) . There must be an adequate reason why appealing to God is necessary ( e.g. Ex 22 : 10 , 11 ) . We should purge from our vocabulary sayings such as " swear to God " or " honest to God " unless the occasion is so serious and solemn as to necessitate an oath. Calvin rightly commented that " God 's name is rendered cheap when it is used in true but needless oaths. For then it is taken in vain. " [ 15 ] Remember that oaths are acts of worship and as such , should not be uttered on trivial occasions. The third commandment condemns all unnecessary , colloquial and irreverent swearing which has nothing to do with the solemn acts of worship commanded in Scripture. [ 16 ] So what makes an oath necessary according to Scripture ? In one way or another , all of the oaths sanctioned in Scripture glorify God and edify others . </swear.v.2094><swear.v.2095>I 'd ask prior to being on the stand.

' Furthermore , Article II , Section 3 of the United States Constitution states in part that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.

What was even worse , they were n't even accomplishing their purpose of getting God out of the picture.

My allegiance doth not lie in swearing , but in truth and faithfulness , for I honour all men , much more the King. But Christ , who is the Great Prophet , the King of kings , the Saviour and Judge of the whole world , saith I must not swear. Now , must I obey Christ or thee ?

When Cheney was asked about the polls showing a large number of people wanting to withdraw from Iraq he answered " so what ? " . Makes one wonder who these two were serving.

He was saying : Now I want to give my people strong encouragement ( when John Piper preaches to them on November 10 , 1996 ) . So I will add an oath to my promise to show them how much I want to undergird their hope. So what shall I swear by ? I could swear by the sun and the moon. They are great.

And of course that one solid Rock is Christ. The apologist presents Christ as the Sovereign Savior and Lord and proclaims His Word as ultimate , self-authenticating truth. In the final analysis , we accept the authority of God 's Word simply because it is God 's Word. God can swear by no one higher than Himself ( Heb 6 : 13 ) , there is therefore no higher authority than God 's Word upon which to base our acceptance of God 's Word. The apologist can not make human logic and science his self-authenticating authorities and then use these to prove God. Logic and science derive their authenticity and authority from God , not vice versa . </swear.v.2186><swear.v.2187>Stop ing swearing !

" Again you have heard that it was said to those of old , You shall not swear falsely , but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.

Leviticus 19 : 12 teaches , " And you shall not swear by My name falsely , nor shall you profane the name of your God : I am the LORD. " When the Israelites swore by the name of the LORD , they invoke the name of the LORD , they invoked the name of a thrice holy God who is not only among His people , but is Sovereign Lord over all His people.

Why ? Because ultimately the covenant oath is only as strong as the person who swears it. The reliability of the covenant is ultimately going to rest entirely upon the dependability of the person who has sworn the oath. So , throughout the Old Testament what does God do ? Well , he selects the strongest and the holiest men to swear the oaths to form the covenants - beginning with Adam and Noah and Abraham and Moses and David and Solomon and Ezra , the High Priest , and others as well.

In no uncertain terms , God forbids swearing by other gods because swearing is an act of religious worship; when people swear by other gods they violate the second commandment.

" The only point at which defendant suggested that the trial court should order a new trial , without formally making a motion to that effect , was before sentencing and before the judgment was filed. The trial court commented that the issue was premature. Defense counsel agreed , stating : " There 's not a motion for new trial before the Court in this context because one has n't been filed yet because a judgment has n't been entered. " On that record , any request defendant may have made for a new trial was effectively withdrawn. Defendant did not file a motion for new trial after the judgment was entered.

Answer. Peter and Paul testify only that which God promised to Abraham by oath , and they themselves promised nothing , as the examples clearly show. But to testify and to swear are different things. When one swears he promises a thing in the future , as Christ was promised to Abraham , Whom we received a long time afterwards. When one testifies he witnesses concerning that which is present , whether it be good or bad , as Simon spoke of Christ to Mary and testified , ' Behold , this one is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel , and for a sign which shall be spoken against. ' Similarly Christ taught us when He says , ' Let your communication be yea , yea , nay , nay; for whatsoever is more than these commeth of the Evil One.

" Nor shall you make an oath by your head , for you can not make one hair white or black " . Man is incapable of controlling his own aging process or the time of his own death.

Prior to taking their oath upon commission or reaffirming it upon promotion , too few officers take the time to read and study the document they swear to support and defend. The oath requires officers to support and defend the Constitution- not the president , not the country , not the flag , and not a particular military service. Yet , at the same time , the Constitution symbolizes the president , the country , the flag , the military , and much more. The preamble to the Constitution succinctly highlights the ideals represented by that document.20 Because the Constitution was built on a series of checks and balances that distribute power across the executive , legislative , and judicial branches , officers must give their allegiance to all three entities- despite the fact that the chain of command leads to the presi-dent. These checks and balances create an inefficiency inherent in America ' s democratic system that often proves frustrating for military officers , whose environment tries to provide the most efficient and effective fighting force available.21 </swear.v.2261><swear.v.2262>You have God in the Old Testament - Paul writing , probably , in Hebrews. Then you have the Lord Jesus. If you go to 2 Corinthians - you do n't need to turn to it - chapter 1 verse 23 , also Galatians 1 verse 20 , you have Paul the apostle who took an oath , as it were , put himself upon oath. He invoked the name of God to prove that he was telling the truth. This confuses us , perhaps , but you see what we fail to see often is that , by the Lord Jesus ' time that we 're reading this Sermon on the Mount , the Jews had built up an entire legalistic system around what was a perfectly feasible Old Testament teaching. They devised ways to swear without using God 's name therefore , as they saw it , evading the responsibility of telling the truth. Swearing had now become , in Jesus ' day , a justification for lying ! Do you see that ? </swear.v.2262><swear.v.2263>It was after Abraham suffered that he received a promise from God. Abraham waited 100 years for the birth of Isaac , only to seemingly have him taken away.

God promised this solemnly , swearing by the greatest One there was -- himself . </swear.v.2263><swear.v.2264>Not only it is permitted but it is mustahab to swear in order to emphasize on a true fact , or to prove some fact , or to show its importance.

All Presidents save one have sworn the oath on the Bible. One President , Franklin Pierce , affirmed the oath. History doesn ' t tell us why he affirmed rather than swore. He was a very religious man. He didn ' t have any scruples against swearing an oath. But his inauguration also was one of the most tragic inaugurations in American history. When Pierce ' s family came by train to Washington for his inauguration , the train wrecked and his son was killed in the wreck. His wife was injured. She was still deeply in mourning when he was inaugurated. She did not attend the ceremony or any of the functions surrounding the inauguration and in fact , died of a broken heart not long thereafter. So Pierce may have simply affirmed it because of the deep mourning that he was experiencing . </swear.v.2272><swear.v.2273>Posted by Dianalevich on July 20 2005 , 01 : 34 Hello Everyone ! It seems to me that a simple statement in which Jesus expresses His teachings on swearing oaths has again become so complicated. It 's like cooking - too many chefs in the kitchen can ruin a good meal. I believe that too many commentaries that attempt to " read " deeper then what Jesus specifically said is something we should all learn to avoid. Let your yes be yes and your no be no -seems simple enough to me. Perhaps I am missing some message that the Holy Spirit is giving to others - the beautiful thing is , only God knows our hearts , our motivations and it is He that will be my Judge. GBU , Peace , Diana </swear.v.2273><swear.v.2274>But exactly how is swearing an act of confession and worship ? When we duly swear in God 's name , we confess several things about God. To begin with , we confess that God exists. Moreover , we confess several of God 's attributes as revealed to us in Scripture : we testify that He is omnipresent and omniscient , that He is eternal and immutable , that He is just and true , that He is powerful and wrathful. By confessing His existence and attributes , we also confess that He is the Supreme Judge over all the earth and that we are accountable to Him for all that we do and say. Though the word of men may fail , the word of God never fails. Though men may fail , God never fails. By taking oaths in God 's name , we confess God to be the ultimate arbiter of truth , and we worship the God of truth in spirit and in truth . </swear.v.2274><swear.v.2275>2.

The Christians at Corinth very much wanted Paul to come visit them , so Paul made plans to travel to the Corinthians and stay with them for a while. However , he knew it would be wrong to make a promise ( swear an oath ) guaranteeing he would come , so instead he wrote to the Corinthians : " But I will come to you soon , if the Lord wills " 1 Cor.4 : 19a. " For I do not wish to see you now just in passing; for I hope to remain with you for some time , if the Lord permits. " 1Cor.16 : 7 Not only was this tactful , but it acknowledged God 's sovereignty over all things and events , even travel plans. Paul said , " Yes , I will come , but only if God permits it to happen. " As a human his " yes " meant " yes " , but he also knew , and stated , that only God could control whether he actually went or not. He could have said , " Yes , I swear I will come !

" ( 5 : 33 -37 ) . The Jews have various degrees of oath-taking. Some swear by heaven , some swear by earth , some by Jerusalem , and some swear by the head. All these use the name of the Lord in vain for they are lightly uttered , and what is sworn is rarely performed. For example , Matt 15 : 4 gives the V Commandment , " Honour your father and your mother , " but they say , " Whosoever shall say to his father or mother , It is a gift , given to God , " but actually they selfishly keep it to themselves , then they are not obligated. Jesus says this is a twisting of God 's commandment. It is like you are supporting your parents $ 500 a month. Suddenly you cut down their support to $ 300 and you say , " I have to give to the Church which has a Building Fund Drive . " Though you have given the sum to the Church you have robbed your parents to pay God. Will God be happy with your gift ?

Amos was a prophet to the ten tribes of Israel. He prophesied not long before their banishment. The chapter containing the prophecy to be adduced , commences with a basket of summer fruit , which must soon be eaten , or it becomes unfit for use. The symbol is thus explained; " Then said the Lord unto me , The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not pass by them anymore. " The prophet in this chapter announces that " they that swear by the sins of Samaria , and say , Thy God , O Dan , liveth; and , The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall.

Oh , that 's what the last 8 years were . </swear.v.2295><swear.v.2296>If the Constitution says nothing about using any book to swear on , then it should not be an issue.

There is a different reading , owing to the affinity of the words   and   141141 For   there are several MSS. , but for   there are not only several MSS. , but the earliest versions , Syr. and Vulg.; so Griesbach takes the latter as the true reading. If you read , into judgment or condemnation , the sense will clearly be , that to take God ' s name in vain will not be unpunished. But it is not unsuitable to say , into hypocrisy; because when simplicity , as it has been already said , prevails among us , the occasion for superfluous oaths is cut off. If , then , fidelity appears in all we say , the dissimulation , which leads us to swear rashly , will be removed . </swear.v.2309><swear.v.2310>Practitioners will be paid for time taken considering draft affidavits. In relatively straightforward or simple cases , Practitioners can expect to be allocated up to four hours for considering and swearing an affidavit , with more complex cases taking up to eight hours. Where necessary time is expected to exceed four hours , the time to be taken in excess must be specifically agreed with the Unit.

Obviously there is no contradiction , the initial vows being to God are all that are needed. Thereafter the Essene should tell only the truth so no further swearing on oath is necessary. In Matthew 's gospel , in the Sermon on the Mount ( Mt 5 : 34-37 ) , Jesus has exactly the same rule for his converts. Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God 's throne : nor by the earth; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be , Yea , yea; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil . </swear.v.2312><swear.v.2313>Matthew 5 : 33-37 is another popular passage supposedly addressing this issue , and when people use it to prove their point about cussing ( usually with an air of superiority that indicates that the matter is settled ) , I get so annoyed I want to wish upon them one of those really painful zits right under the nose. We ' ve all had the verse hurled at us ( or perhaps have been the hurl-ee ) : Do not swear at all , the author cautions , either by heaven , for it is God ' s throne; or by earth , for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great king. </swear.v.2313><swear.v.2314>I can understand a few contexts in which swearing is understandable ( child labor especially ! even though I did n't ) , but my problem is when someone uses swear words as part of a normal conversation.

" It is ridiculous to make such a distinction; yet the Apostle has used even this form , " I die daily , by your boasting. " ( 1Co 15 , 31 ) That this does not mean , your boasting has caused my dying daily , but is an oath , is clear from the Greek , which is . </swear.v.2318><swear.v.2319>I answer that , Two things are to be considered in an oath. One is on the part of God , whose testimony is invoked , and in this respect we should hold an oath in the greatest reverence. For this reason children before the age of puberty are debarred from taking oaths [ *Caus. XXII , qu. 5 , can. Parvuli ] , and are not called upon to swear , because they have not yet attained the perfect use of reason , so as to be able to take a oath with due reverence. Perjurers also are debarred from taking an oath , because it is presumed from their antecedents that they will not treat an oath with the reverence due to it. For this same reason , in order that oaths might be treated with due reverence the law says ( 22 , qu. v , can. Honestum ) : " It is becoming that he who ventures to swear on holy things should do so fasting , with all propriety and fear of God. " </swear.v.2319><swear.v.2320>Yes , Americans are proud of their country ( most of the time ) and its constitution. Most citizens of most countries are proud of their countries. Unlike many countries , however , the United States is not based on territory or ethnicity , but on the concepts embedded in the constitution. That 's why federal officials swear an oath to it rather to a ruler or a vague concept of country. Without the constitution , we would n't be Americans. It makes us who we are , and no matter what our ethnicity or national origins , it binds us together . </swear.v.2320><swear.v.2321>When I was asked to swear an oath , three books were pointed out to me and I was told I could place my hand on any or none. The Bible , the Koran , the Torah. As I am Christian and knew what I was about to swear was the truth , I placed my hand on the Bible. But I was representing only myself not 300 million people . </swear.v.2321><swear.v.2322>Although a JP must receive an information and sign it after you have sworn its contents to be true , the JP can refuse to issue a summons.

There is nothing to prevent you from going to another JP , though you may have to swear another information . </swear.v.2322><swear.v.2323>Remove the reference to God. Its not constitutional and a bad idea. The notion that swearing the oath to God makes the oath more powerful is a feel good assumption and nothing more , which is why the forefathers did not include it in the Constitution . </swear.v.2323><swear.v.2324>If one were to ask a person on the street not to swear the reply would be a quick 'No ' followed by a stream of expletives. People defend their right to swear as if they were protecting their freedom. They feel it as an attack on their character and a restriction of their liberty. Being told what to say and what not to say these days by another person seems unthinkable to many. This is because capitalism believes freedom of speech and freedom of expression are two of the sublime values that all human societies should aspire to. It means that humans should be able to express themselves in whatever way they feel necessary as long as their viewpoint or position is made . </swear.v.2324><swear.v.2325>Totally me too.

We hired him to do a job , and he ' s doing it well. Electing a president is not like hiring a landscaper. We didn ' t just hire Mr. Clinton to keep the economy in shape. We hired him to uphold and defend the Constitution , and we made him swear on a Bible that he would. He didn ' t do that. He has , in fact , become a poster child for broken vows. Not only did he trample on the vow he made to his wife. He has broken his sacred vow to the American people , the vow to uphold and defend the Constitution. Instead , he used the immense power entrusted to him in an elaborate , ongoing attempt to thwart the very laws he swore to defend . </swear.v.2326><swear.v.2327>A swear word said in frustration is a different beast , of course , and may even be reasonable when , for instance , you hit your thumb with a hammer. But for some , any swearing is offensive , and I want my children to understand this. Even the Prime Minister is not immune : Mr Rudd was chastised in the press for having sworn in a private meeting. That does n't seem fair , but it underlines the enduring power of swear words to confront and shock . </swear.v.2327><swear.v.2328>Obs. That an excellent way to prevent swearing is to use a constant truth in our speeches , then we need not interpose an oath; the credit of our communication will be enough. Oaths give suspicion of men 's falseness and lightness. If men were serious and sincere in their discourses , their word would be equivalent to an oath , and their very affirming would be swearing; whereas others in a doubtful case are hardly credited , though they swear never so deeply , because they swear so commonly; for having prostituted the highest and most solemn way of assurance to every trifle , they have nothing left wherewith to establish a controverted truth . </swear.v.2328><swear.v.2329>In addition to the adjectives used to describe flaming , certain visual , typographic attributes of messages can also lead receivers to perceive a message as a flame. Extejt ( 1998 ) , in an article on email etiquette in the business arena , warns against using all capital letters in any context , noting that it is " the equivalent of screaming " ( p. 63 ) . Cleary and Freeman ( 2005 ) add : " Some construe large bold font in uppercase as aggressive. Colour it red and it could be considered swearing ! " ( p. 63 ) . Another visual aspect of email is the use of emoticons ( smiley faces : ) , sad faces : ( , or other symbols ) meant to mimic emotional or facial cues not present in text-only communication. Acronyms such as LOL ! ( laughing out loud ) and J/K ( just kidding ) could also have an effect on how receivers perceive a message . </swear.v.2329><swear.v.2330>We said that the requirement to swear an Oath or make an Affirmation has gradually and in our view , regretfully , been weakened. In 1986 , on the recommendation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission , the requirement for new citizens to renounce all other allegiance was abolished. In addition , they no longer had to state their names. We find the latter difficult to understand. The requirement to state one ' s name when making an Oath emphasizes the personal nature of the commitment. Then in 1993 , arguing this would further the cause of multiculturalism , the Oath of Allegiance , in which the new citizen also swore to observe the laws of Australia and fulfil his or her duties as an Australian citizen , was abolished. The Oath was sworn on the Bible , or in a way consistent with the new citizen ' s religion , while those without a religion or who objected to swearing an Oath could make an Affirmation. This was replaced by a watered down pledge , read by large groups in unison . </swear.v.2330><swear.v.2331>" I , ( State your name ) , swear to sign away 4 years of my life to the UNITED STATES AIR FORCE because I know I could n't hack it in the Army , because the Marines frighten me , and because I am afraid of water over waist-deep.

This is principally based on Matthew 5 : 34-37 , the Antithesis of the Law. Here , Christ is written to say " I say to you : 'Swear not at all ' " . The Apostle James stated in James 5 : 12 , " Above all , my brothers , do not swear not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your " Yes " be yes , and your " No , " no , or you will be condemned.

' So here you may see the use of the true oath , and swearing by the Lord , and it was to come before his altar in his house; which house , and oath , and altar , and law , has Christ ended and fulfilled; and all these before mentioned did not swear by books or creatures , or any other name , but by the Lord in the old time , which ' was to be performed to the Lord.

That is not what the Constitution says.

Proof of service is very important because if you can not show that you have served the documents on a party you will not be able to get a judgment. If you can not prove service of a Summons on a witness , and the witness does not show up , the adjudicator may continue the hearing without your witness.To prove service , the server must swear an Affidavit of Service Form 20 in front of a Commissioner of Oaths. A Commissioner of Oaths is someone who has the power to witness a sworn statement. All lawyers are Commissioners of Oaths , as well as are a number of other people. The Affidavit of Service states that the server gave the document to the party being served. After the server has signed it , the Commissioner of Oaths will then sign and date the form. If the server used registered/certified mail or courier , the party being served must sign the signed receipt or acknowledgement card that must be attached to the Affidavit of Service . </swear.v.2366><swear.v.2367>Next , the Crown called the Barons and Baronesses of Court and declared they were welcome in their Court.

Henchard does everything to an extreme : he can not merely be dissatisfied with married life but , instead , must feel the need to sell his wife; he can not drink responsibly but , instead , must swear off liquor for twenty-one years , only to return to it with an alcoholic ' s vengeance. Similarly , just as his emotions for Farfrae run hot or cold , his extreme contempt for Elizabeth-Jane becomes a boundless and needy love. The extremity of Henchard ' s passions is , in large part , responsible for the severity of his fall. Hardy , appropriating the words of the eighteenth-century German writer Novalis , stresses that [ c ] haracter is Fate. Henchard ' s response to his bankruptcy hearing validates such a hypothesis. His extreme emotions and inability to compromise or show restraint lead him to sell his last valuable possession , his gold watch.

So that this has led not only to an explanation of that in Lord 's Day 36 , but now it goes into it some more in Lord 's Day 37 , it does n't do that with any of the other commandments. And we would think for example , that it would do that in regard to various others rather than this one , because it seems so clear.

Further , the necessity of the swearing must be qualified by some greater good , i.e. it must enable people to believe what it is to their benefit to believe. 20 With Augustine we find the an early articulation of the justified oath : the criteria of the just oath ( the term is ours ) are similar to those he developed for the just war.

Therefore , what do you think will become of all you who swear by so many things in all christendom and in the world; for if ' they shall fall and not rise up again , who swear by the sin of Samaria , and the manner of Beersheba , ' which was forbidden by God in the law and prophets; therefore , I say , what will become of you Christendom that swear by so many things when Christ in his gospel commands you , ' not to swear at all ?

Counting or saying the alphabet in reverse , trying to concentrate on something complicated , or just trying to ignore the hiccups until they go away are other distraction based cures.

It is pretty messed up for a student to get fined money for swearing at a teacher or to his or her friend. If you swear at a teacher , you should get a detention or a suspension. Making someone pay over $ 100 for saying something that perhaps was fueled by the teachers own temper is not right. There 's just so many angles that are wrong with making that law.

So that in this commandment we see , you are not to take His Name in vain; woe to him that swears falsely. God says that too ! Woe to him that swears and then does n't keep his vow. And therefore also Psalm 15 which we will sing at the close this morning , the Psalmist speaks of that , even though he vows to his hurt , he will keep it. Though he realizes that now if he fulfills that promise , it is not going to be profitable. Nevertheless , he keeps it. He does not change , because that is too dangerous. He is standing here under the truth of God , and that has to be upheld . </swear.v.2431><swear.v.2432>The idea that by swearing oath over a version of the constitution that includes the post-November 3 amendments , such amendments will magically become an integral part of the fundamental law is , to put it mildly , preposterous. What if " Alice in Wonderland " was mistakenly printed and appended within the bind of the constitution distributed in the parliament ? Would the members then be duty-bound to preserve and protect the fable as part of our constitution ? Placing the hand over a book during the oath taking ceremony is symbolic. What matters is the content of the oath. And the oath under Article 65 of the constitution requires members to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of Pakistan. And there is only one Constitution of Pakistan , the content of which is objectively verifiable as the constitution itself provides a mechanism to do so . </swear.v.2432><swear.v.2433>I am niether religious nor a child , yet stumbling across your debate , i can not help but sit in awe of your debate.

He lived on an island in the Danube and liked to commute to work in a rowboat. But knowing there were problems ahead for the Jews , he decided to split his family up. He bought them forged papers and he bribed a government official to take 14-year-old George Soros in and swear that he was his Christian godson. But survival carried a heavy price tag.

Davide ACTED even if the Court could not have validly declared the Presidency vacant and authorized him to swear in the Vice President.

The most usual is the explicit " I swear , " but any statement or promise that includes " with * as my witness " or " so help me * , " with '* ' being something or someone the oath-taker holds sacred , is an oath. Many people take an oath by holding in their hand or placing over their head a book of scripture or a sacred object , thus indicating the sacred witness through their action : such an oath is called corporal. However , the chief purpose of such an act is for ceremony or solemnity , and the act does not of itself make an oath.

God Himself takes an oath so that we might be encouraged ( Heb. 6 : 17 ) . Jesus is addressing a narrow and misleading legalism that required a specific oath to make spoken words binding. The implication of such an approach to honesty is that we do not need to be truthful except under oath. Jesus demands an integrity of speech as though everything were under oath.

It is , however , true that what the Prophet ( PBUH ) has stated about the evil and sinfulness of showing off implies that it is also a ( minor ) Shirk. For instance he stated that " He who kept fast or offered Salat for mere show , has indeed committed Shirk.'' In any case , to take oath of anyone other than Allah is strictly forbidden.

This is what it came down to in the garden -- God ' s character. Is God trustworthy ?

Such vows are usually made in desperation , in an effort to convince our neighbors that our promises will be kept. We say , " I swear to God that I will repay you " or some such thing. Our need to make such vows is aggravated by the fact that we have been less than truthful in the past , so James says ( quoting Jesus , see Matt. 5 : 37 ) : " Let your Yes ' be yes , and your No , ' no , or you will be condemned. " We make such vows thinking that our neighbors are the only ones who can relieve our desperate situations.

Because everyone " knows " that you swear an oath to God and on the Bible to tell the truth , then you will attract attention even if you make arrangements ahead of time. It is more likely that this attention will lean negative because so many people associate morality with God and Christianity. Anyone refusing or failing to swear to God will thus become suspicious to at least a percentage of observers . </swear.v.2516><swear.v.2517>The human urge to swear is older than the Bible : Moses wouldn ' t have commanded the Israelites to stop taking the Lord ' s name in vain if they weren ' t doing it. In fact , swearing is at least as old as language. By associating an object , however indirectly , with our sexuality , waste products , religion or race we are rooting it in very deep , important parts of ourselves. So while most educated people can turn swearing on and off quite easily , the exception is when they ' re really angry or emotionally involved.

Plus a kid that swears is more shocking than an adult that does. When they get older ... around 14 or 15 - when they start to reach maturity I would n't mind if they swore a little bit to express themselves. Sometimes you need to throw in an s-h-i-t or a f-u-c-k to emphasize your thoughts.

The corporate , or corporal both , is the name of the linen cloth on which , in the Roman Catholic Church , the sacred elements consecrated as " the body of our Lord " are placed. Hence the expression corporal oath originated in the ancient custom of swearing while touching the corporal cloth. Relics were sometimes made use of. The laws of the Allemanni ( chapter 657 ) , direct that he who swears shall place his hand upon the coffer containing the relics. The idea being that something sacred must be touched by the hand of the jurator to give validity to the oath , in time the custom was adopted of substituting the holy Gospels for the corporal cloth or the relics , though the same title was retained . </swear.v.2536><swear.v.2537>Islamabad 's air is heavy with symbolism.

But if any one being compelled to swear , swears by anything whatever in a manner which the law does not forbid , let him exert himself with all his strength and by every means in his power to give effect to his oath , interposing no hindrance to prevent the accomplishment of the matter thus ratified , especially if neither implacable anger or frenzied love , or unrestrained appetites agitate the mind , so that it does not know what is said or done , but if the oath has been taken with sober reason and deliberate purpose. For what is better than to speak with perfect truth throughout one 's whole life , and to prove this by the evidence of God himself ? For an oath is nothing else but the testimony of God invoked in a matter which is a subject of doubt , and to invoke God to witness a statement which is not true is the most impious of all things . </swear.v.2540><swear.v.2541>My opinion is this : Use them sparingly , if at all.

It is clear that God ' s concern in this passage was that Abraham possess assurance as he reflected on God ' s promises , as he reflected on God ' s oath , as he reflected on the covenant. God is concerned that we would walk in assurance , too. For an assured Christian is an energetic Christian , and a doubting Christian is a weak Christian. And so God wants us to feel the certainty of His promises. I want to remind you of one more thing before we walk away from this great passage here. As far as we know , these were the last words that God ever spoke to Abraham. Eight times the Lord spoke audibly to Abraham in his life.

If this sort of evidence were admissible in the case of either party no limit could be placed on the number of witnesses who could be called to testify about the credibility of witnesses as to facts. It would tend to produce , regardless of the number of such character witnesses who were called , undue confusion in the minds of the jury by directing their attention away from the real issues and the controversy would become so intricate that truth would be more likely to remain hidden than be discovered. For these reasons this evidence was not admissible . </swear.v.2554><swear.v.2555>Hello All , I don ' t swear on my blog mainly because as a parent I ' ll like to keep my posts family friendly.

[ 3 ] Cohen went on to say It 's a shame that this matter can not be resolved sooner. All we have ever asked is that people of all faiths be able to put their hands on the holy text of their choice. It 's that simple. We do n't understand why this is such a big deal.

In Deuteronomy 6 : 13 , for example , Scripture commands God 's people " You shall fear only the Lord your God; and you shall worship Him , and swear by His name. " Far from prohibiting all oaths , Isaiah tells us that " he who swears in the earth shall swear by the name of God " ( Is. 65 : 16 ) . God sanctions lawful oaths to such an extent that He promises to build up those who swear by His name ( Jer. 12 : 16 ) . Even in the mundane affairs of life , such as confirming the truth between disputing neighbors , God commands His people to swear before Him ( Ex. 22 : 10-11 ) . Because Scripture commands God 's people to swear by His name , it can not forbid all oaths. God does not command what He simultaneously condemns ! </swear.v.2562><swear.v.2563>" Again , you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times , " You shall not swear falsely , but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord .

They would swear by Heaven , they would swear by the throne of God. They were so loose with the truth that they would use these objects as a measure of the degree with which they should keep their oath ! Jesus speaks of these things and says in Matthew 23 : 16 : Woe to you , blind guides , who say , ' Whoever swears by the temple , it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple , he is obliged to perform it.

I told him I was a man of a tender conscience , and if they had any sense of a tender conscience they would consider that it was in obedience to Christ 's command that I could not swear. " But , " said I , " if any of you can convince me that after Christ and the apostle had commanded not to swear , they altered that command and commanded Christians to swear , then ye shall see I will swear.

A better publicity stunt would be to play at being Cato the Elder , and say , " President Bush must be impeached " after every speech he gives in the Council. Or to just do what lots of politicians and journalists and regular citizens are already doing; spending time and money trying to convince people to support impeachment of the President and/or an electoral defeat for the GOP . </swear.v.2578><swear.v.2579>It is equally important for the lawyers who do their estate planning. A testator 's inability to understand written English raises a red flag and rebuts any legal presumption regarding his or her knowledge and approval of the contents of a Will. It is imperative that those propounding a Will be able to show that the testator had knowledge and approval of the contents of the Will. Some lawyers videotape both the instructions and execution process and others engage the services of professional translators to translate the Will to the testator and then swear an affidavit evidencing the translation. Without taking proper steps to ensure that the testator understands and approves of the content of the Will , the gifting provisions are open to challenge by the disinherited and the lawyers who drafted them are potentially liable to disappointed beneficiaries . </swear.v.2579><swear.v.2580>One of the challenges to recovery is that alcoholics can abstain from drinking and drug addicts can swear off drugs , but people have to buy things.

David 's father is a respected doctor who has grand plans to mold his son in his own image. David 's best friend , however , is Malcolm , a black boy. Though his father barely tolerates the relationship , he has also sworn to shoot Malcolm if he should ever step foot in their house. The boys manage their friendship for a few years , even as David learns more and more about his father 's night time activities. And as he comes closer to fulfilling his father 's dreams , David also comes closer to disgust with everything his father represents.

Essentially , this is his story as he tries to figure out his messed up life. I did n't enjoy one minute of this book. It was full up of mature content that was unacceptable. It was yet another book filled with swearing and foul language. I skimmed through the last bit and found that the ending was pointless with only more problems created and nothing resolved.

So there are some of our young men surrounded by an atmosphere of profanities. Curses sit on their lips , they roll under their tongues , and nest in the shock of hair.

Their vision was not simply one of not swearing; it was of being people of transparency who belonged to communities of truthfulness. Like most Christians throughout time and space , the Anabaptists didn ' t always do what they wanted to do. Occasionally , as we have noticed , they swore oaths , especially when they were recanting to be able to return from banishment to return to their families. And they often asked what does truthfulness require ? What does it mean , when in danger , to tell the truth ? One of the best-known stories about Menno Simons may be apocryphal; but it has lived on in Anabaptist-Mennonite folklore because it points to a perennial problem for people who are committed to being truthful. The story runs like this : </swear.v.2633><swear.v.2634>The person will be required to write out his/her personal information such as full name , birth date , permanent place of residence , what was lost or stolen , and the particulars of how the identification came to be lost or stolen.

The Prophet ( Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam ) enjoined Muslims to say " I swear by the Lord of the Kabah " , and " If Allah and then The Prophet willed " , because " and " means equality in status and no one has the same status as Allah.

Tom desperately wants to drink and swear; he can not stand the torture of abstinence and wants to give up the order. Only the facts that the fourth of July is approaching and Judge Frazer is on his deathbed stop him. He knows that the Cadets will march in both the funeral parade and the Independence Day parade. In the end , he can not hold out and resigns the order. The night of his resignation , the judge dies. Tom is disappointed that he can not take part in the funeral march since he is no longer a Cadet. The fourth of July is also a disappointment , especially since it rains. But Tom is glad to be free again; he is also amazed that he no longer has the urge to drink or swear . </swear.v.2698><swear.v.2699>Let 's come straight to the point.

In the picture of the false worship , the flying roll or scroll ( v 3 ) is a " curse " which " declares innocent " ( " naqah " -- not " cut off " as in AV ) those who steal and swear falsely.

In particular , the grand assize was a royal monopoly. The magnates , indeed , desired to adopt it , but they had difficulty in getting together twelve knights willing to act as jurors.1 Whatever hopes the barons entertained of overcoming such difficulties were disappointed : in 1259 the Provisions of Westminster declared that freeholders should not be compelled to swear against their will since no one can make them do this without the King ' s warrant. 2 It was the deliberate policy of Edward I. to exaggerate all such difficulties , putting every obstacle in the way of private courts , until he reduced their jurisdictions to sinecures.3 </swear.v.2733><swear.v.2734>Full accountability , that 's what I will have to take if I keep on swearing in front of my child.

As we look at the various statements by Anabaptists on oath-taking we find four. A first concern , especially important to the Swiss Brethren , was humility. The authorities might require people to swear what they are going to do , but the future is known only to God. Jesus had said , in Matthew 5 , ' You can not make one hair white or black. ' You see , thereby all swearing is forbidden. We can not perform what is promised in swearing , for we are not able to change the smallest part of ourselves. 33 Some Anabaptists stated a second concern : that baptism was their sacrament which excluded the possibility of their swearing oaths. In their baptism they had died to their old ways and had been resurrected into new life in Christ. Baptism was their true oath; it was a sacramentum ( Latin for oath ) that bound them to Christ and to each other. Christians could take no oath of allegiance except that which they have already taken in baptism to their Lord , Jesus Christ , and to his church.34 </swear.v.2740><swear.v.2741>I started giving my grand aunt lecithin , to improve her memory and it worked like a miracle !

By Myself I have sworn , ' declares the Lord , 'because you have done this thing , and have not withheld your son , your only son , indeed I will greatly bless you , and I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens , and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed , because you have obeyed My voice.

Since , the Jews had heard God say , " Heaven is My throne , and earth is My footstool , " they would swear by such things. In prohibiting them from swearing by these things , the Lord does not say , " Do not swear by them because heaven is good and great , and earth is useful. " Instead He says , " Do not swear by them because the one is the throne of God and the other is His footstool , " so that idolatry would not occur.

However , of these cases , many involved technical errors or miskennings , mistakes in pleading. For instance , in Langbaurgh v. Bytham ( 1287 ) , one of the compurgators accidentally named the plaintiff when he should have named the defendant ( SCLM , i , 20 ); in Legge v. Mildenhall ( 1291 ) , the defendant failed to repeat the plaintiff ' s count exactly in the course of his denial ( SCLM , i , 46 ) . These errors would have resulted in defaults in other English courts as well , and so do not point to any deficiency in the defendants ' knowledge of mercantile law. In other cases , such as Risborough v. Russell ( 1275 ) , the defendant was unable to find a sufficient number of compurgators ( SP , 150 ) . This may indicate that he did not know how many to bring , but it may also indicate that the defendant was widely known to have been guilty , and that few people at the fair were willing to endanger their souls by swearing to his innocence . </swear.v.2745><swear.v.2746>the dna aviden tha was foud who wasit and what was about ... ... and is he gilty our not ... ... do you swear that is the thurt so help you GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.. </swear.v.2746><swear.v.2747>Again , you have heard that it was said to the people long ago , Do not break your oath , but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.

Then the meaning is , that it is not more lawful to swear by heaven or by the earth , than openly by the name of God. The reason is mentioned by Christ because the glory of God is everywhere inscribed , and everywhere shines forth. Nay , men take the words , heaven and earth , in their oaths , in no other sense and for no other purpose , than if they named God himself; for by thus speaking they only designate the Worker by his works . </swear.v.2791><swear.v.2792>We fashioned pipes out of large acorns and used a grass reed as the pipe stem.

As the writer of Hebrews states : " Men swear by someone greater than themselves , and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument " ( Heb. 6 : 16; see also Gen. 26 : 28ff; 31 : 44 ) . Oaths , rather than becoming a basis for peace , became a source of contention. In disobedience to the law that says they are only to make an oath in the name of God ( Deut. 6 : 13 ) , the Jews would swear in the name of things close to God. They hoped that what they swore by was not close enough to God , so that they would be excused from their oath. This would oftentimes lead to litigation and a determination would have to be made whether the oath was binding. So , rather than preserving peace as originally intended , the oaths , as used by men , caused dissension . </swear.v.2823><swear.v.2824>You swear by writers ' workshops.

He will not swear that he did not , but he has no recollection on the subject.

Not dissimilar reasoning was found among the Essenes , who avoided taking oaths , " regarding it as worse than perjury for they say that one who is not believed without an appeal to God stands condemned already " ( Jos. War II , 135 [ viii.6 ] ) -- though they did require " tremendous oaths " of neophytes joining the community ( ibid. , 139 [ viii.7 ]; cf. 1QS 5 : 7-11; CD 15 : 5 ) . </swear.v.2835><swear.v.2836>No , segregation was wrong because it violated the Constitution of the United States of America.

The grant is issued once the Registry considers and approves the application. Some time thereafter , the Capital Taxes Office will also consider the executor ' s account.

When Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker ' s book The Stuff of Thought argued that swearing was an emotional trigger for the brain and often used to arouse equally negative responses in others , we nodded reluctantly. But when Messrs Vishal Bhardwaj and Anurag Kashyap , professors-in-vogue of profane linguistics , peppered their scripts in Ishqiya , Omkara , Dev D and Gulaal with fiery obscenities rolling off the tongues of even their female characters , Pinker started making sense. Emotion has no gender , but it has a nationality. The answer also lies in a dialogue in Karan Johar ' s My Name is Khan , when two young TV interns find themselves jostled in a crowd impatient to see the American president. The boy curses in Hindi , and the girl smiles and comments , Hindustani gaali ke jaisi koi gaali nahin hoti ! ( There is nothing like swearing in Hindustani ) .

Suppose the law required that jurors swear an oath to well and truly try the case , render a true verdict according only to the evidence presented , and convict all black defendants.

What makes Christianity so great ? We have something brand new in human history. In the New Covenant , Christianity is built upon one simple revolutionary fact : for the first time in history , God has sworn the oath and taken upon himself the curse. It 's almost as if God said , " I am going to save you , as I promised , but I am going to transform that promise into an oath by swearing an oath and taking upon myself the curse.

If God swore by oath in the Old Testament , if the Lord Jesus was put under oath in the New Testament , if Paul does it on occasions right through the epistles , and Hebrews says that God swore to us about our salvation under an oath - what does the Lord mean when He says : 'Swear not at all ' ?

Through the oath the unwilling person is compelled [ to receive ] punishment and justice and whatever is necessary for common tranquility. Through the oath the laws and covenants are established and kept. Likewise , peace is also made through it. And without the oath ? Society would descend into chaos. Bullinger goes on : So if you now take the oath away , this is all dissolved , counts for nothing , and all together becomes nothing , resulting in such complete confusion and disorder that it is impossible to describe. 28 </swear.v.2884><swear.v.2885>Sharina is regular grandma age.

They argued that the oath is Biblical : it was not difficult to find passages from the Hebrew Scriptures as well as from Pauline epistles and even the gospels to justify swearing oaths.26 It was also easy to establish that the oath is Necessary. In 1560 the Swiss Reformer Heinrich Bullinger put it succinctly : The oath is the button , which holds together the whole body of the common good. Bullinger ' s argument is the same , in 16th century Protestant Christendom , as that of the pagan Lycurgus in 4th century BC Athens. It was as evident to the Protestant Reformers as it was to the ancient pagans that there could be no social cohesion without the oath.27 Clearly we are dealing here with something that is profound and primal . </swear.v.2896><swear.v.2897>To obtain this document from the Embassy , a Canadian citizen must present himself/herself to the Consular Section and must complete and swear an Affidavit to the effect that there is no impediment to the proposed marriage.

As affidavits are essentially testimony in written form , they must be sworn under an oath which is similar to the one used by witnesses in court. The problem is that only certain people can adminster the oath for swearing an affidavit. In British Columbia , these people are most commonly lawyers and notaries who charge anywhere from $ 24.99 to $ 69.99 per affidavit.

When councillors were told of this the lead member on the Burrows , Andrew Eastman , forcibly pointed out that an ex-councillor who knew the area intimately had seen drums actually labelled " Cyanide " being dumped into the tip and was willing to swear an affidavit to the truth of this.

The union ' s lawyer advised SLDF that they were willing to protect this employee and to protect her actions under a section of the Forest Practices Code , which is commonly known as the Whistle Blower Provision.

With the advent of Christendom , Christians began to justify swearing oaths. Leading this change was the now Christian imperial court , which thought it obvious that the operation of government required witnesses to be bound by the sanctity of the oath. 15 The people of the empire , who were rapidly being Christianized , at times lightly , were also eager to swear. As pagans they had sworn in many circumstances : and now that they were Christians they , to John Chrysostom ' s disgust , still swore in the marketplace , at work , at home : Whether you are buying vegetables or arguing over two obols or threatening your servants in your anger , you always call on God as your witness. 16 </swear.v.2926><swear.v.2927>For older children , as for adults , swearing is often a sign of anger , rather than just wanting to make an impact on others.

Other people decide the kid is n't the " right " kid for leadership opportunities. Some people just hear the curse words and figure that anyone who was intelligent could express themselves more eloquently. They may see some curse words as degrading or linquistically violent. And that 's why a lot of people do n't want their kids to swear. It 's hard to teach your kids not to swear if they always hear adults doing it.

The better reading of the Constitutional text , I think , is that the oath is wholly non-performative; Obama did indeed become President at noon without regard to the oath. But he was still correct to retake the oath , for an entirely different reason : because it 's his responsibility to do the things the Constitution directs him to do.

When he refused to move , he was arrested for violating the " Jim Crow Car Act of 1890. " The incident led to the Supreme Court case in which all but Justice Harlan voted against Plessy , affirming the right of states to enact segregation laws. The " separate but equal " ruling set the stage for the rampant racial discrimination that followed in the Deep South. In many cities and towns , African Americans were not allowed to share a taxi with whites or enter a building through the same entrance. They had to drink from separate water fountains , use separate restrooms , attend separate schools , and even swear on separate Bibles and be buried in separate cemeteries.

But the Court rejected this interpretation of Maryland law and did not pass upon or approve the definitions of subversive person and organization contained in the Maryland statutes. Instead , it made very clear that the judgment below was affirmed solely on the basis that the actual oath to be imposed under Maryland law requires one to swear that he is not a person who is engaged " in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violence , ' and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt.

The Constitution provides that the President be elected through an electoral college , with membership equal to the number of Senators and Representatives from each state. It authorizes Congress to determine when elections are held , when the Electoral College meets , and when the new President takes the oath of office. The Constitution also requires that the President must be a native born citizen of the United States , have lived in this country for at least fourteen years , and have attained the age of thirty-five. It even specifies the oath of office that the new President should swear or affirm.

Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised , he confirmed it with an oath.

Many public personalities are at the forefront of this , football players , Hollywood stars and rap artists all contribute their share of swear words for society to absorb. Swearing has become a standard in life that is common in most places and situations , whether one is walking in a high street , studying in a classroom or simply watching television.

The first injunction is simple : Do not swear. Jewish rabbis had been growing increasingly severe in their critique of promiscuous oath-taking; Jesus went one step further : he prohibited oath-taking altogether. Jesus ' second injunction is a corollary of the first : Tell the truth : Let your words be yes , yes , or no , no. This , says exegete Paul Minear , is a command for transparently honest speech .9 There is , for Jesus ' disciples , to be one level of truth-telling , which they practice all the time; not two levels , depending on whether or not they are under oath. There is also a warning : this is very important , an area of spiritual danger. Anything more than the simple yes and no comes from the evil one. Justifying two levels of truth gives Satan a big foothold. In this passage , Jesus is appealing to his disciples : don ' t be people who are sometimes true and at other times economical with truth : be people who are transparent , transparently honest , all the time . </swear.v.3146><swear.v.3147>By 1914 , there were several hundred members , perhaps as many as 2500.

It presents the swearer as someone who is either less intelligent or lower class. Swears often take the place of stronger and equally powerful vocabulary words. For less intelligent people , that may be all they have at their disposal in their verbal artillery . </swear.v.3153><swear.v.3154>Inhale/ Exhale is as straightforward as breathing itself. I Swear ... , the Ohio band 's Solid State sophomore release , is refreshing in equal measure for its love of heavy diverse music as it is the depth to which it mines classic rock. " We have our own style of rock. " States Larussa , echoing a sentiment shared by singer Ryland Raus. " We feel that it 's structured well , and that it brings people in. We want someone to pop our disc in on the way to work if they need to hear something that will lift them up , and at the same time hear something with passion and raw energy. " Thrash metal ( including Bay Area legends Testament ) , singer-songwriters ( ever heard of Johnny Cash ? ) and even a bit of country music informs what Inhale/ Exhale brings forth : emotionally moving but brutal tunes. Best of all , Inhale/ Exhale 's songs make sense. The landscape is cluttered with bands who have no idea how to string their riffs together. In contrast they 've gone to great lengths to structure things properly , and take their musicianship seriously . </swear.v.3154><swear.v.3155>What about Peter ? He was a seaman.

That ' s because to survive in the rough sea , they themselves have to be rough . </swear.v.3155><swear.v.3156>Your reaction will influence whether your child swears again. Staying calm is the key.

Very blessed is it to note her further word to the spies : " Now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the Lord , since I have showed you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father ' s house , and give me a true token : And that ye will save alive my father , and my mother , and my brethren , and my sisters , and all that they have , and deliver our lives from death " ( Josh. 2 : 12 , 13 ) . Some contracted hearts , in which the very milk of human kindness seems to have congealed , would deem Rahab ' s request highly presumptuous. Personally , we believe that her soul was so overflowing with gratitude unto the Lord for His saving such an abandoned wretch , that her faith now perceived something of the infinitude of the Divine mercy , and believed that such a God would be willing to show grace unto the whole of her family. Nor was she disappointed . </swear.v.3157><swear.v.3158>He ( a.s. ) said , Certainly , Musa , the Prophet of Allah commanded you not to swear falsely by Allah.

It makes it as I say , it tells you that it ' s real. It tells you that I really mean business here. I ' m just not saying a word , I ' m giving an oath to swear that I will tell the truth , and the whole truth , and so forth. And what it does , it said ,  The oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. It says , okay , this is it. So let it be written , so let it be done.

They do not prohibit the proving of a true fact by oath. However when a situation arises where it becomes obligatory to take an oath , then one must swear only by Allah. Oath by any other object or personality will not be absolutely correct and from the Shariat point of view the matter will not end conclusively. Similarly if one has to take an oath for performing a particular action in the future , in this case too , one must swear only by Allah. Any other vow does not have any legal standing . </swear.v.3167><swear.v.3168>So this one oath by the Lord , that people was to swear by his name in the time of the law , it was a type of that oath that the Lord swore concerning his Son , who ends and forbids this true oath in the old time of the law , who comes to fulfil the law , and gathers people into his own name above every name , where salvation is; and commands them , let their yes be yes , and no , no , for whatever is more is evil.

He was so firmly wrapped round and tucked in and folded over , that he could not get out. He , of course , made frantic struggles for freedom - the birthright of every Englishman , - and , in doing so ( I learned this afterwards ) , knocked over George; and then George , swearing at Harris , began to struggle too , and got himself entangled and rolled up . </swear.v.3170><swear.v.3171>Who wants what.

Unfortunately , learning this method takes about as much time and practice as learning the Dewey decimal system. Plus you are then at the mercy of the few dictionaries that are arranged according to the numbering scheme of the four-corner system. Those who have mastered this system usually swear by it. The rest of us just swear . </swear.v.3172><swear.v.3173>In addition to being nominated by at least two registered voters of the Electoral district for which the candidate seeks election , the candidate is required to swear an affidavit in Form No. 13 that he is not disqualified under the Constitution from contesting and being elected to a seat in the House of Assembly . </swear.v.3173><swear.v.3174>An easy request , swear to God , you walked on the moon - the only reason they would respond in a way of violence , rather than simply swearing to God , is they can not swear to God , because that would be a lie.

I think we 're going to see that one big reason why sacraments are so little understood these days is because an oath is even less understood. Where do we find oaths in modern society ? I mean , how in our own experience do we relate ourselves to oaths in a meaningful way ? Well , the President takes an oath of office as soon as he assumes the presidency. We also hear physicians swearing the Hippocratic Oath. We also know that immigrants who want to be naturalized as citizens have to take an oath as well. When you enter the military you frequently have to take an oath or when you register to vote , you have to take an oath . </swear.v.3176><swear.v.3177>The oath begins with an option to swear or affirm. Although current common law places less religious connotation on the word swear , the term oath clearly had such a connotation in the late 1700s. In fact , the original legislation referred to an oath or affirmation. Recognizing that some religious groups , such as the Quakers , might object to swearing to a Supreme Being or that someone might not believe in a Supreme Being , Congress provided the option to affirm. This wording is also consistent with the option for the president to swear or affirm , as prescribed in Article 2 of the Constitution. Either way , the oath signifies a public statement of personal commitment. Officers must take personal responsibility for their actions . </swear.v.3177><swear.v.3178>Swearwords are typically introduced into language as general terms , but later they acquire a status as terms of insult or some other unpleasant usage. Swearwords adjust to the society. Often they corrupt and change as we ( intentionally or not ) create " milder " , disguised versions of them. This is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to define what counts as swearing and what does not. The ways of swearing transform as well as the swearwords themselves. Apparently there has been a major shift in the style of swearing from " high " to " low " , meaning that before it was very common to use swearwords related to heaven and God ( the sacred ) but later it has become more general to use the profane expressions , related to sex and bodily functions. These changes reflect the social developments that also have taken place ( Hughes 4 , 236-7 , 249 ) . </swear.v.3178><swear.v.3179>Every candidate for election shall be nominated on one nomination paper by at least two registered voters of the electoral district for which the candidate seeks election.

Kennon is just plain wrong. The fact is that all Presidents starting with FDR have said " So help me God. " ( Herbert Hoover is the last President who did not. ) Kennon was wrong again when he said , " Franklin Pierce is one of only two presidents who affirmed the Oath of Office , rather than swore the Oath of Office. " Pierce is the only President who did not swear to his oath of office. ( Hoover , and Eisenhower actually swore to their oath of office . ) </swear.v.3180><swear.v.3181>A.

Gynaecologists also seem anything but angelic but may have been penalised by a small sample size of operating time. The 95 confidence interval shows that gynaecologists may actually use more foul language than general surgeons.

Quite the contrary; every day I hear the most vile swear words basically being announced in public. If you ride commuter or subway trains , you know what I 'm talking about , especially if you ride them at night like I do. Groups of young people flood onto the trains , often after drinking , and you would swear you 'd stumbled into a longshoreman 's convention. And not just young people; beered-up sports fans riding home from a game are 'effing this and m-'effing all along the line , with no thought to the people around them who have to breathe in all that blue air.

But I ' ve not done much in-depth study of the matter , so I may perhaps change my mind one day , after having done so ( I read Greek enough to do so , and am capable of sifting through the many scholarly works on the subject ) .

Many of the music industry role models of today prefer to talk about their cars and possessions in the foulest language imaginable. Unfortunately , these are the same role models who have risen to the heights of popularity as their albums , clothes and even their way of walking is mimicked. Popular icons such as rappers , sportsmen and 'gangsters ' get away with continuously swearing in front of the cameras and recording it in their music. Essentially , these role models are allowed to use expletives and words that denigrate others by the music industry and record producers.

It is important that the appointed executor is not himself or herself a beneficiary of the will if so they will simply lose their place in the will. The procedures can be very complicated which is why most executors hire a solicitor to help sort out the will when the time comes. The first duty for the executor is to assess the debts and liabilities of the deceased and then to value the assets they had. Property , liquid assets and bank accounts are all included in this valuation. Once this procedure is finished then the executor must make an application to a local registry for a grant. Hereafter the executor will be required to visit the registry and swear an affidavit as to the basic details of the author of the will and then to declare a net value of the assets to be distributed. The capital taxes office is then involved and assess the situation as to if they are satisfied with the figures for tax purposes . </swear.v.3247><swear.v.3248>In this book I will show you how we are being attacked , decimated and herded toward a UN global slavery system.

He alludes to Isaiah 66 and Psalm 48 , and it amazes me as I 've been going through the Sermon on the Mount - before I elaborate on what I 've just said - it amazes me how the Lord uses His Bible so much , so much.

For every oath that is kept , a million are violated. Who really believes that every testimony from the witness stand is truthful because an oath was taken ? Or every politician is truthful because he swore on the Bible ? Let your yey be yea and your nay be nay. As Christ said " anything more than this is from the Evil One " .

According to this doctrine , when a Christian commonwealth frames a constitution , embracing no recognition of the Holy Scriptures , it formally sets itself in opposition to the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ , whom all men are commanded to honour , even as they honour the Father.

If he swears , to one and the same loaf of bread , I will not eat it , then , I will not eat it , the former is a vain oath , and the latter an uttered oath; so that by eating it he is liable for uttered swearing; by not eating it he is liable for a vain oath . </swear.v.3262><swear.v.3263>Quote of the Year : We swear an oath to the Constitution , not to a man , even if he makes a thrill run up your leg when he talks. </swear.v.3263><swear.v.3264>15 The Lord ' s angel called to Abraham a second time from heaven 16 and said , ' I solemnly swear by my own name , ' decrees the Lord , ' that because you have done this and have not withheld your son , your only son , 17 I will indeed bless you , and I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be as countless as the stars in the sky or the grains of sand on the seashore.

Deut. vi. 13; x. 20 , etc. Christ himself , when put upon oath in the form common among the Jews , did not hesitate to answer. Matt. xxvi. 63 , 64. Paul often appeals to God for the truth of his statements -- thus : " God is my witness; " " I call God for a record upon my soul. " Rom. i. 9; 2 Cor. i. 23. In Heb. vi. 13 -- 18 , Paul declares that God , in order " to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath; " and that , " because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself.

Thus , when men swear to tell the truth in a court of law , they swear with their hand on the Bible. Since God is greater than anyone or anything else , He can only swear by Himself ( verse 13 ) .

In 1908 , this legislation was amended , effectively lifting sanctions on length and location of federal service. Further changes came with the National Defense Act of June 3 , 1916.

During the reign of king Sambuvardhana ( 935-36 AD ) , some adherents went to him , but he would not trust them until they proved their bona fides. So he ordered them to swear to him their loyalty by taking in his presence the oath of fidelity by Libation ( Kosha ) . He and his trusted retainer , a Damara , placed the feet of the adherent son a sheep 's skin , which had been sprinkled with blood and they mutually took the oath by means of libation , with a sword in hand.

We also see Abraham who is righteous through thick and thin until he succumbed to the temptation to enter into a polygamous concubinage with an Egyptian woman. Even Moses who is the meekest man in all the earth , according to the Bible , sins so as not to be able to enter into the Promised Land. David , a man after God 's own heart , swears the oath and then commits adultery with another man 's wife and has that man killed and becomes a murderer.

This is utter nonsense. In the first place , the entire issue is somewhat moot since members have one ceremony where they all take the oath of office as a group on the floor of the House. The rules of the House , furthermore , allows for the use of an " affirmation " for those choosing not to swear their oaths as a religious preference -- which demonstrates that America does have a tradition of tolerance for the needs of other religions in its processes.

They who swore otherwise violated this order : By the name of strange gods you shall not swear [ Ex 23 : 13 ] . Although at times one swears by creatures , nevertheless , it must be known that such is the same as swearing by God. When you swear by your soul or your head , it is as if you bind yourself to be punished by God. Thus : But I call God to witness upon my soul [ 2 Cor 1 : 23 ] .

There however he refused to swear the oath on the treaty of Bedzin-Bytom to Polish senators because of absence of his commissioners and lack of amnesty for his supporters. Moreover in Wislica he had been deprived of a deposit connected with his efforts to confirm the treaty with an oath by Hungarian estates and his will to swear on the treaty. Bishop of Chelm Wawrzyniec Goslicki who escorted the arch-duke made an official protest and Polish cortege came back to Bedzin. Refusal to swear the oath by the arch-duke complicated Polish-Austrian relations , especially already initiated talks about the marriage with Anne. The next Sejm in Warsaw passed a constitution " Protection of the Commonwealth against sir Maximilian an Austrian arch-duke " ( VL , II , p. 1319-1320 ) in which the arch-duke was deprived of rights to ever apply for the Polish throne.

You could swear thus , by the heavens as the cloudy heavens , or the starry heavens , but not the heaven of heavens; not where God dwells. And in this way they made their various distinctions , and therefore they would swear by that temple , this is true; and then you still could n't depend upon it.

Elsewhere he remarks that it 's not wise to swear at " the person you sleep with on a regular basis , " referring to " your spouse or significant other. " When he suggests telling friends that you are trying to reduce your cursing , he stresses : " Make certain they understand you are not asking them to stop swearing or behave differently in front of you.

Let 's be honest - children will hear them , so it 's a question of whether , as parents , we put our heads in the sand and hope our dear little darlings never hear a cross word , or whether we educate our children that these words are part of the English language and why they are such bad words to use . </swear.v.3577><swear.v.3578>when I see a film and hear swearing , it spoils it for me.

An oath ought to be taken " in truth , in righteousness , and in judgment. " Jer. iv. 2. In truth; that is , with an entire correspondence between the sentiments of the mind and the words of the oath , in their common obvious meaning , and as understood by those who administer it; without any equivocation and mental reservation. To allow of mental reservation in swearing , as the Church of Rome in certain cases does , is to defeat the very end of an oath , to destroy all confidence among men , and to involve the swearer in the heinous sin of perjury. In righteousness; that is , in things lawful and possible for us at the time of swearing , and with a fixed intention to perform what we pledge ourselves to do. In judgement; that is , deliberately and reverently , well considering whether the matter of the oath be good and just , and whether the ends proposed be sufficient to justify us in interposing the glorious and dreadful name of God for a pledge of the truth of our declarations . </swear.v.3620><swear.v.3621>Enthoven , who chaired the University 's committee on health benefits at the time the plan was adopted , has long been a proponent of managed competition where the consumer is encouraged to pay attention to the cost of insurance coverage and insurers have incentives to be competitive in cost and services offered. In Stanford 's case , employees have a choice among different types of health insurance plans , ranging from the lowest cost ( offered by Kaiser Permanente in most years ) to the most costly preferred provider organization ( PPO ) plan. The university gives each employee the equivalent of 100 percent of the premium of the lowest priced plan for individual coverage and 82 percent of the lowest priced dependent coverage. Employees use these dollars to " buy " coverage of their choice among the plans offered , and if an employee is covered under a spouse 's policy , the military , or some other source , they may swear an affidavit declining coverage and receive an additional $ 50 taxable benefit each month . </swear.v.3621><swear.v.3622>21.

As I understand it , NOrman Baker was not calling for the abolition of the monarchy , as such. What we do need in Britain is a written constitution and any legislator would be required to swear allegiance to that constitution ( whatever form the head of state ) as well , perhaps , as his/her constituents. On the question of whether a constitutional monarchy provides protection against tyranny , there is evidence both ways. In Spain , the post-FRanco monarchy in the person of Juan Carlos was undoubtedly importantin the early days in fending off threats to the still fragile democracy. This no doubt stemmed from Juan Carlos ' s personality and his life experience , not least the example of his feeble cousin , the King of Greece , who bowed to the colonels and lost his throne. It would be interesting to know the nature of the oath that parliamentarians in the Scandinavian and Dutch monarchies are required to swear. This is an interesting topic and one which requires some common sense , some constitutional knowledge and a little less raving . </swear.v.3626><swear.v.3627>Most importantly , the anti-ACLUers don ' t seem to have thought this through very well. The whole notion behind swearing an oath , and this goes way back even to John Locke , is that if someone swears an oath to their God they are more likely to be honest because they know that their God will punish them if they ' re not. The fear of eternal punishment allegedly keeps them in line ( which is nonsense , but that ' s the premise ) . But if you force , say , a Hindu person to swear an oath on the Bible , you are already forcing them to be dishonest right from the start. So the whole purpose of having an oath is defeated if they are swearing to a God they don ' t believe in. But these Christian Supremacists don ' t really care about things like honesty , they just want you to have to pay homage to their beliefs . </swear.v.3627><swear.v.3628>I sit hear reading this comments on this rehat about swearing , but can u poeple tell me that none of you have gone without swearing at least ones , at someone.

As is shown in verse 13 a proclamation or promise becomes an " oath " only when it is combined with some form of extraordinary affirmation , otherwise known as " swearing by something greater than oneself " . A promise is always a binding statement , whether it is made as a simple statement of intent ( e.g. " Yes , I will give you this land. " ) or when it is combined with swearing to become an oath. Because a promise ( statement of intent ) , or any other ordinary agreement a Christian may make , is genuinely binding on the believer; there is no advantage at all in " swearing an oath " . Christians must do what they say they will do , if the Lord permits , and swearing an oath will not improve on that . </swear.v.3632><swear.v.3633> Do you swear or affirm that the person appearing before me and who signed this document is the person he [ or she ] claims to be ?

The MDC politician fulfilled the first stage of becoming a cabinet minister by being sworn in as a non-constituency Senator last Wednesday. This was to enable him to take up his role , as only members of parliament and the senate can be government ministers. He missed the swearing in of Deputy Ministers after he was slapped with what the MDC has described as extremely dubious terrorism charges , and locked up in a Mutare Remand Prison.

Even if other religious texts are permitted , it still means that the government is favoring religion in an inappropriate manner. Finally , there are good legal reasons to affirm rather than swear an oath. If you swear to God on a Bible when you do n't believe in either , then you doing the opposite of what you are supposed to.

He swore at himself for not bringing more ammunition , and he would swear at his men for wasting their ammunition or shooting too often. Then an Indian would expose himself , and he would swear and yell : " Shoot , you damned idiots ! What do you suppose I gave you ammunition forto eat ?

I can spout off a litany of foul words that arent considered swear words and still bring forth the same effect as if I had said F $ or S &amp;^ .

During the growth of familly organization that came about during and after the great depression these words suddenly became the worst thing anyone could say , never before were these words frowned upon in such a grand scale. There is fundementally nothing wrong with using these four letter words. The only reason they are frowned upon is because they were looked down upon by the American church during the great depression and to this day the primary source of hatred toward these words is from American Christians.

Instead of abiding by that oath , he assaulted one of the most important principles of justice -- that witnesses in court must tell the truth , and that the oath they swear to tell the truth is foundationally important -- indeed , sacred.

The strongest and most positive thing that a smoker can say about his pipe , or cigar , or cigarette , is that he could not get along without it; and he will usually add that he wishes he had never begun to use it.

It is being suspected of falsehood that leads men to swearing.

His immutability will not even allow Him to change His mind concerning any promise that He has made. So He could swear to Himself simply because He has complete confidence in His own ability and character . </swear.v.3773><swear.v.3774>It is very much against mainstream custom to swear.

I think there is continued value in asking witnesses to swear their truthfulness upon a sacred text ( or affirming their oath if they prefer ) .

Let us pretend , for the sake of argument , that our representatives are actually sworn in with their hands on a book. If I understand the reasoning of Prager et al , a person who does not hold the Bible to be sacred should none the less lay his hand on it when he takes an oath. To my mind , there are only two ways to read that : either it ' s a religious test , or it ' s a meaningless gesture. Meaningless because , if you don ' t believe in the holiness of the book you lay your hand on when you swear , the gesture adds no force to the oath , and may even trivialize someone else ' s belief in the book ' s sacredness. The idea of swearing on a book one holds sacred is tied up in notions of blasphemy , serious religious stuff.

It then appears evident that both by Christ and by James the puerile astuteness of those is reproved who taught that they could swear with impunity , provided they adopted some circuitous expressions. That we may , then , understand the meaning of James , we must understand first the precept of the law , Thou shalt not take the name of God in vain.

Every time you utter a swear word , drop a set amount of money into the jar. As much as possible , do not use loose change like pennies or nickels as a penalty for each swear word. If you really want to discipline yourself and keep track of how much you swear , use bills instead of loose change. Five dollars , ten dollars , or even twenty dollars dropped into the swear jar could give you a good idea of how much your swearing hurts other people. Instead of keeping the swear jar as a piggy bank , donate the money to a worthwhile cause , or offer to buy dinner for your friends and family.

Once at school , he usually gets into a little pushing with the other kids in those few minutes between his mother 's eyes and the teacher's. The class work does not go that badly now. Between the daily allowance which is geared to behavior and his medicine , he manages alright. This is good for everyone. At the beginning of the school year he would flip desks , swear at the teacher , tear up his work and refuse to do most things. Looking back , the reasons seem so trivial.

It 's all a matter of " jurisdiction " ( oath spoken ) , which a Christian ca n't abide. Christians must be freemen. Their faith , duty and allegiance can go to no one on earth. Weca n't serve two masters. No one can. As Christians our faith and allegiance rests not on an oath. Our faith and allegiance arise naturally. These are duties owed by a child to his father.

Even with those words attached , the oath is to the American people. Period.

If he swore by something upon the altar of sacrifice , why that was a binding oath , but if he swore by the altar , it was not a binding sacrifice. Now our Lord Jesus sweeps away all of this fallacious reasoning by saying first of all , that anything in the temple partakes of the character of the temple.

They imagine , then , that there is no evil , provided they do not openly mention the name of God; and this is an old gloss. So the Jews , when they swore by heaven or earth , thought that they did not profane God ' s name , because they did not mention it.

Another option on the occupancy affidavit is to claim that the property is going to be a second residence which also might result in a decreased interest rate.

He devoted only a few lines to the first question. In his earliest draft of the consilium , he concentrated on whether Wenceslaus could transfer all imperial jurisdiction and power to Giangaleazzo. If Giangaleazzo had seen this early version of the consilium , he might not have been pleased. Baldus restricted Wenceslaus 's privilege considerably. Could the emperor order a vassal who holds him as his liege lord to swear allegiance to another lord ? Baldus concluded that it would be dangerous to believe the emperor had this authority. Further , if one thought that Wenceslaus could revoke earlier privileges , then his successor might do exactly the same. Giangaleazzo and his children might lose everything that Wenceslaus had granted them. Echoing the constitutional provisions of Magna Carta , he noted that if a feudal lord wronged his vassal , he should appeal to his peers at the lord 's court.

It is an act of treason for governments we elect to swear an oath of allegiance to this foreign power. Voting for them knowing they are going to commit treason makes you party to an assault on the Canadian state. Note that this government claims to be the de facto government of Canada , not the de jure government of Canada. De facto means in fact where as de jure means in law. Where is our lawful government ? The present government of Canada assumed power. An assumption is a legal fiction of the legal system that operates under colour and guise of law. How do you challenge the assumption on court when the foreign power that is running your government is also running and appointing your courts ?

I do n't even see why its shunned upon. Oh yeah the US was founded on Christian morals where everything is a sin. Trust me if you read the bible everything is contradicted so everything that is good is bad. Here 's for example , you should be humble and not be proud. To be proud is to sin. But if your greatly humble , someone will complement you and then you will enjoy that compliment , But that joy is pride , oh crap you just sinned. That 's why I find the US gov to be such BS.

Everyone would know they did n't mean it ! I seem to remember a certain MP called Willie Hamilton some years ago , who was an ardent anti-Royalist - presumably he swore the oath , even though he spent his career saying that the monarchy should be abolished. Are we saying that the only important thing here is swearing the oath , not actually MEANING what you say ? If so , then this country is even more stupid and superficial than I thought , and that takes some doing ! </swear.v.3882><swear.v.3883>The only thing that they are able to look for is that we speak out of ourselves , and that is the lie. And now in order that the truth may be established , that is , when someone is to be inducted into office , when he is to take the oath of office , that is to be done with a hand upon the Bible. That way , he is going to be faithful , that fidelity is established. He has thereby sworn that he will be faithful to that oath , that we will be faithful to that work. And consequently those who then go contrary to that are guilty of a felony; they are guilty of perjury. Anyone who lies under oath is already condemned. Now that is the way our jurisprudence is set up , and that is also good , that is Biblical that he who swears falsely is to be incarcerated , he 's to be imprisoned , and our country does that . </swear.v.3883><swear.v.3884>Before him , others have denied bad language or apologised for it - in the case of former top politician Peter Beattie , he did both.

Therefore , to swear vainly or rashly by the glorious and awesome name of God , or to swear by any other name or thing , is sinful , and to be regarded with disgust and detestation. But in matters of weight and moment , for the confirmation of truth , and for the ending of strife , an oath is sanctioned by the Word of God. Therefore a lawful oath being imposed by a lawful authority can rightly be taken in such circumstances . </swear.v.3885><swear.v.3886>Why then ? Because it is the day after Harvey Pitt 's deadline for the top US companies to swear to the veracity of their accounts before the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Pitt 's decision to call for this public affirmation that all we see can be believed was initially decried by the market experts as a bit of " ass covering " from someone who was seen as just a little bit too close to Wall Street. It was also a slap in the face for the auditing profession , which was supposed to have put its integrity on the line to verify these accounts . </swear.v.3886><swear.v.3887>13When God made his promise to Abraham , since there was no one greater for him to swear by , he swore by himself , 14saying , " I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.

For this reason the present Canon excommunicates those Christians who in accordance with the custom of the Greeks swear , either by the gods falsely so called of the Greeks , by saying , for instance , by Jupiter or by Zeus , or who swear by the elements , by saying , for instance , by the Sun , or by the Heaven above us , and the like; just as c. LXXXI of Basil subjects them to penances. St. Basil , however , canonizes eleven years those men who without any great necessity due to tortures deny the faith or eat things that have been sacrificed to idols and take the oaths of the Greeks , just as they themselves , that is to say , believe in them. The present Canon of the Council excommunicated , as Balsamon says , not only these men , but also Christians who have not denied the faith but have taken oaths in accordance with the custom of the Greeks. Wherefore no such oath , nor indeed any other oath taken in the face of an unrecognized or disreputable religion , is to be kept , according to ch. 19 of Title XIII of Photius . </swear.v.3889><swear.v.3890>I 've been wondering about when the idea was introduced.

" </swear.v.3892><swear.v.3893>The scroll , then , represents wicked teaching , which releases men and women from their obligation to obey God 's laws. Such teaching , with a Jewish flavor , may be traced in the Pharisees ' use of " Corban " -- a legal fiction that effectively released a man of his obligation to his parents ( Mark 7 : 6-12 ) . By some similar misapplication of law Pharisees enriched themselves by " devouring widows ' houses " ( Mat 23 : 14 ) and swearing falsely ( v 16 ) . This same attitude was carried forward into the early church and became part of the Roman Catholic apostasy. So-called saints are alleged to have accumulated large excesses of virtue which could be transferred , at a price , to sinners. The clerics , from the pope down to the parish priest , claimed the power to excuse on God 's behalf sins of lying , stealing and so on at the confessional.

God is the greatest value in the universe. There is nothing more valuable or wonderful than God. So God swears by God. And in doing that he says : I mean for you to have as much confidence in me as it is possible to have. For if more were possible , it says in verse 13 , he would have given us that . </swear.v.3896><swear.v.3897>Would you feel soooo bad about swearing allegiance to him as the symbol of the NZ state.

I mean , to a certain extent , swearing and foul language is generally associated with being of a lower class ... and a lower class means lower income. So some kids , who come from trailer park families perhaps have become so accustomed to bad language that it comes really easily to them in front of teachers. And so if the teachers would fine them , they 'd have a hard time paying the fine , since they would n't come from families with alot of money.

Answer : Peter and Paul only testify of that which God promised to Abraham with the oath. They themselves promise nothing , as the example indicates clearly. Testifying and swearing are two different things. For when a person swears he is in the first place promising future things , as Christ was promised to Abraham Whom we a long time afterwards received. But when a person bears testimony he is testifying about the present , whether it is good or evil , as Simeon spoke to Mary about Christ and testified , Behold this [ child ] is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel , and for a sign which shall be spoken against . </swear.v.3902><swear.v.3903>Hebrews 3 : 18-19 And to whom did He swear that they should not enter His rest , but to those who did-not-obey ?

Nevertheless , ask yourself , " Who designed this intelligent designer ? " If nothing in the universe exists without a cause and the universe 's designer is incredibly complex , then the designer must have a designer , according to their theory. Moreover , his designer has a designer , too. And so on. Just imagine an infinite number of ever more complex designers going back in time with no evidence at all for a single one. It is a classic reductio ad absurdum unless you add the assumption that one of these designers is self-creating or outside the universe. However , either of these assumptions takes you out of the realm of science and plants you firmly in the realm of religion , where fantastic claims are readily promoted and believed without evidence. The infamous Wedge Strategy document leaked out of the Discovery Institute ( the main promoters of Intelligent Design ) even confirms their religious intent. According to the document , " Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview , and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.

You see , many hundreds of years ago , kings and queens were crowned with great ceremony not just to stroke their egos , but so that all the country would know that there WAS a new king , and that it was George ( or Philip , or Mary , or Elizabeth , or whomever . . . . ) Much the same todo was done with any great life event , because records were not easily searched or even kept , so weddings and funerals and christenings ( who are this child 's parents , so we can make sure he/she does n't accidentally marry a cousin one day ) were big town or county affairs. You raise your hand to get attention , or walk down the aisle , or otherwise signal that the ceremony is starting. Everyone falls silent , because this is the Big Thing we 've all come to see.

This chapter is a prophecy of blessing from a dying man Jacob , whose name was changed to Israel to his twelve sons. The prophecy concerned both their futures and the coming Messiah : Verse 10 reads , " The scepter shall not depart from Judah . . . until Shiloh come. " With his hand on this portion of Scripture , Washington took the oath of office to become the first president of the American Republic. Each president since Washington has followed the same pattern , most of them choosing to open the Bible to a particular passage of Scripture as they swear to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States. The choice of Scripture has often proved to be prophetic of a president 's term of office , and on occasion the chosen verses have uncannily reflected America 's role in the plan of Bible prophecy . </swear.v.3911><swear.v.3912>I guess , but there are other ways to do that.

Sin is a condition of the heart , the mind , and the inner man ( Romans 7 : 22 ) , which is manifested in our thoughts , actions and words. When we swear and curse , we are giving evidence of the polluting sin in our hearts that must be confessed and repented of. Thankfully , our great God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness ( 1 John 1 : 9 ) .

In making such oaths , we again show a lack of faith that God is working the situation for our good. Moreover , by making such oaths , we are turning God into a mercenary by implying that He will not work for our good unless we give Him something. We are exalting ourselves by presuming that we have something of value to give to God , that He needs our holiness , or church attendance , or good deeds , or tithes.

Eliminating the opportunity to swear an oath on one 's own holy text may also have the effect of diminishing the credibility of that person 's testimony. CAIR 's Legal Director Arsalan Iftikhar said " CAIR will offer a free copy of the Quran to any judge in North Carolina or throughout the United States for use in oaths or for personal awareness of the holy text.

Refusing to swear on the annual Swearing Day ( of allegiance ) was tell-tale behaviour , making Anabaptists visible and arrestable. For many of themn this led to exile or worse. Recent scholarship has demonstrated that at times the Anabaptists broke down and swore an oath , the Urfehde , promising to obey the established authorities and to participate in the state churches , which was the only way that they could return to their homes and families after exile. So to return to families they swore that they would would renounce Anabaptist beliefs and associations and then they often broke their oaths : they started attending the illicit Anabaptist congregations again. The authorities punished this breaking of the oath in various ways by execution , by renewed exile , or most benignly by chopping off the Anabaptists ' two swearing fingers. In the latter half of the sixteenth century , there were in south Germany quite a few eight-fingered Anabaptists ! 39 </swear.v.3946><swear.v.3947>1 ) When you swear in person , it ' s normally something which flows.

And sometimes even after the death of their enemy , they keep up their irreconcilable enmity , not allowing their friends to give the customary honors even to their dead bodies when in the grave.

What else can they say ? They will admit that the Constitution is not altogether without a meaning; that at a time of universal peace it imposes some kind of obligation upon those who swear to support it.

Causal swearing , on the other hand , is caused or provoked by pain or by an emotion , such as anger , annoyance , frustration , or impatience. You could argue that casual swearing does n't hurt anyone , but the truth is , it hurts you , especially if you swear excessively or inappropriately , like in a public place. Believe it or not , many people are offended by crass language , and even though they might not tell you , they are passing judgment on your lack of maturity and consideration for others.

Last week a study by the Centers for Disease Control confirmed what many former smokers have learned from experience : people who swear off smoking can expect to gain weight -- an average of 3.8 kg ( 8 lbs. ) for women , 2.8 kg ( 6 lbs. ) for men. More disturbing is the finding that 1 in 8 women who quit -- and 1 in 10 male quitters -- add a hefty 13 kg ( 29 lbs. ) or more , while continuing smokers tend to gain much less. The CDC 's report , published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine , noted that certain groups are particularly likely to lose the battle of the bulge , among them blacks , people under 55 and those who smoked more than 15 cigarettes a day . </swear.v.4070><swear.v.4071>Another power that the moderator possesses during the town meeting is the power to swear in the newly elected officers. In towns where municipal officers are elected by being nominated from the floor with paper ballots being cast immediately , it is the general rule that moderators line up the successful candidates and swear them to office. Later the moderator makes out certificates on the persons to whom he administered the oath and files these with the town clerk. In towns that use the 2528 secret ballot , the Australian ballot so- called , the moderator may or may not swear these persons to their office. More often than not the moderator does not in this situation because the successful candidates are rarely present at the time the outcome is announced. It is important to note here that this power of the moderator exists only during the open sessions of the town meeting and the power is lost immediately upon adjournment. In the event that the town meeting is adjourned to a time certain , recessed or postponed , the moderator does not possess this power between open sessions and an oath administered by him during these times is illegal . </swear.v.4071><swear.v.4072>An employee covered under a spouse 's policy , the military , or some other source may swear an affidavit declining coverage and receive an additional $ 50 taxable benefit each month.

" It would be a great waste of money if Stanford were to follow the widespread practice of offering only the PPO , " the authors say , since the majority of employees apparently are satisfied with less costly plans.

In response to the criticism , Confederate congressmen amended the Twenty-Slave Law on May 1 , 1863 , to apply only to overseers on plantations belonging solely to " a minor , a person of unsound mind , a femme sole [ single woman ] , or a person absent from home in the military or naval service of the Confederacy. " Congressmen required planters to swear an affidavit that they had been unable to secure an overseer not liable for military service and to pay five hundred dollars for the privilege. In addition , only men who had been overseers prior to April 16 , 1862 , on plantations that had not been divided since October 11 , 1862 , could qualify for exemptions under the Twenty-Slave Law . </swear.v.4073><swear.v.4074>Can another notary administer the notarial oath to swear me in -- as required by NRS 240.030 ( 1 ) -- or must the county clerk perform this function ? </swear.v.4074><swear.v.4075>For instance , with a new oath , politicians could be forced to " further solemnly swear that since the adoption of the present Constitution , I , being a citizen of this State , have not accepted money or campaign contributions in exchange for a vote , nor have I upon accepting such a gift replied , Bless your heart , ' so help me God.

" But perhaps it means there an aino garum ( a dish in which wine is mixed ) ? The verse says further Shechor 1 ( old wine ) , which means an intoxicating beverage. Neither can it here be spoken of a date of the City of Kehilla , which when eaten intoxicates and regarding which a Boraitha says that one who had eaten it and then entered the sanctuary is culpable , as the word shechor here is analogous with the same word used concerning a Nazarite where it surely means only wine for which he is culpable.

In a court of law , people place their hand on the Bible and swear that they will tell the whole truth and will not perjure themselves. An oath builds confidence in the one receiving it.

So it ' s interesting that when Washington got to Federal Hall to be inaugurated , they couldn ' t find a Bible in Federal Hall. None of the Members of Congress seemed to have a Bible with them. But they did find and locate nearby in the Masonic Temple a Masonic Bible. That was used to swear Washington in. Actually that Bible has been kept by the Masons in New York City and has been used on four other occasions by Presidents when they inaugurated -- Harding in 1921 , Eisenhower in 1953 , Jimmy Carter in ' 77 , and the first George Bush in 1989.

In some counties , for individuals who were physically unable to swear an affidavit in person at the assessor ' s office , the deputy assessor from the assessor ' s office would take the affidavit at the taxpayer ' s residence.

Expecting people in court to swear an oath to God while using a Bible only helps reinforce Christian Supremacy in America. It 's not just a " privilege " for Christians that courts incorporate Christian beliefs and text into legal procedures , but instead a form of supremacy because they are receiving official state approval and citizens are expected to actively participate.

He thinks a lawyer 's job is to tell a client 's story and , when the client is a defendant in a criminal matter , lapsing into fiction is fine. This raises a second problem : in the example , the story told by the lawyer is not the defendant 's story at all. The defendant could not swear to the truth of the lawyer 's explanation of the presence of the TV in the rear seat. He could not even swear to his own innocence. The story is simply a lawyer 's point that may persuade a jury to find reasonable doubt , as Luban sees ( p. 73 ) .

In Edsa-II Davide was a main player , in fact , the very protagonist who made it happen , without whom it could NOT have happened. Why did he not reconvene the Senate Impeachment Court , rebuke the public prosecutors for walking out , cite them in contempt and complete the trial of Joseph Estrada ? What was his official business at the clearly partisan political rally going on at the Edsa Shrine ?

The concept is wide , and everyone has their own opinion on which words they think are swearing and which are not. Everyone agrees that swearing includes the use of somehow offensive language and words related to taboos ( either past or present ); furthermore , many scholars ( e.g. Andersson &amp;Trudgill , 53 ) add that swearing should not be interpreted literally , and it is ( or at least can be ) used to express emotions and attitudes.

Should they refuse , there was nothing for it but some form of the ordeal a subject which will engage our attention presently. Meanwhile it may be pointed out that purgation by oath was itself a distinct appeal to the Almighty. It was believed that perjured persons incurred the danger of becoming dwarfs , or of their hands remaining attached to the Gospels or relics on which they swore. Persons guilty of this offence were compelled to purge themselves by the ordeal . </swear.v.4255><swear.v.4256>In Cramp v.

" </swear.v.4275><swear.v.4276>O.E. swerian " take an oath " ( class VI strong verb; past tense swor , pp. sworen ) , from P.Gmc. *swarjanan , from root *swar- ( cf. O.S. swerian , O.N. sverja , Dan. sverge , O.Fris. swera , M.Du. swaren , O.H.G. swerien , Ger. schwren , Goth. swaren " to swear " ) , from PIE base *swer- " to speak , say " ( cf. O.C.S. svara " quarrel " ) . Also related to the second element in answer. The secondary sense of " use bad language " ( c.1430 ) developed from the notion of " invoke sacred names. " Swear-word is Amer.Eng. colloquial from 1883. Swear off " desist as with a vow " is from 1898 . </swear.v.4276><swear.v.4277> Nephi , a powerful fellow , held the terrified Zoram in a vise-like grip long enough to swear a solemn oath in his ear , ' as the Lord liveth , and as I live ' ( 1 Ne. 4 : 32 ) , that he would not harm him if he would listen. Zoram immediately relaxed , and Nephi swore another oath to him that he would be a free man if he would join the party. </swear.v.4277><swear.v.4278>Lauren; I was raised on southern values and was taught that ladies should not swear. Of course , sometimes you may say somthing here and there on accident but I personally do n't think that cursing and swearing is very lady like. ( Then again , I live in Texas ) I say; follow your parents guidance and do n't fall into peer pressure or stress yourself over a little thing like this. I think that as long as your true to yourself; ESPECIALLY in high school you 'll be perfectly fine.

People should be able to swear by what *they* find sacred , and that should be respected for what it is . </swear.v.4281><swear.v.4282>The Prophet ( Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam ) also said : " Do not swear by your parents. When one swears , he should either swear by Allah or keep silent " . Swearing by other than Allah does not conform with monotheism. Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdulwahhab , in his book Ad-D'awa ( The Call ) , pinpointed this matter . </swear.v.4282><swear.v.4283>Prager , who usually gets it right , got this issue spectacularly wrong. He wrote that any Congressman not willing to swear an oath on the Bible should not serve in Congress , and that the American fabric would suffer its worst damage since 9/11 if Ellison used the Qur ' an instead of the Bible. This is utter nonsense. In the first place , the entire issue is somewhat moot since members have one ceremony where they all take the oath of office as a group on the floor of the House. The rules of the House , furthermore , allows for the use of an affirmation for those choosing not to swear their oaths as a religious preference which demonstrates that America does have a tradition of tolerance for the needs of other religions in its processes. Quakers in particular take advantage of that option , although Richard Nixon swore his oath when elected as President . </swear.v.4283><swear.v.4284>Besides , if using a religious text for an oath has any significance at all -- and our experience with courts and politics strongly suggests there is n't much -- one would suppose that it would have to be a religious text with significance to the person swearing the oath. Atheists would not feel bound by the power of Divine retribution if they swore their oath on the Bible and then broke it later. Similarly , Christians would not feel much responsibility for protecting the honor of the Qur'an if they swore their oath on that text. Why would n't we want Ellison to swear his oath on the one religious text he holds sacred , if we want him to feel some responsibility for acting in its defense by fulfilling his oath ? </swear.v.4284><swear.v.4285>it 's high time these TV Producers got a grip , and recognised that there is absolutely no need for so called professional TV presenters ( Ramsay/Oliver/Ross et al ) to swear in order to attract viewers. Frankly , it makes me want to switch off rather than watch . </swear.v.4285><swear.v.4286>Michael 's mother hated school almost as much as Michael did. Almost every day there were calls from the school about Michael. In grade primary he tried to stab a youngster with scissors. He was swearing at his teachers by grade one. On Grade two it was stealing lunch money. Every time they seemed to get one problem under control , he was into something else. Everyone seemed at a loss about what to do except her brother. It did n't matter what the weather was like , Michael was out there. His uncle said that by the time he was ten , he could do the work of a grown man. There was no fear in Michael. Cold weather , big swells , nothing bothered him. He refused to do any homework from fourth grade on. Up until that grade , his teachers let him go out for a walk around the building every hour or so , but when a set of keys went missing and were " discovered " by Michael a few days later , the walks ended. Still , compared to the last few years , this was easy . </swear.v.4286><swear.v.4287>I do n't give a damn if Congressman-elect Keith Ellison swears on a Bible , a Koran , or the sleeve of Nancy Pelosi 's favorite Chanel suit. And I do n't care what any of the other 400+ Representatives swear on , either. What I do care about is that they keep their oath. What I care about just as much is that they 're duly punished when they don't. Where are the people who promised to see to that part of things ? And why are they failing - just as are so many others - to make good on their promises ? </swear.v.4287><swear.v.4288>Hypocrites eh ? in my experience , the seraphic angels who do not swear in public perpetually let off their steam in private ( which is not as attractive and twice as harmful - nobody ever heard bottling up your anger could ever be good. bad for the heart , I believe . ) </swear.v.4288><swear.v.4289>Swearing What may seem silly or funny in the privacy of your own home is rarely as amusing when a youngster yells a swear word at church , school or a local play group. Unfortunately parents likely have no one to blame but themselves for this development. Young children learn vocabulary words in large part by hearing them said , so whether it is from you , a friend , a carer or the television , if children have managed to pick up swear words it means that someone has been careless. Thankfully this habit is usually only cultivated because it brings the child attention either good or bad. Explaining why swear words are inappropriate , and ignoring them when possible , are good ways to bring a swift end to under-age swearing . </swear.v.4289><swear.v.4290>This is a ridiculous assertion. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will never agree to any dictum to swear an oath to Obama instead of to the Constitution. They would refuse to do so; and there would be a constitutional crisis. Gim me a break. I know the military; believe me , this will never happen . </swear.v.4290><swear.v.4291>My husband is a soldier and , as is common in the military subculture , he swears every-other-word. I hate it. I swear too , but I do n't have a 4-letter word in every sentence. Beyond the constant assault on my ears and the trips to school when my 5-year-old tells a friend to " f.o. " , I hate that he swears so much because it makes him sound ignorant. He is far from ignorant , one of the most intelligent people I know in fact , but he presents himself in this way and it is nearly impossible not to make judgments based on the language his chooses . </swear.v.4291><swear.v.4292>But if a person makes a vow because he is afraid lest his evil inclination dissuade him from a righteous action , that is permitted. In fact , God ordered that one should make a vow in the case where a person went on an evil path , and a vow will rein him in , to ensure that he no longer returns to that way. As King David said : " I have sworn , and shall fulfill , to heed Your righteous judgments " ( Psalm 199 : 106 ) . We see from this that it is permissible to swear in order to fulfill the commandments. ( Tze'enah Ur'enah ) </swear.v.4292><swear.v.4293>You must swear to , or affirm the affidavit before an officer of USCIS if you are in the United States , or a U.S. immigration or consular officer if you are outside the U.S. The form must be submitted along with your Form I-360 . </swear.v.4293><swear.v.4294>The Convention when it framed the Constitution , and the people when they adopted it , could have had no thought like that. If they had supposed that it would operate only while perfect peace continued , they certainly would have given us some other rule to go by in time of war; they would not have left us to wander about in a wilderness of anarchy , without a lamp to our feet , or a guide to our path. Another thing proves their actual intent still more strikingly. They required that every man in any kind of public employment , state or national , civil or military , should swear , without [ 71 U.S. 2 , 80 ] reserve or qualification , that he would support the Constitution. Surely our ancestors had too much regard for the moral and religious welfare of their posterity , to impose upon them an oath like that , if they intended and expected it to be broken half the time . </swear.v.4294><swear.v.4295>10. Be reasonably considerate about using strong language around women. Even though a girl ' s husband or father may swear vociferously , she ' ll grow to dislike a place of business where she hears too much of this . </swear.v.4295><swear.v.4296>When the Illinois State Bar heard these kinds of views from Clyde Summers , it refused to allow Summers to take the " support oath " and be admitted to the practice of law. The State Bar said Summers could not swear his " support " for such a constitution in " good faith " because of his religion , which caused him to question parts of the constitution. [ 70 ] Based on the Sermon on the Mount , Summers questioned the legitimacy of the Empire 's use of war and violence , clear components of its constitution . </swear.v.4296><swear.v.4297>Kirkman says mothers trying to warn daughters about potential life problems can be a bit like a doctor trying to deliver bad news : " People will swear blind that no one told them , and they were told but they found it too distressing to absorb it. " </swear.v.4297><swear.v.4298>Jehovah hath sworn truth unto David , He turneth* not from it ( Ps. 132 : 11 ) . [ 4 ] Jehovah God , or the Lord , never swears , for to swear is not becoming to God Himself , or the Divine verity; but when God , or the Divine verity , wills to have anything confirmed before men , then that confirmation in its descent into the natural sphere falls into the form or formula of an oath , such as is used in the world. This shows why it is said in the sense of the letter of the Word , which is the natural sense , that God swears , although He never swears. This , then , is the signification of " to swear " in reference to Jehovah or the Lord in the preceding passages , and also in the following. In Isaiah : </swear.v.4298><swear.v.4299>But I digress. Back to knitting. Here 's the hat I knit up for EzzaBoo during all the TV watching last week. It 's with leftover yarn from the Wild Stripes blanket , which I swear is almost done ( the knitting is done ! I just need to back it , and like I said , sewing time is hard to come by these days ) . I 'm so psyched , because the yarn was so cheap to begin with ( from KnitPicks ) and I made the entire ( huge ) baby blanket , and will have enough leftover for hats for all three kids ( all deserving of their own posts upon completion in the near future , of course ) .

The ceremony we see in Genesis 15 : 12-21 is an ancient ceremony of " cutting " a covenant and swearing to the other party to keep it. Joseph speaks of the land that God " promised on oath to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob " ( Genesis 50 : 24 ) . See also Hebrews 4 : 3 ( quoting Psalm 95 : 11 ) , and Hebrews 6 : 13 , where the writer says , " When God made his promise to Abraham , since there was no one greater for him to swear by , he swore by himself. " </swear.v.4301><swear.v.4302>Verse 18 : For amen I say , +. Gr. Amen i.e. , " in truth; " As S. Jerome says , " Amen is the word not of one who swears , but of one who affirms something he is about to say , or confirms something which he has said. In the former case it is prefixed , in the latter it is affixed , as it were a seal. " This may be seen from Deut. 27 : 26+ , and 1 Cor. 14 : 16 . </swear.v.4302><swear.v.4303>4. If you worship with us regularly , but are not on our church Electoral Roll , you can be married by ' Common Licence ' , which requires you to swear an ' affidavit ' ( a legal declaration ) before the Bishop ' s Surrogate for Marriages . </swear.v.4303><swear.v.4304>This seems pretty straightforward : If you make a promise , you must keep it. However , the text uses two very different terms here to make its point. Neder , translated as " vow , " is generally used to represent a promise to do something ( " I vow to give $ 1000 to tzedakah " ) . Shevu'ah , on the other hand , is generally translated as " oath , " implying a promise to abstain from doing something ( " I swear to stop smoking " ) . In each case , as soon as it is uttered , the promise is considered binding. A man must carry through what ever he states. And the text does refer to men here . </swear.v.4304><swear.v.4305>swear - Idioms - by the Free Dictionary , Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. swear ( up ) on someone or something. to take an oath on someone or something.

( KJV ) </swear.v.4306><swear.v.4307>Many Northern Republicans in Congress argued that Lincoln was not being tough enough on the South. In 1864 , Senator Wade and Representative Henry Winter Davis ( R , Maryland ) proposed a harsher plan. Their Wade-Davis Bill required that a majority of each Confederate state 's white males swear their loyalty to the Union in an " ironclad " oath. It also prohibited Confederate officials from voting or holding office , and it required Southern states to allow blacks to vote. Lincoln refused to sign the bill , however , so the law never went into effect. When Lincoln was assassinated , he and Congress were still at odds over the Reconstruction issue.

After surgery , and being put in my room , I had already been bleeding internally for quite some time ( this was early in the morning ) . By mid-morning I was experiencing extreme pain and yet no one would come to my room. My mother kept going out and telling nurses and doctors I needed help and they kept ignoring her saying they had already given me a pain pill. Several hours went by I was swearing loudly , continuously and prolifically like a longshoreman. Finally , late in the afternoon when my skin had turned so white it could n't be seen against the sheet , my mother went out and screamed at the doctors. Late that night I was finally rushed to the ER. My one regret is that I did n't sue that hospital blind for gross neglect and malpractice. But it was cursing that helped me survive.

The iniquitous Quaker Act of 1662 was especially damaging to Friends hopes for the future since it prohibited them from meeting together to worship and threatened those who offended thrice with transportation. Similarly , the Conventicle Act of 1664 was deliberately designed to cut the roots of a movement like Quakerism. From the spring of 1660 onwards , however , Montgomeryshire Friends faced considerable hostility with cheerful good h and astonishing courage. By November , eight Friends were languishing in Welshpools 'old Crib , a wretched hovel in the hands of a foul-tempered and hard-hearted gaoler. Friends were forced to sleep on wet straw or cold floors , and were periodically showered with urine and excrement falling from a chamber above where common felons were housed. Like many of their brethren elsewhere in England and Wales , they froze during the cold months of winter and sweated profusely on hot summer days . </swear.v.4319><swear.v.4320>Since it can not be assumed that every believer knows all the theological doctrines pertaining to their faith tradition , in the court room the emphasis is upon receiving the live testimony and determining the credibility of the witness on the basis of how much they consider themselves bound by the oath or affirmation. For witnesses who openly profess to be adherents of a particular faith which is scripture-based , the swearing of an oath is a profoundly solemn undertaking. Some extremely strict believers may choose to affirm instead because they believe that swearing an oath is not a procedure to be undertaken in a non-religious context , such as some Orthodox Jews for example . </swear.v.4320><swear.v.4321>Why swear an oath ? Do you really want God to damn someone to hell ? What a prayer that is !

Faust. , xix , 23 : Therefore in his writings , as writing allows of greater circumspection , the Apostle is found to have used an oath in several places , that none might suppose that there is any direct sin in swearing what is true; but only that our weak hearts are better preserved from perjury by abstaining from all swearing whatever . </swear.v.4338><swear.v.4339>He includes many brief interviews with people who cuss , and with some who don't. Both make interesting points , although some of the non-cussers come across as a bit too smug. But there is much of value in this book , including reminders that some people who swear have an underlying problem of excessive anger and a bad disposition. O'Connor suggests ways of avoiding anger and of remaining calm when confrontation is needed. Nothing spectacular here , but some common-sense points that might help many . </swear.v.4339><swear.v.4340>Now , you don ' t have to swear on the Bible you can choose to affirm instead. Affirming is essentially the equivalent saying on my honor instead of swearing to God. But even though I chose to affirm my oaths , rather than swear , both oaths still had the words so help me God at the end. What about those of us who don ' t believe in the Judeo-Christian God ( atheists , agnostics , humanists , buddhists , etc ) ? Why does the oath for any public official still have the words so help me God in it ? Why doesn ' t this violate the First Amendment ' s separation of church and state clause ? Or the freedom of religion clause ? </swear.v.4340><swear.v.4341>There is no requirement that any book , or in particular a book of sacred text , be used to administer the oath , and none is mentioned in the Constitution. Use of the Bible being customary for oaths , at least in the 18th and 19th centuries , a Bible was generally used. Several Presidents were sworn in on the George Washington Inaugural Bible. [ citation needed ] On some occasions , the particular passage to which it was opened has been recorded , as below. Only one president , Franklin Pierce , is definitely known to have affirmed rather than sworn; there are conflicting reports concerning Herbert Hoover , but the use of a Bible is recorded and suggests that he swore in the usual fashion. President-Elect Barack Obama will be using the Lincoln Bible for his swearing in. [ 11 ] </swear.v.4341><swear.v.4342>But seriously , parents need to do their jobs too.

However , the difference here is that when I handle or spend money I ' m not pledging anything on the strength of the phrase In God We Trust. When I swore an oath to defend my country and the Constitution , that ' s a serious personal commitment where my life is involved , and degrading it by swearing ( falsely , in my view ) on a book that holds no bond over me is both pointless and , I believe , downright insulting to those who revere that book as holy writ.

There is nothing in the Constitution that permits the Congress to pass a joint resolution , giving away their war powers. Once the Congress has made a formal Declaration of War , it then becomes the responsibility of the President to prosecute that war to the best of his ability , win or lose. Every House and Senate member , as well as the President and VP , swears an oath to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution. Any action that defies or ignores the Constitution is an act of treason against that Constitution. Remember , the elected representative or executive does n't swear to protect the Federal Government nor the American people ... ... .but the Constitution.

" Using crazy words that no one has ever heard of , as well as common words used out of their normal context takes the emphasis off the negativity and puts it more on the expression of what the teen is feeling , " O'Connor says.

Such an oath is not to be taken lightly because God 's judgment falls upon the one who broke an oath taken in God 's name. In a Court of Law in the United States it has been our tradition to raise our right hands , placing the left hand on a Bible and swearing to tell " the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth " , making our truth telling subject to God 's divine judgment.

They discover , to their surprise , that God does not strike them dead if they sometimes swear at him and ask him , " Why did you do that ? " Not only do they talk to God about what they 're doing , at some level they sense what God is saying back to them. " Why do I have to do this ?

Such cursing -- whether we be using the name of the Lord , or some hybrid such as " Jeez " , " Gosh " , etc. -- rejects ( at best ) or shows contempt for ( at worst ) the fact that God is involved in our situation , and also demonstrates a lack of faith that He is working everything for our good.

In the same way that Obama proclaimed I swear to God ! on the day of his inauguration , Spaniards can be heard extolling Te lo juro por Dios ! , or rather Ich schwore bei Gott if you ' re German and Te lo giuro su Dio ! if you ' re Italian.

My husband and I have been consciously trying not to swear for the past couple of years or so. We 're finding it very difficult , since our swearing is so automatic - it 's a habit. ( Hence , this inevitably ends up on our new year 's resolution list every year ! ) This is for two reasons : 1. swearing reduces your vocabulary , 2. influence on children. We 've found that we automatically use swear phrases , such as , 'I 'm so pissed-off ' , or 'that shits me ' , or 'I feel like crap ' , without pausing to think which adjective we could have used to describe our feelings more accurately. We do not ( yet ) have children , however , we realise that it 's much better to stop or reduce our swearing before they arrive.

How does this passage have anything to do with saying a cuss word ? Yeah , someone could use a cuss word when they swear , maybe to emphasize their point or show how serious they are , and some people certainly do. But the oath is what is wrong here , the act of swearing in the name of God and his creation , not the specific words used to make the oath you could just as easily sin in such a way , but using the word couch or pachyderm or marsupial.

As a matter of good practice : </swear.v.4413><swear.v.4414>Vows are taken so seriously because in the Bible no provision is made for them to be absolved. In the passage above , which comprises the heart of the Torah 's teachings about vows , only vows made by a woman can be revoked. In that case , it is the father of an unmarried woman or the husband of a married woman who can annul the stated vow; the woman herself cannot. Therefore , anyone , male or female , who swears an oath or a vow must be fully prepared to go through with their pledge . </swear.v.4414><swear.v.4415>In 1828 , the Connecticut Supreme Court " ruled that disbelievers in accountability to God or in an afterlife were not competent witnesses.

It hence follows that it is a sin equivalent to that of worshipping a false god if we swear by any other than the only true and living God; and a sin of idolatry if we swear by any thing or place , although it be associated with the true God. Those who swear with uplifted hand swear by the God who created , preserves , and governs all things. Those who swear with hand upon or kissing the Bible , swear by the God who reveals himself in the Bible -- that is , by the true Christian God. It is evident that none who believe in the true God can , consistently with their integrity , swear by a false god. And it is no less evident that it is dishonest for an atheist to go through the form of swearing at all; or for an infidel to swear with his hand upon the Christian Scriptures , thereby professing to invoke a God in whose existence he does not believe . </swear.v.4417><swear.v.4418>" I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely , without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter , so help me God.

A justice of peace or commissioner for oaths is under obligation to ensure that a person swearing or affirming to the contents of an affidavit understands what has been stated in the affidavit.

The PCO also places the declaration of emergency , the PCO and all acts taken under the PCO outside judicial review.

" The judge could then " hold the uncooperative witness in contempt , in effect punishing a person who simply asks that his religious beliefs be granted the same respect as those of a Christian. ... [ and ] While holding the witness in contempt , the judge also could bar the testimony that would have been offered thereby jeopardizing the case of one party or the other. ...

Then coat the pan with vegetable oil , rubbing vigorously and blotting up any extra oil; for a new pot , repeat the process several times until the surface blackens.

You will find a man far advanced in years , who swears that he has forgotten love entirely; yet when you remind him of it , he calls that love back to mind , and is rejoiced; he is filled with youthful desire; his old emotion returns to him; his yearning is mightily stirred.

" We require our politicians to take an oath of office , if they are going to become President. We even require witnesses in a courtroom to take an oath and ask for God 's help as they swear " to tell the whole truth.

It 's also the idea behind needle-exchange programs , which recognize that one thing worse than injecting heroin is injecting it with an AIDS-infected syringe . </swear.v.4476><swear.v.4477>Like in every state , a foreign citizen who wishes to become a citizen of Israel can do so , and the regulations governing his acquisition of citizenship are similar to those which exist in many other countries. The basic condition is that candidates must have resided in Israel for a number of years. Likewise , before citizenship is granted , the candidate must pledge his allegiance to the State of Israel. In contrast , Jews are not required to swear a pledge of allegiance to the State of Israel. So it is that a Satmar Hassid , who has the utmost contempt for the existence of the state , and perhaps even translates this into action , can immediately become a citizen , with the right to vote in Knesset elections ... . Moreover , only [ " Jews " ] have the right to retain their former citizenship even after becoming Israeli citizens , while " non-Jews " are obliged to renounce it before becoming Israeli citizens . </swear.v.4477><swear.v.4478>The association , which insisted through its President , Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu ( SAN ) , that it was illegal for Kutigi to swear in his successor , said , The moment a new CJN takes his oath of office , he automatically becomes the substantive CJN , while the former CJN bows out.  </swear.v.4478><swear.v.4479>" Senator , when you took your oath of office , you placed your hand on the Bible and swore to uphold the Constitution.

When dignitaries arrived for the April 30 , 1789 , swearing-in ceremony at New York 's old City Hall , they discovered that no Bible had been provided for the oath of office.

It is not acceptible at any other time , and if not used at other times swearing would not be the first thing that comes to mind when in pain. Any heartfelt expletive would do. ( My grandmother used to say , " People ! " ) The primary reason why profanity is bad is that swear words have lost their original meanings and are used in place of many , much more specific words. Swear words have become nouns , verbs , adjectives , expletives , etc. and dumb down the user 's vocabulary. There are educated , white-collar executives , academics , entertainers , etc. who think that by sounding like laborers and criminals they convey an image of toughness. Why does society devalue educated people who sound educated ?

Hence Isidore says ( De Summo Bono ii , 31 ) : " However artful a man may be in wording his oath , God Who witnesses his conscience accepts his oath as understood by the person to whom it is made. " And that this refers to the deceitful oath is clear from what follows : " He is doubly guilty who both takes God 's name in vain , and tricks his neighbor by guile. " If , however , the swearer uses no guile , he is bound in accordance with his own intention. Wherefore Gregory says ( Moral. xxvi , 7 ) : " The human ear takes such like words in their natural outward sense , but the Divine judgment interprets them according to our inward intention.

" Would n't we be much safer as a Republic if the children learned to respect the Constitution ? If we were to place the flag in the hierarchy above , it would follow the Republic.

I should know as an atheist I affirmed that oath of enlistment in the U.S. Army from 1964 until my retirement in 1985 , as did innumerable others whose ceremonies I attended. We take an oath ( affirmed or sworn ) that our country seems to consider rather binding , to say the least , without getting involved in some Jesuitical flummery over whose book takes precedence L.

Forgive me , though , if I do n't see how not casting a ballot helps any reporter fight for the truth or an executive editor oversee better coverage , particularly when these contorted standards lead them to make bizarre , Orwellian claims such as " I like everybody I cover , and I dislike everybody I cover , and I try to do it in equal proportion " or " I did n't just stop voting -- I stopped having even private opinions about politicians or issues , so that I would have a completely open mind.

As a 17 year old , I was fortunate enough to grow up in a household where for the most part , swear words were looked down upon. Because of that , the worst I will ever say is 'bloody'. Doubtless I have less life experience than you , but there can not be any adult who wants their child to grow up into someone who uses the F-word several times in every sentence . </swear.v.4615><swear.v.4616>As for the swear word , I basically agree with what everyone else has said; HBP is not a book for kids , so I think that a bit of profanity is to be expected , and I 'm not really offended by it. That being said , I think I 'd have a bit more of an issue if JKR started tossing around the 'f ' word instead. But really , swear words are a part of the majority of teenagers ' vocabulary ... and we know that JKR is trying to create a cast that grows up in a very realistic way.

Before i left for my first trip back in March 07 I consulted with my lawyer about this and he never heard of it before. I went online and found the website for the consulate in Chongqing and got the phone number. When I arrived in Chengdu I called them and made an appointment to swear the affidavit and all they asked me for was my divorce decree and passport. If you have never been married before you will need your passport , and the consul with swear your Affidavit. It would be a good idea to look up the consulates website and email them asking for other documents to prove that you were never previously married . </swear.v.4617><swear.v.4618>During the process you will have to swear an affidavit ( which is written evidence on oath ) . If you do this in the presence of a solicitor or commissioner for oaths the fee will be £ 7 or £ 9. There is an alternative.

" But the negatives outweigh the positives. You really do n't win an argument by swearing. You do n't prove that you are smart or articulate. You do n't earn respect or admiration.

Its important for the parents to acknowledge that it ' s a struggle for them as well and to make it a joint project with the kids. You can say , ' We ' re all going to watch our language , ' but the parents have to lead , says Milley. Things like having a swear box ( whoever swears has to drop a buck into a jar ) can make it a little bit fun and take the harshness or negativity out of it. </swear.v.4622><swear.v.4623>Imprimis , That the catholic church is the soul of every good christian man.

Some of these words may be just the ticket in certain rare situations , but most are dangerous expressions , only to be used when and if you really know what you 're doing. We do n't really encourage swearing or the use of vulgar language in German , but as Goethe said , a lack of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Problem words fall into the following categories : </swear.v.4625><swear.v.4626> You say that it means nothing to swear ' by God ' s Temple ' but then you say that it is binding to swear ' by the gold in the Temple.

This also is fourfold , but not in the same manner as the former : 1.

" 2. When one asserted that by an oath , concerning which there was no reason that any should doubt. For example , that " Heaven is heaven , a stone is a stone , " &amp;c. 3. When a man swore that he would do that which was altogether impossible; namely , " that he would not sleep for three days and three nights; that he would taste nothing for a full week , " &amp;c. 4.

Sometimes when a child is very young the temptation is to laugh - after all it can seem quite precocious. However , laughing will only encourage the use of foul language. On the other hand , punishment is n't necessary either. Dr Briggs says you should n't " make a big thing out of it. Just simply say 'we do n't talk like that here'. But then parents must ensure that they do n't talk that way. Often parents lose sight of their own language and some of this is being modeled at home. The model is probably the most important.

Answer : Hear the Scripture , He who swears by heaven swears by God 's throne and by Him who sits on it. Observe : it is forbidden to swear by heaven , which is only the throne of God : how much more is it forbidden [ to swear ] by God Himself ! You fools and blind , which is greater , the throne or Him that sits on it ? </swear.v.4632><swear.v.4633>If the Bible is your sacred text , then you 're not going to swear on it.

" 15 And thus , having patiently waited , he [ Abraham ] obtained the promise. 16 For men swear by one greater than themselves , and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute. 17 In the same way God , desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose , interposed with an oath , 18 in order that by two unchangeable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we may have strong encouragement , we who have fled for refuge in laying hold of the hope set before us . </swear.v.4635><swear.v.4636>Over the course of the day-long meeting , the debate moved back and forth in both directions.

In the chapter on " The Spoils " the prophet is told to arouse the faithful to arms; they are told that twenty determined men will conquer a hundred , and a hundred will rout a thousand unbelievers , who lack understanding. A woeful punishment is proclaimed for those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in God 's cause . </swear.v.4686><swear.v.4687>When the United States achieved political independence , the ties that had bound the Anglican congregations to the Church of England were severed. However , English law required bishops consecrated by Church of England prelates to swear allegiance to the British crown. Permission was finally granted by the archbishop of Canterbury , and in 1787 , bishops of the Church of England consecrated Samuel Provoost the first Episcopal bishop of New York , and William White the first of Pennsylvania. In 1784 clergyman Samuel Seabury had accepted consecration from nonjuring bishops of Scotland and became the first bishop of Connecticut. In 1789 the Episcopal Church was formally organized as an independent denomination. By the 1870s several church movements had given rise to bitter differences of opinion among Episcopal congregations. The movement resulted in 1873 in the organization of an independent denomination , the Reformed Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church has since joined with other Protestant denominations in an attempt to achieve a more unified Christian church.

The problem was this. Even though Riley was somewhat innocent , the Bank was more innocent. The Crown agreed to withdraw the charge if Riley paid back the $ 8000. Asking Riley to come up with $ 8000 , however , was like asking him to sail a boat to the moon. At a later Judicial pre-trial meeting , I had further discussions with another Crown and a Judge. Though the Crown 's initial position was fair , I argued , it had the effect of prosecuting Riley simply because he had no money.

That state required loyalty oaths for state jobs , so I had to swear to uphold the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. I felt vaguely guilty , like I was reciting the Apostle 's Creed , secretly harboring doubts about the Trinity. But I did it pragmatically , needing the money and the job experience. Years later the university that had employed me offered a job to a senior scholar , who after hearing he 'd have to perform this ritual turned the lucrative opportunity down.

And therein resides my point ( as well as Ellison 's ) : The oath is made by the oath-taker , and swearing the oath in tandem with one 's personal belief system ( if one is referenced at all ) is the only meaningful oath. If Ellison , a Muslim , had taken the oath with his hand on a Christian Bible as Goode had insisted , would his oath be meaningful to him ? ..would it be true himself and his integrity ? Ellison did n't think so , and in fact he used the personal copy of the Koran owned by Thomas Jefferson. That was what was meaningful to him in expressing the highest/strongest possible commitment to upholding the content of the oath he was taking . </swear.v.4961><swear.v.4962>A : The First Amendment to the Constitution is supposed to protect religion and government from each other by forbidding laws that promote a religion or hinder its private worship. However , the U.S. Supreme Court has a little junk drawer called " ceremonial deism " in which it keeps religious laws it likes and protects them from constitutional banishment. These include Congressional prayers , " In God We Trust " on money and the federal holiday of Christmas , along with the practice of swearing in witnesses with a Bible and an oath that ends : " so help me God.

This is because God alone is able to see our hearts , whether we be speaking the truth , and God alone has the power to execute judgement in the case when we break our vows or tell a falsehood. Therefore when a believer swears in the name of God , it is really an appeal to His omniscience , omnipotence and justice. To swear by any other thing is always evil , not only because it would be a violation of Deuteronomy 6 : 13 , " Thou shalt swear by his name , " but because it would rob God of the honour due Him and would involve a superstitious idolatry in which the thing swore by is ascribed some power it does not have . </swear.v.4988><swear.v.4989>During the last twenty-five years that I have been a scoutmaster I have enforced a policy of " no bad language " in the troop.

There are other posts in the blogosphere that provide a good summary and analysis of the case.

This is not a subject I ' m an expert on. But it is among the topics that Steven Pinker delves into in his recent book , The Stuff of Thought : Language as a Window on Human Nature. And this makes Pinker ' s analysis a potential source of guidance for the Supreme Court to understand how our emotional brains process swearing , just as he has offered some recent guidance ( in a NY Times op-ed ) on why a grammar-obsessed chief justice might instinctively and unintentionally amend the presidential oath of office , as Chief Justice Roberts did in his first attempt to swear in President Obama . </swear.v.4998><swear.v.4999>After the death of Matthias , departing without issue , Uladislaus , son of Casimir king of Poland , and of Elizabeth daughter to Albert the emperor , and sister to king Ladislaus , married his wife Beatrix , whom Matthias left a widow , and with her was elected king of Hungary , with this condition made between him and Frederic the emperor , that if he died without lawful issue , then the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia should return to Maximilian , son to Frederic. But Uladislaus not long after did repudiate his wife Beatrix , and depriving her of her kingdom , caused the said Beatrix to swear and to consent to his marrying another woman , who was the daughter of the French king , named Anne , procuring from pope Alexander a dispensation for the same , as is before signified.

But this can not be the case , firstly , because the Apostle Paul practised it without giving a hint that he thought it improper ( e.g. , Rom 1 : 9 ); secondly , the writer of Hebrews speaks of God swearing ( Heb 6 : 1617 ); and , thirdly , notice that the Lord does not condemn swearing in the Lord 's name , but swearing by the furnishing of the temple. We therefore believe , with the magisterial Reformers , that the Lord was in fact condemning the Jews ' habit of swearing rashly and trivially. Perhaps the Jews had trivialised the making of an oath so much that they knew better than to swear in God 's name ! </swear.v.5027><swear.v.5028>Notice that the eighteenth degree Mason swears to " observe and obey all the decrees which may be transmitted ... by the Supreme Council of the thirty-third degree " as an " obligation.

A fourth submission was that , if the intention in requiring an affidavit was that greater reliance may be placed on the assertion of compliance because of the penal consequences provided under the relevant State law for false swearing , the immunity of the prosecution staff against legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts performed by them in their official capacity would negate such an objective.2 With all due respect , the objective was made clear at the time. It was to impose some type of additional onus on the prosecution to ensure compliance with the rule , so that one person would take responsibility for giving such an assurance. Having to swear an affidavit is an effective way of focussing the mind of the deponent upon his or her responsibilities. The affidavit was to be filed in the Tribunal , and was to be a practical way of avoiding that person having to give oral evidence in the interlocutory proceedings under solemn declaration in accordance with Rule 90.3 </swear.v.5037><swear.v.5038>Reply to Objection 2 : An oath may lead to an evil result in two ways. First , because from the very outset it has an evil result , either through being evil of its very nature ( as , if a man were to swear to commit adultery ) , or through being a hindrance to a greater good , as if a man were to swear not to enter religion , or not to become a cleric , or that he would not accept a prelacy , supposing it would be expedient for him to accept , or in similar cases. For oaths of this kind are unlawful from the outset : yet with a difference : because if a man swear to commit a sin , he sinned in swearing , and sins in keeping his oath : whereas if a man swear not to perform a greater good , which he is not bound to do withal , he sins indeed in swearing ( through placing an obstacle to the Holy Ghost , Who is the inspirer of good purposes ) , yet he does not sin in keeping his oath , though he does much better if he does not keep it . </swear.v.5038><swear.v.5039>" He told me that when we made love , it would basically mean that we would be together forever for him , " Liz smiled mistily at Maria.

I think that must be one of the greatest tributes to Winston Churchill ever : 'Your word is good enough for me'. That is the believer , that 's the believer - the Lord says : 'Whatsoever is more than these comes of evil'. In other words , if you have to swear it 's either because you 're not trustworthy to tell the truth , or the person does n't trust you to tell the truth. The mistrust is either in you or the other person - and that 's why the Lord says : 'If you have to swear it comes of evil'. Let me go further : that is the reason why we are required to swear in a court of law today , because we live in an evil world - that 's why we do it.

This was somewhat surprising , given that in Western culture , the " general belief is that women 'do n't use bad language ' " ( Stapleton , 2003 , p. 22 ) . Moreover , Herring ( 1996 ) found in a study of academic discussions groups that women generally consider bad language and flaming to be unethical , at best. In Herring 's study , online exchanges among women showed " different interactional norms : little or no flaming and cooperative , polite exchanges , " whereas exchanges among men were largely adversarial ( Herring , 1996 , p. 3 ) . The unexpected findings in the present case may be related to the age of most of the subjects in the study younger , undergraduate college students. Indeed , a study by Bayard and Krishnayya ( 2001 ) of university students ' use of profanity showed that males only swear slightly more than females , and that there was very little difference as to the intensity of the profanity used by the two groups. This is nevertheless an interesting issue and one that calls for further study . </swear.v.5066><swear.v.5067>The husband , however , says what the hell he likes , no matter what little ears are in range.

The reason why this was enjoined upon them , although it was only permitted , was that the confirmation of the internal man also would thus be represented; so that oaths at that time in the name of Jehovah , were as other things were , namely , representative.

Incredible distinctions proliferate under such an approach. Swearing by heaven and earth was not binding , nor was swearing by Jerusalem , though swearing toward Jerusalem was. That an entire mishnaic tract ( M Shebuoth ) is given over to the subject ( cf. also M Sanhedrin 3.2 , Tosephta Nedarim 1; SBK , 1 : 321-36 ) shows that such distinctions became important and were widely discussed.

Did Jesus destroy or abolish the Old Law ? He said he came to fulfill it. Some parts he did set aside and replace under the NT gospel , but some things he only reinforced. When he had fulfilled it , or better said , when it had been fulfilled in all that it was designed to do , it was taken away and replaced with the new law of the gospel ( Gal. 3 : 24-25 , Heb. 10 : 9 ) . Any parts of the Law that carry over into the NT will be noted somewhere , and any parts not carried over by the Lord must not be accepted as binding today. So the question becomes , not was swearing an oath ever permitted , but is it permitted under the New Testament of Jesus Christ. Did Jesus forbid the swearing of any oath or taking any vow in any form under any and all circumstances either in civil court , in private transactions , or in the church ? </swear.v.5092><swear.v.5093>The crazy thing , though , is that the Christian version of the Bible explicitly forbids this kind of oath.

Why should people who are elected as Republicans have to swear allegiance to an institution that they have been sent there to oppose ? It 's hypocrisy ! In fact , why do MPs and Peers have to swear Oaths at all ? In many countries all they need is the Returning Officers Certificate that they are the person who has been duly elected. All a Peer should need is her or his Writ of Summons. And how about those Quakers and others whose highly respectable religious beliefs forbid them to take Oaths or even Affirm ?

When big words , long words and scary foreign words spooky language , as George Carlin would say- was used to intimidate , control and marginalise everybody else ? If you can ' t use the right words , you can ' t be in the club. Isn ' t it time we moved past these ideas ? </swear.v.5228><swear.v.5229>There are , however , still places in the United States where you may have trouble taking public office without swearing an oath to the judeo-christian god. Our own Herb Silverman of the Secular Coalition of America won a unanimous decision in the South Carolina Supreme Court , which struck down the religious test requirement for holding public office in that State. This was possible not only because of the relevant wording in the Constitution , but also because of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Torcaso v. Watkins in 1961 . </swear.v.5229><swear.v.5230>According to a report in the U.K. 's Daily Mail , one school in the town of Wellingborough is allowing pupils to swear at teachers , providing they only do so no more than five times in a class.

Jews , Mennonites , Quakers and atheists can make an affirmation or sign an affidavit instead where such legal options exist. They have all suffered persecution for refusal to swear oaths in the past . </swear.v.5235><swear.v.5236>I swear in almost every conversation I have. I think its just part of language really. Sometimes I swear at members of my family when I am angry. I can not stop swearing because everybody does it. It 's a part of everyday life for some people. Sometimes , especially when I have had a drink I can feel good swearing because it lets anger out , it expresses what you feel to another person . </swear.v.5236><swear.v.5237>Well as for making people Aes Sedai - is n't the Acceptatron a bit like that ?

Although I am usually well behaved , I have a terrible temper and sometimes swear and use bad language -- a habit I want very much to break . </swear.v.5239><swear.v.5240>This may sound immature , but honestly , i 've never heard that word befor , and did n't know that it was a swear word. I assumed that it was just one of those wierd brittish words and passed over it. the cantext was enough for me to get a general idea of what it meant , so it did n't give me any trouble. As for the increase of swear and hand gesture references , that is just to be expected. Harry is growing up , he is becoming a man , just like those around him. I try not to swear , but most of the kids do it. a lot. Since they did n't actually put what word/gesture was used , i do n't think it is that bad. HP is n't for little kids , I have been reading since the age of 8 , but the later books are much more mature and deep , the readers are growing up with the books . </swear.v.5240><swear.v.5241>Swearing originally meant making an oath , and this usage is still used today in official and legal contexts. A court witness will have to swear to tell the truth etc. Very often this swearing is by God , or things considered holy . </swear.v.5241><swear.v.5242>Today is an extremely responsible day for me. A few minutes ago , I swore an oath to our people to unconditionally follow the provisions of our Constitution. On this historic day , we all swear an oath : I do it aloud , and ask you to do it silently. I am confident that each of you has an oath of your own to serve our fatherland and people . </swear.v.5242><swear.v.5243>If you use swearing as a source of attention , ask yourself what is lacking in your life and try to work on improving that aspect of yourself. If you feel easily confronted by other people , seek out groups that teach you about improving self-confidence , assertiveness training and learning to feel at ease in social situations ( including crowds ) . If you prefer one-to-one , ask your doctor or find a psychologist to assist you . </swear.v.5243><swear.v.5244>We also held two Terms ago , in Torcaso v. Watkins , supra , that a State may not constitutionally require an applicant for the office of Notary Public to swear or affirm that he believes in God. The problem of that case was strikingly similar to the issue presented 18 years before in the flag salute case , West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette , supra.

As if the specters of lung cancer and social disdain were n't enough to make them swear off smoking , puffers soon may not even be able to indulge their perfectly legal habit in most public places . </swear.v.5246><swear.v.5247>Consequences for Swearing Like all behaviours that parents would like to control in their children , negative consequences for disobeying household rules about swearing are usually fairly effective ways to encourage cooperation. Obviously , rewards and punishments must vary according to the ages of the children and their level of maturity and understanding. When very young children swear , they are usually simply repeating something that they 've heard , so ignoring the behaviour or mentioning casually that such words are " not nice " is usually enough. As kids age , though , they are capable of understanding what is expected of them and need to be held accountable for their actions. School aged children , pre-teens , and teenagers all have the ability to abide by their parents wishes regarding appropriate language , especially at home . </swear.v.5247><swear.v.5248>Another issue in which the Quran and the Bible disagree is the issue of women bearing witness. It is true that the Quran has instructed the believers dealing in financial transactions to get two male witnesses or one male and two females ( 2 : 282 ) . However , it is also true that the Quran in other situations accepts the testimony of a woman as equal to that of a man. In fact the woman 's testimony can even invalidate the man's. If a man accuses his wife of unchastity , he is required by the Quran to solemnly swear five times as evidence of the wife 's guilt. If the wife denies and swears similarly five times , she is n't considered guilty and in either case the marriage is dissolved ( 24 : 6-11 ) . </swear.v.5248><swear.v.5249>You ' re right that many Muslims will not know the Qur ' an or Islam well enough to know this. As I said before , this is not a fail-safe against perjury any more than swearing on the Bible is. This practice is in fact saying something about us , our society , our civilization , and the source of our laws , not about the person giving testimony. But that , of course , was Prager ' s argument , and you have already given that a once-over . </swear.v.5249><swear.v.5250>Ogun is considered as both a primordial divinity and a deified ancestor. As legend tells us , it was Ogun who cleared the thicket for Olodumare after the other divinities could not. Therefore , the association with Ogun as the one associated with clearing obstacles exists in Yoruba belief. By appeasing Ogun , these obstacles can be overcome. One tradition holds that Ogun was a powerful warrior , the son of Oduduwa , who helped him defeat his enemies. Hence , the association between Ogun and warriors exists. It is still a practice for Yorubas to swear upon Ogun ( represented as a piece of iron ) . If your testimony is false or you break your word , Ogun ' s judgment shall be severe. In this manner Ogun symbolizes or deifies absolute justice. Some other symbols for Ogun are the machete or guns . </swear.v.5250><swear.v.5251>Now just as a declaratory oath , which is about the future or the present , should contain the truth , so too ought the oath which is about something to be done by us in the future. Yet there is a difference : since , in the oath that is about the past or present , this obligation affects , not the thing that already has been or is , but the action of the swearer , in the point of his swearing to what is or was already true; whereas , on the contrary , in the oath that is made about something to be done by us , the obligation falls on the thing guaranteed by oath. For a man is bound to make true what he has sworn , else his oath lacks truth . </swear.v.5251><swear.v.5252>When the President is sworn into office - " I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.

Obviously you have no respect for the laws , or the common sense to realize the reason for the drug test is to keep creeps like you from hurting others. Why not use your brain and swear off drug and alcohol misuse- then you would'nt have to worry about passing a test . </swear.v.5253><swear.v.5254>It was a clever remark and it deserves wider distribution but as CM says the real problem is that political figures are expected ( would it be political suicide not to ? ) swear on a book of mythology. You have to remember that the real crazies like Frist would likely respond that he did swear to uphold the bible and the constituion be damned. I also noted a random quote on Pharyngula about Pat ( I hate people ) Robertson saying the US constitution is dangerous if used by atheists and non-christians. Yes , he is a completly evil human being and anti-humanist but it appears that there is a sizable bunch of loonies that agree with him . </swear.v.5254><swear.v.5255>Still , bad language retains its power to upset and shock at least a proportion of the population. Richard Branson , the greatest ( indeed the only ) hero of the age , found himself constrained to apologise last week for his repeated use over the radio of the verb to " fuck up " in connection with the inability of his railway company to deliver delegates to the Labour Party Conference at Blackpool on time. It 's one thing for our rulers ' trains to be late , and for ministers to be kept waiting on station platforms , but another for the owner of the trains to swear in public . </swear.v.5255><swear.v.5256> For when God made a promise to Abraham , since He had no one greater to swear by , He swore by himself . Hebrews 6 : 13 ( HCSB ) . </swear.v.5256><swear.v.5257>There is a serious point here. I consider it very undemocratic to force someone to swear an oath of allegiance to someone/thing that they do not believe in. The result of this oath is that those who believe in a republic are effectively barred from the democratic process. In Scotland sovereignty lies with the people not with a monarch. So much for free speech . </swear.v.5257><swear.v.5258>No matter how careful you are it 's hard not to ever swear in front of your child. And no matter how good you are , you have no control over other people. We tell our 3 year old , that it 's an " adult " word and it 's not acceptable for him to use yet. That way if he hears it , it 's not such a big deal . </swear.v.5258><swear.v.5259>So the Bible says on more than one occasion that we should not swear and that our " Yes " should be yes and our " No " should be no. But what does that mean exactly ? </swear.v.5259><swear.v.5260>It appears President Obama , as with his predecessor , views his role as that of a CEO for U.S.A. Inc. , and not in any way conversant or familiar with the actual limitations on his office accorded him in our Constitution with respect to the citizenry. He did swear an oath , twice actually , but seems to have the same interpretations of " executive privilege " and " executive powers " as his predecessor and quite a few before him. With 535 other " representatives " you would at least think one of them had read the document upon which they , too , swore and oath . </swear.v.5260><swear.v.5261> After studying the surveys , I decided , and the students quickly agreed , to work on the swearing problem by creating an anti-swearing campaign. </swear.v.5261><swear.v.5262> I vaguely recall feeling very bad about swearing one time when I was rollerblading to the 7-11. I was probably in Grade 8 or 9. I fell , and let out the filthiest stream of curse words. It was awesome in retrospect , but at the time I was like , ' This is so bad.

Should you not be able to eat meat in the lunch room if the parents were trying to raise their children vegetarian ? It 's not your responsiblity. I advise cutting out the swearing not because I agree with the above posters , but because it 's just gon na make you look like an asshole if you 're cussing and nobody else is . </swear.v.5263><swear.v.5264>My response would depend on the situation.

On the second occasion he did not swear on the bible. One should not read too much into this ! Making a mountain out of a mole hill is definitely not important. What is important is that America has got an intelligent vibrant President who is determined to make a difference and tackle the country 's economic ills as well as repair America 's image abroad with an experienced cabinet and team of advisers. There is so much hope and real belief in his abilities and intentions from home and abroad that he would make a real difference.

When you get married , it ' s kind of like buying a used car. Occasionally , you get one that is pretty low mileage , and you can just jump in and take a cross-country road trip.

Not the sin of coarse speech ( which is not , in fact , a sin ) , but of failing to control what we say . </swear.v.5296><swear.v.5297>I answer that , Whatever is required merely as a remedy for an infirmity or a defect , is not reckoned among those things that are desirable for their own sake , but among those that are necessary : this is clear in the case of medicine which is required as a remedy for sickness. Now an oath is required as a remedy to a defect , namely , some man 's lack of belief in another man. Wherefore an oath is not to be reckoned among those things that are desirable for their own sake , but among those that are necessary for this life; and such things are used unduly whenever they are used outside the bounds of necessity. For this reason Augustine says ( De Serm. Dom. in Monte i , 17 ) : " He who understands that swearing is not to be held as a good thing , " i.e. desirable for its own sake , " restrains himself as far as he can from uttering oaths , unless there be urgent need.

If you conclude that it is best to affirm rather than swear an oath , you should do so only if you understand that risks are involved and if you are prepared to deal with them.

These products are designed to get you to quit smoking , but they are not designed to keep you from smoking ever again. These products use nicotine to ease you off of cigarettes.

Nowhere in Scripture will one find support for this kind of sophistic reasoning. In fact , this excuse can easily be reduced to absurdity. If a courtroom witness , for instance , swears to tell nothing but the truth and subsequently utters false testimony , is he thereafter free to perjure his testimony to his heart 's content ? If a secret agent swears to secrecy and thereafter violates his oath by committing a single act of treason , is he then free to commit treason without restraint ?

" Instead of the traditional response , " Stop swearing. " This focus on the reason and not the behavior effectively de-escalates many situations. The fear is that doing this will send the message that the behavior is acceptable. This might be true if the behavior was never addressed. Planned ignoring and interpretation do not mean ignoring forever. That would be condoning. All that happens is the timing of when the behavior is addressed is delayed. After the student is rational , it is important to say , " It 's OK to be upset when you have a bad day; it 's not OK to swear. The consequence for swearing is. " If an adult makes a decision not to immediately address the behavior , it will not be looked on as " condoning " IF that behavior is dealt with in a reasonable length of time.

The State Department would be the primary agent for much of the logistics associated with overseas publicity of the enumeration at the embassies/consulates , along with the distribution of the bulk of the census forms. If the overseas form asked for passport numbers , the State Department would have to match a file of passports on the overseas forms with their official passport files.

Because it strikes most directly at the honor of God and throws contempt upon His name and authority. Let it suffice you to confirm or deny a thing , and stand to your word , and be true to it , so as to give no occasion for your being suspected of falsehood.

After Christ remained silent during the accusational phase of his trial , Caiaphas charged Christ , exclaiming , " I adjure You by the living God , that You tell us whether You are the Christ , the Son of God. Jesus said to him , You have said it yourself ... " ( Matt. 26 : 63 : 64a ) . Literally translated , Caiaphas said to Christ " I swear You [ call on you to swear ] " or " I charge You. " In the rabbinical form of directly affirming an oath , Christ responded to Caiaphas. In other words , by answering Caiaphas ' adjuration , Christ undertook an oath that what He was saying was true.

If Henry II. granted a short and grudging charter , neither of his sons , at their coronations , granted any charter at all. Reasons for the omission readily suggest themselves; the Crown had grown strong enough to dispense with this unwelcome formality , partly because of the absence of rival competitors for the throne , and partly because of the perfection to which the machinery of government had been brought. The utmost the Church could extract from Richard and John , as the price of their consecration , was the renewal of the three vague promises contained in the oath , now taken as a pure formality.
