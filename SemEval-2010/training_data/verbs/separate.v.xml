<separate.v.train><separate.v.1>" That the State must be separated from the Church is a thesis absolutely false , a most pernicious error. Based , as it is , on the principle that the State must not recognize any religious cult , it is in the first place guilty of a great injustice to God ... We owe Him , therefore , not only a private cult , but a public and social worship to honor Him. " - Pope St Pius X </separate.v.1><separate.v.2>California has a statute , Family Code 852 ( c ) , that provides that gifts that are tangible articles of a personal nature and not of substantial value become the separate property of the recipient spouse. The consequence at divorce is that the gifted piece of property does not get divided under the usual community property presumptions. But what do tangible , personal , and substantial mean ? We know clothes and some jewelry come within the gift exception. But what else ? According to a recent court opinion a Porsche , while tangible and substantial , is not personal and thus not separate property . </separate.v.2><separate.v.3>1. Geography : Unlike its main geopolitical rival , the United States , Russia borders most of the regions it wishes to project power into , and few geographic barriers separate it from its targets. Ukraine , Belarus and the Baltic states have zero geographic insulation from Russia. Central Asia is sheltered by distance , but not by mountains or rivers. The Caucasus provide a bit of a speed bump to Russia , but pro-Russian enclaves in Georgia give the Kremlin a secure foothold south of the mountain range ( putting the August Russian-Georgian war in perspective ) . Even if U.S. forces were not tied down in Iraq and Afghanistan , the United States would face potentially insurmoun table difficulties in countering Russian actions in Moscow ' s so-called Near Abroad. Russia can project all manner of influence and intimidation there on the cheap , while even symbolic counters are quite costly for the United States. In contrast , places such as Latin America , Southeast Asia or Africa do not capture much more than the Russian imagination; the Kremlin realizes it can do little more there than stir the occasional pot , and resources are allotted ( centrally , of course ) accordingly . </separate.v.3><separate.v.4>If it was their intention to separate the state and church they would never have taken principles from the Bible and put them into our government. An example of an idea taken from the Bible and then incorporated into our government is found in Isaiah 33 : 22 which says , " For the Lord is our judge , the Lord is our lawgiver , the Lord is our king ... " The founding fathers took this scripture and made three major branches in our government : judicial , legislative , and executive. As mentioned earlier , the founding fathers strongly believed that Man was by nature corrupt and therefore it was necessary to separate the powers of the government. For instance , the President has the power to execute laws but not make them , and Congress has the power to make laws but not to judge the people. The simple principle of checks and balances came from the Bible to protect people from tyranny. The President of the United States is free to influence Congress , although he can not exercise authority over it because they are separated. Since this is true , why should the church not be allowed to influence the state ? </separate.v.4><separate.v.5>Seventeen-year old Gina S. Rey was married , but separated de facto from her husband , when she met petitioner Jacinto Saguid in Marinduque , sometime in July 1987. After a brief courtship , the two decided to cohabit as husband and wife in a house built on a lot owned by Jacintos father. Their cohabitation was not blessed with any children. Jacinto made a living as the patron of their fishing vessel Saguid Brothers. Gina , on the other hand , worked as a fish dealer , but decided to work as an entertainer in Japan from 1992 to 1994 when her relationship with Jacintos relatives turned sour. Her periodic absence , however , did not ebb away the conflict with petitioners relatives. In 1996 , the couple decided to separate and end up their 9-year cohabitation . </separate.v.5><separate.v.6>A high efficiency back side contact solar cell is fabricated using a self-aligning process that reduces the number of masks and alignments as compared with prior processes. The back surface of the cell is patterned by etching into an array of bilevel , interdigitated mesas and trenches , separated by inclined surfaces. Doping of the back surface region produces laterally alternating and overlapping P and N regions associated with the mesas and trenches. A metalization layer is deposited over the entire back side of the cell. The portions of the metalization on the inclined surfaces are readily removed by etching. Removal of the metalization on the inclines surfaces separates the mesa conductors from the trench conductors , leaving a well defined interdigitated array of positive electrodes and negative electrodes . </separate.v.6><separate.v.7>Countess LuAnn de Lesseps can no longer count on her Count.

Would it make a difference if Bishop Robinson practiced celibacy ? It is unclear whether those opposing the consecration of Robinson are in objection solely by the fact that he engages in sex with a man , or simply because he is gay . </separate.v.8><separate.v.9>Practically , this means that a separated or divorced person should live in a way that reflects the fact that they 're still married. They should n't marry , live with , or even date someone else. To do so would be adulterous. Someone who is divorced or separated should be celibate . </separate.v.9><separate.v.10>There is disclosed a solar cell module comprising a solar cell element , a front surface member provided at the light receiving surface side of the solar cell element , and a back surface member provided at the back surface side of the solar cell element. The front surface member and the back surface member are adjoined in a releasable state. At least the front surface member and the solar cell element are in close contact or the front surface member is in close contact with a solid layer which is in close contact with the solar cell element. The solar cell element , the front surface member and the back surface member can be separated without leaving residue of any of the front surface member , the back surface member or the solid layer on the solar cell element. Thus , there is provided a solar cell module allowing for easy component separation and easy collection and classification , whereby recycling of each component , particularly of the solar cell element , is facilitated . </separate.v.10><separate.v.11>One can not take Christianity and Witchcraft , even when one has defined them , and slap them together and call it a system. There are still limitations where some parts of Christianity cancel magical practices out. For example , the importance placed on love and forgiveness in Christian belief would restrict " harmful " spells. While it is fine for some witches to cast curses , and it does not go against their ethical code , when a potential Christian witch is practicing magic , he or she must take into consideration her own ethical code. Also , with Christianity 's worship of God and the belief in His presence in all things , I believe that magic would be hard to separate from spiritual and religious presence in rituals . </separate.v.11><separate.v.12>26. Finally , parishes must be sensitive to the social needs of members with disabilities. We have already touched on some ways in which Christians can express their concern for their brothers and sisters with disabilities. These actions and others like them can help solve some of the individual 's practical problems. They also create an opportunity for disabled and non-disabled people to join hands and break down the barriers that separate them. In such an interchange , it is often the person with a disability who gives the gift of most value . </separate.v.12><separate.v.13>A spokesman for the couple confirmed the break up in a statement , which read : " Perry Fenwick and Angela Lonsdale have sadly separated after five years of marriage. They will not be making any further comment. " </separate.v.13><separate.v.14>I don ' t believe we are judging Todd and his marriage. I for one am not gloating , or happy about this. I am a divorced mother myself , and would not wish that pain on ANYONE. However , what I AM seeing are the FRUITS of his ministry . As a Christian it is my job to discern ( not judge ) what is going on here. A marriage is to be fought for , and the fact that he ' s FILED for separation ( not just quietly and privately separated so they could work out the issues of the relationship ) leads me to believe that Todd has already made up his mind about how this is going to end up. I am truly sorry for Shonnah , and hope she finds out what a true miracle is a miracle of emotional healing . </separate.v.14><separate.v.15>So if the separation from his word has been working toward the goal of separating the Church and faith , we can see the resulting separation from " The Word of God " which is Jesus Christ , who was the living word. A man is separated from or associated with the Son , by way of his actions , and there is no denying the scriptures on that point. Jesus made it clear that if we love him , we will keep his commands , and that we would walk in the footsteps that he foreordained with his life , that we walk in. We find no more powerful a separation form Christ in the world today than the one manifested since the Church in America began to take worldly matters into it 's own hands in the form of political activity to bring about conditions favorable to what he believes he should be in the world ...

The average altitude of the zone varies from 4 , 800mts. to 6 , 000 mts. The important peaks of this region are : Nanda Devi , Kamet , Bander Punchh , Kedarnath , Chaukhamba , Dunagiri , Trishul and Nandakot. Almost all these peaks are glacier-garlanded and are separated by transverse gorges of the Alaknanda , the Bhagirathi and the Dhauli Ganga. The important glaciers of the Kumaon Himadri are : Gangotri , Chaturangi , Bhagirathi , Kharak , Satopanth , Kamet , Milam and Pindari . </separate.v.16><separate.v.17>The transmission and reception devices are spatially separated in the base assembly and in the reflector assembly and form two separate optical light paths. The working procedure is then comparable with two one-way light barriers which have been connected sequentially. In this respect , as shown in the embodiment , both the transmitter and the receiver can in each case be integrated in one unit and only have a corresponding spacing. It is alternatively also possible that the individual transmitters and receivers each form separate units which can then be installed correspondingly more flexibly. The monitoring of a bigger light path is moreover hereby possible. In this respect , different signals also do not necessarily have to be used for the two optical signal paths for the separate arrangement . </separate.v.17><separate.v.18>Perhaps the words of Paul have as much practical meaning as theological importance. Could it be that when he told husbands and wives not to separate or divorce , he considered more than law but also addressed the practicality of reconciliation ? A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does , she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. ( 1 Corinthians 7 : 10-11 ) Yes , you read that right; Paul tells us not to separate and then goes on to tell us what to do if we do separate. Interesting , isn ' t it ? It appears that he envisions times when a couple can not live together , as suggested in the first section of this article. However , unless the continued sin of one spouse prevents reconciliation of the marriage ( 1 Corinthians 7 : 15 , Matthew 19 : 9 ) , God ' s ideal is that we work out our problems and sustain our marriages . </separate.v.18><separate.v.19>Just like having sex with your spouse after you 've separated , there 's nothing wrong with having sex with someone else after you 've separated. Separation is partly defined as leaving a spouse with the intention of ending the relationship. Once you 've separated , the court will consider the romantic , married aspect of the relationship to have concluded and your obligation to remain monogamous along with it. You wo n't be divorced until you get a court order , of course , but the marital aspects of your relationship and the attendant expectations of monogamy will be considered to be at an end . </separate.v.19><separate.v.20>In this bypass-function added solar cell , a plurality of island-like p.sup.+ regions , which is third regions , are formed at a boundary between a p-type region and an n-type region layer constituting a substrate so that the p.sup.+ regions project into the region and the region and are separated away from the surface of the substrate. Therefore , in this solar cell , unlike prior art counterparts , the insulating film for isolating the p.sup.+ regions and the n electrodes constituting the np.sup.+ diode from one another is no longer necessary , thus allowing a reduction in manufacturing cost. As a result , a bypass-function added solar cell with a bypass-diode function added thereto can be provided with low cost and by simple process . </separate.v.20><separate.v.21>The west should separate from Canada.

Separate seating was established in the early church by the apostles whom Jesus assigned the task to help Him to " build my church. " We are told to " stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us , either by word of mouth or by letter " ( II Thessalonians 2 : 15 ) , therefore this apostolic established practice should be retained. Augustine ( 354-430 ad ) wrote about separated seating : " the masses flock to the churches and their chaste acts of worship , where a seemly separation of the sexes is observed; where they learn how they may so spend this earthly life. " </separate.v.22><separate.v.23>Three : Do not separate yourself from the people and do not let the marriage prevent you from participating in social affairs. For your duty to defend the truth and help the deprived is not only limited to singleness. Be aware that marriage is not a golden cage to surround yourself with rather husband and wife are as two wings of a bird , the existence of both of which are essential for flying. It is with the cooperation of each other that you will have a prosperous life . </separate.v.23><separate.v.24>Kate Hudson and Chris Robinson are splitting up after nearly six years of marriage , said her publicist , Brad Cafarelli. " Kate Hudson and Chris Robinson have confirmed that they are separated , " Cafarelli told The Associated Press on Monday . </separate.v.24><separate.v.25>A further form was when the couple registered the fact that they were living together sine manu and explicitly declared their intention to marry. They had to have been living together continuously for a year and could legally enter into the marriage. Over time this reduced to the fact that it was sufficient for the couple to live together openly with the consent of both parties; although there was a 'get out ' in that if they separated for three days during the year the relationship legally started again , it also meant that the woman retained control of her assets on the death of her father. This kind of 'free marriage ' remained in use until the end of the Empire and had the advantage that it could easily be terminated. To dissolve the marriage it was sufficient for the couple to separate and for one partner to issue a formal injunction to the other to 'Take back his/her possessions'. This was a ritual formula that had to be spoken by one partner to the other , or sent in writing or by a messenger . </separate.v.25><separate.v.26>Other Churches , no longer in communion with the Church of Rome , have also maintained Apostolic Succession.

To such believers , since God 's law is Truth and beneficial to all people , any state law or action opposed to God 's law would be harmful to the citizens , and displeasing to God. Many Muslims find the Western concept of separation of Church and State to be mere rebellion against God 's law. There is a contemporary debate in Islam whether obedience to God is ultimately compatible with the Western secular pattern , which separates religion from civic life , as opposed to Islamic ideals of toleration . </separate.v.30><separate.v.31>To add functionality to this system that would allow the caller or receiving party to connect a third party to the call ( often called " conference call " ) , we need to add behavior to the flow of events. One alternative , and the first one we should consider , is to put the differences directly into Place Call. We could model these differences using alternative flows of events , as described in Guidelines : Use Case. This solution works for most simple additions , where the added functionality will not confuse or obscure the original meaning of the use case. The other alternative is to separate the differences into an abstract extension use case called Place Conference Call which extends the base use case . </separate.v.31><separate.v.32>It could be argued that once the personalized contact takes over attraction marketing gives way to relationship marketing.

Recent historians , however , believe that though Robert Browne and other separatists developed ideas identical with those of early Congregationalists , the two groups were wholly distinct : Members of the former were perfectionists and refused to cooperate with other branches of the church; those of the latter were as cooperative as possible without giving up their principles . </separate.v.33><separate.v.34>Bedding Supplies Wholesale &amp;Manufacturers Business - Opening a bedding supplies wholesale and manufacturers business is a rewarding experience as long as you separate yourself from the competition.

While there are relatively few issues where the overlap isn ' t obvious ( as in building codes and traffic matters , perhaps ) , most issues clearly are a matter of both religious and political concern. Long after I wrote the above , Howard Fineman published a book , in 2008. in which he wrote If you cover politics , as I do , or write a book about political history , as I ' ve just done ( The Thirteen American Arguments , Random House ) , you know that we separate church and state , but not faith and politics.

Each Brother had a class of over 100 boys , aged between seven and fourteen. While the work of the Brothers drew favourable comment in the press , as the years passed it seemed the Benedictine 's expected the Brothers to separate from their Superior General in Ireland , and come under Benedictine jurisdiction. The Brothers were unwilling to make this separation and returned to Ireland in March 1847 . </separate.v.38><separate.v.39>Note 3 : There is no consensus on the data of founding of Judaism.

One of the things that separate the church from all other organizations is that it is to be the pillar and support of the truth ( 1 Tim 3 : 15 ) .

Its attendance may be mega , its programs prolific , its enthusiasm contagious , and its motives honorable , but if it is not the pillar and support of truth it fails in its job description as a church.

A spouse who applies for a divorce does not need to prove that the other spouse was at fault. It is possible to simply plead that the marriage has broken down , as established by the fact that the parties are living separate and apart. While a divorce will not be finalized before the parties have lived separate and apart for a period of at least one year , the process can begin as soon as the spouses begin to live separate and apart. A brief attempt at reconciliation during the year will not affect the required separation period if the reconciliation is unsuccessful. Spouses will still be considered to have been separated for one year if they did not live together for more than ninety days following their initial separation . </separate.v.63><separate.v.64>As a continuation of this expansionist policy being carried out under security claims , the Israeli Army issued two new military orders for the construction of two road barriers : the first , on road number 60 in Wadi Hebron connecting Tene settlement with Bir Shiva ' and confiscating 138 dunums for this purpose ( see case study 'security barrier confiscates and separates more of Palestinian land around Tene settlement , July , 2006 '; the second , on bypass road number 3265 that connects the Negohot settlement with Kibutz Sheqiv inside Israel.to the west of Beit Awwa town . </separate.v.64><separate.v.65>The twentieth century thus far has been one of Quaker unity and outreach.

For off-road , this would include buggy , truck , nitro truck , monster truck , etc , while on-road racers will be separated by electric touring car , nitro touring car , " gearbox " ( on-road buggies and trucks ) and possibly other classes. You will be grouped together with similar type vehicles and possibly separated into different skill levels. Smaller tracks or clubs may not separate by skill level and lump everyone driving the same type of car or truck together in one group. Large tracks with many racers in attendance may have up to three skill levels ( typically novice , sportsman and expert ) . If it 's your first race ever , ask to be included in the " rookie " or " novice " class , or just tell them it 's your first time. If you find the novice class is too easy , you can always race in the sportsman class next time . </separate.v.66><separate.v.67>Well , I think we have finally found a point of agreement.

Such bodies have been described as loosely affiliated with the Church of Christ. 1 The founders and members of these churches generally maintain ties with churches of Christ but tend to conceal these connections from the community and from the target audience they are seeking to influence.2 Because the community church movement is relatively new to churches of Christ , many brethren are not aware of what it involves.3 </separate.v.74><separate.v.75>The alleged church autonomy doctrine is an interesting turn on the near-dead notion of the separation of church and state. True constitutional separation of church and state aims to do just that - separate the church from an intermeddling government ( and the government from church control ) . But the Church and other proponents of the church autonomy doctrine are invoking a very different version of the separation of church and state - one that would separate the church from the rule of law , saying that it need not comply with the same laws everyone else in society obeys -- regardless of the sound public policy behind the law . </separate.v.75><separate.v.76>Near Ellensburg , Washington , another breach occurs in the Cascade Range , which separates maritime and continental air.

Our founding fathers were God-fearing men who understood that for a country to stand it must have a solid foundation; the Bible was the source of this foundation. They believed that God 's ways were much higher than Man 's ways and held firmly that the Bible was the absolute standard of truth and used the Bible as a source to form our government . </separate.v.91><separate.v.92>Human beings , in Catholic belief , were originally created to live in union with God. Through the disobedience of the first humans , that relationship was broken and sin and death came into the world ( cf. Romans 5 : 12 ) . Man 's fall left him separated from his original state of intimacy with God which carried into death through the idea of the individual human soul being immortal. But when Jesus came into the world , being both God and man , he was able through his sacrifice to pay the penalty for all human sin and to reconcile humanity with God. By becoming one in Christ , through the Church , humanity was once again capable of intimacy with God but also offered a much more amazing gift : participation in the Divine Life , also called the Beatific Vision . </separate.v.92><separate.v.93>8.

But there can be no doubt that the former were the cause of the latter. Sin in the Church is the origin of the ( equally sinful ) separation from the Church. The process can last for hundreds of years within the Church -- think of the long prelude to the schism with the East and to the Reformation -- but it can always be traced back . </separate.v.98><separate.v.99>These days , most practical proposals for the church start with an idea that the author likes. Rainer and Akin start instead with a biblical and theological foundation. Then they build their practical proposals. Twice they point to Millard Erickson 's helpful observation that many authors today look for the connection between God 's mission and the church 's mission without first meditating on the connection between God 's identity and the church 's identity. Such authors miss the fact that mission flows from identity ( even if the Barthians , panentheists , and Social Trinitarians conflate mission and identity ) . This becomes hugely significant when we get to the nuts and bolts matters of membership , discipline , the ordinances , and so on. When we focus on God 's mission but not his identity , holiness gets lost or redefined , as do the practical boundaries which separate the church from the world . </separate.v.99><separate.v.100>Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ? In this case if the unbeliever is willing to live together peaceably then the believer is bound to not separate , but to continue to dwell together with the unbeliever. Technically he 's not using the word for divorce or " put away " which would be " apoluo " as it is used in the gospels when speaking of divorce. But rather he is using the word " aphiemi " meaning " to send away or to leave " . He 's speaking of a separation , desertion or abandonment as opposed to a divorce. Jesus uses the word " aphiemi " in the gospels for example to say , " Most assuredly I tell you , there is no one who has left house , or wife , or brothers , or parents , or children , for the Kingdom of Gods sake , ...

The Cascades , Sierra Nevada , Tehachapis , and the ranges of Nevada are well exposed to the upper-air winds and therefore experience a winter maximum wind power. Where the mountain ranges and ridgelines are oriented perpendicular to the free-air flow , these winds may be further enhanced. Additionally , these ranges are large enough to separate adjacent air basins. The unequal heating of these basins during spring and summer produces air flow over some of these barriers.

Obviously , believers will answer these questions differently but how each is answered represents the variety of expressions within the Christian church. How Christians personally resolve this tensionshould produce a healthy biblical tolerance , a thankfulness for the multiplicity of expressions of Christianity. It is not easy to resolve the tension between identifying with the culture ' s institutions and structures and seeking to separate from thedistortions of each. Some Christians will choose not to own a TV , not to listen to secular music and to discard old socks rather than darn them.

( 1 Corinthians 7 : 10-11 ) Yes , you read that right; Paul tells us not to separate and then goes on to tell us what to do if we do separate. Interesting , isn ' t it ? It appears that he envisions times when a couple can not live together , as suggested in the first section of this article. However , unless the continued sin of one spouse prevents reconciliation of the marriage ( 1 Corinthians 7 : 15 , Matthew 19 : 9 ) , God ' s ideal is that we work out our problems and sustain our marriages.

No. 6 , 392 , 281 , Tsuge discloses a means of forming a magnetic tunnel junction formed from two ferromagnetic layers separated by an oxide tunnel barrier ( e.g. , Al.sub.2O.sub.3 or MgO ) by first depositing the lower ferromagnetic electrode with or without a metal overlayer and then forming an oxide of the metal layer , if present , and the upper portion of the ferromagnetic layer by exposing these layers to ultra-pure oxygen. When the metal layer is not initially present , a metal layer is subsequently formed on top of the ferromagnetic oxide layer and is then subjected to oxidation by pure oxygen gas. Tsuge argues that a subsequent heat treatment will cause oxygen to diffuse from the ferromagnetic oxide layer into the metal oxide , which forms the tunnel barrier , if the heat of formation of the metal oxide is significantly greater than that of the ferromagnetic oxide . </separate.v.135><separate.v.136>Entitled 2640 of the California Family Code , this refers to separate money used to purchase a community asset wherein one spouse uses separate savings or inheritance toward the down payment on a house the couple purchases together.

The general tendency of the Church in the twentieth century has been toward a conception of social responsibility which virtually made it an agent of secular society. Under the circumstances it is not impossible that a strong countermovement will arise and that Christians will seek forms of church life that are independent of secular society not only in source but also in purpose. The true measure of the Churchs responsibility is not to be found , however , by attending to either extreme or by seeking for a compromise position between them but rather by attending to the two aspects of Christian responsibility in the right way. The relation to God and the relation to society must neither be confused with each other as is the case in social religion , nor separated from each other as is the case in Christian isolationism; they must be maintained in the unity of responsibility to God for the neighbor . </separate.v.157><separate.v.158>You can not separate sex from love in a marriage.

Parental discipline warns children of the dangers of immoral behaviour. The discipline that parents exercise over their children is a sign of their love , for while any discipline seems unpleasant at the time , it produces a harvest of good in the long run. Parents are to teach their children the difference between right and wrong , and , by their behaviour , set an example for their children to follow. A major problem associated with divorce is that it separates parents from their children. This makes it difficult for parents to discipline their children and to teach them a moral foundation on which they can base their lives. By divorcing , parents show their children that marriage does not matter; by honouring their marriage vows , parents teach their children the importance of marriage and the family . </separate.v.163><separate.v.164>16 Well chambered coverglass cell culture vessel has a 2 x 8 format with standard 96 well plate volumes and well spacing.

The August Theses make the argument that the FFLP can be developed into a mass Communist party. There is no foundation for such an assertion. The conditions for the building of a mass Communist party are the existence of a closely knit Communist nucleus operating within the broadest mass organizations of the workers , permeating them with its doctrines and sweeping the most advanced of them into its ranks. The WP is such a Communist nucleus , and the naturally developing labor party movement is such a mass organization. By working within this mass organization and pushing it forward , the WP is bound to expand and extend its influence. The organization of the FFLP does not facilitate this development , but interferes with it.

While banks retained the ability to handle certain securities such as Treasuries , Section 20 prohibited banks from affiliating with firms " engaged principally " in underwriting and dealing in securities , like corporate bonds and equity.

It does not mean they have their own identity or their own name that is separate from the rest of the church in that city. Multiple Christians in any setting can be referred to as the church. Paul is not coming from a bias of division that we all tend to have. Therefore , he would not be stating that the Christians that meet at those particular homes are an entity in and of themselves , or who are separated from the rest of the Christians in the city and who have their own boundary.

It would seem that the majority of consumers perceive cell phone handsets to have continued value , even after they have finished using them , and prefer to hold onto them , rather than return them. This approach is partly because of the financial outlay associated with the cell phone and the logic that an old " back-up " phone may be useful if the replacement malfunctions. This leads to the issue of whether to incentivise any handset return programmes that are launched , to offset the perceived value of the handset to the consumer. Historically , this has been done by both Vodafone and Telecom by offering free air time per handset returned. This may be , for example , a $ 5 credit for each component returned , however , Vodafone have already found issues with unscrupulous owners returning their handsets in a broken down form , such as mobile charger , battery and handset separated , and claiming the $ 5 air time for each component . </separate.v.249><separate.v.250>Love and sex can most definitely be separated , tho not easily.

And girls can not learn how to become healthy women from even the most loving father ( or pair of fathers ) alone. This learning takes place day by day and often by example in the larger context of intimate family life. The need for fathers is particularly acute for boys , moreover.

While we are bound to favor the formation of a third party as the result of a split in the ranks of the capitalist parties , our main task is to prevent the stultification of the Farmer-Labor movement to such an end. This fight can be made successfully only on the condition that we and our closest sympathizers are not isolated in a separate party of our own , but that we have attached ourselves inseparably to the mass movement. The separate existence of a small labor party under the direct control of the Communists jeopardizes the main labor party movement by separating it from the one element , the Communists , that can safeguard it from the machinations of traitorous politicians . </separate.v.261><separate.v.262>Narthex or Vestibule - a true narthex is either an outside , covered porch-like structure or an inside area separated from the nave , but this word has come to mean " entry " or " foyer.

The two p-n junctions are interconnected in anti-parallel , so that , when a reverse voltage is applied to the first p-n junction , the second p-n junction is forward biased to permit current flow therein , thereby preventing the solar cell from breaking down. Since the first and second p-n junctions are integrated with each other , the cost of fabricating the solar cell is decreased and the reliability thereof is improved . </separate.v.328><separate.v.329>You are no longer married to , or are legally separated from , the spouse with whom you filed the joint return for which you are requesting relief.

They argue that the church certainly is in the world to do good to the world. Here are these cities , states , and nations that are corrupt. The Church must have some influence upon them.

In early America , even after church establishment ended , some state legislators sought to revive the compulsory taxation of citizens to support religious institutions. In this century , public schools were once required to teach the biblical version of the earth 's and humanity 's creation , while the scientific theory of evolution was prohibited. Throughout our history , sectarian advocates have tried to inject religious exercises , such a s daily prayer , into the public schools. At times , religious minorities , including members of " cults , " have been discriminated against because of their beliefs. And today , many citizens in many communities disagree about whether a model of the infant Jesus in the manger , which officially promotes certain religious beliefs over others , should be displayed on the steps of City Hall.

This is partly a consequence of methodology. As there is a general reduction in importances towards venture creation , these " middle " groups , when compared to pooled means of all groups , are less likely to be significant.

After that time much of it was submerged before reemerging about 3 million years later. Like Jamaica , it has a mountainous backbone and a limestone belt. It has as well isolated mountain massifs near its eastern tip , namely the Luquillo and Pandura ranges. Similar to Hispaniola , its tallest mountains are near the center of the island. Among the Greater Antilles , its submerged insular platform is the most extensive in proportion to the emergent area and it has numerous satellite islands and cays , largest of which are Culebra , Vieques , and the northern Virgin Islands. That means that if the size of the insular bank and , thus , the extension of the biogeographic unit are considered , the third largest island in the Caribbean turns out to be Puerto Rico , and not the taller Jamaica. However , that is not obvious if one looks at a normal map , because almost half of Puerto Rico is today under a mere 100 meters of sea water . </separate.v.340><separate.v.341>A device is provided which comprises a solar cell section and a thin film battery section.

Before this constitution , Thailand was best known for its frequent changes in leadership and regular military coups that interrupted the countries economic and political stability. The constitution has attempted to address this situation by providing more authority into the executive branch of government , not to mention allowing the people more opportunities to contribute in the governing system. But by doing so , the most crucial consequence directly associated from this constitution has been the increase in the Prime Ministers powers and authority , because the constitution separated the executive and the legislative branches from one another . </separate.v.352><separate.v.353>Congress acted in 1998 to make it easier to avoid paying taxes that should have been paid by your spouse or former spouse.

When He was questioned about the reasons for divorce , he quoted the two verses from Genesis mentioned above and then emphasized that those who marry are joined by God and so should not be separated by other people. When a man and a woman are joined in marriage , they are obeying God 's law and are joined together as husband and wife. The union is permanent and the married couple should not separate - marriage is for life. So marriage is a serious undertaking which is to provide security for the children that may result. For these reasons other people must not attempt to destroy a marriage and marriage partners must not allow any relationship to develop that endangers it. Jesus said that marital unfaithfulness is to be avoided at all costs , for it constitutes grounds for divorce. Cohabitation , as we shall see later , is not characterised by faithfulness to one partner.

The ultimate meaning of marriage is the representation of the covenant keeping love between Christ and his church. To live this truth and to show this truth is what it means , most deeply , to be married. This is the ultimate reason why marriage exists. There are other reasons , but this is the main one. Therefore , if Christ ever abandons and discards his church , then a man may divorce his wife. And if the blood-bought church , under the new covenant , ever ceases to be the bride of Christ , then a wife may legitimately divorce her husband. But as long as Christ keeps his covenant with his bride , the church , and as long as the church , by the sustaining grace of God , remains the chosen people of Jesus Christ , then the very meaning of marriage will include : What God has joined , only God can separate , not man . </separate.v.390><separate.v.391>However , spiritually and emotionally , I actually do believe that we become one.

The effort to separate yoga from Hinduism must be challenged because it runs counter to the fundamental principles upon which yoga itself is premised , the yamas ( restraints ) and niyamas ( observances ) . These ethical tenets and religious practices are the first two limbs of the eight-limbed ashtanga yoga system which also includes asana ( postures ) , pranayama ( breath control ) , pratyahara ( sense withdrawal ) , dharana ( concentration ) , dhyana ( meditation ) and samadhi ( contemplation/Self Realization ) .

During the two-year period , the court may still grant and enforce temporary orders for things like child support , parenting time ( formerly known as " visitation " ) and spousal support ( sometimes called " alimony " or " spousal maintenance " ) . </separate.v.467><separate.v.468>Because the IMF was designed to treat both taxpayers who filed a joint tax return as one unit with a joint tax liability , it has been difficult for the IRS to separate the joint tax liabilities [ 7 ] once an Innocent Spouse claim was determined to have met the basic requirements for processing. The IRS now addresses this problem through the mirroring process , which creates two identical individual accounts on the IMF for each joint tax liability listed on the Innocent Spouse claim. A number of steps in this process are designed to protect the rights of the requesting spouse and the Federal Government ' s interest while ensuring continued collection enforcement actions are taken against the other ( nonrequesting ) spouse . </separate.v.468><separate.v.469>MAR'RIAGE , n.

Recognizing mistakes , taking responsibility for them , expressing remorse for any hurt caused , and making a commitment to change the hurtful behavior are all essential to mending the relationship after a mistake. For spouses who have created a chasm of hurts that separate them , offering a sincere and humble apology is the first step in building a bridge over that chasm. Even if you believe that your partner made the mistake , you can begin the healing by finding something you did that calls for an apology . </separate.v.473><separate.v.474>With the exception of a bankruptcy case , the issue presented is one of first impression. In Colwell v. Royal International Trading Corp. , 226 B.R. 714 ( S.D.Fla.1998 ) , the bankruptcy court held that a husband and wife who had been living separately for more than three years could not each claim a homestead exemption under the Florida Constitution , but on appeal , the district court reversed. Although the facts are not identical , Colwell is significant because it recognizes that married people who live separately can each have a homestead exemption. In Colwell , at the time they filed their bankruptcy petition , the husband and wife were married , but had been separated for over three years and living in residences owned individually by each. Each had obtained a homestead exemption for tax purposes. Relying on the same principles this court relied on in Myers , the district court judge reversed the bankruptcy court and allowed homestead exemptions to each spouse . </separate.v.474><separate.v.475>But another process , recognizable far and wide in dynamic zoogeography , may be called into account without assuming any departure in the past from topographic and climatic conditions as they are today. Comparison of the fauna of the Lower Sonoran plains of south central Arizona with that of the Mohave desert plateau in the same zone , shows two prevalent character combinations among the nearly related component species. The mid-Arizona representatives are usually dark colored and large sized , the reverse appearing to hold in the majority [ [ p. 106 ] ] of the Mohave desert forms. There is considerable floral difference in the two regions , and minor climatic differences are well known. Different environments thus impinge upon the animals in these widely separated centers , and more or less regular blending of conditions occurs between. Although every factor of environment may be identical immediately on the two sides of the Colorado River , the animals now there have undoubtedly descended from ancestral lines which have invaded the territory from the two opposite directions , bringing with them by inheritance the characters developed under the two different sets of conditions . </separate.v.475><separate.v.476>The last several decades have not been kind to Lutheranism.

Lutheranism in all its parts , both in this country and elsewhere , had settled for being a permanently separated Protestant denomination; or , as the case may be , several Protestant denominations. Some of my Lutheran friends say that , in entering into full communion with the Catholic Church , I acted precipitously , I jumped the gun.

The state in America is separated from the church. American government tolerates no single form of religious worship but shelters and protects alike all.

It was the contention of a certain faction ( roughly 40 of the total membership ) of the church membership at that time that because scandal ( public sin ) had arisen and become known it was necessary for the church to separate from the PCA. This was in spite of the fact that a judicial commission had been erected within the PCA and was even then dealing with the scandal. The officer was deposed and suspended for a definite period from the sacraments. Yet the separatist faction insisted , despite the teaching of SC 91 and LC 161 , that the sin of the administrator of the sacrament causes the sacrament to become tainted even for those who receive it by faith . </separate.v.485><separate.v.486>Spanish king ' s daughter to separate from husbandMADRID -- The eldest daughter of Spain ' s King Juan Carlos , Elena , is to separate from her husband , the royal palace announced Tuesday.

For example , Welsh and Lind ( 1992 ) found that over six months , 66 of Plethodon elongatus males and 80 of females recaptured were in the same 7.5 x 7.5 m grid , and the maximum distance moved was 36.2 m. D. Clayton ( pers. comm 1998 ) estimated that average home ranges may be as small as one square meter. Yet , on occasion , dispersing plethodontids likely travel at least several hundred meters. The separation distance for unsuitable habitat reflects the nominal minimum value of 1 km. The separation distance for suitable habitat reflects the limited movements of these salamanders , tempered by their tendency to occur throughout patches of suitable habitat and the likely low probability that two locations separated by a gap of less than a few kilometers of suitable habitat would represent independent occurrences over the long term . </separate.v.499><separate.v.500>Building Inspection Commercial Business - Opening a building inspection commercial business is an excellent entrepreneurial opportunity as long as you separate yourself from the competition.

As discussed in the article " UNDER SIEGE " on this site , a myriad of attacks have been mounted in the world today against God 's word. It is vital to the destruction of faith for the enemy to discredit the Bible in any way he can. Most of the sciences existing in the world today are primarily working toward this goal. We can see the successes of this in the fact that many believers today attempt to make their beliefs in some way accommodate the supposed facts of science. It is a most powerful attack , since it relies on a person 's pride , in that they do not want to appear " ignorant " of " facts " that most of the scientific world pontificates as truth.

If your name appears on a lease or mortgage for the residence where your spouse will live , you will remain liable for payments. Similarly , if you continue to share joint credit accounts , including credit cards , or your name appears on any utility bills ( phone , gas , electrical , etc. ) you will ordinarily be liable for any debt incurred by your spouse even after separation.

Although this is not a rule , we do see more instances of men cheating on their wives purely for the physical act of sex. These men are more likely to have a relationship with any willing female and to allow that relationship to end quickly or immediately than are women. Women committing adultery tend to initiate an affair for some greater purpose than lust. A woman can find a man for sex any time they want to whereas a man can not always find a woman willing to have sex with him. These types of cheating men will often have more interest in the physical aspect of the relationship and tend not to get as emotionally attached to their cheating partner in the affair as women do. Experts say that unlike women who undoubtedly fantasize about extracurricular romance but who are able to separate that fantasy from reality; men are more likely to be unable to distinguish between mental longings and physical transgressions , many times not realizing the true scope of what they are doing until it 's too late . </separate.v.565><separate.v.566>Let us assume that fornication means adultery in Matthew 5 : 32 and 19 : 9.

What a mistake ! Imagine that you have two glasses of water in front of you. One is clear and represents your personal life and the other is cloudy and represents your professional life. Why would you want to mix the dirty water with the clear , clean water ? All you would end up with is two glasses of cloudy , dirty water. Why not keep them separate ? If your job does n't fulfill your expectations for the day and is a source of disappointment , do n't bring it home. It 's a decision you can make. Just because one part of your life is n't working does n't mean that the other has to break down as well . </separate.v.594><separate.v.595>You , your husband , and your 10-year-old son lived together until August 1 , 2008 , when your husband moved out of the household. In August and September , your son lived with you. For the rest of the year , your son lived with your husband. Your son is a qualifying child of both you and your husband because your son lived with each of you for more than half the year and because he met the relationship , age , and support tests for both of you. At the end of the year , you and your husband still were not divorced , legally separated , or separated under a written separation agreement and you and he did not live apart for the last 6 months of the year , so the special rule for divorced or separated parents does not apply . </separate.v.595><separate.v.596>3.

This phase of the innovation chain sometimes known as the " valley of death " is the point at which costs and risks usually rise very substantially for technology developers and where investors and financiers typically seek firmer assurances about the scale of their likely return. To some extent , in an efficient market , the higher costs and risks of the demonstration phase should act to separate out the most promising technology options from those with less potential. However broader market failures , including uncertainties about the scale of potential markets for such new technologies , or the degree to which they will be supported by carbon pricing or other regulatory interventions , can act as a significant deterrent to further development even for technology options with significant long term commercial potential . </separate.v.597><separate.v.598>Through November , a barrier will separate the westbound U.S. 2 exit to the southbound I-5 onramp from the offramp to California and Walnut streets.

Any attempt to unlawfully separate a husband and wife would constitute an unjustified divorce in the eyes of Elohim. Since the very definition of adultery is " woman that breaketh wedlock " , if a husband unjustly divorces a wife , he is in effect forcing her to break her marriage covenant by causing her to commit adultery against him when she remarries. The husband is not committing adultery in this case , even though he orchestrated these events . </separate.v.603><separate.v.604>They are among the most soaring words ever penned.

It is located in a large valley that is separated by the Wasatch Mountains to the east and Utah Lake to the west. The metro area below the mountains is known commonly as the Wasatch Front.

Indeed , one must add that it can not be separated from this Christian environment and transplanted into any other system , as is shown very clearly today in the renaissance of Islam; the attempt to graft on to Islamic societies what are termed western standards cut loose from their Christian foundations misunderstands the internal logic of Islam as well as the historical logic to which these western standards belong , and hence this attempt was condemned to fail in this form. The construction of society in Islam is theocratic , and therefore monist and not dualist; dualism , which is the precondition for freedom , presupposes for its part the logic of the Christian thing. In practice this means that it is only where the duality of Church and state , of the sacral and the political authority , remains maintained in some form or another that the fundamental pre-condition exists for freedom . </separate.v.610><separate.v.611>If the wife initiated the separation of " what God has joined " ( divorced her husband ) and remarried without him first having committed sexual immorality , she would be guilty of adultery. If the wife were guilty of " sexual immorality " and her husband divorced her , she would need to deal with her sin in a Godly way. She must confess and forsake. Prior to coming to repentance , she would be described this way , 33 " as a wife treacherously departs from her husband , so have you dealt treacherously with Me , O house of Israel. " But if a husband , unlike God , breaks the marriage covenant ( i.e. separates what 9 " God has joined together " by immorality ) , then his wife would not commit adultery if she remarried. If her husband separated what God had joined together , simply by divorce without first committing sexual immorality , he would be responsible for " causing " her to commit the act of adultery. " If the wife committed " sexual immorality , " which prompted her husband to divorce her , then in essence she had separated " what God had joined.

Ukraine , Belarus and the Baltic states have zero geographic insulation from Russia. Central Asia is sheltered by distance , but not by mountains or rivers. The Caucasus provide a bit of a speed bump to Russia , but pro-Russian enclaves in Georgia give the Kremlin a secure foothold south of the mountain range ( putting the August Russian-Georgian war in perspective ) . Even if U.S. forces were not tied down in Iraq and Afghanistan , the United States would face potentially insurmountable difficulties in countering Russian actions in Moscow ' s so-called Near Abroad. Russia can project all manner of influence and intimidation there on the cheap , while even symbolic counters are quite costly for the United States. In contrast , places such as Latin America , Southeast Asia or Africa do not capture much more than the Russian imagination; the Kremlin realizes it can do little more there than stir the occasional pot , and resources are allotted ( centrally , of course ) accordingly . </separate.v.615><separate.v.616>If you separate , you and your partner may make an informal arrangement for contact with your child.

To repent means to quit doing the sin. Scripture says that if you marry a divorced woman , you are living in a state of adultery.

In each case we are dealing with individual groups or bishops who regularly divide themselves into a party of agreement and a party of objection whenever reunion with the Catholic Church is contemplated. And , seemingly , the best that such groups can produce is an offer of abstract catholicity arrived at by overlooking real differences.

" " Investing in the relationship " means making a special effort in the first period that will only yield the investor benefits in the second period , and will yield benefits in the second period only if the couple stay together. At the end of the first period , if there has been no vow , each partner decides whether to remain together for the second period or separate. If either prefers to separate , then separation occurs; but if both choose to remain together , they remain together for the second period.

" </separate.v.634><separate.v.635>Having stressed the importance of the creational ordinance of marriage , Jesus concluded with the words , ' Therefore what God has joined together , let man not separate. ' He contrasts the divine action of joining together husband and wife with the human inclination to separate as a matter of convenience. According to Jesus , it is God who joins a husband and wife in marriage. This means that God is the author of the new family created by marriage. And so we see a profound biblical truth families are created by God , and not by man. Jesus is saying that at the most fundamental level a man and woman are joined by God to become a family in marriage. In his book Divorce &amp;Remarriage ( 1993 ) , Andrew Cornes writes , ' whenever a man and woman marry , whatever the circumstances that have brought them together , it is God who is yoking them to one another ' .14 Therefore those who think correctly about marriage will no longer think of a man and his wife as two separate entities.15 </separate.v.635><separate.v.636>The solution lies in the awareness of what " holy " means in the Bible. To be holy is to be separated from what is profane and to be dedicated to the service of God. It does not mean that the Christian is free of sin. The apostle Paul said of himself : " Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect " ( Phil. 3 : 12a ) , and in the greetings to the Corinthian Christians he calls them " sanctified " and " saints.

By creating a separate diocese , church authorities acknowledged that the number of Catholics abiding in and near Chicago had risen sufficiently to sustain an independent ecclesiastical existence. Roman authorities appointed William Quarter as the first bishop of the new diocese. Quarter began to lay the groundwork for vigorous church life by creating parishes , establishing a seminary , and developing other educational institutions staffed by male and female religious communities. He also petitioned the legislature to establish the Chicago bishop and his successors as a corporation sole. This gave future bishops enormous power in arranging church affairs and developing the Catholic presence in the city. After Quarter 's death the diocese suffered three decades of administrative instability , compounded by the loss of nearly a million dollars in church property in the Fire of 1871 . </separate.v.642><separate.v.643>The Church of the Nazarene has undergone a few changes since its beginning.

On October 13 , 1908 , the Holiness Church of Christ united with the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene which signifies the official founding of the Church of the Nazarene.

An optional germanium ( Ge ) p-n junction can be formed in the substrate upon which the other p-n junctions are grown. The bandgap energies for each p-n junction are tailored to provide substantially equal short-circuit currents for each p-n junction , thereby eliminating current bottlenecks and improving the overall energy conversion efficiency of the solar cell. Additionally , the use of an InGaAsN p-n junction overcomes super-bandgap energy losses that are present in conventional multi-junction solar cells.

No. 2 , 600 , 566 ( issued June 17 , 1952 to F. W. Moffett ) which affords a frozen food package , such as an ice cream package whereby a body of ice cream or frozen dessert and a body of topping or syrup adapted to be liquified upon heating is separated by an edible or other insulating barrier or layer as for instance , a cake-like layer positioned between the ice cream and body of topping material. The cake-like layer acts to keep the syrup or topping hot. Unfortunately , such cake-like barriers , while edible , provide little resistance to moisture migration between the two food components. Thus , at best , such known barriers can be used only with products wherein the components differ only slightly with regard to such important features as water activity or could only be used for frozen foods. Additionally , the cake-like layer provides only modest support strength. Thus , the cake-like barrier could not be used with regard to two-component food products , the major weight fraction of which is a moist food , e.g. , yogurt and a minor portion of which is composed of individual pieces of dry , frangible particulate material , e.g. , ready-to-eat whole wheat flakes . </separate.v.652><separate.v.653>Polygynous marriage : A man would leave his family of origin and join with his first wife.

While hydrogen is in great abundance on earth , it is not easily isolated for use as a fuel. Currently , the most economical and practical source for hydrogen gas is fossil fuels , such as natural gas , gasoline , methane , and propane , though in the future it may become cost competitive to get renewable hydrogen from water via electrolysis powered by renewable electricity generating sources such as the sun and wind. These fossil fuels are all composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms.

For example , one court decision in 1959 that upheld laws against interracial marriage actually stated : Almighty God created the races white , black , yellow , malay and red , and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.

Thus , absent a written separation agreement , there are important strategic advantages to staying in the house. The aphorism if you want the house , don ' t leave the house; if you want the kids , don ' t leave the kids may not be universally true but it is almost always good advice. The party who moves out of the house and leaves the children , weakens his or her custody claim ( and destroys any claim that the other parent is unfit ) . The party who moves out and takes the children risks a claim that he or she has disrupted the children ' s lives.

One of hydrogen 's advantages is that it can be made from a variety of local resources like water , plants , coal , natural gas and even algae.

His proposal , he argues , is modeled after Jesus , for He separated from the evils of His culture , identified with its institutions and people , yet sought to transform it from the inside out. By adding to His deity humanity , Jesus identified with the world andits social order ( e.g. , its people and its customs ) . Similarly , the church is to do the same. At bottom , this is the heart of Christ ' s admonition that we are to be in the world but not of the world. Yet Christ separated Himself from the evil distortions of the created order. He had nothing to do with the distorted use of wealth , social positionor political power. Finally , through His death , burial and resurrection , He broke the power of sin and Satan and guarantees the world ' s transformation when He returns in glory and power. Similarly , the church is to move culture ' s institutions toward genuine , biblical righteousness , all the while anticipating His final transforming work when He returns . </separate.v.742><separate.v.743>What is meant by " The Separation Of Church And Faith " ?

Second-century Christianity , as represented in the epistles of John , in the Didach and other contemporary writings , tended to make the commandment not to love the world nor the things that are in the world into an injunction to separate the Christian community from the political and cultural societies of the time. It thought of the Church as a new society for the sake of which the world had been created and which was destined to govern the world. Again in the monastic movement the temptation to isolation. ism had to be combated ever and again by the great reformers who sought to make the monk a servant of mankind rather than a seeker after his own holiness. Protestant sects also have been tempted to pursue a sort of perfectionism that was highly self-regarding while another stream in Protestant religion has been so spiritualistic and individualistic that the concrete life of the secular societies has been actually ignored as beyond the scope of a spiritual churchs responsibility . </separate.v.755><separate.v.756>All this we know.

Most of these ranges are short , under 100 miles in length , and trend in a north-south direction ( although the pattern in the south is mixed ) . These mountain systems are the jagged edges of giant blocks of the earth 's crust that were uplifted by the same plate tectonic processes that built the mountains and plateaus of the rest of the Mountain West. However , there was insufficient material within the earth to support this uplift , so the blocks of earth caved in on each other.

Most priests will recognise that to demand that cohabitees separate before marriage is unreasonable. Yet there are ways in which they might be encouraged to do so. Some way needs to be found to help couples see that marriage is not a continuation of the life already begun as a cohabiting couple. As the Catechism says : " Those who are engaged to marry are called to live chastity in continence. They should see in this time of testing a discovery of mutual respect , an apprenticeship in fidelity , and the hope of receiving one another from God. They should reserve for marriage the expressions of affection that belong to married love. They will help each other grow in chastity " .

In particular , U.S. Pat. No. 4 , 233 , 325 issued Nov. 11 , 1980 to Slangan et al. ) disclosed an ice cream package including a compartment for heating syrup. However , the barrier between the syrup and the ice cream is not edible. Thus , the package compartment housing the syrup must be removed entirely and the syrup poured onto the ice cream in the lower compartment. It is possible to make the supporting member of the compartment pierceable or tearable allowing for penetration thereof by , for example , a spoon , the contents of the upper container could then be allowed to fall or drain into the lower compartment. However , such construction suffers from several disadvantages. First , there is a trade-off between support strength of the barrier and the pierceability of the barrier. Second , for barriers which are more readily pierceable , fragments of the barrier material can be intermixed with the food. Not only is such admixture aesthetically unpleasant but consumption of the pieces of ruptured membrane material could possibly result in serious health problems . </separate.v.772><separate.v.773>If a woman generally experiences the onset of her cycle at a fixed interval , for example , every twenty-eight days , then she must separate from her husband on the day her flow is expected based on this interval.

Clear biblical examples of this choice are Noah ( whom God called out of the culture before He destroyed it ) , Abram ( called to separate from pagan Mesopotamia ) and Moses ( called to separate from idolatrous Egypt ) . The New Testament buttresses this conviction with verses like Matthew 6 : 24 ( You can not serve two masters . . . ) , 1 Peter 2 : 11 and 1 John 2 : 15. For this model , the church of Jesus Christ is a counterculture which lives by kingdom principles.

In the case , [ *89 ] Chief Justice John Marshall used the contract clause to protect Dartmouth ' s corporate charter from the state government ' s threatened alteration. For McGarvie , the upshot of the decision was to reinforce the idea that religious institutions ( such as Dartmouth in the early nineteenth century ) were essentially private entities under the law and therefore separated from distinctive public purposes. Readers might be left wondering if McGarvie , who claims DARTMOUTH COLLEGE privatized religion ( my emphasis ) , not just the church , and also secularized and expanded the public realm ( p.188 ) , has ascribed far too much influence to this single case. Still , his use of the case is illuminating as an example of how contract law reflected the ideological tensions of the day . </separate.v.776><separate.v.777>Marital 'quality ' , a catch-all phrase that refers to satisfaction , adjustment and happiness , was the focus of intense research energy through the 1980s and 1990s.

This is done by using a first conductivity type junction on the front of a high resistivity cell and a second , opposite conductivity type junction on the back of the cell. The two junctions are separated by an intrinsic region , and the cell potential , which is normally reduced by using high resistivity substrate material , is instead raised by using the second junction. The cell includes a reflective back surface and a non-reflective front surface to further enhance light absorption within the active cell volume. The reflective back surface is formed by polishing the substrate. The non-reflective front surface is a multi-pyramidal or V-grooved surface formed by preferential etching of the substrate material. The front electrode is a fine geometry grid deposited over the front surface of the cell. An anti-reflection coating may additionally be provided over the front surface of the cell to further promote the non-reflective characteristics of that surface.

It was also recognized that the flexibilities that already exist in current legislative and policy frameworks are not being exploited to full advantage. Annexes 4 and 5 outline some of these mechanisms for the Public Service and illustrate how barriers proliferate as movement between the Public Service , separate employers , and other federal organizations is considered.

If she were divorced , she wouldn ' t have a husband. But when you ' re just separated , you still have a husband . </separate.v.795><separate.v.796>So , through the 1960s and ' 70s , churches in the region formally separated themselves from their U.S. brothers and sisters.

It would probably be helpful to give several examples. Examples should be chosen by the teacher and relate to material students have studied previously.

They believe one must believe in Jesus , repent , bear all the fruits of a disciple , and experience water baptism ( in that order ) to be saved. The Christian theology , however , is that you only have to believe. Since this cult considers a Christian who commits a sin to be unsaved in the first place , they separate from Christian theology concerning repentance. So the only agreement that can be made is belief in our Lord Jesus Christ. But unlike the thinking of this cult , the Christian belief is not just in the existence of Jesus as even the demons believe , but rather a belief that leads to repentance and obedience. For the Christian , all works , except believing , are done after salvation. And the conditions for remaining saved are the same as for getting saved . </separate.v.799><separate.v.800>Punctuation is not used at the ends of lines ( commas , periods , colons , etc. ); however , commas are used within lines to separate the day from the date , the city from the state and a man 's surname from " Jr./junior/II/III , " etc . </separate.v.800><separate.v.801>Baby Food and Formula Business - Opening a baby foods and formulas business can get you on the path to a secure financial future as long as you separate yourself from the competition.

When the Church of England separated from Rome , the nation was thoroughly churched. Reformation did not involve church planting; it involved reforming the existing life of the church its structures , its doctrine , its clergy and its liturgy. However , in the 19th century , as Anglicanism spread around the globe , the missionary impulse entered the Anglican fold. To some degree in the United States ( there is a robust history of church planting by the Episcopal Church in the 19th century ) but mostly in Africa and Asia , Anglicanism has taken on a missionary DNA that has led to church planting and church planting movements. One of the classic texts on church planting was penned by Anglican cleric and missionary Roland Allen entitled The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church : And the Causes Which Hinder It. In the 20th century the church planting impulse has become part of global Anglicanism. In Rwanda , the Anglican Church has all the classic structures diocese , bishop , parish one finds in the Church of England , but the aim of these structures is to facilitate evangelism , discipleship and church planting . </separate.v.802><separate.v.803>KAUSANI : Nestling among thick , dense pine forests atop a narrow ridge and separated from the towering mountains of the Nanda Devi range by low , medium mountains; at Kausani the grandeur of the Himalayan scenery comes alive.

What was addressed up to this point in our opinion , is the groundwork needed for the enemy to bring about the results I will address in this section. What will be addressed in the last section : " Separated from His Spirit " will be the ultimate cost of the activity in the first two sections , and is clearly foretold by scripture as that result . </separate.v.804><separate.v.805>A process for fabricating layered semiconductor structures , particularly thin gallium arsenide solar cells , on reusable substrates. The structure is fabricated by depositing a selectively removable layer such as gallium aluminum arsenide onto a substrate , and then depositing a solar cell basic structure on the selectively removable layer. Preferably , the solar cell basic structure includes a layer of p-type gallium arsenide on the layer of gallium aluminum arsenide , a layer of n-type gallium arsenide on the p-type gallium arsenide , and a transparent glass cover over the n-type gallium arsenide layer. The solar cell basic structure is separated from the substrate by selectively dissolving the gallium aluminum arsenide layer , and a new layer of gallium aluminum arsenide is epitaxially deposited upon the exposed face to form a thin , lightweight gallium arsenide solar cell. If the layer of p-type gallium arsenide is about 0.5 microns thick or less , the new layer of gallium aluminum arsenide may be omitted. The separated substrate can then be reused . </separate.v.805><separate.v.806>The apostle says , As in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive. The whole human race was in Adam when he fell just as we read in chapter 7 of the Epistle to the Hebrews that Levi was in the loins of Abraham when Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedec. So the Church was in Christ before it had any being. The apostle speaks of some saints who were in Christ before him. This is experimental union which the believer enjoys when he is called out of darkness into God ' s marvelous light. You can not separate the head from the body. Christ is the Head of the Church. In Romans 5 : 19 , we read : As by one man ' s disobedience many were constituted sinners [ apart from any sin of their own : they were constituted sinners through one man ' s disobedience in the Garden of Eden ] so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. So all in Christ are treated and regarded as righteous because of His obedience. Thus when He obeyed , the Church obeyed in Him . </separate.v.806><separate.v.807>Unfortunately Christians have often been unable to agree on matters of belief and practice.

They can. It 's the commitment aspect which helps keep a relationship when love is threatened. It does n't mean that you wo n't find other people attractive; it means that you have committed yourself to that one person. Mistakes , fights and problems will happen. It 's normal. Correct the mistakes , stop the fighting , fix the problems and move on. That is what builds relationships. If every time you face a little problem , you separate , your relationship will remain shallow and never grow . </separate.v.811><separate.v.812>Obviously , having substantial evidence for a fault based divorce is good leverage for getting the other spouse out of the house. When one represents a spouse who is intending to separate but has not yet separated , it is wise counsel to discourage the client from engaging in behaviors that allow the court to order the client out of the marital home ( e.g. , now is not the time to develop a drinking problem or begin dating ) . </separate.v.812><separate.v.813>Among the problems facing the Anabaptists , some of the most pressing illuminate the impact that Anabaptism held during the early years of the Reformation. The teachings and way of life of the Anabaptists , according to the Anabaptists themselves , were merely ways of trying to reinstate the true church , a church of true believers. It did not seem this way to the Magisterial Reformers or to the Roman Church , however. It was those very teachings and acts that made the Anabaptists into the object of numerous persecutions at the hands of both church and state. The dialogues and discussions between the Anabaptists and the Magisterial Reformers show some of the main differences between the groups , while the reactions of both the Roman Church and society to the Anabaptists show that their teachings and manner of living did affect the greater society. Many of these effects are reflected in the historiography of the Anabaptists , which is largely hostile to them and their teachings. It remains one of the largest problems in modern scholarship to separate the hostility of their biographers from the circumstances of Anabaptist existence . </separate.v.813><separate.v.814>I doubt that western voters would choose to separate if they were offered the chance. But if were a choice between maintaining traditional Canadian values of compassion and caring for our fellows , expressed politically as universale health care and strong social programs , against the option of catering to an extreme right-wing agenda that would throw away what it means to be Canadian , I 'd care more about the people and ideals of Canada than lines on the map. If the west wanted to go , I 'd say let them go. Canada is founded on bilingualism and diversity , and people who do n't like that should find another country to live in. Ontario needs Quebec more than it needs the west , if it came to that . </separate.v.814><separate.v.815>" BRIDE and GROOM , today you join your separate lives together.

That statute , which was incorporated into Family Code 2460 ( b ) , gave something to the separating spouse and simultaneously took something away. The statute made it easier for the separate property portion of the community asset to be recognized by simply requiring a tracing of the community property back to its separate property source. No longer was it necessary for the separating spouse to offer evidence of an understanding or an agreement. On the other hand , under the statute , the separating spouse would only be entitled to be reimbursed for the amount of the separate property contribution. Unlike the Lucas rule , where the separating spouse was entitled to a proportionate share of the equity , the return to that spouse was now strictly limited to reimbursement; any remaining equity was deemed community property . </separate.v.818><separate.v.819>Amidst stacks of baled aluminum and cardboard at the Blue Mountain MRF , Senator Carper made a speech. He began with an anecdote about living in California as a young man , before his first service in the military. He owned a Karman Gia with a rebuilt engine and remembers loading up the small car with recyclables , driving it to a facility where he separated cans and bottles. Nothing had changed 36 years later , besides the location and the car. The Senator 's passion for recycling everything even led him to pull coat hangers out of the YMCA 's trash before coming to Philadelphia that day.

But the Catholic Novel , that mysterious entity we seek to define , but into whose confines The Violent Bear it Away is always admitted , has a profoundly Catholic sensibility and understanding of the world.

Elevations in the Big Horn basin generally range from 4000 ft to 5000 ft M.S.L. While the Big Horn and Absaroka mountains define the eastern and western borders of the Big Horn basin , the Owl Creek mountains , a small range of mountains with elevations ranging between 7000 ft and 8000 ft M.S.L. , lie along the southern periphery of the basin.

A Party Wall may be built astride the boundary , and is thus partly on the land of each owner ( Type 'A ' ); or it may sit entirely on the land of one owner , but still separates the two properties ( Type 'B ' ) . A Party Wall is therefore in shared ownership; this means that certain works , deemed to be 'notifiable ' under the Act , will require the Building Owner 's service of prior notice upon the Adjoining Owner before works may start. The Act details the requisite notice periods applicable in each situation. In the event of a 'dispute ' in response to the notice ( s ) , the parties must either each appoint their own Surveyor , or concur in the appointment of a single Agreed Surveyor in accordance with Section 10 of the Act. The purpose of this appointment is the resolution of the dispute by way of a Party Wall Award . </separate.v.826><separate.v.827>When you file a joint return you become jointly and equally liable for the tax on that return and any subsequent tax the IRS may assess relating to that return.

This compares with 17 per cent of Muslims , 34 per cent of Christians and 43 per cent of those with no religion. The graphs show that the living arrangements of young Christians are broadly in line with those who profess no religion. It seems that about 12 per cent of young Christians are living with a partner , and about 9 per cent ( or 75 of those who are living with a partner , which is the more interesting figure for us ) are cohabiting. We need to recognise therefore that most Christians have gone the way of the world in this regard.

I will keep my own arguments about the Separation of Church and State debate out of this discussion , because we address a more important separation. As the American Christian becomes a political activist , and an avid supporter of an administration that he perceives as centered on God , he makes manifest the success of decades of work on the part of the enemy to bring him to the current place. The church is surely being separated from its faith in the 21st century , and the discussion here will be directed at that separation , which as you will see here we believe is perilous . </separate.v.830><separate.v.831>The Council of Chalcedon abandoned Cyrillian terminology and declared that Christ was one hypostasis in two natures. However , in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed , " Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary , " thus the foundation according to non-Chalcedonians is made clear. In terms of Christology the Oriental understanding is that Christ is " One Nature -- the Logos Incarnate , " of the full humanity and full divinity. The Byzantine understanding is that Christ is in two natures , full humanity and full divinity. ( Just as all of us are of our mother and father and not in our mother and father , so too is the nature of Christ. If Christ is in full humanity and in full divinity , then He is separate in two persons as the Nestorians teach. Imagine your nature in your mother and your father; you are then two different people. If however your nature is of your mother and your father , then you are one person [ 1 ] . ) This is the linguistic difference which separated the Orientals from the Byzantines . </separate.v.831><separate.v.832>" Diversity " is not a biblical principle.

Today the government can stop you from Praying in school , reading the Bible in school , showing the Ten Commandments in school , or have religious displays at Christmas.

And so I want to start by asking a logical question , which is , in what can we say that two or more things ( gatherings of believers ) are in fact one thing ( one church ) . This means that we need to set aside our preconceived ideas of what a " church " is. Yes , the semanticists will want to quickly jump in and say that the Greek word which we translate into church means assembly or gathering. But we 're interested in a logical question for the moment , which means we need to set aside preconceptions. After all , multi-site and multi-service advocates use that term " church " to refer to something that involves more than one gathering. So let 's start by asking , how can these two things really be one thing ? </separate.v.834></separate.v.train>
