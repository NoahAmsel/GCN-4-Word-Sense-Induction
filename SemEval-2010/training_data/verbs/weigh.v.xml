Thus , while the weight of Medieval and Renaissance swords can be accurately recorded and compiled , the matter of their being " heavy " or not is one of perspective. It is clear that despite the facts , regardless of the objective mass of historical swords , their " heaviness " is a subjective matter. The same three-pound weapon is elegant and robust to a skilled practitioner while his desk-bound colleague might think it ungainly and sluggish. The understanding we must have is that to the men who skillfully used these tools , they weighed just right . </weigh.v.71><weigh.v.72>Other players are more explosive and have flashed elite talent , but Jackson has been steady and consistent all along.

Like other species of flatfish , the fluke has both eyes on one side of its head and rests on the ocean floor on its side. The fluke is called a left handed flatfish because its eyes are on the upper surface of the head when the fish is facing left.

Generally they are white below and darker above , but they can turn various shades of gray , blue , green/orange and almost black. The fluke may weigh up to 26 pounds with a length over 37 inches.

The very size of these rigs is limiting , however. Job-site maneuverability can be a problem , and with a 92-in. bite the soil plug alone can weigh 12 , 000 to 14 , 000 pounds. Greater equipment costs , plus higher prices for really big trees , substantially limit the customer base. The final bill for a single transplant can exceed a couple of thousand dollars. Because of this , market pressures generally dictate smaller spades , usually in the 40- to 60-in. range. These work well on trees 6 to 12 years old , 4 to 6 in. in diameter and 12 to 20 ft. tall , depending on the species. The good news is that trees of these sizes have very good survival rates . </weigh.v.91><weigh.v.92>Will and Emily Langston Pahlman of Overton are pleased to announce the birth of their daughter , Sadie Elizabeth Pahlman , who was born Oct. 15 , 2009 , at Mother Frances Hospital in Tyler.

However , almost 50 percent of some model air suspension motorhomes exceed a tire rating without exceeding an axle rating , and it is not uncommon for us to find tires that exceed their rating by more than a thousand pounds !

If your bird will perch comfortably and stay on the scale until you remove him , then a fixed perch scale such as the Rick 's Bird Supply Scale is a good choice. If your bird will not perch , then you need to consider a scale with a flat platform or a removable perch such as the Acculab GS2001 or the Ohaus LS2000. If you are weighing unweaned babies , you need to be able to accommodate a bowl of sufficient size to hold one baby comfortably. A scale with a TARE function is useful if you need to use bowls or other containers to hold birds for weighing. The TARE function allows you to adjust the scale back to zero with the empty container on the scale - so you weigh only the bird - not the bird and the container . </weigh.v.163><weigh.v.164>A baby boy was born at 4 : 56 a.m. Sept. 1 , 2009 , at South Peninsula Hospital to Tania and Jesus Trego.

The female ( doe ) usually weighs from 90 to 130 pounds , but some can weigh as much as 165 to 175 pounds. The deer 's coat is a reddish-brown in the spring and summer , and turns to a grey-brown throughout the fall and winter. Males one year of age or older have antlers. Antlers begin to grow in early spring , covered with a highly vascularised tissue known as velvet. Bucks shed their antlers when all females have been bred , usually in late December or January. " White-tailed " refers to the distinctive white tail that when raised is a flag and provides a flash of white , signaling other deer when there is danger.

" Everyone thought there was some sort of record when they call. " And it 's true that the MonsterPig.com web site only makes a carefully worded and modest claim : " The feral hog is definitely one of the biggest , if not the biggest ever taken by an 11 year old. " The only documented world record I could find was for a colossal domestic swine , Big Bill , whose bulk at 9 feet and 2 , 552 pounds dwarfs the Jamison 's hog which allegedly measured 9 feet 4 inches and weighed in at 1 , 050 pounds.

Her request for equitable relief from underpayments from two tax years was evaluated using the factors in Rev. Proc. 2000-15 , 2000-1 CB 447. Only two factors weighed in favor of relief : the taxpayer was divorced and her divorce settlement allocated the liabilities to her former husband. For three additional tax years , the IRS had already granted her request for separate liability relief , which relieved her of tax liabilities attributable to her ex-husband 's tax items. She was not entitled to additional relief because she failed to show that she did not know or have reason to know of the understatements on the returns , especially in light of her advanced education and her representation by an attorney and an accountant when she filed her delinquent returns. For the last tax year at issue , relief was denied because she and her husband had filed separate returns , and their subsequent attempt to file an amended joint return was untimely . </weigh.v.214><weigh.v.215>Soft-Pak plays an important role in many of Texas Disposal 's procedures.

Each pad has a flexible and quick disconnect connector for easy setup. These weigh pads can be used with or without leveling approach pads. For higher accuracy we recommend the use of approach and exit pads. Each pad spans approximately three feet in length , and ensures that the vehicle stays level during the weighing process. The leveling pads and ramps are made from a high compression strength composite material. They are easy to setup and take down. Angled ends provide a smooth transition from the road surface to the elevated runway. The approach and exit pads attach to the weigh pads to ensure that they stay in place at all times. Since the pads are modular , you can order as many or as few sections as you need , depending on the size of vehicle you are weighing . </weigh.v.217><weigh.v.218>MS.

The malt is then moved via an auger to our mash tun. In the mash tun , the grains are mixed ( hydrated ) with hot water. This process of mixing cold grain and hot water is known as mashing. The process of Mashing activates enzymes which help break down the complex starches into simple sugars which can be fermented by our yeast. After allowing the mash to sit for one hour , the mixture now called Wort is separated from the grains. We use two processes to make this happen. The act of draining the wort from the grain is called Lautering. Here , we slowly remove the wort from the bottom of the mash tun while at the same time , we sparge ( spray ) the wet grains with more hot water . </weigh.v.290><weigh.v.291>Introducing Weigh Point ' s new slip-on scale that slides quickly and easily turning your lift truck into a mobile weighing machine !

However , as the Ninth Circuit pointed out , the amount and substantiality of the taking is only one factor in the fair use determination and does not by itself dictate a finding that a use is unfair. [ 81 ] Moreover , the substantiality of the copying was undercut to some degree by the intermediate nature of the copies.

Make sure the total weight of the resin/hardener is the same as the cloth weight. During the laminating process , monitor the number of plies vs. the weight of laminating resin used.

If the nipple is lower than the IMF , then some form of lift will most likely be necessary. This is somewhat of a controversial topic , therefore , it is important that you are as educated as much as possible so that you can have done what is best for you. It is controversial because you must weigh the advantages of a properly positioned nipple versus a scar that goes completely around the areola. This is a decision that you and your plastic surgeon must make together. Hopefully , this has helped. ( One caveat , if you are on the fence about whether or not you want to have a lift you can take some solace in knowing that it can be done later.

One option would be to broadly review all Medicare Part A and B spending and propose spending reductions in areas where per beneficiary spending is above a certain threshold compared with the national average. In this option , spending per beneficiary for Medicare Parts A and B would be adjusted to reflect differences in the price of inputs and the health status of the local population. Another option would require similar analysis of Medicare Parts A and B spending , but require spending reductions only for individual providers who are above a certain threshold in spending compared to their peers in their local area. Spending per beneficiary for Medicare Parts A and B also would be adjusted under this option to reflect differences in the price of inputs and the health status of the local population.

With the gastric bypass , the peak weight loss usually is about a year and a half after the operation. At that point , you should expect to lose somewhere between 50-80 of your excess weight. So for example , if you are supposed to weigh 100 pounds and weigh 200 pounds , you could expect to lose between 50-80 pounds in about a year and a half after the operation. With LAP-BAND that process is little bit slower , typically the peak weight loss is somewhere around three years after the operation to lose that amount of weight , but when you get further out about five or six years out , the weight loss typically is more comfortable to both operations . </weigh.v.537><weigh.v.538>The policies which underlie the various rules may , under certain circumstances , be in some tension with each other.

In other cases , lawyers must carefully weigh conflicting values , and make decisions , at the peril of violating one or more of the following rules. Lawyers are trained to make just such decisions , however , and should not shrink from the task.

The usual dosage range for smoked free base DMT is 20-40 mg ( Bigwood &amp;Ott 1977; Shulgin 1976 ) , and an analytical balance is needed to weigh such a quantity precisely. Some users weigh out a reference sample , setting this aside as a visual aid in estimating doses. Such estimation and apportionment should not be done under the influence of the drug !

For two axled vehicles , for 'off site'/'away from base ' weighing , or where the weighing demands are not particularly high , this is probably the most cost-effective method of all . </weigh.v.701><weigh.v.702>We pulled up to where they 'd harvested last and gradually began the process of cutting and tossing the pumpkins up into the truck.

Despite its name , this animal seldom eats fish , but is agile in trees and slender enough of body to pursue prey into hollow trees or burrows in the ground. Adults weigh between 4-15 lbs and are between 29-47 inches in length , with the males larger and heavier than the females. Their coats are darkish brown , with a black tail and legs; some individuals have a cream-colored patch on the chest. All four feet have five toes with retractable claws. Because they can rotate their hind paws 180 degrees , they can grasp limbs and climb down trees head first. Fishers are solitary hunters , feeding mainly on small herbivores such as mice , porcupines ( they are the only predator to consistently hunt this quilled animal ) , squirrels shrews and possibly deer . </weigh.v.711><weigh.v.712>[ 0027 ] FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an electronic weight-measuring device 60 for determining and indicating the weight of an object. The weight-measuring device 60 includes a weight sensor 29 , an electronic unit 28 , and one or more buttons 24 , 25 , and 26 used to control the functions or operation of the electronic unit 28. The weight sensor 29 has not been shown in FIGS. 1-3 , however the attachment between the weight sensor 29 and the support assembly 13 has been previously described. The weight sensor 29 can be any suitable transducer having a property that changes in proportion to the weight applied thereto. Such a weight-dependent property could be , for example , resistance , capacitance or any other physical property. A preferred weight sensor 29 is a weight cell that has a weight-dependent capacitance and that can weigh up to 100 pounds.

It also is great because buying a used 250 you can ride it for a season and gain much needed experience and confidence before moving up and still be able to sell it a year later for close to or even the same price as you bought it for. Not saying all new riders drop their bikes but even riders of 20+ years still drop their bike once in awhile from stupid stuff , loose gravel in the road , oil spots , stopping on hills , and your first bike will not be your last trust me . </weigh.v.717><weigh.v.718>The Silver Plated Key Chain Compass is a solid and beautifully made highly polished key ring.

This couple had waited until the fourth day to weight her in on certified scales. Not really , because the scales at Piney Point Plaza are certified . Well , the miss read scale was not detected until Mr. Seidensticker was called out to make another certification and he started looking at the scales at Piney Point. On his inspection he found that if you look at the side that read 12.10 oz. the opposite side reads 15.00lbs. This solves the problem of the fish being weighed in before three days , because she was first taken to Piney Point. So new paper work was submitted and finally approved.

With regard to involuntary passive euthanasia , the courts are generally supportive of the practice , but they have the right to insist on a more stringent standard of evidence before approving such procedures. The courts have generally employed a balancing test that weighs the patient 's right to privacy and self determination against the interest of the state in preserving life , the interests of potential third parties that might desire that the patient continue to live , and the ethical image of the medical profession ( Adams , et. al. , p. 2022 ) .

Out of ignorance many sword makers and their consumers honestly expect that a sword should feel heavy. They have been conditioned by endless displays of lumbering swordsmen with great sweeping blows of slow blades to believe that unless their " barbarian broadsword " is hefty and causes strain when lifted , it ca n't be a " real " sword as if sheer mass alone affects a successful sword blow. [ When contrasted with the lightening-quick featherweight aluminum swords used in many Asian martial arts displays and choreographed routines , its hard to blame anyone for such misunderstanding. ] While the difference between a 3.8 pound and a 5.3 pound blade may not seem like all that much , when trying to correctly perform proper fighting techniques it very much is. Additionally , when it comes to rapiers , which generally weighed between two and two-and-a-half pounds , their weights can be somewhat misleading. Being such slender thrusting blades , rapiers often have the majority of their mass at their hilts , giving them a balance that lends agility to their points despite their weight comparative to much wider cutting swords . </weigh.v.910><weigh.v.911>Local Jasper , Texas , pro Chris McCall was the star of the day-three weigh-in today bringing in five hefty bass that weighed 17 pounds , 2 ounces.

We emphasize the word " system " here because it is absolutely key to understanding how to use the various trading strategies we outline in this section. Every strategy covered below is to be used and measured against the prevailing Ichimoku " picture " rather than in isolation. This means that , while a scenario that matches a given strategy may have transpired , you still must weigh that signal against the rest of the chart in order to determine whether or not it offers a high-probability trade. Another way of looking at it is that Ichimoku is a system and the discrete strategies for trading it are merely " sub-systems " within that larger system. Thus , looking at trading any of these strategies from an automated or isolated approach that does n't take into account the rest of what the Ichimoku chart is telling you will meet with mixed long-term success , at best . </weigh.v.1274><weigh.v.1275>Do n't even want to weigh myself , thinking at least 5 lbs up during vacation.

Arguably , it was the court ' s view that the cost of the accident multiplied by the probability that it could be avoided should be weighed against the cost of avoidance in order to determine negligence again , precisely the prediction made by economic reasoning.

In this case , the upward buoyant force on the bathysphere is equal in amount to the weight of the water it displaces. Since the bathysphere is essentially incompressible , it always displaces the same volume of water. And since water is essentially incompressible , that fixed volume of water always weighs the same amount. That 's why the bathysphere experiences a constant upward force on it due to the surrounding water. To sink the bathysphere , they weight it down with heavy metal particles.

The weighing pan ( s ) of a high precision ( .01 mg or better ) analytical balance are inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance 's operation. The use of a vented balance safety enclosure , which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils , allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the weighing of mass down to 1 g without fluctuations or loss of product. Also , the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure , affecting the weighing . </weigh.v.1407><weigh.v.1408>When I retired from the Coast Guard in 1998 , I weighed 212 pounds.

Ephron hints that he wants an exorbitant price of four hundred shekels , a sum to which Abraham agrees. As Abraham weighs out the coins to give to Ephron , the Torah spells Ephron 's name in a short manner , missing the letter " vav. " Rashi explains : The name Ephron is spelled without a vav because Ephron said much and did not even do a little , for he took from Abraham large shekalim. Ephron originally boasted that the cave is free for the taking but ultimately charged a small fortune; therefore the Torah criticizes him by misspelling his name. The Ba'al Haturim comments further that the numerical value of Ephron without a vav is 400 !

Weight pulls the object downward because of the gravity. The force of gravity is always pulling all objects on or near the earth toward the center. Lift acts upward against the downward force of weight. Lift is derived mainly from the flow of air over the object. Air is mainly a mixture of two gases , oxygen and nitrogen. We live in a sea of air weighing billions of tons which hugs the earth because gravity is constantly pulling down upon it.

Such counsel is vital in order to properly weigh all legal , financial , tax and lifestyle implications surrounding each option. Since this brochure principally focuses upon the subject of short sales as just one alternative , it is important to note that short sales usually benefit home sellers because they not only stop mortgage foreclosure , but typically prevent the lender from suing for deficiency. Deficiency refers to the difference between the outstanding loan amount and what the net proceeds are from the sale of the home , or in some cases , simply what the proceeds are that the lender receives from the sale of the home. During their short sale negotiating process , it is vital that homeowners have their attorney ensure that the lender agrees to forego suing for any monies that are written off due to the short sale . </weigh.v.1560><weigh.v.1561>Having a nice juicy contract with a major supermarket chain can mean a lot of pressure for a meat processor.

There are plenty more meat processors ready to muscle in on a deal with a national , or even international , retailer , so selecting the right equipment is key to opening and securing the door to lucrative sales opportunities.  Weighing machines are no exception. A meat processor needs to deliver what it is contracted to deliver and inaccurate merchandise can mean both unhappy suppliers and wasted raw material , and meat does not come cheap in the first place. Suppliers of weighing equipment are fully aware of the modern-day pressures facing their customers and have designed products to meet these demands.

You did n't mention the size of the area that needs raising. Let 's say it was 10 ' by 10'. That would be 100 square feet , but since we are raising a triangle-shaped area , we are only lifting half of that. Assuming a dead load of 30 pounds per square foot ( standard load for a bedroom or living room ) , that would be 1500 pounds to lift. But that is just the first floor. If there is a second floor , double that number. And then the roof weight must be added in. I would guess 20 pounds per square foot would be the design load in your area. You could use 30 to be safer. That would be another 1500 pounds to add to the total load calculation. So a 10 ' by 10 ' corner might weigh about 4500 pounds. That 's not much , really.

Thus , there is little to no overlapping of the markets. However , the image and marketability of Barbie might be hindered if the artwork became widespread-the artwork has Barbie in various compromising poses. Accordingly , if Eleanor 's work became widespread , then Barbie 's marketability might be harmed.

A good way to introduce students to the need for standard units is through exploration of balance scales without unit measurements. Ask your class to look at and feel objects and predict which is heavier or lighter. Ask them how they could prove which is heavier or lighter. Then , compare the objects on opposite pans on a balance scale. Give your students many opportunities to predict which objects are heavier and lighter and then check their predictions on balance scales themselves. Then ask students to find a way to find objects that weigh the exact same amount. Finally , students can use a single unit of weight to compare the weights of various objects to prove that they weigh the same amount. For example , you might ask the class to use pennies or cubes to find the exact weight of classroom objects. After you have established the need for a common unit of measurement of weight , you can begin to discuss the standard measures of ounces , pounds , and tons . </weigh.v.1643><weigh.v.1644>( iii ) assess carefully the value for money case for accepting refinancings involving increases to the private sector borrowings and increased termination liabilities to the public sector.

Georgia , 408 U.S. 238 ( 1972 ) ( per curiam ) , we have required States to limit the class of murderers to which the death penalty may be applied. This narrowing requirement is usually met when the trier of fact finds at least one statutorily defined eligibility factor at either the guilt or penalty phase. See Tuilaepa v. California , 512 U.S. 967 , 971 972 ( 1994 ) . Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied , the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it. Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors ( sometimes identical to the eligibility factors ) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations. The issue in the line of cases we confront here is what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after at least one valid eligibility factor has been found , but under a scheme in which an eligibility factor or a specified aggravating factor is later held to be invalid . </weigh.v.1648><weigh.v.1649>I have only been on the diet for 4 days , but today I was feeling heavy like the diet was n't working or that I ate too much.

After erosion from wind and waves , and melting from the warmer sea temperatures away from the Antarctic coast , the tabular icebergs become unstable and roll over to form jagged irregular icebergs , sometimes with spikes towering up to 180 feet into the air and with even greater protrusions deep under the ocean surface.

Sometimes one will open even a new bottle , and depending on where it has been and for how long you might find your crystals immersed in a semi-liquid slurry. Because we do n't know how much water has accumulated and because water adds weight , it is impossible to obtain an accurate concentration of magnesium chloride by weighing out the chemical unless it has been stored in a very effective dessicator. A trick is to purchase a known quantity of the material , for example 500 gms , and without even weighing it to prepare the entire lot as a stock solution. You can prepare , for example , a liter of 0.5M ( 500 mM ) magnesium chloride. To use the stock to prepare respiration medium , simply include 10 ml of stock solution per liter of working solution.

Like adults , pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure , weight , height , intraocular pressure , and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection , psychosocial disturbances , thromboembolism , peptic ulcers , cataracts , and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route , including systemically administered corticosteroids , may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression ( ie , cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels ) . Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored , and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives.

However , smaller dogs tend to cost less as they eat less and spay/neuter surgeries depend on the weight of the dog , making the smaller , the better. Consider a St. Bernard male can weigh 220 pounds and feeding a dog daily of that size will require 8 cups of food per day. And life is a little bit more planned out when you need a vehicle to transport that size of a dog , a crate to fit him , and larger size bowls , collars , leashes all cost more than those for smaller breeds. Regular , frequent grooming is required for many small and some large breeds , so consider this when assessing costs . </weigh.v.1729><weigh.v.1730>Situated in Cardigan on the West Wales Coastline , Yum Yum is an old fashioned sweet shop where you can still buy your sweets weighed out into a bag by the quarter ( 115g ) .

Besides , the birds-in-a-truck problem is not properly posed. The truck needs to be very very large , so that the birds can SOAR. Soaring birds would not add to the weight of the truck , since they are being supported by the air , not the truck. Some will say that the truck must support the air , but I have disproved that in this paper. A column of air 62 miles high weighs nothing on a scale , so a little air in a truck also weighs nothing , with a bird in it or not. The truck is not supporting the air , the charge field is supporting the air , which means the bird is also being supported by the charge field. Does an airplane flying over register on a scale ? No. Mythbusters should install a scale on a runway , as easy proof of this.

Conversely , in fact , nutritionists now believe that adding more of certain foods to your diet may help you weigh less. And we 're not just talking about puffed wheat and dry salad. Of course , calories are still a key part of the picture. But reducing your diet to steamed broccoli and grilled fish can set you up for failure ( if it does n't bore you to death first ) . Women who give up specific foods or food groups often only fuel their cravings and end up overeating , as researchers from the University of Toronto at Mississauga , Ontario , demonstrated in a 2006 study. Shedding pounds , and keeping them off , is a much more realistic proposition when your focus shifts from what you do n't eat to what you do leaving the minimalism to the numbers on the scale . </weigh.v.1756><weigh.v.1757>Following a couple of weeks of warm for the time of year and settled weather , on Monday evening 23/03/09 , Sod 's Law prevailed and so did the strong winds , which meant the intended venue for our third competition of the year , Brighton Marina West Arm , was closed for safety 's sake , forcing us TOSSA 's once again to head for the relative shelter and safety of Newhaven Harbour.

Finally , as you give in to save your sanity , more weight is gained in the end , more than what was lost. With this plan I have been able to lose weight without the resulting overreaction.

Since this is a catch &amp;release tournament , every effort must be made to keep walleye alive. Teams weighing in dead walleye are entitled to the dead fish.

For example , consider another country , Islandia , with a fixed exchange rate and conservative monetary and fiscal policies. Wages there are relatively inflexible , so that the government can increase competitiveness and ( temporarily ) reduce unemployment by devaluing the currency. ( If wages were completely flexible , they would rise immediately in response to the devaluation , and the devaluation would have no effect on employment. ) However , the government must weigh the short-term benefits of a devaluation against the higher prices that would result in the long run , which would impose political costs and possibly a loss of the government 's credibility as an inflation fighter . </weigh.v.1764><weigh.v.1765>Other vendors provide no support , either due to lack of testing or because of known issues when their applications run in a virtual world.

Petitioner argues that in most weighing states the aggravating factors that are used to determine eligibility for the death penalty are the same factors that are weighed in selecting a sentence , which is not the case under the California system. Respondent attacks this position by pointing to weighing jurisdictions where the aggravating factors considered at the sentence-selection phase are not limited to the same factors used at the eligibility phase. Respondent contends that the hallmark of a weighing scheme is simply that aggravating factors play a specific role in sentence selection i.e. , the sentencer must weigh or consider aggravating factors against mitigating factors in choosing a sentence. Because the California procedure mandates that aggravating and mitigating factors , including special circumstances , are to be weighed against each other in sentence selection , California is a weighing state . </weigh.v.1794><weigh.v.1795>I ' ve been finding weight specs ranging widely all over the place.

For the sake of conversation , let 's say Angler A catches the maximum 3 fish limit for non-boaters and has a weight of 5 pounds. His/Her pro partner has a great day on the water and has a 5 fish limit that weighs in at 20 pounds. The non-boater 's total combined weight for the day would be 25 pounds. Now Angler B comes to the stage with a monster 3 fish limit that tips the scales at 15 pounds. Their pro partner , on the other end of the spectrum , had a crappy day and only weighed in 2 fish for a measly 5 pounds. This would give Angler B a combined total weight of 20 pounds. Although Angler B has a 10 pound lead over Angler A on an individual level , he/she would not win.

If you layer your hair it can prevent you from looking weighed down by your locks and help your hair appear volumeous. Shorter layers create a funky and playful look , so if you 've got a little spunk in you , go for the layers. Longer layers are also attractive on curly hair.

The largest transport planes weigh more than 350 short tons ( 320 metric tons ) when fully loaded. A plane 's engines , wings and control surfaces enable it to fly. The engine or engines move the plane forward through the air. As the plane moves , the air that flows over the wings moves faster and therefore has less pressurethan the air under the wings. This difference in air pressure , called lift , keeps the plane in the air. The pilot keeps the plane balanced in flight by adjusting the control surfaces , which are movable sections of the wings tail . </weigh.v.1925><weigh.v.1926>A cubic foot of air weighs about 0.078 pounds so the upward buoyant force on a cubic foot of helium is about 0.078 pounds.

The difference between the upward buoyant force on the cubic foot of helium and the weight of the helium is the amount of extra weight that the helium can lift; about 0.067 pounds.

The scale 10 is preferably an electronic scale 10. As shown , an object 12 is positioned on a weighing platform 30 where downward forces on the weighing platform 30 are sensed by a transducer 11 , which produces an electrical signal indicative of weight. The weighing platform 30 is associated with a base member 13 , which is positioned on a horizontal reference plane. The object 12 causes the weighing platform 30 to move perpendicular with respect to the plane or base 13. The perpendicular force of the weight of the object 12 causes the weighing platform 30 to exert a force or pressure on a transducer 11 coupled between the weighing platform 30 and the base 13 . </weigh.v.1928><weigh.v.1929>Meanwhile , the New Yorker and Mother Jones are weighing in with their own stories about the downside of organ sales.

Since nitrogen occurs in lower concentrations than carbon ( for most organic materials ) , the nitrogen content becomes the limiting factor in dual-isotope measurements. Plants ( i.e. , 2-5 nitrogen ) and soils/sediments ( 0.1-1.0 nitrogen ) have much lower nitrogen concentrations than animals ( i.e. , 8-12 nitrogen ) , so more material is needed per sample for plants and soils than for animals. The preference in our isotope lab is to weigh out 60 micrograms of nitrogen per sample ( regardless of the sample type ) . This amount of material usually results in a nitrogen peak of sufficient size for accurately measuring stable isotopes , but it does not result in a peak so large that it will exhaust the chemicals too quickly. Since there is usually much more carbon than nitrogen in organic materials , there should always be enough carbon per sample for 13Canalysis ( so long as samples have been properly prepared for 15Nanalysis ) . </weigh.v.2031><weigh.v.2032>Classic Wholesales has all the products according to the need and budget of all the customers.

Although various weights of Cordura , pack cloth , and ripstop nylons are commonly used in this class for different areas of the packs , some specialty fabrics have made a huge impact to this class. Dimension Polyant X-Pac fabric , used in GoLite 's Infinity and Mountainsmith 's Auspex packs , features a three layer construction consisting of an outer 40 denier polyester bonded to a 1 , 000 denier high tenacity polyester matrix with a 50 denier polyester liner. The 1 , 000 denier high tenacity fiber is highly load bearing and tear resistant creating a superior fabric at only 3 oz/yd2 ( 102 g/m2 ) . Another fabric is Dyneema Gridstop , used in Mont-Bell 's Alpine series , ULA 's entire pack line , and several packs from GoLite. The fabric consists of 210 denier high tenacity nylon with a 215 denier gridstop of Dyneema fiber. Dyneema is nearly identical to Spectra in terms of strength ( pound for pound twice as strong as Kevlar and 10 times as strong as steel ) and the fiber is light enough to float on water , creating a final gridstop pack cloth weighing 4.5 oz/yd2 ( 153 g/m2 ) . </weigh.v.2150><weigh.v.2151>Mushroom Anchors - Mushrooms are meant to be used for providing permanent mooring and are not suitable for normal use on a recreational vessel.

Minnoch , like many of the heaviest people , suffered from massive edema : his weight was augmented by at least 900 lbs of fluid at its peak. The former taxi driver had always been unusually heavy , reaching 400 lbs in 1963 , 700 lbs in 1966 , and 975 lbs in 1976 , but he claimed to have been in no way handicapped by his size until a 500-calorie diet sapped his muscle strength and left him at the brink of death. Subsequent hospitalization brought him down to 476 lbs in 1981 , mostly through the loss of 12 to 14 pounds of fluid per week. He was readmitted later that year after regaining 200 lbs in seven days. Although physicians at University Hospital in Seattle persisted in treating him with a 1 , 200-calorie diet , he weighed about 800 lbs at the time of his death.

Where the evidence comes from the mainstream of its respective field , this consideration will weigh heavily in favor of admission. For example , the expert testimony in the execution by lethal gas case was primarily based on principles which commonly appeared in authoritative medical treatises. Accordingly , the court could presume it had been subjected to peer review and publication and accepted by the scientific community as having significant probative value. Where experts present new or marginal theories , this factor should not lend significant support to the admission of evidence. Thus , the magistrate hearing the mentally retarded children 's abuse case gave little weight to controversial literature on the symptomatology of abuse.

Stephens , 462 U.S. 862 , 874 ( 1983 ) ( " [ I ] n Georgia , the finding of an aggravating circumstance does not play any role in guiding the sentencing body in the exercise of its discretion [ to impose the death penalty ] , apart from its function of narrowing the class of persons convicted of murder who are eligible for the death penalty " ) . In the latter , such a finding performs a second function-it provides a reason for deciding to impose that sentence on an eligible defendant. See , e.g. , Clemons v. Mississippi , 494 U.S. 738 , 745 ( 1990 ) ( " In Mississippi , unlike the Georgia scheme considered in Zant , the finding of aggravating factors is part of the jury 's sentencing determination , and the jury is required to weigh any mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances " ) . </weigh.v.2193><weigh.v.2194>Stuart Smalley may need to gain a pound or two , but he 's already in possession of a big heart.

Soft-sided bags , especially those with external compression straps , are preferable , as you can cinch them down to minimal size once they 've been packed.

This will require , at a minimum , the registered representative to obtain a copy of the existing contract and compare its salient features against those of the new product that the representative is recommending. Firms doing variable annuity business in New York already have some experience dealing with a forerunner of this requirement in New York State Insurance Department ' s Regulation 60 , which requires the agent to provide the client with a rudimentary side-by-side comparison of the existing and proposed replacement contracts. Firms and reviewing principals may not be comfortable leaving it to the registered representative to undertake the detailed analysis and comparison of the two contracts that the rule seems to suggest is necessary. The only viable alternative may be to establish a centralized review procedure at the home office , a potentially expensive solution that firms will want to weigh carefully from a cost-benefit perspective . </weigh.v.2263><weigh.v.2264>PolyPro Pellets are DEFINITELY recommended for blankets weighing over 7 pounds.

Consider the following points when making your choices : </weigh.v.2276><weigh.v.2277>Mating and Breeding : Males reach sexual maturity at about 15 to 16 feet ( 4.6 m ) and 12 years of age. Females reach sexual maturity at about 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) and 6 to 7 years of age. Gestation lasts approximately 12 to15 months and calving occurs once every 3 to 5 years. Calves are generally 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) at birth , and weigh about 225 pounds. The calf nurses for up to 22 months , with some evidence for longer lactation and extensive mother calf bonds. Most calves are born in the summer , though some calving occurs throughout the year. The males may compete for mates with fights involving butting , biting , and ramming. Mating also involves these activities , and some females carry scars from bites inflicted by males during the breeding season. Females have been observed to have calves as late as 35 years old , and lactate as late as 51. This evidence indicates that females may nurse their last calf until puberty ( up to 10 years in males ) . </weigh.v.2277><weigh.v.2278>Cosmopolitan is a pretty tan Shih Tzu.

Several courts have held that copying all of a work is not fatal to a fair use defense , especially in the nonprofit context.2 If the amount copied is appropriate in light of the intended use , it will not weigh heavily against you , even if you copy the entire work . </weigh.v.2284><weigh.v.2285>Currently , the maintenance costs , comparatively , for a Hybrid versus a convention gas-powered vehicle are nominal. In fact , engine wear may turn out to be less for a Hybrid due to its ability to shut itself down during idling. Thus , creating less wear on the engine. This is especially beneficial for city drivers. However , it remains true for drivers in any environment; city , suburban or country. The other bonus feature a Hybrid has that a conventional gas-powered vehicle does not have is its braking system. In a Hybrid , when slowing to a stop the electric motor slows the vehicle taking much of the strain off of the braking system. To sum up , engine use and brake use is less in a Hybrid as compared to a gas-only powered conventional car. These two factors weigh in on the maintenance list when comparison shopping or simply when owning a Hybrid car or Hybrid SUV . </weigh.v.2285><weigh.v.2286>These factors are just some of the structural issues that the agricultural industry must address.

Liquid oxygen is stored under less pressure ( 21 psi ) than compressed oxygen ( 2 , 000 psi ) , meaning that liquid oxygen does not need the extensive and weighty physical protection that compressed oxygen requires. The liquid oxygen container is simply a thermos type container that minimizes warming and evaporation. The efficiency of liquid oxygen becomes clear when one compares the weight and duration of liquid and compressed oxygen. A liquid portable , which weighs about the same as an E cylinder , lasts a third longer.

Since 1 milliliter of water weighs one gram , we can measure a volume instead of weighing the solvent. A very common use of w/w formulas is with media for the culture of bacteria. Such media come in granular or powdered form , often contain agar , and often require heat in order to dissolve the components. Microbiological media , especially when they contain agar , are difficult to transfer from one vessel to another without leaving material behind. They coat the surfaces of glassware , making quite a mess. Using a w/w formula the media and water can be mixed , heated , then sterilized , all in a single container.

She says that she kept her light shining all week , and Bob agrees that she was great. Helen has immunity , and is proud to have proved to herself that she 's strong enough to bring Shannon back.

There is only so many ways we can repeat how these weapons were not at all heavy or ungainly. Remarkably , while one would think a crucial piece of information as the weight of swords would be of great interest to arms curators and arms historians , there is no major reference book that actually lists the weights of different types. Perhaps this vacuum of documented evidence is part of the very problem surrounding the issue. However , there are a few respected sources that do give some valuable statistics. For example , the lengthy catalog of swords from the famed Wallace Collection Museum in London readily lists dozens of fine specimens among which it is difficult to find any weighing in excess of 4 pounds. Indeed , the majority of specimens , from arming swords to two-handers to rapiers , weigh much less than three pounds . </weigh.v.2582><weigh.v.2583>Experts agree that a loaded backpack should not exceed 10 percent of your body weight.

Spawning is known to occur in the western Atlantic primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and within the Mediterranean Sea over in the eastern Atlantic. We have long known that many bluefin that spawn in the spring in the Gulf of Mexico will head north to feeding grounds along the U.S. continental shelf. There is a growing body of evidence that indicates western Atlantic bluefin tuna can interact with the spawning and feeding grounds in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Despite being the same species , the expected age of first spawning is quite different for the two groups of tuna. Western bluefin are thought to mature at about age-8 when they weigh near 250 pounds. Eastern bluefin mature at about age-4 when they weigh less than 80 lbs. Hopefully , ongoing research on reproduction , migrations and stock identification will shed more light on the Atlantic stock composition of bluefin tuna . </weigh.v.2606><weigh.v.2607>The Weigh In Motion LTS4 weighbridge system is the ideal low speed ( up to 15kmh ) solution for mine loadouts , industrial plants , cement , power stations , steel mills etc. It consists of 2 electronic weigh sleepers &amp;4 dummy sleepers braced together forming one solid structure , including accessories , control cabinet and PC train weighing software . </weigh.v.2607><weigh.v.2608>Another Golden Boy prospect featured on the card , Daniel Jacobs 5-0 ( 5 ) , weighed in at a ready 163.8 lbs. to Jose Pena ' s 2-2-1 ( 2 ) 159 . </weigh.v.2608><weigh.v.2609>Four boilers were constructed.

Weight is a measurement of the gravitational force acting on an object. Mass , however , is a measurement of the quantity of matter in an object. Therefore , the weight of an object changes based on gravitational pull , while its mass remains the same. An object on the Moon will weigh less than the same object on Earth because there is less gravitational pull. However , its mass on the Moon will be the same as on Earth.

" So when we say that we are " weighing anchor , " we 're really just saying that we 're lifting or carrying it.

Luther opposed justification by works , as well as shutting God out of temporal life. To him , the workday life had been intended and given by God. The concept of a continuously active God and a living , ever-present Christ characterized Luther 's framework of thought. Luther 's concept of Scripture rises from this foundation. To him , Creation and Redemption were not two separate matters , but he looked at Creation in the light of Redemption. Justification by faith is the foundation. When God justifies a person alone by faith , alone by grace , and alone by the merit of Christ , a person is freed to serve his neighbor.

Sometimes the pH of the nutrient solution may be too low and it may be necessary to add an alkaline solution to raise the pH. Caustic potash or potassium hydroxide solution is used for this purpose. Pure potassium hydroxide is usually sold as flakes or pellets. Both forms are strongly corrosive and will cause nasty skin burns which are hard to heal , so wear rubber gloves and do not handle the pellets or flakes. A considerable amount of heat is released when potassium hydroxide is dissolved in water and the solution will get very hot. Do not dissolve too much caustic potash in too little water in plastic containers or the heat may melt the plastic , and spill the caustic solution. The usual strength of potassium hydroxide solution for raising the pH of nutrient solutions is 50 grams of potassium hydroxide per litre. If only a small volume is required , weigh out 200 grams of caustic potash and put into a calibrated 4 litre glass flagon , add about 3 litres of water and shake until dissolved , and then make up to the 4 litre mark . </weigh.v.2814><weigh.v.2815>Anchor bow rollers provide a low friction mechanism which makes it easier to drop and weigh anchor.

This results in an extract that should produce less smoke per milligram of salvinorin A ingested. The most compelling value of standardized extracts is that a known amount of salvinorin A can be ingested by weighing the extract carefully before each use.

The Sorters themselves should be constructed of a material which will not corrode. Arlyn Scales uses welded stainless steel tubing for the construction of all major components of the Sorter , including both the inside and outside cages , and the gates. Most importantly , the load cells should be made from stainless steel. As the animals grow to close to their market weights , they can apply tremendous forces to the weighing devices as the hurl themselves through the sorter. Stainless steel load cells are much less prone to shock and overload abuse as compared with load sensors that are made from aluminum or other metals. Furthermore , the highly corrosive environment can very quickly ruin load cells that are not made from stainless steel. A protective coating should be applied over the electronics on the stainless load cell as further protection. As yet another step , the load cells should have stainless guards around it to prevent rodents or the pigs themselves from attempting to chew on the load cells or the attached wires . </weigh.v.2907><weigh.v.2908>All of these weights can be reduced by about 40 if you use sitka spruce instead of ash and even further if you are careful in your sizing of parts.

Most trucking companies charge $ 25 to $ 30 more to deliver to a residential address ( if you can have it delivered to a commercial address you save the $ 25 - $ 30 ) . The reason for this is a semi-trailer pulls up to a commercial loading dock where a fork lift truck will drive into the semi , pick up the liner , and back out onto the loading dock. For a residential delivery , they must transfer the liner to a smaller truck with a lift gate and hand truck. Remember , these liners can weigh a lot.

Richards claims that this statute only allows an assumption that all defendants are subject to jurisdiction in Maine and that dismissal of a case based on a mere assumption would itself be an abuse of discretion. But there is no dispute that the exposure and injuries alleged by Richards occurred in Maine. Richards has not identified any defendant over which Maine courts would not have jurisdiction under the Maine long-arm statute.

The court reviewed Plaintiffs ' analysis of notice failures and conducted its own review of the notices provided to Plaintiffs. The court held that the notices failed to provide adequate explanation for the denials. See 946 F. Supp. at 757-58. We agree. This failure creates a high risk of erroneous deprivation of medical care to Medicare beneficiaries. The appeal rights and other procedural protections available to Medicare beneficiaries are meaningless if the beneficiaries are unaware of the reason for service denial and therefore can not argue against the denial.

It may weigh 19 to 23 pounds , but it will still be quite fast ( certainly faster than your mountain bike ) , offer good handling , and be decked out with Shimano or Campagnolo components that will last years with proper care and maintenance. What is the difference between a $ 700 bike and a $ 3 , 000 bike ? They may look the same , but there are many differences. On a high-end bike , expect to get components that are even lighter , stronger and more beautiful. The superior quality of the machining and finish of higher-end components make them worry-free. They work like a dream , and even require less effort to operate. There may be smatterings of carbon , titanium , magnesium or other exotic materials that enhance performance and extend the life of the components . </weigh.v.3013><weigh.v.3014>Eligible-fish categories for the tournament are redfish and trout.

Intelligent Design ( ID ) goes basically like this : humans , and other creatures , are too complex and our parts too interdependent to have arisen via a series of random evolutionary changes. Further refinements of the theory , including some articles that ID specialists have managed to get published in very low profile peer-reviewed journals , talk about the information content of the human genome and use information theory to prove that such content could not arise randomly.

Fit it with a decent lens like the Sony DT 16-80mm and you 'll again see an upgrade in resolved detail. So for our money , unless you absolutely need 14 Megapixels , the A300 , despite not offering significantly better noise levels , is probably a better bet than the A350 overall.

This draft is then discharged to a blow tank or other suitable receptacle which forms a part of the filling unit and which has as its outlet a spout or nozzle on which a bag to be filled is mounted. Upon delivery of the charge to the tank , the inlet of the tank is sealed off by a valve , and a large volume of relatively low-pressure air is admitted to the tank to blow the material out in a high-velocity air stream passing through the nozzle and into the bag on the nozzle. As soon as the scale dispenses one weighed out draft to the tank , it automatically recycles to weigh out the next draft.

One six-ounce glass of wine is about 105 calories. One bottle of beer ( 12 ounces ) is about 160 calories. ( Lite beer is about 110 calories. ) None of this is intrinsically bad or good. If you 're a middle-aged man who wants to weigh about 170 pounds when he 's 90 years old , you 'll probably end up living on roughly 2 , 000 calories a day. Plenty of room for alcohol every now and then ! But while you 're in the first year or two of your rest-of-your-life diet , be aware that alcohol will cause your fat cells to plump up again. Like fat , it goes right to where it 's needed most and where you want it least . </weigh.v.3149><weigh.v.3150>First tournament.

For a towing vehicle of two axle , six-wheel configuration pulling a 5th wheeler as a semi-trailer , the ideal distribution would be 20 GCW on the front axle , 40 GVW on the rear axle , and the remaining 40 GCW on the trailer axles , however , practical distribution is 15 on the front axle , 31 on the rear axle , and the remaining 54 GCW equally divided on the trailer axles. A rig that is not relatively equal side-to-side will not ride or handle well. If there is an out of balance condition in either direction ( absent a broken suspension component or flat tire ) it is due to improper load distribution.

At the end of the analysis we may conclude that individuals from whom samples are taken have a moral right to privacy and confidentiality concerning those samples , but this will only be shorthand for a much more complicated ethical conclusion about how these two sets of interests ought to be balanced.

Generally , the public interest factors to be considered are administrative difficulties related to court congestion , burdening the people of a community with jury duty when they have no relation to the litigation , local interest in having localized controversies decided at home , and trying a case in the forum that is at home with the law that governs the case. See Gulf Oil , 330 U.S. at 508-09. The private interest considerations generally are considered to be the ease of access to proof , the availability and cost of compulsory process , the possibility of viewing the premises , if appropriate , and other practical problems that make trial easy , expeditious , and inexpensive.

Eighteen dollars and fourteen cents in the subsidiary silver coin of the United States weigh a pound; a hundred dollars weigh five pounds and a half; a thousand dollars weigh over fifty-five pounds; ten thousand dollars weigh more than a quarter of a ton; fifty thousand dollars weigh more than twenty-seven hundred pounds; a hundred thousand dollars weigh more than fifty-five hundred pounds; and three hundred thousand dollars weigh over sixteen thousand pounds. A million dollars in coined silver would weigh more than twenty-five tons. The weight of the metal and the consequent difficulty and increased labor of handling it and storing it explain the reason why , during our entire history since 1792 , the Government has coined but a trifle over eight millions of 412-1/2 grain silver dollars. The low value of silver , in comparison with its weight , precludes its use in payments. It involves a large loss of time in counting and demands more room for storage and imposes greater cost of transportation than gold , by the proportion of fifteen or sixteen to one . </weigh.v.3368><weigh.v.3369>2 Corinthians 1 : 8 For we do n't desire to have you uninformed , brothers , concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia , that we were weighed down exceedingly , beyond our power , so much that we despaired even of life.

I did lose 100 pounds but I began to have complications. My surgeon put the silastic ring in too small and when adhesions began to form around the ring , I could barely eat or even drink anything. I survived on an ice cream and chocolate diet until 1995 , when I finally had the surgery reversed . </weigh.v.3721><weigh.v.3722>What interesting bit of history !

After finally putting together a realistic routine of dieting and exercise , I 've been able to trim down to a much healthier 182 pounds.

But the trial court could have concluded that the prejudice suffered after that point was virtually nonexistent , because appellant was already incarcerated on a different offense. Moreover , appellant 's failure to assert his right until August 2002 weighs heavily against him. Not only was this assertion tardy , occurring after a year had passed , but the assertion was made when appellant was no longer suffering the same degree of prejudice suffered by one who is not incarcerated. Further , the case was tried approximately two months after the speedy trial right was first asserted. And had there been witnesses appellant wished to call , they could have appeared at the hearing on the motion to revoke probation. After balancing the factors , we conclude that they weigh against finding a speedy trial violation . </weigh.v.3737><weigh.v.3738>You can get pushed up.

The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the denial of innocent spouse relief under Code Sec. 6015 ( e ) ( 1 ) and could use evidence outside of the administrative record in determining whether the IRS abused its discretion. With regard to the factors set out in Rev. Proc. 2000-15 , 2000-1 CB 448 , the IRS abused its discretion in failing to consider whether the couple was still married , whether there was abuse or if a finding of liability would impose economic hardship on the wife. Although the couple was not divorced at the time of the request and they were living in the same home , they were using separate bedrooms , so the marital status factor was deemed to favor the wife. Evidence of abuse and economic hardship was present , but the IRS failed to follow up on the evidence.

At the weigh-in he passes a hydration assessment. He uses this as his certification weigh-in for 135 . At a subsequent regularly scheduled school team competition weigh-in , he weighs in at 139.7 and will be wrestling in the 140 weigh-class for that competition. Has the wrestler broken his 135 certification ? Answer : No , since he only weighed in one weight class above 135 class , he has not broken his original certification. Question : Can he use the hydration assessment when he weighed-in at 134.9 as meeting the hydration assessment for the later weigh-in at 139.7 so that he can be certified at 140 . Answer : Since the major concern with respect to hydration and the rationale for having hydration assessment for wrestlers is that wrestlers do not deplete/dehydrate themselves in order to reach a minimum weight , if in this case the wrestler wanted to certify at 140 and since he was hydrated at a weigh-in for a lower weight , the wrestle could use the 139.7 weight weigh-in as now his certified weight . </weigh.v.3955><weigh.v.3956>Take Gary Poulin , for example.

She and the accused are , in most instances , the only ones present when the crime was committed. See Pennsylvania v. Ritchie , 480 U. S. 39 , 60 ( 1987 ) . Cf. Goodman , Testifying in Criminal Court , at 118. And the question in a capital case is not just the fact of the crime , including , say , proof of rape as distinct from abuse short of rape , but details bearing upon brutality in its commission. These matters are subject to fabrication or exaggeration , or both. See Ceci and Friedman , supra; Quas , supra.

Science is about about keeping an open and honest mind about the evidence and to willing to investigate all the plausabilities. I was once a non-believing atheist , but science has shed light opun the whole topic. By the way I looked at the evidence before I read a Bible or became a Christian , just so you know.

For instance , if your small package weighs 439 grams you pay one rate , but if it 's 440 grams you pay almost TWICE as much ! And - if your scale is not accurate and you ship a 440 gram package with too little postage you risk having the items returned weeks later with " postage due " on them ( if the post office does n't lose it ) .

If you weighed the samples out by the earlier method , you would have needed to make eight mass determinations ( mass of empty container , mass of container with sample ) .

Although the delay was somewhat lengthy in this case , the trial court could have reasonably concluded that some of that delay - especially at the beginning of the case - was attributable to appellant. Because of counsel 's failure to appear at three settings , we can not conclude that the reasons for delay weigh heavily , if at all , against the State before appellant 's probation revocation in February. And the amount of prejudice suffered before the February revocation was relatively limited. The trial court could have rationally concluded that appellant 's probation on the prior offense interfered more with his ability to find a job than the burdens associated with the new prosecution.

The load cells generate an elecctrical signal proportional to the weight they support. A device called a " Scale Indicator " supplies power to the load cells , sums their output , and produces a digital signal which represents the combined weight of the grain and weigh hopper. The flow of grain into or out of the weigh hopper is controlled by slide gates. A scale control computer records the output of the scale indicator , subtracts off the weight of the hopper itself , and operates the gates . </weigh.v.4327><weigh.v.4328>These are great pillows to display your favorite mineral spcimans.

Titrating with standard acid , usually HCl , makes it possible to determine the total alkalinity of the soda ash. It is common practice to report the total alkalinity as percent sodium carbonate or sodium oxide , Na2O. Since samples are frequently non-homogeneous , the method of aliquot portions is usually employed. Instead of weighing out three separate samples of soda ash , one accurately weighs out a larger amount. This is then transferred into a volumetric flask , dissolved in water and then diluted to an accurately known volume.

They are classified as tainter gates by their design and usage. They weigh 54 , 000 pounds each. The gates are opened by raising rather than lowering them. The water flows under the gates from a depth of twenty-two feet below the surface , thus avoiding a strong surface current when in use. The gates are raised and lowered by 70-ton traveling gantry cranes. These are the two house-like structures seen above the dam wall. In the event of mechanical failure , high water will overtop the flood gates before reaching the top of the dam. The base of the spillway section ( 131 feet ) is wider than the rest of dam.

One mole of water weighs 18.015 g. If we mix 46.069 g of ethyl alcohol with 18.015 g of water , we can be assured that the mixture contains 1 molecule of ethyl alcohol per molecule of water. Further , we will know that there are 2 atoms of C and 8 atoms of H per each 2 atoms of O.

While some suggest that a food gelatin such as Knox unflavored gelatin can work , I find that a gelatin designed for photographic use will give a more consistent result. Gelatins are given a hardness rating , the Bloom scale. You will want to find a gelatin with a Bloom rating of around 250. I find that two coats of a 6 gelatin solution works well. To make a 6 gelatin solution , weigh out 60 grams of the gelatin and slowly add the dry gelatin with constant stirring into 900cc of distilled water. Add just small amounts of the dry gelatin at a time and avoid clumps which are very difficult to break up. Use a container that you can heat such as a glass beaker. Once all the gelatin has been stirred into the water add enough water to make one liter. The gelatin granules need time to absorb as much water as possible. Not allowing enough time will cause the gelatin to cook rather than melt when the temperature is raised. Allow at least 30 minutes for the gelatin to swell . </weigh.v.4503><weigh.v.4504>Sarah and Jorge E.

Conversely , if you weigh out 16 times more oxygen ( by weight ) than hydrogen , you will have equal amounts ( by atoms ) of each. As long as the weight of the oxygen measured was 16 times heavier than that of the hydrogen used , we would have the same number of atoms. Pause for a moment to make sure that makes sense to you.

So if your micro balance is in a separate room with no temperature control and 2 or 3 person walk into the room resulting in a temperature increases by 2 C sensitivity of drift becomes an issue. If the test was to determine particles captured on a 2 gram filter where the filter is weighed , then the filter is placed into the exhaust air stream of a piece of equipment being measure for emissions and the filter is now weighed again the delta might be 10ug. The problem is if the temperature was raised by 2 C then 4 ug [ weight in grams x sensitivity to drift x temp change in C so 2 x ( 0.000001 x 2 ) ] is the result of sensitivity to drift and 6ug is the weight of particles captured in the filter.

A giraffe 's heart , which can weigh up to 10 kg ( 22 lb ) and measure about 60 cm ( 2 ft ) long , has to generate around double the normal blood pressure for an average large mammal in order to maintain blood flow to the brain against gravity. In the upper neck , a complex pressure-regulation system called the rete mirabile prevents excess blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head to drink. Conversely , the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure ( because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them ) . In other animals such pressure would force the blood out through the capillary walls; giraffes , however , have a very tight sheath of thick skin over their lower limbs which maintains high extravascular pressure in exactly the same way as a pilot 's g-suit . </weigh.v.4689><weigh.v.4690>In 2008 , the Iowa caucus for both Democrats and Republicans is scheduled for January 14th.

Similarly , costs are reckoned from the standpoint of institutions and entities that have the means to identify and publicize their costs , but rarely if ever from the standpoint of unaffiliated individuals for whom aggregate costs or benefits might be quite considerable. This problem has been widely publicized in the area of environmental regulation over recent years , where efforts have been made to weigh the costs of proposed measures against the health savings or increased longevity that arguably would result from them.

It 's not a practical process when you 're holding up a line of big-rigs 10 trucks long , but it would be more accurate. Should there be more weight on the front of the hitch than you expect to see , you 'd be well advised to rearrange the gear in your trailer to put more weight toward the rear of the trailer. Visually , our truck and trailer looked about level , but we still took some time to shift what had to be at least 150 pounds of tools , spare batteries , and emergency equipment to the rear. In the end , it 's likely our setup was slightly heavy on the rear axle. That axle , rated to carry 6100 pounds , was probably not in jeopardy , but we 'd be driving with a chassis that had less-than-ideal front-to-rear weight distribution.

In a modification , the court is forced to weigh the benefit , if any , of the proposed change against the disruption caused by a change in custody. Studies have shown that changes in custody are extremely disturbing to children and , for that reason , courts are reluctant to make changes unless the proposed new arrangements are head-and-shoulders better than the old ones. So a parent seeking a change in custody faces the additional hurdle that an apparently stable and functional custody arrangement , even if it would not have been the best decision originally , will be left intact , rather than disrupt the child 's stability . </weigh.v.4787><weigh.v.4788>Factor 1 is your weight.

Casaba melons were originally cultivated in Persia thousands of years ago and were introduced to America in the late 1920 's from Kasaba , Turkey. Golden Beauty is related to cantaloupes but instead of netted skin it has long furrows and fruits are pointed at the stem end. Mature casabas are about 8 " x7 " and weigh 7-8 lbs. The rind is tough , making them a long keeper off the vine. The green skin turns yellow at maturity. The luscious creamy-white juicy flesh is delightfully sweet with an exotic hint of spice. Golden Beauty is harvested by cutting from the vine rather than slipping from the vine as many melons do. Makes a refreshingly different melon salsa. Perfect for fruit salads or serve slices with a drizzle of fruit flavored liqueur. They are well adapted to hot , dry regions.

For example , you should be able to record the mass as " 2.104 mg " . [ Please note : if you are unable to acquire a balance that measures to 3 decimal places on a milligram , but instead can only use a balance that measures to 2 decimal places ( e.g. , 2.10 mg ) or to 1 decimal place ( e.g. , 2.1 mg ) , it is important to realize that some precision may be lost when measuring C and N ( but not C/N , or 13C and 15N ) . This is because C and N are calculated using the recorded weight of the sample. Isotope measurements are not affected by small weighing inaccuracies because their determination is not weight-dependent ... beyond the assurance that a large enough sample has been combusted in the EA. Thus if one can live with slightly lower precision on C and N ( e.g. , 2.0 for carbon as opposed to 0.5 ) then acquiring a balance that records to 3 decimal places on a milligram is not essential . ] </weigh.v.4846><weigh.v.4847>Because there are legal issues to consider , you should contact your solicitor for advice on dividing your home , dealing with mortgage issues and dividing the contents of your home.

After a 1-2 hours in the bag , the person 's body chemistry will have " reset " to the lower altitude.

How you have come up with this goal may or may not be something economics can address. If your goal is to be wealthy , you may have signed up for this class in order to advance yourself towards that goal. After all , getting a degree is a common characteristic of wealthy people. But , you may want to be rich in order to prove that your father was wrong when he called you worthless , or you may want to be rich because you like expensive stuff.

Because the atomic weight scale is numerically preserved in the definition of gram atomic weights , the mass of 1 gram-atomic weight of any element could be immediately determined as the atomic weight in grams. Thus 1 gram-atomic weight of sulfur weighs 32.06 g; 1 gram-atomic weight of hydrogen weighs 1.008 g , and so on. Analogous terms , such as gram-molecular weight for the molecular weight of a compound expressed in grams , were similarly used. However , having to use a different term depending on whether elements or compounds were being discussed was awkward and inconvenient. For this reason , the term " mole " was adopted to signify the atomic , molecular , or formula weight of a pure substance expressed in grams . </weigh.v.5001><weigh.v.5002>But M.

Here the density of the articles is computed from the volume data and total weight value , which is the total of the combined weight values constituting the optimum combination , as described above. The density data obtained in this fashion is sampled once per cycle or once every several cycles so that the average density may be computed by an average density calculating device 26 . </weigh.v.5047><weigh.v.5048>I do n't quite know how to rate this book.

Each custom feeder will handle the charges for feeding a little differently. Some programs are based on a cost per pound of gain. Cost of gain programs are common to grass feeding where weighing feed is impossible. The method of measuring shrink , which is the amount of weight an animal loses between the time of sale and the time of placement on feed , is very important in cost of gain agreements. The other option is based is based upon the actual amount of feed provided to animals and yardage charges. It is probably safer in the long run for feedlots ( dry lot feeding ) to use such a method , though this requires a set of scales to weigh feed going into the pens . </weigh.v.5049><weigh.v.5050>If you restrict your daily calorie intake enough , you can lose weight without increasing your activity. But it will be very hard to keep the weight off. It ' s almost impossible to stay on a very restricted diet for a lifetime. A sedentary teenage girl burns only 12 calories per pound per day ( a moderately active teen burns 15 , and a very active girl burns 18. ) So to weigh 120 pounds , the sedentary girl could eat only 1440 calories a day for the rest of her life. You need a minimum of 1800 calories a day for good nutrition ( at that level a sedentary girl will weigh 150 pounds , but a moderately active teen would weigh only 120. ) The average American woman eats 2200 calories a day ( and a sedentary girl would weigh 183 pounds , and the moderately active teen would weigh 146. ) Exercising has many , many other benefits too : it boosts your metabolism , controls your appetite , increases your energy , tones your muscles , and elevates your mood.

In fact , it was not really until late May , when I had dropped another 20 lbs that people truly started to notice. From that point on , it seemed that I could not shut them up.

She surely deserves it , because her first few years of life have been anything but blissful. This lovely sable brown Chihuahua is about 2 years old and weighs 8 pounds. Bliss has been a great mom to her two pups , Paul Mitchell and Tess , but she is still quite shy in the company of people. That 's because , until now , little Bliss has lived her life confined to a cage in a puppy mill , forced to make litter after litter of puppies and with little or no positive human contact. It 's about time this sweet little girl got the chance to learn that there are kind , caring people in the world. It 's happening now in her foster home , where she has recently begun seeking human attention. Bliss will need an experienced , patient family to help her out of her tiny shell. No small children for Bliss , now or in the future . </weigh.v.5108><weigh.v.5109>Strain on the windlass should be limited to the hanging weight of the anchor and rode. In reality , because many boaters don ' t make proper use of their boat ' s power when raising the anchor , it is often much greater. Therefore , manufacturers tend to recommend windlasses with hefty pulling power so that you have the capacity to weigh anchor even if your engine is out or it is already running at full capacity or your anchor is firmly stuck . </weigh.v.5109><weigh.v.5110>Gardnerville residents Sarah and John Kimpel are the parents of a daughter , Brianna Michelle Kimpel , born Dec. 3 , 2009 , at Carson Tahoe Regional Medical Center.

She would be best-suited to a calm-yet-active household. She is energetic , loves toys , and LOVES to run and play with other dogs.

On that account also , the requirements for deciding whether he was justified in feeling called on to act can not be too high. For W , the way the situation presented itself was that two people had already jumped out of the window in front of him and both had then still been able to run away. The fact that in these circumstances W thought the danger of a substantial injury was not great enough to prevent him from jumping justifies ( contrary to the view of the appeal in law ) , in the context of the peculiarities of the present case set out above under a and b , the appeal court 's view that W could have felt himself to be called on to pursue in the sense of the case law on this subject . </weigh.v.5119><weigh.v.5120>150.

Perhaps before taking any direct action to gain weight , one should realize that , just like being overweight , being underweight is a relative condition.

For this reason , one should consult a number of different sources for weight standards and Body Mass Index calculators , which will assist in setting realistic weight goals . </weigh.v.5132><weigh.v.5133>Plastic pumps do come with their limitations , though , so when choosing plastic over metal , you have to weigh the disadvantages with the advantages. Plastic pumps give you limited pressure ratings as opposed to alloy pumps. They have limited high and low temperature ratings relative to alloy pumps , meaning that you can only take them so high and so low in temperature before they are structurally incompatible with your liquid. They are less impact resistant than metal alloy pumps , and they are not recommended for flammable liquids. They are also less capable of handling abrasive fluids . </weigh.v.5133><weigh.v.5134>On day one 189 fish were weighed in , including 60 in the morning following the opening bell at 8 a.m. and 129 during the 8 to 10 p.m. evening weigh-in.

Although aluminum stays and HDPE plastic framesheets are still common , even these have undergone improvements. Mountainsmith has replaced the common bar-stock aluminum stays with corrugated stays ( which are shaped like the wavy middle layer of corrugated cardboard with the corrugations running the length of the stays ) . Because the corrugations add stiffness to the aluminum , the stays can be made using thinner and lighter aluminum. We reviewed the Mountainsmith Auspex , which uses two such corrugated stays. This pack weighs in at 65.3 ounces ( 1 , 851 g ) , which seems rather heavy until you consider its 65-pound ( 30 kg ) carrying capacity. We are also seeing hollow aluminum stays in a number of packs.

Tighten too much and you 'll place undue pressure on the anchor due to the torque multiplying effect. Remember your angles for effective anchor building , if you go over 120 degrees you will be adding strain on each anchor in multiples of force greater than the force that you are applying at the single point , thus on a Tyrolean traverse you may only weigh say 80 kgs but the force on each anchor may be many multiples of that , we 're talking huge numbers here. Therefore if you have zero sag in your line you could conceivably either pull that tree out or break the rope.

If you ' re young and healthy , you can go for lower premiums and higher co-pays. But if you ' re older , have a chronic health condition , or have young children who make frequent visits to the doctor , you ' re better off with higher premiums and lower co-pays. You also have to weigh the value of your health plan against what you pay yearly. If you go with a cheap health plan but it doesn ' t pay for the benefits you need , you are not getting good value for your health insurance dollars . </weigh.v.5163><weigh.v.5164>As we mentioned earlier , parallel limb bows start with a very long riser. Since most of the bow 's weight is in the riser , the parallel limb bow is typically 1/2 pound heavier than standard D-shaped bows. In 2001 , the average compound bow weighed just 3.6 lbs. Today , that average is well over 4 lbs. You may in fact notice that the term " lightweight " has largely disappeared from bow advertising. The dilemma is balancing weight against structural stability. The longer a riser is , the stronger it must be. So there is only so much material the manufacturer can machine away ( cut-outs in the riser ) to reduce the riser 's finished mass. So for now , parallel limb bow buyers will simply have to live with the extra weight. But we expect this situation will continue to improve over the next few seasons . </weigh.v.5164><weigh.v.5165>The largest chocolate model was one weighing 4 tons ( 8818 lbs ) , in the shape of a traditional Spanish sailing ship.

When a scale is receiving inbound grain , the control computer takes a gross weight and subtracts the preceding tare weight to obtain the net weight. This gives the true net weight received , because any grain already in the weigh hopper at the beginning of weighing is subtracted out and not counted. When the scale is weighing outbound grain , the computer takes each gross and subtracts the following tare. This gives the true net weight of grain shipped , because any grain remaining in the weigh hopper at the end of weighing is subtracted out and not counted . </weigh.v.5182><weigh.v.5183>Estee Lauder is a little purebred Yorkie.

Unfortunately , nature does n't always work that way. Some things in life can not or should n't be planned; otherwise we open ourselves to potential risks for both mom and baby. According to ACOG , an induction is necessary when the potential risks to mom and baby with birth are less than the risks of carrying on with the pregnancy. Planning a birthday , working around vacation time , or simply being " sick of being pregnant " do not qualify as being risks to the pregnancy. Therefore , choosing to induce for scheduling purposes is not an appropriate reason and may , in turn , do more harm than good.

Non-published underground researchers have reported content percentages higher than 2.5 mg/g in dried leaf that was considered " good quality " , including reports of 4-5 mg/g.

These " Hell burners " were the most fearful weapons for a fleet at anchor. The Spanish began to prepare. Pinnaces stood guard with long grapnels to tow the fire ships away from the main fleet. Medina ordered the ships to be ready to weigh anchor for a quick getaway. As it was a lengthy business hauling up heavy sea anchors , the tactic was to attach them to buoys. If the fire ships came , then the ships cut their cables and escaped , leaving the heavy anchors attached to the buoys. When the danger was over the ships could return to pick up the anchors. The English recognized their advantage. They filled eight old ships with inflammable material and waited for the wind and tide. After midnight , the waiting Spaniards saw the glow from the fire ships approaching on the tide. As they came closer , their guns heated and exploded , making a terrifying sight. The Spanish hastily cut their cables. In the pitch darkness they collided with each other in their effort to escape , but no ship was set on fire . </weigh.v.5588><weigh.v.5589>My 10year high school reunion is coming up and all the girls I went to school with still look the same no matter how many children they have had.

But while ERISA expressly grants federal courts jurisdiction to review the denial of employee benefits by a plan administrator or fiduciary , it does not specify what standard should govern that review. In Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. v. Bruch , the Supreme Court held that , if an administrator has been given discretion to determine eligibility for benefits under the terms of the benefit plan in question , federal courts can overturn eligibility determinations only if they find that the administrator has abused its discretion. In passing , the Court noted that such deferential abuse-of-discretion review might be more difficult to survive if the plan administrator ' s objectivity were called into question : in a case involving an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest , that conflict must be weighed as a ' facto [ r ] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.

A clerk in Plymouth Yard , named Pering , in the early part of that century ( 1813 ) introduced curved arms; and after 1852 the Admiralty anchor , under the direction of the Board , was supplied to H.M. ships , followed by Lieutenant ( afterwards Captain ) Rodger 's anchor ( fig. 1 ) . This marked a great departure from the form of previous anchors. The arms , de , df were formed in one piece , and were pivoted at the crown d on a bolt passing through the forked shank ab. The points or pees e , f , to the palms g were blunt. This anchor had an excellent reputation amongst nautical men of that period , and by the committee on anchors , appointed by the admiralty in 1852 , it was placed second only to the anchor of Trotman.

Generally we do not bring cost into the equation when considering early clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration does not weigh cost considerations when granting either an investigational new device ( IDE ) or new drug exemption ( IND ) .

There are only two exceptions to this generalization : The first is where ascriptive-group harms are a serious possibility because the source 's ethnic or racial identity can be determined despite individual nonidentifiability; the second is where the process that generated the sample involved a clear violation of basic human rights.

You prepare the remedy in advance , but because the person preparing the remedy is the same person who will get angry , the angry part knows the remedy is there and will chase it out. Then it 's not available when needed. When we demonize our afflictions , we see ourselves in opposition to them , and the tension just increases the power of the affliction.

Unfortunately , because the material continues to reduce the pH as it dissolves , dissolving a quantity can be a tedious process. EDTA salts tend to dissolve more readily , but you would have to keep two different salts for sodium based and potassium based solutions respectively. In addition , we might use EDTA in a concentration as low as 0.1 mM in a small volume. It is usually easier to deliver a small volume of liquid accurately than to accurately weigh out and deliver a small amount of dry chemical. A concentrated stock of EDTA can be prepared using either NaOH or KOH to adjust pH , to be available whenever a solution requires EDTA as a component. For example , our respiration medium is potassium based so we might prepare 100 mM EDTA and use 1 ml of the stock per liter of working solution . </weigh.v.5733><weigh.v.5734>Ok ... but for real ...

After drying and grinding , samples need to be weighed into small tin capsules prior to isotope analysis. Capsule size will depend on sample weight. For example , 4x6-mm tin capsules are preferred when sample weights are less than 7 mg; 5x9-mm tin capsules are used for sample weights between 7 mg and 40 mg; and 9x10-mm tin capsules are used for samples greater than 40 mg.

Generally , a low-potency implant administered to suckling calves at first working ( about four months of age ) will increase weaning weights by 7.5-10 percent. Assuming a calf has the genetic and nutritional potential to weigh 500 pounds at six to eight months old , that 's 35 to 50 pounds more per weaned calf. During the stocker phase , again assuming adequate genetic potential for growth and diet quality , implanting can increase average daily gain 0.25-0.33 pounds and efficiency by 10-20 percent. Heifer calves to be used or marketed as replacements may be implanted once with a low-potency product during the suckling phase but should not be implanted again. An implanted feeder calf will gain faster ( 0.25-0.50 pounds per day ) and more efficiently ( 10-12 percent ) than a nonimplanted calf.

Another load cell is positioned substantially midway in the leg-connecting frame section 26. Thus the three load cells 38 , 40 , and 42 are located in the frame as illustrated. It can be seen that the lower member 30 is not as rigid as the upper member 28 stiffened by side surfaces 31 and 32. This particular arrangement employing three load cells in a triangular configuration , like a tripod , allows a load on the scale to be uniformly received by the load cells even on an underlying rough or uneven surface. That is , the lower member 30 and the load cells 38 , 40 , and 42 will conform to the unevenness of the underlying surface supporting the weigh scale. The scale 's stability and weighing accuracy are therefore ensured.

The Court did not provide any further guidance on this topic , however , leaving post-Firestone courts to struggle with how to evaluate benefit denials involving such potential conflicts of interest. Indeed , claim fiduciaries typically operate under a conflict of interest. Insurers of disability and medical plans both make claim decisions and fund approved claims. Employer-sponsors of qualified retirement and severance plans both make benefit eligibility decisions and pay for benefits. Even employer-sponsors of self-insured medical and disability plans with independent claim fiduciaries may retain discretionary authority to consider appeals of denied claims.

We use four IAEA standards ( IAEA-N1 , N2 , CH6 , and CH7 ) to correct ( i.e. , normalize ) the raw isotope data. We then use a series of elemental standards and various NIST standards to correct the C and the N data. These standards also serve as secondary checks on isotope data from day to day , and are logged into a datafile which serves as a long-term QA/QC report. Standards are interspersed throughout each daily run , to ensure data integrity over the entire analysis. As you will note on the sample-submission sheet , we ask that you weigh out duplicates of some samples as a check on sample homogeneity and reproducibility. If for some unknown reason ( e.g. , power failure , exhaustion of chemicals , computer error ) a sample is lost during analysis , we will request that you re-submit the material. Any repeats that requested by our lab will be analyzed free-of-charge . </weigh.v.6197><weigh.v.6198>Ethan Christian Eacho was born to Lauren Eacho on June 7 , 2007 , at St. Mary ' s Hospital in Leonardtown.

It may not , of course , be possible to provide both these ideal amounts in one sample. The lower limits for reliable day-to-day operation of our instrument at natural abundance isotope levels appear to be ~25 micrograms total N and ~200 micrograms total C.

Native to the harsh Sahara Desert , this antelope is highly adapted to arid conditions , capable of living most of its life without drinking , instead getting the water it needs from the leaves and grasses it eats. Addax can apparently sense desert vegetation great distances away. They have oversized hooves for running on sand , but are still large and rather slow , making for easy targets for poachers. Addax stand roughly 36 inches high at the shoulder , and both sexes have ringed horns that spiral upward to lengths reaching 43 inches. They weigh in between 175 and 275 pounds.

Nihiser 's intent , buttressed by her actions , shows that her relationship with Connolly was drastically changed on July 9 , 1999 , when he flourished divorce papers at her. From then on , they no longer shared a bedroom , and she reasonably thought that her husband had filed for legal separation -- even reporting that day as the start of their legal separation on her forms requesting innocent-spouse relief. She explained on these forms that they remained under the same roof only because of their financial situation. We believe her , and find that she was " living apart " from her husband both when she requested relief and when the Commissioner made his determination. We thus agree with the apparent conclusion reached by the CCISO in its initial consideration of her request that this factor weighs in favor of relief.

Otherwise you would not know if you are overloaded and you would n't know the proper air pressure for your tires according to the chart your tire manufacturer gave you. Yes , you do have the manufacturer 's RV tire chart ? ? ? After an Escapees rally the RV Safety Council ( aka A Weigh We Go ) weighed many RVs ( for a few bucks ) and found over 70 were either overloaded or had low tire pressure. Those 70 were pulling out of the rally grounds and driving unsafely and dangerously down the road and they were the ones concerned about safety. Those not concerned snuck out without being weighed. It is estimated about 85 of RVs are unsafe because they are overloaded or have unsafe tires or tire pressures . </weigh.v.6393><weigh.v.6394>Each barrow gets a 10-pound waiver , meaning it can weigh 10 pounds more or less than the initial card shows , Fontenot said.

During the last few minutes of class , distribute a short , simple questionnaire to students or to a random sample of students in a large lecture class. Limit the questionnaire to four to six short-answer or multiple-choice questions. The issues posed should be ones you can respond to during the term; otherwise your students may develop false expectations about the remainder of the course. You might ask about the level of difficulty of course content , the quality and quantity of assignments , the use of classtime , the nature of student preparation outside of class , or the pace of the class. Consider asking students to list the one or two specific behaviors or incidents that weighed most heavily in their ratings. To assure that students respond candidly , leave the room while they complete the questionnaire anonymously , and ask a student volunteer to collect the forms and return them to you or the department assistant.

I also thought if I was going to spend $ 30- $ 40 on a scale I would look at what amazon had to offer instead of just buying a scale at Target or some place. I am happy with this scale because it measures up to 15lb and displays in metric scale as well , whereas department store scales may only go up to 3lbs. It also has a calibration feature that I have yet to mess with , however , it seems a little sketchy to use only one mass to calibrate this machine. A minimum of two masses should have been used to get the linear relationship between the different masses that you would measure. I do work in a calibration lab but not one that calibrates masses so I could be wrong about the number of points you would need for an accurate mass measurement ( i.e. do n't quote me ) . </weigh.v.6731><weigh.v.6732>The McKids , ages 12 and under brought their bass , crappie , catfish and perch to the scales all morning.

Each contains a 3 " poly-titanium woofer and a 3/4 " Hyperbolic aluminum-dome tweeter. They are a rear-ported design , and are housed in a high-gloss black finish that is pretty sexy. They have a very sturdy cloth grill that has a slight curve at the top that extends above the top of the speaker , adding a touch of style to an otherwise typically boxy speaker. On the rear there is a keyhole-style hanger and a threaded insert for wall-mounting , and a set of what I thought at first glance were sturdy push-pin speaker cable connectors , which I have been critical of in the past. But upon closer inspection , I found that they are miniature 5-way binding posts . </weigh.v.6736><weigh.v.6737>Why do we need moisture sensors in the sand bins ? Because your mix design assumes that aggregates , cement and water are present in the correct proportions , according to the dry material weights. If your sand contains 10 moisture , when you weigh out 1000 lb , only 900 lb is sand; the rest is water. You can allow for this by estimating or measuring the moisture of the sand and increasing the amount that you weigh in proportion. If your sand moisture decreases by 2 without being noticed , however , the batching system will weigh out 2 more sand than you require and will add appreciably less water than needed , making a dry batch. If you correct for this by adding more water , the water/cement ratio will increase , reducing the strength of the product. If the moisture had been measured accurately , the proportions would all have been correct and there would have been no need to add more water . </weigh.v.6737><weigh.v.6738>" Works that are creative in nature are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than are more fact-based works.

This is a topic that is not generally a part of the curriculum in most mortuary colleges , which is likely due to the infrequency of this situation for most embalmers. This frequency or infrequency of cases that have undergone tissue harvesting will weigh heavily on the geographic location of the funeral home , surrounding population , and the proximity of medical research facilities. With the majority of these cases , I am usually told by the funeral home management that the deceased would only be viewed for a day or two and that they would understand if proper preservation of the extremities would not be possible. Strangely , it was as if they did not have any expectations for the case to be done correctly.

When you talk about cost of gain , it is important to know how it is calculated. To start with , you need to know if it is figured on pay weights or in-weights. The pay weight is how much the cattle weighted when they got on the truck for the trip to the feeder. An in-weight is what the animals weigh when they arrive at the feedlot. Since cattle shrink due to transport ( see Table 1 for examples ) , in-weights are less than the pay weight. By the end of the feeding period , cost of gain based on the in-weights usually looks more favorable than those based on the pay weight. In-weights are often used because a feedlot may not know what the pay weights are . </weigh.v.6805><weigh.v.6806>I read weigh down this summer and lost 15 pounds and felt great.

If you go into business for yourself , you forgo the wage income you would have earned by working for someone else.

So let 's say that you want to generate 100 pounds of thrust for an hour by throwing one baseball every second at a speed of 2 , 100 mph. That means that you have to start with 3 , 600 1-pound baseballs ( there are 3 , 600 seconds in an hour ) , or 3 , 600 pounds of baseballs. Since you only weigh 100 pounds in your spacesuit , you can see that the weight of your " fuel " dwarfs the weight of the payload ( you ) . In fact , the fuel weights 36 times more than the payload. And that is very common.

Moreover , the factor that favors defendants -- the nature of the copyrighted work -- does not provide strong support for a fair use finding , since defendants copied both the factual and the expressive elements of plaintiffs ' news articles. Conversely , the amount and substantiality of the copying and the lack of any significant transformation of the articles weigh heavily in favor of plaintiffs on this issue. The court thus finds that defendants may not assert a fair use defense to plaintiffs ' copyright infringement claim. See Reuters , supra , 149 F.3d at 994-95 ( " the district court , having found that only one of the four statutory factors weighed in favor of defendants , correctly concluded that the fair use defense did not apply " ); Tullo , supra , 973 F.2d at 799 ( the [ *76 ] only one of the four fair use factors -- the nature of the copyrighted work -- supported a fair use finding , the court held that the defense could not be invoked to shield defendant from liability for infringing plaintiff 's copyrights ) . </weigh.v.6937><weigh.v.6938>Finally , keep an eye out for ' hidden ' price add-ons.

HFEA weighed a number of factors affecting the welfare of the children concerned , namely , psychological harm if a child finds out that she had been sex-selected , the possibility of preferential or prejudicial treatment to fit parental expectations , or the potential for favoritism and neglect of existing children. It also anticipated , if the birth of a child of undesired sex occurs as a result of a misdiagnosis , how this child might suffer from parental frustration and disappointment.19 All of these concerns warrant extreme caution , even if sex selection is not always incompatible with the welfare of the child.

On the other hand , if parody is not argued then Sony raises concern.

The other utilizes a preweighing principle wherein a preselected amount of material is first weighed out and then dispensed with the bag. Although this latter type , with which this invention is concerned is , in certain respects , more advantageous than the former type , it has not been employed as frequently owing to the fact that prior proposals , which are commercially available , do not rapidly and reliably dispense successive charges of material for filling the bags . </weigh.v.7173><weigh.v.7174>Diet/Feeding : Despite its size , the Blue Whale does not eat large animals. In fact , its diet is formed by microscopic shrimp-like organisms called Krill. Krill are one of the most important organisms in the ocean ecosystems , as many large whales depend on prodigious amounts to survive. Blue Whales gulp huge amounts of ocean water filled with millions of Krill and Plankton. The water is then filtered through baleen plates in the whale 's jaw. As the water escapes through the baleen plates , the Krill and Plankton are retained. Baleen plates work much like a water filter you may have on your kitchen sink. Such plates allow the Blue Whale to consume about 2 , 000-9 , 000 pounds of krill per day , or 40 , 000 , 000 individual krill. You would have to eat 8 , 000-36 , 000 cheeseburgers per day to eat the same amount. The Blue Whale has about 320 baleen plates on each side of its jaw. They are each more than three feet in length. In addition , the whale 's tongue may weigh 4 tons and can hold 50 people . </weigh.v.7174><weigh.v.7175>As a procedural matter , host states must consider the family interests involved before expelling a non-citizen family member. As a substantive matter , respect for the right to family unity requires balancing the state 's interest in deporting the family member with the family 's interest in remaining intact. The inquiry is focused whether the effects on the family of the separation would be disproportionate to the state 's objectives in removing the individual. Considerations such as length of stay in the host country , age , and the degree of the family 's financial and emotional interdependence should be weighed against the state 's interests in promoting public safety and in enforcing immigration laws. The best practice suggests that , particularly when expulsion is threatened for immigration violations only , as opposed to criminal law convictions , and citizen children will be affected , states should find it difficult to rely solely on their interest in immigration enforcement to justify separating an intact family . </weigh.v.7175><weigh.v.7176>When my daughter was 2 , I suddenly gained 30 pounds in the matter of a month !

Volume data v 1 through v n , read out of these volume memories in response to the signal S2 , are applied to an adder 25 , where the volume of the articles batches corresponding to the optimum combination is computed and applied to the divider 23. Here the density of the articles is computed from the volume data and total weight value , which is the total of the combined weight values constituting the optimum combination received from the combination computing unit 20. The density data obtained in this fashion is sampled once per cycle or once every several cycles so that the average density may be computed by an average density computing device 26. Based on the calculated average density , the adjustment unit 230 adjusts the size of the individual articles in such fashion that the density of the articles becomes substantially constant . </weigh.v.7178><weigh.v.7179>Cardinal Run-A-Weigh RW-500 Portable Platform Scale weighing in at less than 100 pounds and featuring built-in handles and wheels , the Run-A-Weigh RW-500 is easy to lift and roll to wherever you need it.

The right attaches when the defendant becomes an accused , either at the time of arrest or upon the issuance of an indictment or information. When a speedy trial claim is made , the defendant must make a threshold showing that the length of delay is presumptively prejudicial. Once that showing has been made , the burden of persuasion shifts to the State to show , on balance , that the four factors do not weigh in favor of dismissal. Courts balance four factors to determine whether a speedy trial violation has occurred. The factors to be considered are : ( 1 ) the length of delay , ( 2 ) the reason for delay , ( 3 ) the defendant 's assertion of the right , and ( 4 ) prejudice to the defendant.

We all make some sort of sense of the production and distribution of goods and services. But it is possible to be unaware of the particular economic theory used by your mind. Every time you decide to produce or buy or borrow or invest or save something , your mind is at work. That is , you weigh various factors in reaching your decision. You take some account of various aspects , implications , and possible consequences of your decision. Which factors you weigh and which aspects you take into account depend on your theory of how the economy works . </weigh.v.7208><weigh.v.7209>Akano actually weighed in a pound and a half under the designated weight limit , at 143.5 lbs.

The extent of your risk is directly related to your potential reward , or the amount you can make. The relationship is fairly simple : the greater the risk , the greater the opportunity for substantial rewards. Investments such as money market funds , CDs , Treasury bonds or fixed annuities expose you to little or no risk on your principal. In most cases , they pay you what they promise to pay , based on a particular rate of interest. The trade-off is that these investments offer limited reward because they do n't grow in value as much as other investments. High-risk securities like stock in start-up companies or derivative products , such as options and futures , offer potentially high reward but at the very real risk of losing your investment capital. Between these extremes are a large number of investments that let you weigh moderate risk against the potential for return. Among other things , the list includes stocks , stock mutual funds , and variable annuities.

This can lead to a single point check , though more may be necessary if a wide range of weighings is to be done on a given scale. The emphasis on Dispensary scales has its origin in the fact that almost everything that is weighed out will remain in the typical pharmaceutical product. The pharmacological response depends , in this and other ways , on accuracy and consistency in production. An interesting case is the weighing out of ingredients for a clinical trial batch : here checks done both before and after the event and which bracketed the weighings would not be excessive ! Similarly almost all laboratory tests are affected by the accuracy of reference and sample preparations and of standardised reagents. All of these rely upon the analytical balances in the laboratory : it would therefore seem wise to calibrate frequently ( 6 monthly ) and performance check say weekly or daily . </weigh.v.7227><weigh.v.7228>Floyd Mayweather vs Juan Manuel Marquez Weigh In HD Quality scale he revealed a bulky and soft frame that weighed in at 142.

In a weighing state , the consideration of an invalid aggravating factor can place improper weight on death ' s side of the scale. As a result , the Supreme Court established in Clemons v. Mississippi that a court in a weighing state can only uphold a death sentence that was based on consideration of an invalid aggravating factor if the court either : ( 1 ) independently reweighs the valid aggravating and mitigating circumstances , or ( 2 ) determines that consideration of the invalid factor was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. By contrast , the Court held in Zant v. Stephens that because aggravating factors matter in determining death-penalty eligibility but play no particular role in sentence selection in a non-weighing state , as long as there remains at least one valid aggravating factor making the defendant death-eligible , the presence of an invalid factor does not unduly affect the sentence-selection process . </weigh.v.7341><weigh.v.7342>The best way to ensure a proper coffee to water ratio is to weigh the coffee rather than measure it by volume with a scoop. Measuring by volume is a compromise between quality control and convenience. If you use a scoop , you need to determine how many scoops of coffee to use for your prefered serving size. To do this , weigh out the proper amount of coffee calculated from the 3.75oz : 64oz coffee to water ratio and then measure how many times that amount of coffee fills your favorite coffee scoop. For instance , to find the number of scoops needed to produce a 10.6 ounce serving of coffee ( which fits nicely in a standard twelve ounce mug ) , weigh out 0.7 ounces ( 20 g ) of ground coffee , and then find how many times that coffee fills your scoop. I find that I can fill my two-tablespoon coffee scoop about 2 and a quarter times with 0.7 ounces of ground Kenya . </weigh.v.7342><weigh.v.7343>yeah , it makes me wonder when i see people refer to to FSJs ' as heavy. they 've obviously not weighed theirs. they 're actually lightweights. our minivan weighs in at 4800lbs. 400 heavier than my '91 GW was . </weigh.v.7343><weigh.v.7344>Sean William weighed 10 pounds , 14 ounces , and Abigail Rose weighed 12 pounds , 3 ounces for a combined 23 pounds , 1 ounce.

" </weigh.v.7376><weigh.v.7377>The required ( dry ) mass for simultaneous analysis of d15N and d13C depends mostly on the sample type , but also on the nitrogen content of each sample. Since nitrogen occurs in lower concentrations than carbon ( for most organic materials ) , the nitrogen content becomes the limiting factor in dual-isotope measurements. Plants ( i.e. , 2-5 nitrogen ) and soils/sediments ( 0.1-1.0 nitrogen ) have much lower nitrogen concentrations than animals ( i.e. , 8-12 nitrogen ) , so more material is needed per sample for plants and soils than for animals. The preference in our isotope lab is to weigh out 60 micrograms of nitrogen per sample ( regardless of the sample type ) . This amount of material usually results in a nitrogen peak of sufficient size for accurately measuring stable isotopes , but it does not result in a peak so large that it will exhaust the chemicals too quickly. Since there is usually much more carbon than nitrogen in organic materials , there should always be enough carbon per sample for d13C analysis ( so long as samples have been properly prepared for d15N analysis ) . </weigh.v.7377><weigh.v.7378>What is an interest ?

The output voltage being fed in the A/D varies in proportion to the load applied to the platform of the scale. This occurs since the weighing platform of a scale is connected to the end of the load cell via a post. The applied force is transferred from the platform , through the post and onto the aluminum beam. Since the aluminum beam is milled out in the shape of a dog bone , the force applied results in a deformation of the beam. When the beam bends the strain gauges bend resulting in their resistance value to change. Since the current is the same in a series current and the resistance changes as the strain gauges bends , the voltage changes in proportion to the load applied to the platform . </weigh.v.7380><weigh.v.7381>How could anyone resist such a sweet apricot poodle face ? !

His/Her Pro partner has a great day on the water and has a 5 fish limit that weighs in at 20 pounds. The non-boater 's total combined weight for the day would be 25 pounds. Now Angler B comes to the stage with a monster 3 fish limit that tips the scales at 15 pounds. Their Pro partner , on the other end of the spectrum , had a crappy day and only weighed in 2 fish for a measly 5 pounds. This would give Angler B a combined total weight of 20 pounds.

You can estimate that rather quickly. First , 1 mm of water spread over a square metre weighs one kilogram. We 'll assume here a 10 : 1 snowwater ratio , so 1 cm of snow on a square metre weighs a kilogram. Next calculate the area of your driveway or walk in square metres. For this example , let 's assume a driveway of 15 x 4 metres which gives 60 square metres. Then multiply that by the average depth of snow on the surface , I took 5 cm. Finally multiply that number by 1 kg. That gives 60 x 5 x 1 kilograms or 300 kg.

This further allows versatility in use of a manually-operated pallet mover which could not be used for fairly heavy loads when it was necessary to drive the manually-operated pallet mover up a ramp to a platform. Moreover , to ensure an accurate weight measurement of the load to be weighed , fork-lift trucks should be removed from a platform-type scale to perform the weigh measurement. If the fork-lift truck was not removed from the platform scale , the weigh measurement could be inaccurate , particularly when the loaded pallet was of a low weight in comparison to the fork-lift truck. Because a pallet mover or fork-lift truck with its lowered forks will not interfere with the operation of the scale of this invention during weighing , there is no need to remove the pallet mover or truck from the scale area between weighings. Not having to remove the pallet mover or truck minimizes the time needed for each weighing.

The height of their reign in the 15th century came to a brutal end in 1535 when the Spanish conquistadors took over their territory. Their cities and fortresses were mostly built on highlands and on the steep slopes of the Andes Mountains. The architecture of the Inca cities still amazes and puzzles most scientists.

When asked to give their weight , Americans may misreport for several reasons. Most obviously , overweight individuals may consciously or subconsciously shave off pounds in order to present themselves more positively to those inquiring about their weight. Because Gallup Poll interviews are conducted by phone rather than in person , respondents may be tempted to claim a weight that is lower than their true weight -- even when the interviewer is an anonymous individual whom the respondent will never see or hear from again. Americans may also give an incorrect weight because they do n't know their precise weight , so they simply guess based on their recollections of what they weighed at some point in the past . </weigh.v.7612><weigh.v.7613>The fact is , the atmosphere does n't weigh anything , and the reason is that the forces up equal the forces down.

Before I show what the force up is , I must show that the force down has been miscalculated. When you read that the column of air weighs 11 tons per square meter , you may not realize how that number was arrived at. You may think that scientists weighed a parcel of nitrogen/oxygen gas at sea level , then summed up , accounting for known density losses at higher altitudes and the changing makeup of the gas. Or you may think they used the atomic or molecular weights of nitrogen and oxygen and so on , and summed up from that. But that is n't how the number was achieved.

Unfortunately , even with the resulting suicides of investors who lost millions or 90-year-old Madoff investors such as Ian Thiermannn returning to work 30 years after his retirement , neither Madoff nor any other corporate criminal has accepted complete blame. While pleas of guilt have been entered as well as a somber statement made by Madoff stating that he is , " painfully aware that I have hurt many , many people , " these public displays are still a far cry from affirming the magnitude of their crimes.

The Tax Court found that the woman met the threshold conditions for equitable relief under Section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 2000-15 , 2000-1 CB 447 , but relief was not available under that section because the couple had lived together for part of the 12-month period preceding the request for relief , the woman had reason to know that the reported liability would not be paid , and she provided no evidence regarding her financial status to support her claim of economic hardship. Consideration of the factors weighing for or against equitable relief under section 4.03 of Rev.

Teak is synonymous with the best wood for marine applications in that it does not require a stain or sealer for protection thanks to its natural siliceous ( high silica ) content. Burmese teak is hard to differentiate from other lesser types of teak like Indonesian teak but as a rule of thumb it is a rich golden brown heart wood while the soap wood is pale yellow. The Master America barrels are laminated using 6 laminations to ensure rigidity and eliminating any possibility of warping and glued together specifically. But more importantly 6 laminations are used because Teak has a natural variation in density of roughly 25-30 , basically not all teak is homogeneous , and therefore one piece may weigh up to 30 more or less than an identical sized piece. These inherent differences in the wood were considerations that couldn ' t be blown off for the proper balance of the gun and therefore all the strips of teak used are weighed so that they conform to a specific weight criterion and the ones that fall outside of this criteria aren ' t used . </weigh.v.7845><weigh.v.7846>Isabella Rose Van Dinther Loboy was born at 3 : 20 a.m. June 14 , 2009 , at home to Andrea Van Dinther and Joe Loboy.

California , 512 U.S. 967 , 971-972 ( 1994 ) . [ FOOTNOTE 2 ] Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied , the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it. Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors ( sometimes identical to the eligibility factors ) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.

Like the euro , event risk for the British pound will be minimal until Thursday , when the Bank of England is expected to leave rates unchanged for the second straight month. A look at the minutes from their April policy meeting showed that the MPC voted unanimously in favor of leaving the Bank Rate at 0.50 percent and to continue their quantitative easing ( QE ) program. They also said that there was a " high degree of uncertainty " over the amount of asset purchases that would be necessary to keep inflation at target , and if " the evidence warranted it , " the Committee could reduce or expand their program. Ultimately , how the British pound responds will likely depend on the BOE ' s QE stance.

[ Please note : if you are unable to acquire a balance that measures to 3 decimal places on a milligram , but instead can only use a balance that measures to 2 decimal places ( e.g. , 2.10 mg ) or to 1 decimal place ( e.g. , 2.1 mg ) , it is important to realize that some precision may be lost when measuring C and N ( but not C/N , or d 13C and d 15N ) . This is because C and N are calculated using the recorded weight of the sample. Isotope measurements are not affected by small weighing inaccuracies because their determination is not weight-dependent ... beyond the assurance that a large enough sample has been combusted in the EA. Thus if one can live with slightly lower precision on C and N ( e.g. , 2.0 for carbon as opposed to 0.5 ) then acquiring a balance that records to 3 decimal places on a milligram is not essential . ] </weigh.v.7896><weigh.v.7897>Sail rigs do n't actually weigh very much.

Having a brick that weighs less than six pounds makes no sense because of a negative difference in weight. Furthermore , the difference would have to be zero because half of the weight has been taken out , leaving only the three pounds. Three pounds minus three pounds will result in zero if it is the brick we are considering. This only happens when the brick weighs six pounds as shown in the table. Therefore , if one brick weighs 6 pounds , then a brick and a half will weigh 9 pounds . </weigh.v.7924><weigh.v.7925>In 1900 George Lawrence was called upon to make a giant photograph of a new Chicago &amp;Alton railroad train for display at the upcoming Paris Exposition , the result was the giant railroad camera above.

In its traditional form , it consists of a pivoted horizontal lever of equal length arms , called the beam , with a weighing pan , also called scale , scalepan , or bason ( obsolete [ 1 ] ) , suspended from each arm ( hence the plural term " scales " for the entire instrument ) . The unknown mass is placed in one pan , and standard masses are added to the other pan until the beam is as close to equilibrium as possible. In precision balances , a slider weight is moved along a graduated scale. The slider position gives a fine correction to the weight value. Although a balance technically compares weights , not masses , the weight of an object is proportional to its mass , and the standard weights used with balances are usually labeled in mass units . </weigh.v.7928><weigh.v.7929>Being overweight or obese.

Therefore , when weighing out and packaging articles in batches each of which has a fixed weight , the volume of each batch within the packaging vessels will also be fixed. This makes it possible to avoid an unexpected volumetric excess caused by a variation in apparent specific gravity when the packaging operation is carried out , thereby preventing the articles from overflowing from the package. Accordingly , a batch of articles of a fixed weight will always have a volume suited to the specified capacity of the packaging vessel , thereby making it possible to prevent too small a product volume and , hence , the impression of a weight shortage. At the same time , too large a product volume can be avoided to preclude an improper seal and an obstruction to the packaging process caused by overflowing of articles from the package . </weigh.v.8129><weigh.v.8130>In case that does n't do it for you , two average-size horses weigh one ton.

The volume and specific gravity of an object such as a cube of wood is easy to calculate as it is a regular shape and is of the same material throughout.

Muscle mass is proportionately heavier than fat mass. Taking these things into consideration , I used the Strength and Body modifiers found later in this article to modify the 97.7 kg human just mentioned and make him an Ork. The total modifier became 1.28 , which gives us a male Ork weighing 125.1 kg , or 276 pounds. This places them firmly in the bounds of many modern-day human professional athletes.

I 'm not sure if the extra beef is needed because Harmonica seemed totally adequate to me as far as strenght and stiffness go. But the extra size of Shanteuse is probably going to take it out of the compact car tow class. The plywood bill for Shanteuse looks like six sheets of 1/2 " plywood and eight sheets of 1/4 " plywood. I would not use fancy materials on a boat like this and am reminded of Phil Bolger 's warning to never spend a lot of money building a design that was intended to look cheap. I see pine exterior plywood at my local lumberyard selling for $ 11 or a 3/8 " sheet and this entire boat could be built of it. So the plywood bill would be less than $ 200 and I 'm thinking the entire bill less than $ 500.

Consumers decide to buy a product if its benefits outweigh its price , and forgo the purchase if the opposite is true. During an economic downturn , the price of a product carries a higher weight in a price-benefit comparison. If the price of a product is lower than other products in the same category , promotional campaigns should highlight the price aspect of the product and aim to encourage consumers in a price-benefit comparison. If price is not the most attractive part of the product 's attributes , then the promotional policy should aim to prevent consumers from engaging in a conscious price-benefit calculation. An example of such a policy would be an advertising message that highlights the emotional connection of a particular brand with consumers , such as positive childhood memories , instead of focusing on its price . </weigh.v.8200><weigh.v.8201>Determining just how much your luggage weighs after you have packed it can be a real challenge.

It can be seen that the upper member 28 of the legs 22 and 24 and frame section 26 thus has a reverse-U cross-section which is highly stiff and rigid for connecting the load cells to the inner portions of the reverse-U cross-section of that upper member 28 as will be described in greater detail hereinafter.

Parody necessarily uses some characteristic features from the original , but in this case Ernest departed markedly from Mattel 's Barbie. She did n't create another doll , and she did n't include the idealized body style embodied in Barbie. Indeed , Ernest included only enough of Barbie to make a recognizable commentary on Barbie 's 'idealized ' body style. This appears to be a case where the parody is substantial as compared to the copying.

I actually prefer weighing everyday so I can stay motivated. It encourages me when my weight dips , even if only for a day , and it motivates me to keep on keeping on with what I ' m doing. If I weigh MORE on a particular day , I ' m just that much more careful about not overeating that day.

However , whether one characterizes the evidence relevant to this factor as weighing in favor of granting Respondent 's application or simply neutral seems somewhat a matter of semantics. Given the nature of the evidence here ( Respondent 's mere testimony that he anticipates authorization from the state and that he promises to comply with state law ) , I accept the characterization that the evidence is favorable as to the second public interest factor , with the caveat that this factor is of limited weight commensurate with the nature of the evidence . </weigh.v.8505><weigh.v.8506>Irvine , who 's based at the Corvallis , OR , Willamette Resources office , oversees operations located from Portland to the California border.

This scale was located in West Troy , now Watervliet. In these diagrams , the scale used for weighing cargo boats is seen from the perspective of a boat entering the weigh lock. The four sections of the scale , virtually identical to each other , were located one after the other in a line. When the water was removed , the boat would come to rest on the two planks marked " W " in the diagram , which ran the length of the scale. As the heavy boat pulled the body of the scale down , a crossbeam , " B " , which pivots at " J " , was pulled up at its right extremity , raising the rod " H " , which was attached to the scale 's weigh beam.

Since the district court accepted New Era 's contention that it would commission an authorized biography of Hubbard and that all Hubbard 's writings , published and unpublished , would be made available for that purpose , it is difficult to conclude , as does the district court , that the book published by Holt would have no effect on the market for New Era 's forthcoming book.

Yet , the guidance on what constitutes those social and environmental factors is often patchy or non-existent.

An order for fees against the claimant is extremely rare due to the fact that LTD clai-mants are , by definition , unable to work and unable to pay such fees. More importantly , as long as the LTD claim had arguable merit , i.e. evidence to support the disability claim , the carrier would not be eligible to recover its fees from the claimant. As the courts have held , allowing a counterclaim for fees against the disability claimant would compromise the efficacy of ERISA. If such an award were allowed in an ERISA case , an LTD claimant would be compelled to weigh the benefits of pursuing ERISA claims against the burdens of paying opposing counsel 's fees. Requiring an LTD claimant to engage in such a calculation would create a clear disincentive to the assertion of ERISA claims , a result at odds with the statute 's purpose and goals.

This is usually due to some level of overcrowding. However this does not always mean that braces or removable retainers should be put in at once. In conjunction with the braces specialist [ orthodontist ] the decision must be made as to whether the adult teeth should be allowed to come in before the braces are placed , or whether the orthodontist should intervene immediately , and possibly place appliances twice - once early , and again after the permanent teeth erupt. One of the main factors to consider in early intervention is whether the child has to move the jaw to the left , right , or forward to make the teeth fit together.
