The Seller and Listing agent kept insisting on talking with the mold inspector , the lab , and demanding proof of this toxic mold. We kept insisting that we couldn t get that information for ourselves , let alone them , and ALL we wanted done concerning the mold was to have the air ducts cleaned. They argued and argued. The mold inspector refused to take any of their calls since they were so unreasonable on the first call. This made the Seller and Agent more and more agitated. Hours on the phone and nasty emails with both the seller and agent , we could not get them into the mindset that all Jaime and Mary were requesting were to have the air ducts cleaned. Finally , they relented and agreed to clean the ducts . </insist.v.1><insist.v.2>Have you wondered why your family doctor has little time for you ? The simple reason is that the Nova Scotia government , as health insurer , decided that , with few exceptions , regardless of how sick you are , your family doctor will only receive a nominal payment for your care. The government insists that the twenty-eight dollars doctors receive for each office visit includes the costs to deliver primary care. Your doctor pays for office rent , nurse and secretarial services , and the cost of information technology . </insist.v.2><insist.v.3>Praed , Crofts , and Frank depart for the Gardner home to retire for the evening , leaving Mrs. Warren alone with her daughter. The two soon get into an argument about how Vivie will now live. When Mrs. Warren insists that she has the right to determine her daughter 's future , Vivie admits that she knows nothing about her mother and begins to quiz her. Mrs. Warren becomes quite flustered , especially when Vivie demands to know who her father is. Suspecting that her father might be Crofts , Vivie declares that she will leave the next day unless her mother tells her the truth. Mrs. Warren explains that Crofts is not her father and reveals that she is not sure who is . </insist.v.3><insist.v.4>The second principle is that national plans need to be comprehensive. What does that mean , " comprehensive " ? It means that one component obviously is to provide liquidity through the central banks. The second point is to contain guarantees to depositors and assurances to creditors. The third point is very well-known and has to do with distressed assets. The fourth point , which is for us the most important one and on which the IMF has been insisting for months , is recapitalization of financial institutions. There is no way to have a way out of the situation that we are in without enough recapitalization of the financial institutions . </insist.v.4><insist.v.5>Video Poker : Books : Gambling take pulls a crowd to hearing.

Suppose a man insisted that he would not work at any job unless he is paid 500 gold ounces per year. If his best available DMVP is only 100 gold ounces per year , he will remain unemployed. Whenever a man insists on a wage higher than his DMVP , he will remain unemployed , i.e. , unemployed at the wage that he insists upon. But then this unemployment is not a problem , but a voluntary choice on the part of the idle person.

" </insist.v.7><insist.v.8>The baleful fact is that the country suffers from a surfeit of democracy a gazillion interest groups , a gazillion blogs , a gazillion talk shows and all of them insisting on transparency so a gazillion eyes peer over the shoulders of politicians. The black but necessary art of politics shies from the sun. Little gets done. Backrooms have been turned into rec rooms and meetings are seminars. We are doomed. Worse , we are bored . </insist.v.8><insist.v.9>That the arts provide pleasure and escape is one formulation. Another is that they present us with insight into what is eternal and universal. Traditionally , this has been called the theory of imitation. Behind every profound work of art , this point of view proposes , is a set of principles about humanity that always prevails. A Renaissance painting of a Madonna and child , for many viewers , is somehow a revelation of transcendent spirituality; a Beethoven symphony is the last word on human endurance. Certain arrangements of color and movement satisfy us over a long period of time , like the ballet Swan Lake , for instance , or Impressionist paintings. We judge them as beautiful. Beauty , many would insist , is the very hallmark of what is truly " art. " </insist.v.9><insist.v.10>2. You must insist on a properly detailed proposal. This is harder than it sounds. Reps will fight furiously to keep their edge and run out the clock. They will insist that they have already given you everything they can. They will stall and cajole and bring you bad proposal after bad proposal. You should be aware that a vendors generally can not produce a summary proposal unless they have first prepared a fully detailed version for their own use. It should not , therefore , take weeks or months for them to give you what you need. Why then is it so hard to get detail ? The vendors know that if they can keep the detail from you , it gives them the chance to adjust the configuration to their advantage . </insist.v.10><insist.v.11>And this time , says the Libyan leader , it 's for good.

" </insist.v.11><insist.v.12>Third : -- Require native leaders to earn their own living either wholly or in part. There is Pauline example for this method. Some of the Presbyterian missionaries in Laos have adopted it by inducing the members of a congregation to secure a ricefield and a humble house for their minister. The Korea missionaries have very successfully worked this method by insisting that the leaders of groups shall continue in their former occupations and give their services to Christian work without pay , in some such way as Sunday-school superintendents and other unpaid workers do in America. This method is deserving of wider adoption. It would give considerable relief in many other fields. It was probably the way that the early church grew . </insist.v.12><insist.v.13>With Mr Fraser among those insisting there are " numerous questions " needing answered , it seems certain the fallout arising from our investigation has only just begun.

As we have seen many who hold the so-called " traditional view " vehemently insist a divorced person should never remarry as long as his former spouse is alive or else they live in " perpetual adultery. " But who ever heard of such a thing as " perpetual adultery " when reading the Bible ? A person may commit an act of adultery , but to commit perpetual adultery he would have to have a different " partner " every time ! In an unscriptural remarriage the first " going in unto her " may be adultery but after that it would n't be because with the first time he essentially married her. As we have stated before , the reason the sacramentalists talk like this is they really believe a man ( or woman ) is actually still married to his divorced spouse until death. Remnants of Roman Catholicism. The King James Bible , however , says different. For every grounds of legal , legitimate scriptural divorce one will find a legal , legitimate , scriptural allowance for remarriage in the context . </insist.v.14><insist.v.15>Obasanjo lauded NEITI and insisted that : The achievements of Nigeria through NEITI are a good example for other resource rich African countries to emulate particularly through the self regulatory toolkit that the African Peer Review Mechanism ( APRM ) provides.

I tried to make a distinction between the building , which we had given a name , and those of us who gathered in that building , whom I refused to name. I explained that this was a teaching center for the body of Christ in that area. Perhaps it was a mistake , but we held Sunday morning meetings for those who chose not to go elsewhere. That Sunday morning meeting became the main event of the week . </insist.v.18><insist.v.19>All of that is familiar literary ground in our story 's great prologue , and that with a minimum of biblical prompting. Those who wish to credit Joseph Smith with a comprehension of comparative literature and ritual far beyond his time and training are free to do so. They may even insist , as they have with the Book of Mormon , that this is the way any uneducated rustic would tell the story. Today , however , we have several very ancient and significant parallels to Moses 1 , which lie far beyond the reach of coincidence or daydreaming. The number of details and the order in which they occur make it perfectly clear that we are dealing with specific works of great antiquity that come from a common source. To show what we mean , let us compare Moses ' , Abraham 's , and Adam 's confrontations with Satan; these stories themselves contain pointed references to Enoch , with whom each hero is duly compared. These accounts are not scripture , but are simply ancient records that help us understand the Enoch story . </insist.v.19><insist.v.20>ALBANY , Feb. 13 By insisting that the State Legislature approve any settlement to close the Shoreham nuclear power plant , Gov.

Nevertheless , inside the government -where there does not seem to be any good sense at all- they continued insisting on the idea that the implementation of those plans was the key factor for the tranquility of the Salvadoran population. Said and done , when he was about to end his administration period , Flores ordered that the maras had to be closely watched; Saca , following the steps of his predecessor , continued with that persecution . </insist.v.21><insist.v.22>Let 's start with the story of two moms.

Subjected to increasing verbal abuse by black male writers and black male audiences -- such as that for the film , " The Color Purple , " made from the novel by Alice Walker -- black women authors have insisted that the telling of these stories carries out the very function of art. Black artists , like Melvin Edwards and Robert Colescott , are using sculpture and painting to raise some of the painful past of American treatment of blacks. Both female and male photographers are insisting that we face the facts of sexual exploitation in our own culture. Artists and writers who are native Americans and Chicanos are challenging the myths with which their ethnic groups have been marginalized in American society. In West Germany , Anselm Kiefer and other painters , are using their art to demand that audiences face the guilt of Nazi tyranny and persecution. Art not only can criticize the cultural mainstream , it must , if the mainstream is ever to flow purely . </insist.v.24><insist.v.25>[ Footnote 29 ] Counsel had been appointed for the defendant Woodward but withdrew shortly before trial. When the trial court appointed a substitute counsel , the defendant objected : " I would rather not have legal aid. I would rather conduct the case myself. " The trial court insisted , however , that the defendant proceed to trial with counsel , and a conviction resulted. On appeal , the Crown did not even attempt to deny a basic right of self-representation , but argued only that the right had been waived when the accused accepted the first counsel. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument : " The prisoner right at the beginning [ of the trial ] said that he wished to defend himself . . . and he was refused what we think was his right to make his own case to the jury instead of having it made for him by counsel. " This , the court held , was an " injustice to the prisoner , " and " although there was a good deal of evidence against the prisoner , " the court quashed the conviction . </insist.v.25><insist.v.26>Love that is conditioned upon us doing what we have always done , or doing what others expect us to do , is not in fact love. In perhaps the most beautiful chapter of the New Testament , St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 provides for us the definition of love. Within that definition St. Paul asserts that love does not insist on its own way. Slaveholders , for example , who give orders and love only when the slave is obedient do not love the slave but themselves. Likewise , neighbors who speak well of you only if you do not talk about a new way of doing things do not love you but their current circumstances. To insist on our own way , for others to insist on their way , represents not love arrogance , pride that desires to put oneself in the place of God , a manifestation of Adam ' s original sin . </insist.v.26><insist.v.27>Hoorah for MECO ! How brilliant for them to take the stance they have. If a teacher has been told she may not wear the full veil whilst in the classrom because it is wholly inappropriate , why on earth should children be able to ? As Dr. Hargey says , it is a Saudi influence , ( and nothing to do with Islam ) designed to degrade women. In our society , it has ALWAYS been those who are causing trouble/breaking the law who wish to hide their faces. Why can these people not understand this ? If they insist on wearing their full veils as opposed to embracing the culture of the country they choose to live in , maybe they should go and live elsewhere , where this is condoned. Why on earth should we , as British ( English ? ) nationals be made to feel not only uncomfortable , but unreasonable in our own country ? </insist.v.27><insist.v.28>That deal would have a bigger impact on Los Angeles than any ever negotiated by the city with a criminal defendant. Perez was recast as a whistle-blower , a flawed but ultimately heroic man exposing the corruption around him. Over a period of weeks , and then months , Perez went on to implicate more than seventy officers with whom he had worked at the LAPD 's Rampart Division in assorted crimes and abuses against the community 's largely Hispanic population. The story Perez told became increasingly byzantine , with descriptions of a " crash pad " where a " secret society " of Rampart officers debauched themselves with stolen drugs and coerced prostitutes; of prizes given for shooting gang members; and of cover-ups by assorted supervisors. All along , Perez insisted he knew of no criminal activity by either Mack or Martin . </insist.v.28><insist.v.29>In Nairobi the government ' s spokesman , Alfred Mutua , said the Kroll report was incomplete and inaccurate and We did not find that the report was credible.

( Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid denounced the president ' s heartless veto. ) As Republicans see it , the Democratic scheme to enlarge S-Chip would merely be the camel ' s nose under the tent of socialized medicine. They point out that thousands of children currently eligible for S-Chip coverage are not enrolled , and that many other kids would lose their private insurance coverage under the legislation Bush vetoed . </insist.v.32><insist.v.33>Ultimately they are being very discourteous to the barren woman by claiming things for her that God has not promised. Some would probably jump right back with the answer , " Well , I have the faith that God will answer my prayers for her ! " To which we should reply , Hast thou faith ? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. Romans 14 : 22 Has it ever crossed your mind , ma'am , that you are keeping the poor woman in a state of discontent and misery ? Why do n't you try supporting her in her sorrows by being a blessing to her instead of insisting that she believe you when you say " You 'll have children " ? Are you God ? Can you open her womb ? What if the Lord has a purpose for keeping her barren for His glory ? Do you really believe Romans 8 : 28 ? Hmmmm . </insist.v.33><insist.v.34>If you find an effective way to deal with this , I 'd love to know it.

Gamaliel 20 : 47 , 31 October 2006 ( UTC ) </insist.v.36><insist.v.37>We in the human rights community rightly insist that a thing be called by its proper name. The word " genocide " carries with it the horror and weight of the greatest atrocities in human history. In these times , the word has not served the purpose of animating , inspiring , and outraging. Rather , it has conveyed a sense of inevitability and defeat. For those who are daunted and defeated by the word , let us attempt to convey our outrage and horror differently. A genocide is the destruction of a people , one life at a time , one after another , until the numbers are numbing. The converse of genocide is valuing , protecting , and saving a people. If the only way such a high purpose can be understood and acted upon is one life at a time , then so be it . </insist.v.37><insist.v.38>Thus the greenback issue survived after 1875 , and the question of the proper composition of the currency now emerged as one of the most controversial and enduring issues in American politics. Creditors and established financial interests continued to insist on a sound currency based on gold. Debtor groups farmers , laborers , and some manufacturers and debtor regions the South and the West continued to clamor for a currency based not on gold reserves but on the productive capacity of the nation. Otherwise , they claimed , they would continue to be strangled by an overvalued dollar circulating in insufficient quantities . </insist.v.38><insist.v.39>Third , you have to respect your companion 's culture. It 's not 100 about what makes YOU comfortable or empowered; it matters how the guy feels as well. Many men still feel obligated - and honored - to pick up the tab , especially on a first date , and it does n't mean they see you as incapable , vulnerable , or because they expect you to sleep with them. If you come out of left field ( in their view ) insisting to pay , it can cause confusion , awkwardness , an irritation - all the things you want to avoid not only in social settings but especially on a date ! You can always insist on paying for the next meal or picking up the movie tickets; but sometimes it 's the only polite thing to allow him to pay if he 's insisting ( esp if he 's from the South or basically any other culture outside the US ) . </insist.v.39><insist.v.40>Blair , moreover , appears to be sticking by the Niger uranium allegation despite the White House retraction , insisting that it was based on sources besides the forged letters.

But the communal attacks have also taken innocent lives just like terrorists are doing. Bardhan insisted that politics and religion must be firmly kept separated. Lambasting the bogey of conversion being used as a justification of anti-Christian attacks , he said the constitution of India allows voluntary conversion but not any forced conversion or any so called reconversion by force. The CPI leader said the real fight is to defend our secular fabric , of which a part is the fight for protection of the minorities.

What was at issue was whether the brain was self-sufficient and operated on a purely physical basis or whether mind could intervene in its operations so as to ensure one overt action rather than another. Determinists insisted that the brain was a machine and so mental events could have no influence on behaviour , they were mere 'epiphenomena.

Pa was adept at meeting that need , but he was n't herethanks to me , Adam reminded himself. Determined to fill Pa 's shoes as best he could , he began quietly stroking Joe 's temple , humming a lullaby he 'd sung when his brother was still of an age to appreciate such nighttime crooning , waiting for the sedative to take effect . </insist.v.62><insist.v.63>In other words Paul tells Titus to insist on or stress the true gospel , Christian living , doing good works and so changing pagan Crete which are all excellent and profitable for everyone.

The whole point of the canon is to defend itself , to insist that countervailing evidence justify itself in terms of the canonical idea. So , when the ostensibly less-meritorious minorities did well , it must be attributable to a further derogation of merit , namely favoritism in later life. Canonical ideas resist change , insist that new evidence be interpreted in light of them , a near-impossible task for the proponent of social change.

Insight editors insist their source was the Clinton campaign . </insist.v.67><insist.v.68>The President 's drive for support has been vastly complicated by antiwar sentiment , especially in Europe. France and Germany , backed by Russia and China , insist that Bush needs a second U.N. vote before using force. Even British Prime Minister Tony Blair , America 's strongest ally , prefers , but will not likely demand , a second vote. " What is very clear from all of our polls is a profound distrust of Washington -- and Bush in particular , " says Peter Kellner , chairman of London-based pollster YouGov Ltd . </insist.v.68><insist.v.69>One of the issues that proved particularly divisive in the late-2008 discussions was a US-led initiative for sectoral agreements , leading to the elimination or near-elimination of tariffs on certain industrial products. The US in particular insisted that China , India and Brazil agree to sign up to sectoral agreements for products such as chemicals , electronics and industrial machinery , something that the three developing countries refuse to do. While the EU has previously been an advocate for sectoral agreements , the EU was surprisingly lukewarm in its backing of the US initiative. EU officials said that they preferred to focus on ensuring deeper cuts in the overall formula for reducing tariffs rather than concentrating on a handful of sectors , given the diversity of European industry . </insist.v.69><insist.v.70>If you kept going you 'd be guilty of what they call in poker of Throwing Good money after bad , or the Gamblers Fallacy.

It is rather ironic that the whole nation applauded the successful execution of the GSM auction in January this year , as people knew it would pave the way for serious private sector involvement in the provision of telecommunication facilities. Yet on the other hand we continue to advocate that the government should provide us with electricity , transport and roads. And at the same time we insist the government or the Central Bank has a responsibility to maintain macro-economic stability. However , under the prevailing circumstances , I am afraid this would not be possible . </insist.v.71><insist.v.72>On the other side of the fence , the Republicans in 1980 were saying , " Vote Republican for a change. " They talked about a " new beginning. " They said the " New Deal " was out of date , that Keynesian economics was passe'. Maybe so. But all this is true if we have good evidence , not because of age. If the New Deal is wrong , it is not wrong because it is old. Let us insist on straight thinking and make all our candidates give us relevant evidence for their ideas and programs . </insist.v.72><insist.v.73>It 's striking that the fecklessness of the U.N. and the treachery of the French draw so many yawns from establishment commentators and politicians. They much prefer to complain about Bush. These voices are far more sophisticated than the crude Bush-equals-Hitler level of commentary established at antiwar rallies and marches. Lately they just insist that Bush talks too much about God , has a Manichaean sense of good versus evil , and lacks a proper sense of ambivalence and complexity . </insist.v.73><insist.v.74>Organizers had been careful to insist throughout that the process was designed to represent the concerns of those who had had the opportunity to participate and had chosen to do so. Realistically they had concluded that the Detroit assembly could only be composed of people named by the bishops , along with a minority of delegates from national organizations. The most striking fact gathered from a questionnaire of those who attended the Detroit conference was that 64 percent of those who responded were employed by the church. As one commentator noted , the assembly was representative of the church 's " middle management " and of those priests , sisters , and lay people most active at the level of the diocese . </insist.v.74><insist.v.75>The political backlash against Roe v. Wade reaches its height as the Eighties begin. From 1983 on , during the three terms of Presidents Reagan and Bush , the US Solicitor General will routinely urge the Supreme Court , on behalf of the federal government , to abandon Roe v. Wade entirely. Also , when appointing Supreme Court Justices , Reagan and Bush will use opposition to Roe as a litmus test; Justices O'Connor , Scalia , Kennedy , Souter , and Thomas do not support the " strict scrutiny " standard of review established by Roe. The annual rate of legal abortions , which had steadily increased from 1973 until 1985 , now levels off. Then , in 1986 , the keeping-my-baby meme appears in pop culture. All of a sudden , instead of insisting that their lovers , pregnant with an unwanted child , get abortions , male TV characters insist that their lovers keep the baby; or else pregnant single women decide their baby will be OK without a father , and go it alone. The meme is a puzzler for liberals and conservatives alike. Should liberals who want teens to have access to contraception and abortion criticize single mothers ? Should conservatives who want teens to be abstinent until marriage applaud girls who do n't have abortions ? </insist.v.75><insist.v.76>Ron Mossad takes on the conspiracy theorists who are sure it was the Jooz that attacked the World Trade Center. This time it 's a chemistry teacher that 's sure nano-thermite was the method used to ignite the buildings to a high enough heat to destroy the structure. What remains a mystery is how , when the culprits are known the Saudis who learned to fly a plane but not how to land it and the planes crashing into the building were witnessed by anyone owning a TV set , it is still the Jews who are blamed. But why stop there ? In conspiracy-think , there was no Holocaust. Or it was greatly exaggerated. And the recent stock market and housing market crash ? Maybe you think it was the politicians who forced the banks to lend to people who could n't afford the homes they bought. Maybe you think it 's groups like ACORN that used " the people " to persuade the politicians to insist the banks make risky loans. Maybe you think it was the bankers who saw a way to make a lot of money. The conspiracy theorists know better they know it 's the Jews . </insist.v.76><insist.v.77>These early apprehensions were reinforced by the actual course of the Lausanne negotiations. By January 1923 , the conference was deadlocked. The Turkish representives insisted on their National Pact , and the Allies refused the Turkish demands categorically. The outstanding questions were the treatment of minorities , the Capitulations , the freedom of the Straits , the disposal of Western thrace , and Mosul. The uncompromising attitude was not only on the Turkish side; the French delegation insisted upon the Capitulations , and upon full repayment of Turkey ' s foreign debts. Lord Curzon warned the Turkish delegation sternly that if they did not do as he told them he would go right home , or otherwise punish them. The Turks courteously replied that they were sorry , but they could not agree . </insist.v.77><insist.v.78> I think is a fundamental departure and a great achievement and if it sounds as though I am being immoderately immodest , well I plead guilty. I want to signal that there is a commitment on the part of government for this to take place on an annual basis. Formally let me say that this national consultation process signals that we in government are changing the way that we make policy. We are indicating , we are heralding , a fundamental change of approach. We ' re doing this because we want and insist that government policy be directly relevant to the needs and desires of the people. </insist.v.78><insist.v.79>The fathers look upon the Bible above all as the Book of God , the single work of a single author. This does not mean , however , that they reduce the human authors to nothing more than passive instruments; they are quite capable , also , of according to a particular book its own specific purpose. But their type of approach pays scant attention to the historical development of revelation. Many fathers of the church present the " Logos , " the Word of God , as author of the Old Testament and in this way insist that all Scripture has a Christological meaning . </insist.v.79><insist.v.80>As the 44th president of the United States , you should work to make American government open government. A movement began in Texas in 2006 where the governor and state comptroller put all government spending online with a proper search engine. The governor of Indiana posts the entire language of all state contracts. Washington should do the same and you should insist on this level of transparency from any entity that receives government funding : states , counties , NGOs , and frankly any foreign government or entity that receives foreign aid . </insist.v.80><insist.v.81>And I thought he looked robotic; his voice hummed. He seemed like one of those Animatronic U.S. Presidents at Magic Kingdom. I remember , years ago , when I was a paper boy , I got into a fight with one of my customers , who insisted that I had given him too little change. I was sure that he was trying to cheat me , and I said so. We argued for quite a while , and I got quite belligerent. Finally , the man shrugged and gave up. When I got home , we went over my collections and found that the man was right , I had cheated him. My parents made me go over to his house , return the money and apologize ( while they watched ) . I did. And I remember my bland and empty voice sounded much like Tiger Woods ' voice on Friday. I thought it was telling that Tiger Woods ' mother was in the front row ... his was the sort of apology that you give with a parent watching . </insist.v.81><insist.v.82>Similarly , the writer of Hebrews is warning against those who were continuing to insist on the externals , such as dietary rituals. And not only were they insisting on dietary rules , they were teaching that those foods somehow produced holiness. Just like the Pharisees , they neglected the " weightier matters " , or I should say they neglected the WEIGHTIEST matterGod 's grace . </insist.v.82><insist.v.83>I always offer and insist to pay my half; some guys have paid for the whole thing , and others have paid for their half. As for the whoever asked pays , well , I ' m way too shy to ask so I don ' t have that problem. I love to treat others , especially friends and family , and would love to do the same on a date; but most guys in my experience don ' t like it if the girl picks up the whole tab. From what I ' ve learned , there are two options : a ) guys pays for the whole thing and b ) 50/50. c ) girls pays for the whole thing doesn ' t happen . </insist.v.83><insist.v.84>As for clauses which insist that the company name is not mentioned at all in the review , that is so preposterous that we will show up such flagrant oppression against free speech in public as a warning to others to not be so silly ! How would film reviewers react if the trademark owners of Harry Potter insisted " you shall not mention the word " Harry " or the word " Potter " in any of your film reviews " ? ! Fortunately most companies have more sense than to insist on this kind of thing , although at one time Interflora could be seen missing out at the page of Florists because of such a faulty assumption ( see at end of the Florists page ) . </insist.v.84><insist.v.85>On the one hand , the Church condemns race hatred in general and hatred of the Redeemer ' s race in particular. On the other hand , the Church insists , as we have seen , on the duty of combating naturalism in public and private life and approves of love of native land and extols true supernatural patriotism. We have the right and the duty to defend our country and our nation against the unjust aggression of another nation. This duty is still more strongly urged upon us when it is a question of our country ' s fidelity to Christ the King. We must , therefore , combat naturalism in general always and everywhere , and we must be vigilant in regard to the naturalism of the Jewish nation in particular. The tireless energy with which His own nation pursues the elimination of the influence of the supernatural life is doubly painful to our Lord ' s Sacred Heart. The combat against naturalism in general and , therefore , against the organised naturalism of the Jewish nation , is urged upon us , for example , by Pope Leo XIII ( Tametsi , 1900 ) and Pope Pius XI ( Quas Primas , 1925 , and Quadragesimo Anno , 1931 ) . </insist.v.85><insist.v.86>The leaders of the Jewish race have a terrible responsibility. St. Thomas insists ( IIIa P.Q. 47 , a. 6 ad 1 ) , that the excusing words of our Lord : Father , forgive them for they know not what they do ( St. Luke XXII , 34 ) were uttered on behalf of the common people , but not on behalf of the leaders of the Jews. Not only have they formed the ordinary people of their race to consider the idea of Our Lord being the Messias promised to their fathers as absolutely absurd , but they keep them in strict subjection. Pogroms in which the rank-and-file of the Jewish nation suffer serve the useful purpose of keeping them in absolute dependence on their leaders.

Despite the letters and Montano 's own admission that he delivered Amari 's proposal to Malaca ang , the President insists he did not deal with Montano.

How can we expect the government to carefully track its contractors when the it ' s own financial statements are a disaster ?

Then he rallied : Painting is fortunately an old man ' s occupation.

" but just because caring work is not self-seeking does not mean one should be penalised for doing it. Crittenden notes that " maternal love makes every woman a slave " .3 recently we saw the emergence of the neo-liberal right who would insist that raising children is a personal lifestyle choice. " If you want children , you pay. Why should I pay for your children ? " is their attitude . </insist.v.101><insist.v.102>Atheists will doubtless maintain that any public religion at all -- like ''under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance -- excludes them by endorsing the idea of religion generally. But this misses the point : it is an interpretive choice to feel excluded by other people 's faiths , and the atheist , like any other dissenter from a majoritarian decision , can just as easily adhere to his own views while insisting on his full citizenship. So long as no one is coerced into invoking God , it makes little sense to accommodate the atheist 's scruples by barring everyone else from saying words that he alone finds to be metaphysically empty. Complete subjective inclusion is impossible , so if our goal is to include as many people as possible , we need to reach as widely as possible by letting the ordinary democratic process take its course. The Jehovah 's Witnesses , who in the 1940 's fought for the right not to salute the flag , never insisted that the salute or the pledge should be abolished altogether -- they just wanted their children to be exempt from a mandatory ritual that violated their consciences and hence their religious liberty . </insist.v.102><insist.v.103>The incorrigible diachrony captured in both Derrida 's term and in Lacan 's " insistence " of meaning not only challenges traditional conceptions of signification as a process of reference and equivalence between the signifier and the signified ( let alone the sign and the referent ) , but also harbours the profoundly temporal nature of the signifying chain : " the signifying chain ' which subsumes the language of the unconscious and the language of ordinary speech , is by definition always on the move towards a desired future [ ] its temporality seem [ s ] oddly smooth and characterless pure ' displacement , pure ' continuity , a slippage or a passage that moves ahead with unstoppable fluency " ( Bowie 179 ) . So tightly bound up with temporal movement is the signifying chain that any attempt to characterise the glissement of signifiers over signifieds immediately evokes a correlative movement through time. Indeed , the only amendment that I would make to Bowie 's characterisation of this correlation is that Lacan 's conception of the inherent temporality of signification is not necessarily a movement " ahead. " Rather , while Lacan certainly does insist on the inescapably temporal quality of the signifying chain , he does not hold that this temporality must proceed in a given direction : </insist.v.103><insist.v.104>We can look ahead to months of Obama deflecting McCain ' s onslaughts on him as a starry eyed peacenik by insisting that what the beleagured Empire above all needs is efficiency , ruthless if necessary.

Citing Bush 's M.B.A. from Tulane University , Denver insiders contend that he had to be aware of his own vulnerability to the go-go bankers and developers with whom he dealt. More significantly , they insist that Bush did not fall innocently into the clutches of the shrewd operators.

The only type of Witchcraft punished harshly in the Middle Ages was harmful magick Medievals focused on what you did with your magick. To them , it did n't really matter whether you killed someone with a spell or a sword. Either way , you were a murderer. All this changed in the 14th century when Christian theologians began to diabolize Witchcraft , to insist that there was no such thing as a neutral or non-heretical Witch. Under these new theories , Witches were n't simply people with unusual powers : they were Satanists who traded their souls to the Devil in exchange for worldly power . </insist.v.109><insist.v.110>Officials in Berlin 's foreign ministry insist that Bush 's choice to make Europe his first foreign destination of his second administration is a " sign of the particular value " he places on trans- Atlantic relations.

He will also be having private meetings with each member of the triumvirate that opposed him on Iraq -- Schroeder , Jacques Chirac of France and Vladimir Putin of Russia.

She also judges harshly any weaknesses she detects in others , as she does in Praed , who expresses an " anxiety to please her " when they first meet. Her severest judgment , however , is leveled against her mother. She mistrusts her motives , insisting that her mother " has rather a trick of taking me by surprise to see how I behave myself when she 's away.

Although the employer refused the unions ' request to bargain jointly on a companywide basis , the Board found that the unions never abandoned their goal of a companywide master contract; the Board found that the unions ' demands for a most favored nations clause , a limited no-strike provision , common contract expiration dates , and simultaneous settlement of all contracts , although otherwise mandatory subjects of bargaining , showed the unions ' nonmandatory objective of enlarging the unit without the employer ' s consent.

The first is that we end up endorsing a best case scenario in which we try to mediate the definition of national interest in such a way that it effects the least harm  that we engage in a politics that encourages a softer form of imperialism , without taking on the tenets of imperialism as such. A second danger is that we succumb to the policy worldview in which groups like the Minga of Resistance are conflated with identities or sectors that are imagined to compete with the identities and interests of national states. Although it is important to insist that policy makers meet the demands of indigenous organizations and respect their cultural and territorial rights , it is less easy to figure out how to make policy makers understand that movements like the minga are not just a gaggle of special interests , but people who are actively redefining the landscape of both politics and policy making . </insist.v.125><insist.v.126>Thus even granted that we may bring about treaty revision by entering the war , we shall assuredly be obliged some day to forego the revision as a result of this very participation.

Should Germany and Austria , instead of agreeing to the post-ponement of indemnity payments and the revision of treaties , insist on enforcing the original treaties , Britain , France and their Allies will probably break their promises. Since there exists the principle of equal share of interests , any policy which China may try to carry out must have the approval of all the foreign Powers and the opposition of any one country to that policy will effectively block any action. Accordingly , when China desires to accomplish any project , she must avoid antagonizing the totality of the Treaty Powers.

Doubts , which are frequently a part of faith development , at times lead to further study and renewed convictions. The academic world provides intellectual stimulation and helpful resources for those who want to explore their religious tradition. There is a growing interest in religious studies and an increase in programs and courses around the country. Some public institutions have excellent departments or programs in religious studies that demonstrate that this can be done legally and according to proper academic standards. Today , within the academic community a few voices are heard insisting that a well-educated person should have a knowledge of religion. At some institutions , campus ministry has produced excellent programs in theological studies that supplement the offerings in the curriculum through a wide variety of credit and noncredit courses , seminars , and lectures. The faculty members and students who have achieved a more mature appropriation of their faith provide important witness on campus and are a sign of hope in the struggle against religious illiteracy . </insist.v.134><insist.v.135>Dave told Rachel she was over-reacting to Mac 's inability to punish Iris because of how she feels about Mac 's resentment toward her sculpting.

Intellectual pursuits often have no discernible practical ends , in the ordinary use of the concept , nor are they achievable in a strictly linear or cause and effect process. The life of the intellect insists on dialectical reasoning , and the consideration of alternatives , rather than pronouncements. Intellectual work takes a very long time. It calls for the exaltation of emotions and ideas , neither of which are definable in terms of dollars , or specific value as commodities. Above all , it challenges the status quo. As a consequence , intellectuals are often labeled with every quality that is anathema to utilitarians. They 're called dreamers , " out of step , " and " non-conformists.

( 193 ) It was easier to publish the decree than to enforce it. The tribunal of Seville , June 12 , 1819 , represented to the Suprema its perplexities arising from the influx of Jews at Algeciras , Cadiz and Seville , who came to the tribunal begging for baptism. They were indigent beggars and probably fugitive criminals but , as occasionally there might be one whose object was really salvation , to deprive him of this would be a heavy burden on the conscience , and consequently the tribunal asked for instructions. ( 194 ) This resulted in an order of the inquisitor-general , July 10th , to all the tribunals , insisting on the strict enforcement of the decrees of 1786 and 1802; such Jews as obtained a royal licence were to be vigilantly watched and , if the secular officials manifested lack of zeal in cooperation , the inquisitor-general was to be notified.

This assumption appears to echo the claim to superior status made in earlier years by the Scotch Masons ' ( see p. 39 ) , and its presence in the Charter , besides strengthening any supposition that the earlier rite was related to the later one , may help us to arrive at an answer to a difficult question : how came it about that the new Grand Chapter , with no experience of esoteric Installation , was so soon to insist on a Past Master qualification in its Candidates ?

The just war tradition presumes what is widely accepted in modern societies , that civilians may never kill other civilians , except in self-defense , and even then only as a last resort. By articulating requirements upon a just war , ancient and medieval thinkers affirmed as the default position that it is wrong to kill , and that exceptions to this rule must be justified. Specifically , the jus ad bellum conditions require that war be publicly declared by a legitimate authority with right intention as a last resort with a reasonable chance for success and for a just cause sufficiently grave to warrant recourse to deadly force. Once justly waged , a war remains just ( jus in bello ) only so long as non-combatants ( including prisoners of war and soldiers who surrender ) are treated as immune from attack , and the means deployed are not disproportionate to the moral end to be achieved . </insist.v.160><insist.v.161>If the current fiscal conditions affecting the states -- and higher education -- continue , it is very likely that public concerns about the affordability of higher education will intensify. A similar situation occurred in the early 1990s , when tuition at public colleges and universities rose dramatically in many states. A public backlash against these increases emerged , leading to tuition freezes in several states and to tuition rollbacks in others. The backlash also prompted lawmakers -- in the states and at the federal level -- to create new and to enhance existing tax breaks that help the middle class pay for college. Surveys show that the public understands the need for education and training beyond high school. If recent experience is a reliable guide , the public is likely to insist that government and higher education leaders find ways to maintain access to affordable higher education . </insist.v.161><insist.v.162>* In 1952 , Lucille Ball gave birth to her second child , Desi Arnaz , Jr. Ball and Desi Arnaz wrote the pregnancy into " I Love Lucy "; Ball gave birth in real life on the same day that her Lucy Ricardo character gave birth.

Insisting that a gestational mother must consent after the child 's birth would likely discourage such procedures.229 But while this may be an explanation , it does not justify ignoring the maternal affiliation of the birth mother and of the child. It is problematic to ignore the legal status of the birth mother in order allow men to fulfill a commandment. There is significant precedent for putting less emphasis on this commandment in order to preserve the honor and status of the women concerned.230 Authorities have cautioned men against divorcing their wives to fulfill the commandment , in deference to their wives ' feelings.231 Similar consideration might be applicable in the case of surrogate motherhood , where the status of the birth mother is denigrated . </insist.v.182><insist.v.183>It is important to bear in mind how new the consensus about the role of religion in a liberal democracy is , because the relative newness of the idea should serve as a caution against insisting with puritanical rigidity on an ideal model of liberal democracy , one that risks alienating the many citizens who are deeply religious and who would be inclined to abandon the project altogether if it were in irreconcilable conflict with their religious commitments. But we must be equally certain not to overestimate the resilience of liberal democracy , and to think that small , incremental departures from principle will not cumulatively harm the public weal . </insist.v.183><insist.v.184>Caesar has his scribe thrown overboard , insisting that history will never report that he went to Ireland.

One is strongly reminded of a remark made to the distinguished historian , Cardinal Pitra , at Vienna in 1889.

According to The Nation , similar labor provisions in a trade agreement with Jordan in 2000 were largely ignored. " In fact , Jordan has easily evaded what were thought -- even by labor activists -- to be solid protections in that agreement. If Pelosi is fighting for a genuinely progressive agreement , she should insist that Bush commit himself to the same strong labor/enviro rules for the stalled Doha round of the World Trade Organization negotiations.

But as we just saw , Krugman insists that the Fed can do more once rates hit zero. They can engage in QE. And both Krugman and Eggertsson insist the Fed can still engage in inflation targeting.

And the satisfaction would be compromised , replaced with a sense of extreme irritation at the lack of respect for the concept of tennis. The game would never start because there would be too many arguments about what sort of game was being played. And that was precisely what Icke was doing. What is tennis ? Whatever you want it to be. He was demanding the physical world be reconstructed , that this bodily existence be amended somehow , that the limitations that defined the game of life had to be disregarded , the terms of incarnation renegotiated , and that the whole excitement of living on this material plane be agitated to the point of extreme discomfort.

Michael Novak went furthest , insisting that the program should provide the Catholic people with the opportunity to set their own agenda for justice. By now the movement of the committee was clearly away from Hehir 's emphasis on the product - an organized agenda for institutional reflection - and toward process and participation. At a two-day meeting in April , Novak further proposed that the title of the program be " Liberty and Justice for All , " and that it be organized around social " organisms " which he named as church , family , neighborhood , ethnicity and race , personhood , nationhood , and humankind ( later work was added to these topics ) . The procedure would involve grass-roots participation through parish discussions , aided by a study guide prepared under the committee 's sponsorship , and regional hearings at which panels of bishops would take testimony from experts and ordinary Catholics. The results of this consultative process , the committee agreed , would be gathered into a set of preliminary recommendations to be considered by the 1976 conference , which would be as representative as possible . </insist.v.214><insist.v.215>To my astonishment , Bacon was warm , communicative and hospitable.

The sense of mortality was reinforced by the ghostly presence of William Blake ' s glacial life mask , perched on the desk like a warning. But Bacon himself exuded energy , gesticulating forcefully while he talked. What I ' m after is a seizure of life , he declared , before insisting that he wanted to make things as raw as possible . He aimed to paint a nose with all the violence of a real nose . But his vision of life was complex. At one extreme , he told me : I ' m essentially optimistic , always grateful when I wake up each morning and discover I ' m alive.

And , although it is almost wholly abolished ( for they do not dip the whole children , but only pour a little water on them ) , they ought , nevertheless , to be wholly immersed , ... . for that the etymology of the word seems to demand. " Again , he says that baptism does not simply represent washing for sins , but " is rather a sign both of death and resurrection.

To take an obvious example of a bargaining chip , Israel wants to be a full member of the Western and Others regional group ( WEOG ) throughout the UN system. Recently this past April , European Union members in particular prevented Israel from joining in WEOG meetings at the Commission on Human Rights. There are other similar configurations for UN-based Geneva bodies whose membership is largely controlled by the European Union.

Having thus in mind a law of right distinct from , and perhaps , opposed to benevolence , what frightful conduct may not this philosophy lead to ? This is indeed the law of fanaticism. The tendency of this philosophy is illustrated in the spirit of many reformers , who are bitterly contending for the right , which , after all , is to do nobody any good . </insist.v.239><insist.v.240>One guy introduced to me as Awie and told me to open my bonnet , he told me his partner named Osman was a former askar and that he works part-time as a mechanic , checked and told me my timing belt was broken and he need to call the toll truck , but since he did n't bring his handphone can he call from mine , he took the number from the the toll card and called , about 15-20 minutes later the Tow Line truck appeared , the two guys told the tow truck men that my car 's timing belt was broken and that they stopped by to help , the tow truck guys than placed the cone and the two Malays guys left saying that that towing truck will take me to Maran workshop and they will wait for me , when I told them I prefer to go to Kuantan they kept insisting that since they called the towing truck will need to charge me $ 100.00 per kilometer . </insist.v.240><insist.v.241>Truman always accepted personal responsibility for the bomb decision. In his memoirs , however , he states that the Interim Committee chaired by Stimson recommended that " the bomb be used against the enemy as soon as it could be done ... .without specific warning and against a target that would clearly show its devastating strength. " This decision was supported by the scientific advisors to the committee and , Truman insists , by not only British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , but also by Truman 's own " top military advisors. " But , Truman adds , " The final decision of where and when to use the atomic bomb was up to me. Let there be no mistake about it. I regarded the bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubt that it should be used. " [ 27 ] Truman made the same point in a 1948 letter to his sister Mary : " On that trip coming home [ from Potsdam ] I ordered the Atomic Bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The concept of an apotropos , ( legal guardian ) , who has legal responsibility for the child and legal authority over the property of the minor is discussed in The Talmud.245 However , the child maintains his biological identity and natural rights and responsibilities as pertain to the child of natural parents. This apotropos is similar to the formulation of the adoptive parent provided in the Israeli adoption law , except that adoption is arranged in advance as opposed to a de facto apotropos. Since rabbinic authorities have already accepted this form of adoption , and since similar arrangements were valid under Jewish law , there is room for rabbinic authorities to insist that adoption occur in the gestational surrogate motherhood. Such insistence would validate the surrogate mother 's status and give her the leverage of having to agree to the transfer upon the child 's birth , which would go far to prevent exploitation and violation of her status and rights as the natural mother . </insist.v.243><insist.v.244>Q. 30 Why do the authorities insist on disclosure of relevant facts and circumstances to be fully and truely set forth in the instrument ? </insist.v.244><insist.v.245>Bacon , widely regarded as Britain 's greatest painter of the figure , aimed to inherit a place in the pantheon beside Michelangelo , Vel zquez and Rembrandt.

Yet despite his extraordinary innovation and recasting of the human form , he can not be seen as a true modernist. He was , for most of his career , sidelined by the American critics , who saw him as too figurative , too narrative , and too concerned with European art history and Christian iconography.

" </insist.v.248><insist.v.249>On the other hand , the passage indicates a man who marries a woman who was scripturally put away because she committed fornication also commits adultery. The reason is he is marrying someone who is already guilty of fornication and was " put away " for it. They become " one flesh " and consequently share the guilt. If a man unscripturally puts away his wife , many today will insist the woman , who has NOT committed fornication , ca n't remarry without her and her new husband both committing adultery and use this verse as a " proof text , " but Christ is here referring to only the guilty party in both cases. The man who remarries after causing an unscriptural divorce is an adulterer and his new wife an adulteress , and the guilty woman who was put away because of fornication commits adultery with the one she marries. Only the guilty are considered adulterers or adulteresses; the innocent are not " under bondage " ( 1 Cor. 7 : 15 ) . </insist.v.249><insist.v.250> The shake-ups on Wall Street have just begun , warns Barr.

Those who do not learn are at the mercy of chance events , but those who learn and benefit from the arts can avoid chance misfortunes ( though not necessary ones such as death ) . Hard work is best for a person , for indulgence leads to susceptibility to the relaxing pleasures that damage the soul and so are followed by pain , while work leads one to have another constitution , which seeks by preference pleasures of the more long-lived sort that is not followed by pain. The person who learns , then , not only acquires individual technical skills so that those ills that occur by chance become avoidable , but comes to have wisdom , and so prefers and maintain the hardened , cheerful soul that does not give way to extreme bodily pleasure. In these ethical views , and the rejection of the relativism of Protagoras , Democritus seems to be followed by Socrates . </insist.v.259><insist.v.260>The McCain camp insists that Mrs. McCain will face the public and the press again.

The widespread belief in the necessity of a " self-defense " rationale for killing explains why " humanitarian " military missions are often regarded with suspicion by both the populace and military personnel. Since , by definition , self-defense is self-referential , non-interventionists regard missions such as NATO 's 1999 attack upon Kosovo as illegitimate , at best officious and at worst immoral. Of course , cynics about particular conflicts often insist that , during wartime , the self-interest of a nation masquerades as a moral cause weighty enough to justify the annihilation of innocent people.

His charge and others led to an important argument with the Wall Street Journal. The journal maintained in their editorials that big profits were essential to further exploration , and that oil prices should be allowed to rise in the free market to the level where they would reduce demand and stimulate extra production : 'In our view , elasticity of demand is the key to the immediate problem'. Jackson insisted that higher oil prices would not , at least in the short run , produce extra supplies. ( See ( specially ) Wall Street Journal , March 13 , 1974. ) It was a variant of the old argument between oil economists surveying the history since Rockefeller : was oil a special exception , an industry which was not self-adjusting ? In the event , Jackson proved more justified than the journal : the higher prices failed to stimulate much extra production , or to discourage consumption . </insist.v.281><insist.v.282>8.

But when you consider the people who give them you realize that it is love that beats , wickedness that caresses. This is what I insist upon : human actions can only be understood by their root in love. All kinds of actions might appear good without proceeding from the root of love. Remember , thorns also have flowers : some actions seem truly savage , but are done for the sake of discipline motivated by love. Once and for all , I give you this one short command : love , and do what you will. If you hold your peace , hold your peace out of love. If you cry out , cry out in love. If you correct someone , correct them out of love. If you spare them , spare them out of love.

And God has said , No. God refused the use of angels or heavenly visions or even men of reputation. He insisted on Moses. And now he was insisting on three days , and Moses knew that Pharaoh 's rejection of the in-historical claim of God would place Pharaoh on the wrong side of the battle in the heavens.

Berlin warned particularly against the use of violence. He acknowledged that the use of force was sometimes necessary and justified; but he also reminded his readers that violence has particularly volatile and unpredictable consequences , and tends to spiral out of control , leading to terrible destruction and suffering , and undermining the noble goals it seeks to achieve. He also stressed the dangers of paternalistic , or otherwise humiliating and disempowering , attempts to institute reform or achieve improvement , which had a tendency to inspire a backlash of hatred and resistance . </insist.v.289><insist.v.290>People often appeal to utilitarianism when retrospectively defending military actions such as Truman 's bombing of Hiroshima. However , utilitarian defenses of recourse to deadly force do not fare well when a broader time slice of history is considered. In addition , while most people seem to accept the distinctions between ( 1 ) natural and manmade disaster and ( 2 ) killing and letting die , these distinctions are untenable in the utilitarian picture. Military supporters are more than willing to forsake our ordinary distinction between killing and letting die when it comes to responding to the conduct of a criminal regime , often insisting that the use of deadly force is morally required. But rarely do military supporters so enthusiastically advocate the provision of life-sustaining resources to the people of other lands in crisis. Yet it is obvious that food , water , clothing , shelter and medicine tend to sustain the lives of people , in stark contrast to bombs , which terminate human lives and destroy the fruits of human labor. Although the epistemological problems with utilitarianism are ultimately insoluble , it can hardly be denied that the bombs are inherently destructive of life and property , while food , water , clothing , shelter and medicine are not . </insist.v.290><insist.v.291>Initially I gave Mr. Marsh the benefit of the doubt , assuming that we would be able to work it out and agreed to pay an extra 69.99 for the alignment as I could n't readily assert from my online confirmation where I had in fact been charged for the work because the confirmation email was not itemized in any fashion , but I got very frustrated when Mr. Marsh and another of the Sears mechanics tried to tack on more money for the tires I had already purchased by insisting that my vehicle required high pressure valve stems since they apparently had my truck listed as a GMC Sierra 2500 on the online confirmation , which would require the costly valve stems due to the extra weight of the vehicle; however , my vehicle is in fact NOT a GMC Sierra 2500 it is a GMC Sierra 1500 which does not require high pressure valve stems.

The girls were , of course , expected to pay for the dresses and shoes themselves ( $ 250 a fortune back in 1988 ) and to wear them happily , even though one of the bridesmaids was seven months pregnant and was miserable in high-heels . </insist.v.292><insist.v.293>I expect that I 'll be returning to this theme in future articles , because there 's so much more to explore.

Wolf talked all the time about not being fooled into thinking that a player would be fast enough to overcome a lack of size. So when he insists he advised Sherman to draft Morgan I believe him. I had heard NUMEROUS interviews with Wolf long before Mike Sherman showed up where Wolf belabored the point about erring on the side of size/strength versus raw speed. And all Reynolds brought to the table was his supposed " speed to the corner " . </insist.v.294><insist.v.295>" TSA has reviewed the circumstances related to the screening of a passenger with body piercings that occurred recently in Lubbock , Texas. It appears that the Transportation Security Officers involved properly followed procedures in that incident. They rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved.

One false move - and they are immediately sanctioned. The recent case of the sanctions imposed upon Dhanudara Swami are only the most recent example - but there are many. Only a week ago , Praghosa Das , the Irish devotee who monitors the Dandavats.com site - admitted to me by letter , that he accepted his initiation by our ex-sannyasi and " guru " godbrother Satsvarup prabhu - as having fully " connected him " to the Parampara as an " officiating acharya " and he saw no need to either seek out a new initiating guru nor discuss it openly in the pages of the Dandavats.com. He expressed that he had no desire to discuss this in the open forum but that in fact this was his understanding of his natural position. This is a serious problem. When a man - sees reality one way - but the pressure of his peers obliges him to pretend that reality is something else - he is basically forced to lie to himself and then to others . </insist.v.297><insist.v.298>Christians insisted that freedom must be exercised with reference to an objective moral code , a law higher than the emperor , or the sifting sands of public opinion. It was Christians who understood that choice , rightly exercised , meant always choosing what was right and that the freedom to exercise that choice brought with it an obligation and concern for the other. The Christian faith presented a coherent and compelling answer to the existential questions that plagued the ancients , such as why we existed and how we got here. What was the purpose of life ? Questions like how evil came into the world and why we could not always make right choices ? What force seemed to move us toward evil and how we could be set free from its power ? Christian philosophy began to flourish and the arts also flourished under the Christian worldview. Philosophies of government and economic theory began to be influenced by these principles derived from a Christian The Christian understanding of marriage and family is not some outdated notion of a past era but the framework for a future of true freedom.

The American people want to know why oil companies are making soaring profits ... The American people want to know if this so-called energy crisis is only a pretext , a cover to eliminate the major source of price competition ... ' He was soon able to humiliate the company men. Exxon had foolishly insisted that many questions including how many filling stations they owned , involved 'proprietary information'. Jackson lashed back : 'I am just frankly flabbergasted ' , he repeated three times , until the unhappy Exxon expert , Roy Baze , eventually revealed the number ( 9 , 145 ) . When Jackson asked for the company profits for the first nine months of 1973 , Baze could not give the answer , and Jackson himself picked up the telephone to ask the stockbrokers . </insist.v.303><insist.v.304>Regarding the future status of Kosovo , he said no unilateral action could change the current status of Kosovo as laid down in resolution 1244. The international community must insist on the policy of standards , before status. No status issues could be discussed before the benchmarks were met. One of the benchmarks was the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade. That dialogue must not be confused with the status question , he said . </insist.v.304><insist.v.305>Let us take India , for example. There we should insist on the perspective that the Indian working class lead the peasant masses in the overthrow of the bourgeois power dominated by the Congress Party.

The mood in his mail was terrible-he said he would lose his job if we refused to send this balance. In order to resolve the matter again , another amount of USD889.00 ( HK $ 6893.00 which including HK $ 362 for handling charges and 20 addition to prevent any currency change anomalies in his country ) was sent to Contact A through Western Union on 17 Dec 2003 . </insist.v.306><insist.v.307>For example , it is not hard to imagine a scenario like this : Supported by up-to-the-minute research , a company suggests basing an application for accelerated approval on Surrogate A. The FDA agrees. But before the drug comes in for formal review , an article is published casting doubt on the value of Surrogate A and suggesting the use of Surrogate B instead. Despite the considerable resources a company has spent on data analysis -- and despite the FDA 's earlier encouragement -- we may now insist that a new analysis be undertaken using Surrogate B. Patients and physicians will not get the answers they want when they want them.

When asked about the agency 's role in the elections he admitted in an interview with a Karachi-based monthly magazine that " only conditions were created that were favourable to certain results ( in the elections ) . " If this is not election manipulation and rigging , what else it is ? For a long time he insisted that he did no wrong. To his credit , however , he recently admitted that what he did was a mistake . </insist.v.309><insist.v.310>But , with the rise of the blacks , who kicked the Afrikaners out of power in the early 1990s , the Afrikaners then pushed their way into the Anglo-Saxon domain of Mammon , and the English either emigrated , as stated before , or they got mystical. I was too poor and stubborn to emigrate , so I found God. The grim truth was that making money was absurdly difficult. Finding God was easier. It happened on my bed in East London , after the late night shift as a sub-editor at the Daily Dispatch , when I saw no future for myself in this country and insisted , in that reckless way of the fatalistic , that God grant me permission to disincarnate , since emigration was out of the question , and I said I was quite ready to die , if He decided to concur , but that I would not commit the mortal sin of taking my own life . </insist.v.310><insist.v.311>However , in a swift reaction , Chief Etiebet declared the suspension a nullity insisting that the ANPP does not recognize any group known as " stakeholders.

Most international lawyers will probably reject this claim and find the use of force illegal under the terms of the Charter. But even for international lawyers , insisting on formal legality in this case may be counterproductive. The better way to understand what has happened is that neither side can command a majority without a veto. By leaving well enough alone , both sides can continue to claim to have the better of the argument over how best to disarm Iraq . </insist.v.313><insist.v.314>In the case of divorce caused by death , there is no controversy.

Many of the problems outlined in Part II would never have occurred. Instead of licensing laws , physicians who deceived their patients about their training and experience or a pharmaceutical firm that made false claims about drug testing would have compensated those who were harmed. However , individuals and businesses would not be held liable for risks that the consumer agreed to take. People who chose to take a drug , even though the manufacturer warned that its side effects were unpredictable , would be unlikely to collect in case of injury.

I will try to offer and insist to pay every now and then but they just refuse and absolutely wo n't let us. If we order food to go and bring it to their house , they will sneak money in my purse or in my husbands jacket. They always say " one day you all will have more money than we do , you can pay then . . . but as long as we can afford it , we 're gon na do it !

President Clinton is pushing Syria to accept the Israeli position , which is essentially a case of moving the goal posts. In short , after years of criticizing Syria for refusing to accept 242 and 338 , the U.S. is now criticizing Syria for insisting on their full implementation . </insist.v.321><insist.v.322>Defenders of the inhumane institution of slavery used to employ an erroneous analogy comparing the slave to a child. Southern slaveholders insisted that a black man was just a child all of his life. Not even as an adult could he be trusted to accept adult responsibility.

Lacking mature self-control , the negro could never be granted the freedom of an ordinary citizen . </insist.v.322><insist.v.323>This 'demand ' has been a salient feature of the South African foreign policy debate within the epistemic community. Here , however , it is predicated on the belief that this community is well positioned to steer foreign policy in the 'right ' direction. More often than not , it complains that the government sidelines 'civil society ' in formulating foreign policy - by which it almost certainly means itself ! An examination of conference and workshop attendance registers would show that the epistemic community rarely engages citizens in discussions about foreign policy. The gatherings have become incestuous , and the failure to engage with the public is compensated for by regular newspaper articles - which seem unable to capture the public imagination. Champions of 'open ' decision-making therefore agree on the need for only a few cooks to avoid spoiling the broth - but insist on becoming one of the cooks . </insist.v.323><insist.v.324>Whatever else you have been told or may believe , the election of 2008 comes down to a choice between a more activist government and a less activist one. Because modern nations are very complex , and because their populations insist that government do things for them , we can not expect to see a truly limited government. Our choice Tuesday is one of degree , not kind . </insist.v.324><insist.v.325>Also , more recently , the Chilean government was deeply insulted when a Spanish judge sought to try former strongman Augusto Pinochet in a foreign court for crimes committed in Chile during the 1970s and 1980s. Chile rightfully insisted that Pinochet be tried in a domestic court. The Chilean government eventually succeeded in its bid. This marked a significant victory for the country 's fledgling democracy . </insist.v.325><insist.v.326>The major focus of Religious Right organizing has been to fan the flames of anti-choice extremists by insisting that the health care bills , which do not mention abortion , would require , in the words of one Concerned Women for America alert to activists , abortion on demand , unregulated and taxpayer funded. </insist.v.326><insist.v.327>Regions 20 and 21 submitted these Section 8 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and ( 3 ) cases for advice because they involve identical charges filed against different UNITE-HERE locals ( collectively , the Unions ) .

It seemed like it took 15 minutes to set up and a half hour to clean up for 10 minutes of painting. And it seemed like I should insist that if she wanted to paint that she be involved in setting and cleaning up. The result was she chose not to paint . </insist.v.328><insist.v.329>One lesson we can learn from pre-industrial peoples is the power of storytelling. I am struck by how important storytelling is among tribal peoples; it forms the basis of their educational systems. The Celtic peoples , for example , insisted that only the poets could be teachers. Why ? I think it is because knowledge that is not passed through the heart is dangerous : it may lack wisdom; it may be a power trip; it may squelch life out of the learners. What if our educational systems were to insist that teachers be poets and storytellers and artists ? What transformations would follow ? </insist.v.329><insist.v.330>You 're following the rules. Offer , and if he insists on paying ( which is the norm ) , say thank you and accept.

These are called field variables. You will , also , have to tell what the field is at this present moment , if you are to be able to see later what is going to happen. From the overall space-time view of the least action principle , the field disappears as nothing but bookkeeping variables insisted on by the Hamiltonian method . </insist.v.331><insist.v.332>Critics , though , insist the Bush Administration intentionally pushed the trial to Rock Island for several reasons. Mazon is Ecuadorian American but his skin tone could lead many to mistake him for an Arab American.

Frank refuses and scolds her for her newfound " sentimentality " in her attitude toward her mother. Vivie angrily declares that her previous attitude marked her as a " prig " and that she has now come to understand and appreciate her mother 's hardships. They continue to argue about Mrs. Warren 's character and Vivie 's continuing relationship with her until Frank turns romantic , calming Vivie with silly baby talk. Vivie succumbs to his lovemaking for a moment , admitting that she wants to forget about her mother but then abruptly snaps out of her romantic revelry , insisting they are being childish . </insist.v.333><insist.v.334>But the moment Engels moves beyond such aphoristic formulations he makes it quite obvious that the relationship between thought and its material conditions can not be reduced to simple reflection. Thus later in Ludwig Feuerbach , where Engels discusses philosophy and religion , he insists that these higher ideologies ... are still further removed from the material base and that the connection between ideas and their material conditions of existence becomes more and more complicated and more and more obscured by the intermediate links. [ 90 ] And he goes on to elaborate : </insist.v.334><insist.v.335>The Chemicals Ministry 's climb down from its earlier stand comes from the anticipation that the Ministry may find the going tuff in insisting on bringing all the 354 medicines under price control due to stiff resistance from the pharma industry. The industry argues that the government should monitor the prices of essential medicines instead of controlling it. Its argument goes that the market competition will act as a check on prices . </insist.v.335><insist.v.336>The numerous studies of the Egyptian lotus design are remarkably devoid of conflict , since this is one case in which nobody insists on a single definitive interpretation. The points emphasized are ( 1 ) the abstract nature of the symbol , containing meanings that are far from obvious at first glance; ( 2 ) the lotus as denoting high society , especially royal receptions , at which the presentation of a lotus to the host was obligatory and showed that the bearer had been invited; to be remiss in lotus courtesy was an unpardonable blunder , for anyone who refuses the lotus is under a curse; 244 ( 3 ) the lotus as the symbol of Lower Egypt , the Delta with all its patriotic and sentimental attachments; ( 4 ) the lotus as Nefertem , the defender of the border; ( 5 ) the lotus as the king , or ruler , defender , and nourisher of the land; ( 6 ) the lotus as the support of the throne at the coronation. It is a token of welcome and invitation to the royal court and the land , proffered by the king himself as guardian of the border . </insist.v.336><insist.v.337>The same difficulty appears in a grosser form when one receives a perfectly true reply , but insists on interpreting it so as to suit one 's desires. The vast majority of people who go to " fortunetellers " have nothing else in mind but the wish to obtain supernatural sanction for their follies. Apart from Occultism altogether , every one knows that when people ask for advice , they only want to be told how wise they are. Hardly any one acts on the most obviously commonsense counsel if it happens to clash with his previous intentions. Indeed , who would take counsel unless he were warned by some little whisper in his heart that he was about to make a fool of himself , which he is determined to do , and only wants to be able to blame his best friend , or the oracle , when he is overtaken by the disaster which his own interior mentor foresees ? </insist.v.337><insist.v.338>Theories abound on why the Tour abandoned a once-celebrated venue , but who 's to blame depends entirely on whom you ask. The Tour says it 's Westchester 's fault because the club 's members were too demanding and out of touch , insisting that they be allowed to continue to play tennis and golf in the middle of a $ 7 million Tour event. The club says the divorce is the Tour 's fault because the Tour kept asking for more , even as it was courting alternate courses. Either way , this week 's Barclays will not be held at Westchesterand most insiders believe the Tour will never be back . </insist.v.338><insist.v.339>In my view , the Nakba is none of these things , and the attempt to make this year the 60th anniversary of the Nakba 's life and death is a grave error. The Nakba is in fact much older than 60 years and it is still with us , pulsating with life and coursing through history by piling up more calamities upon the Palestinian people. I hold that the Nakba is a historical epoch that is 127 years old and is ongoing. The year 1881 is the date when Jewish colonization of Palestine started and , as everyone knows , it has never ended. Much as the world would like to present Palestinians as living in a post-Nakba period , I insist that we live thoroughly in Nakba times. What we are doing this year is not an act of commemorating but an act of witnessing the ongoing Nakba that continues to destroy Palestine and the Palestinians. I submit , therefore , that this year is not the 60th anniversary of the Nakba at all , but rather one more year of enduring its brutality; that the history of the Nakba has never been a history of the past but decidedly a history of the present . </insist.v.339><insist.v.340>This opportunity must be fully exploited and maximised if Africa is to extricate itself from the periphery and take centre stage in the global economy. For example , Africa must diversify its economy by identifying strategic niches and insisting on local beneficiation; negotiating better terms of trade at a bilateral and multilateral level as well as using its natural resources endowment as leverage in political and economic negotiations with international partners. However , for this to be effective Africa needs to adopt a more coordinated and integrated approach in its dealings , whether at bilateral or multilateral level. Unlike the Chinese and other major economies of this world that are backed up by strong political and economic clout , Africa ' s ability and capacity to leverage is rather limited . </insist.v.340><insist.v.341>It is something altogether other that I wish to attempt here as I turn or return to Marx. It is " something other " to the point that I will have occasion instead , and this will not be only for lack of time and space , to insist even more on what commands us today , without delay , to do everything we can so as to avoid the neutralising anaesthesia of a new theoreticism , and to prevent a philosophico-philological return to Marx from prevailing. Let us spell things out , let us insist : to do everything we can so that it does not prevail , but not to avoid its taking place , because it remains just as necessary. This will cause me , for the moment to give priority to the political gesture I am making here , at the opening of a colloquium , and to leave more or less in the state of a program and of schematic indications the work of philosophical exegesis , and all the " scholarship " that this " position-taking " today , still requires.96 </insist.v.341><insist.v.342>" Concentration and co-operation in industry in order to secure efficiency are a world-wide movement. The United States can not resist it. If we isolate ourselves and insist upon the subdivision of industry below the highest economic efficiency , and do not allow co-operation , we shall be defeated in the world 's markets. We can not adopt an economic system less efficient than our great competitors , Germany , England , France , and Austria. Either we must modify our present obsolete laws regarding concentration and co-operation so as to conform with the world movement , or else fall behind in the race for the world 's markets. Concentration and co-operation are conditions imperatively essential for industrial advance; but if we allow concentration and co-operation there must be control in order to protect the people , and adequate control is only possible through the administrative commission. Hence concentration , co-operation , and control are the key words for a scientific solution of the mighty industrial problem which now confronts this Nation.

He cited the Bakhurutshe who 'are in three sub-divisions on account of denominational quarrels. ' Tshekedi insisted that if the Anglicans could not be expelled from his Reserve then they must come and live in Serowe under his eye.

Quite a number of rabbis castigated the Union harshly in comments to the media , and then , after we complained about the unfairness of some of their charges , claimed to us that they had been misquoted.

My first order of business was to insist that Lanner , who , unsurprisingly , had not come to work that day , should either resign immediately from his position at NCSY or be fired by the end of the day.

The task of the rest of this section is to establish the proper interpretation of the cognitive side of faith. A clearer understanding of " belief that " is much more important for us today , primarily because of the rise of religious skepticism. For the biblical writers there was no doubt that God existed and that God had acted in history. Now that these claims are under attack , religious believers , especially those living within a scientific world-view , are tempted to prove their faith by extrabiblical means. Hick 's observation that cognitive fides has logical priority , but that fiducia comes first temporally is correct. People of faith , as Cantwell Smith has so brilliantly demonstrated , have rarely ever thought in explicit logical terms , so the virtual absence of cognitive fides in religious literature is not surprising. This silence , however , does not mean that faith has no epistemological dimension at all . </insist.v.354><insist.v.355>Many ( if not all ) of Darwin 's disciples regard his authority as apostolic.

Divorce is anything that dissolves a marriage , and if death does n't dissolve a marriage , what else could ?

In the second place the judicial functions of Chiefs and headmen in kgotla were to be replaced by a series of tribunals with no traditional backing. In both cases the Chief would lose much of his power.

Historically , the hollow grind has the highest value across many cultures. The deserving reputation is due to the difficulty of designing , constructing , grinding , and finishing the hollow grind accurately. If executed well , the hollow grind possesses the thinnest cross sectional area and allows a lower relief angle , smaller relief faces , and an overall sharper edge. As the edge is used up with repeated sharpenings , it remains thin , sometimes well into the midline of the blade , offering the greatest longevity of any knife grind. Because the blade steel is hollowed out , it leaves a fully thick spine supporting the blade for good strength , while reducing unnecessary weight. While it can be made thin and may not support heavy chopping , with careful planning , design , and execution by the knifemaker , can be made well enough for light chopping. For example , my military clients who require thin , sharp , but tough and strong blades for Combat Search and Rescue insist on hollow grinds. For investment knives and value retention and appreciation , the hollow grind is considered the most beautiful. It is a challenge to execute accurately and mirror finish well . </insist.v.366><insist.v.367>Last year , Blumenthal insisted that Pitter be removed from the school after being caught lying about his education and falsifying diplomas saying he had bachelor ' s and master ' s degrees from the University of West Indies.

Tarwater is not sick or crazy but really called to be a prophet a vocation I take seriously , though the modern reader is not likely to. " For O'Connor , Tarwater is not a parody of a religious fanatic. He is not a psychological study of a disturbed boy who plays out in his psychoses the indoctrination of his insane , controlling evangelical great-uncle. He is not a satirical portrait of an ill-educated boy from the backwater. He is , for O'Connor , a boy who first rejects , then hears and answers the call of God; he is a spokesperson for the Christian faith. Tarwater is someone who is aware of the truth of the divine. But how is a modern reader supposed to take this and Tarwater seriously ? Why does O'Connor think that using an unlikable redneck hero , exploring his tortured psyche , and describing his insane-seeming actions will point readers to the truths of the Christian faith ? </insist.v.368><insist.v.369>However , I could see another difference , besides all what I already mentioned : the insisting manners that lots of people would use towards us.

As for the justification saying Saddam was not threat or did not attack us. Countries Bill Clinton invaded didn ' t attack us either. That is the same argument the hard left is using to bash President Bush for invading Iraq. Granted , George Bush has made some mistakes in fighting this war , but at least he is trying to protect us.

Many separately incorporated day-care centers , job-training programs , hospitals , and welfare-service organizations may still display or insist on their religious purpose or inspiration , but that need not inhibit their cooperation with government as long as the organization agrees to internalize the distinction between the religious and the secular , between what is sectarian and what is nonsectarian. In the nineteenth century , Catholic schools were denied funding by public authorities who decided to fund only " nonsectarian " ( generally Protestant ) common schools. Eventually , however , Catholic school leaders went back to government to ask for funding for some of the " nonsectarian " or " secular " elements within their schools certain textbooks , lunches , school busing , and more. This frame of thought , you see , allows one to continue to think of religion as something quite narrow even if it somehow extends into " non-churchy " organizations. Regardless of how religious an organization may be , much of what it does can be viewed as " secular " from a dualistic point of view.

While these developments made it difficult to envisage every local parish as embodying everything which is required in order to be " church , " the ancient equivalence of presbyter and bishop was not forgotten.

( 289 ) He argued , " For also at Alexandria , from Mark the evangelist down to bishops Heraclas and Dionysius , the presbyters always chose one of themselves and , having elevated him in grade , named him bishop-just as if an army might make an emperor by acclamation , or deacons choose one of themselves , whom they know to be hard-working , and call him archdeacon.

If the people who and wish to remain in this Country and use our services , then they must comply with our terms and conditions.

We would rather go to jail or face death , the Bavarian Bishops declared in 1936 , than become unfaithful to our pastoral duty.

The president should only sign a law which makes clear ( 1 ) that government has no right to insist that organizations internalize a sectarian/ nonsectarian dualism , ( 2 ) that religion is something religious people , not governments , have the right to define , and ( 3 ) that government 's cooperation with integrally religious organizations constitutes no violation of the First Amendment as long as no particular religion or non-religion is singled out for special treatment . </insist.v.410><insist.v.411>There must be no more Iraqs.

I have heard the view expressed and I have also echoed that view that it is human to fall ill , and that certain other Presidents in other countries have been ill before Yar ' Adua. The critical difference which we must stress is that Yar ' Adua was ill before he became President. His condition was not concealed before he sought our votes. As Governor of Katsina State , he was out of the state for six months seeking medical help abroad. As Presidential candidate , he was perpetually struggling to show up on the campaign trail. We were all here when he travelled abroad and there were speculations that he had died , prompting former President Obasanjo to make that phone call : Umoru , are you dead ? . Obasanjo was deceiving other Nigerians , he was playing games with our future by insisting that only Umoru could succeed him. And yet we all agreed.

Its remit covered much territory now known as sociology and political science. Consequently , the notion of economics is much wider in Marx and Engels than many superficial observers comprehend. As we have seen , they considered human beings ' relationships with nature , their family relationships and the social relationships they formed with other human beings to be some of the most important constituents of a materialist analysis of any particular epoch. Marx ' s mature economic theory insisted that both means of production ( tools , machines , factories , offices and so on ) and the relations of production ( above all , the class relations ) were , together , what constituted the mode of production. And it was upon this basis , the production and reproduction of real life as Engels put it , that they sought to understand the development of social institutions , political parties , ideologies , religions , philosophies and so on . </insist.v.423><insist.v.424>Bush insisted such accounts will grow fast enough to provide a better return than the present system.

An International Atomic Energy Agency report on Iran 's activities is expected next week , and Western diplomats tell Time that it will include " potentially incriminating " details about traces of highly enriched uranium found by inspectors recently on equipment at the Lavisan-Shian military site. The find is significant not because of the residue -- it is n't bomb-grade and may have been on the equipment when it was bought from renegade Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan -- but because Iran has n't explained why such enrichment tools were found at a military facility. Iranian officials still insist their military is not engaged in nuclear work . </insist.v.426><insist.v.427>On February 16 , 2005 , the Army 's plans for gender integration in the 3rd Infantry Division were explained to Dr. Charmaine Yoest and me during a meeting with Secretary Harvey and Vice Chief of Staff General Richard Cody.

Yet with segments bouncing from satellite to satellite , passing from one news organization to another , it is easy to see the potential for confusion. Indeed , in response to questions from The Times , Associated Press Television News acknowledged that they might have distributed at least one segment about Afghanistan to the major United States networks without identifying it as the product of the State Department.

Suchinda ' s forces had blocked off all of the old city center and there was sporadic gunfire. Suchinda made another short televised announcement , mainly to say that he had things under control. With him were governing coalition party leaders Narong , Banharn , and Samak. Samak , as in the 1970s , insisted that shooting the people had been acceptable because they were communists . </insist.v.430><insist.v.431>I believe that Luther has expressed accurately the essence of biblical theology -- recall Paul 's equally forceful " we destroy arguments and every proud obstacle to the knowledge of God , and take every thought captive to obey Christ " ( 2 Cor. 10 : 5 ) -- but no self-respecting philosophical theologian can possibly accept such a methodology. I believe that evangelicals are correct in insisting on the unity of truth , but this can not be attained without preserving the integrity of reason as a critical tool. If truth is unitary , then critical reason can not be a slave to any presuppositions , even though it can not say it does not have any. Reason must remain constantly vigilant , checking carefully all claims , including the claims of faith. If reason is taken " captive by faith , " then reason completely loses its ability to recognize truth and unify it. If reason is enslaved by faith , then faith controls and dictates the results of reasoning. Reason would truly be a whore if she were open to such liberties. She could be forced to utter nonsense at the command of faith. Any statement could be " true , " by direct or indirect inference from one 's articles of faith. Critical thinking as we know it would come to an end . </insist.v.431><insist.v.432>Although Henry once affirms the traditional idea of " personal faith as a divine gift of the Holy Spirit , " this is completely incompatible with his use of Neidhardt 's theory , which makes the acquisition of faith anthropocentric rather than theocentric. ( This essential distinction is confused when Henry implies that scientific faith is simply an extension of biblical faith. Such a view , of course , undermines the integrity of science. ) Henry reaffirms his evangelical rationalism by insisting that as opposed to " blind faith , " Christian faith , like scientific faith , must have " adequate evidential supports , empirical or nonempirical. " 24 By their comparison of scientific and theological knowledge ( Henry , incidentally , defends the traditional view of theology as science , i.e. , knowledge ) , evangelical rationalists risk the reduction of fides to scientia. Traditional Christian theology has always resisted such a reduction : faith is a theological not an intellectual virtue . </insist.v.432><insist.v.433>Today , conditions under the Pentecostal monarchial bishop are exactly as they were in the monarchial churches of Ignatius ' time and after. As for apostles , any and all " sending " will be done by the " pastor " rather than by God himself. As for prophets , the monarchial bishop is the Prophet with a capital " P " , although prophets and bishops are two entirely different positions in the church , and " preaching " and " pastoring " are never equated in the Bible. And as for teachers , as Ignatius insisted , it is the " pastor " who is the source of all that the church believes , the mainstay of the truth , the supposed guardian of the gospel. So while the monarchial bishopry today boasts that its position of power is soundly based on the Bible its very existence has robbed the church of its most essential ministries and of its responsibility to uphold the truth and has destroyed the order which God instituted for the Church . </insist.v.433><insist.v.434>The Palestine War , however , revived all the sound and fury of pan-Arabism , Greater Syrianism , Islamism and every other ism , which undermined the legitimacy , integrity , and independence of his smaller troubled Syria. Quwwatli was torn between the logic of the state he actually ruled and the state Syrians dreamed of. The war in Palestine should have forced him to choose between the two , but he insisted on standing for both. To tell Syrians that they were small Syrians with limited capabilities , who could afford only small hopes , was something he refused to do. Perhaps no statesman could have advocated a smaller Syria and survived politically ? If Quwwatli did not defend the notion of a smaller Syria openly , his strategy for organizing and deploying the volunteer Arab army in Palestine is proof enough that he defending it in reality . </insist.v.434><insist.v.435>The Sharon-Olmert Kadima continued to harrass the Jewish settlers , in the unswerving belief that it would be able to give this Land to the Arabs in return for peace. Given the history of gross bureaucratic incompetence most of the 10 , 000 Jews from Gaza are yet to be resettled in permanent housing ( see Fendel , here ) an Israeli government that booted out some of the more than half-million Jewish " settlers " of Judea , Samaria and eastern Jerusalem , is unlikely to be able to cope with additional Jewish political refugees in what is left of Israel. Nevertheless , the war against the settlers continues , by stealth , by harassment , by cutting water and electricity from farmers who keep sheep and goats and grow plants , by treating them unfairly in the courts and in the press. This policy is pursued almost as strongly as the Arabs continue to insist by word and by nasty deed that their objective is to destroy the Jewish State. I for one believe them . </insist.v.435><insist.v.436>It is quite an understatement to say that the fight to save the lives of innocent and helpless human embryos and fetuses has been a losing battle.

" That constitutional question can be resolved , she said , only by balancing the grave harm that would be done to a person who is erroneously and indefinitely imprisoned against the danger to our security and the burdens placed on our military forces from allowing prisoners to claim judicial review of their detentions. The Virginia district court had granted too much protection to the individual , O'Connor said , at too heavy a cost to security , by insisting that Hamdi could be detained only if he was proved to be an enemy combatant by the standards of evidence required in an ordinary criminal trial. The Fourth Circuit court , on the other hand , granted too little protection in holding that because Hamdi was captured in a " theater " of military action , the President 's declaration that he was an enemy combatant could not be challenged at all . </insist.v.468><insist.v.469>In 1865 , when the Confederacy finally surrendered to the North , no one knew quite what to do in response.

Yet neither could he simply readmit the Southern states into the Union as if nothing had happened. The South had been devastated by the war socially , economically , and politically.

Insisting that the Koran prohibited a Muslim woman from " removing the veil before an unknown man , " fifteen Tatar women , represented by the Muslim Women 's Union , sued the authorities for denying religious freedoms guaranteed by the constitution.

Robert and Ethel Kennedy flew to San Francisco on Friday , Aug. 3 , 1962 and were met by their friend John Bates , his wife and family. They all insist that RFK had been in full sight of one member of the family or ranch workers for the full day. Dinner ended at approximately 10.30 p.m. and the party retired to bed shortly afterwards. The nearest airstrip was in San Jose , an hour away by car. The deep canyons in the Santa Cruz Mountains made the ranch inaccessible by helicopter and the ranch was five hours away from Los Angeles by car. On Sunday morning the Bates and Kennedy families attended mass in the town of Gilroy. The Bates family stories have been rigorously researched and , unlike many tales about this sorry event , have the ring of truth . </insist.v.478><insist.v.479>The Spartacists after the debate insisted that they had only called on Russia to extend its nuclear umbrella over Vietnam.

Insist that other programmers observe those idiosyncratic conventions in " his " modules. Banning beautifiers is quite easy , even though they save the millions of keystrokes doing manual alignment and days wasted misinterpreting poorly aligned code. Just insist that everyone use the same tidied format , not just for storing in the common repository , but also while they are editing. This starts an RWAR and the boss , to keep the peace , will ban automated tidying. Without automated tidying , you are now free to accidentally misalign the code to give the optical illusion that bodies of loops and ifs are longer or shorter than they really are , or that else clauses match a different if than they really do. e.g . </insist.v.481><insist.v.482>Iran , which insists its nuclear program is meant only to produce fuel , refused suspend enrichment by an Aug. 31 deadline set by the Security Council.

However , in order to pay for fiscally irresponsible tax cuts , Congressional Republicans have cut $ 24 billion from the President 's domestic priorities. This would result in fewer quality teachers for our schools , fewer law enforcement officers and prosecutors to fight crime , reduced environmental protection , and less funding for National Science Foundation research.

There is assumption that part of this growth can be reflected in exports , but if that is not the case , Iceland is insisting on " conditionalities " of its own to take its actual balance-of-payments position into account . </insist.v.489><insist.v.490>At a time when Wolfowitz as Rumsfeld 's right hand man in the Pentagon , was insisting to Congress and America that the war would cost US taxpayers virtually nothing because it would , " pay for itself out of the oil , " the White House 's own Economic Advisor , Lawrence Lindsey , told Congress and the American people that the true cost of the war and the occupation for just one year would be a staggering $ 200 billion -- a dissent that had to be immediately destroyed , or at least the dissenter destroyed.

Darwin Fish insists this too is a false accusation , citing as proof a list of his own tapes that he has withdrawn from circulation.

The rest of his " retractions " are trivial or silly corrections , such as one tape that was withdrawn because " Darwin felt he could have dealt with the subject of flatulence in a more mature manner. " Rather than demonstrating his willingness to recant error , the list of no-longer-available tapes proves that Darwin Fish can not distinguish that which is vital from that which is trivialand the only substantive changes he is making to his teaching are taking him further and further from the historic and biblical Christian faith. In other words , even his list of " retractions " demonstrates that he is devising a cultish system no one before him has ever been able to find in the Scriptures . </insist.v.492><insist.v.493>SEDONA , Ariz. -- As he prepares to accept his party 's nomination for president in Minnesota this week , Sen.

This pairing of face-to-face assembly and regional community developed over an extended period without a conscious intent to create this pattern. How is this development to be understood theologically ? Is it completely fortuitous or does it express an institutional truth about how the koinonia of salvation is rightly realized , namely , the need both for the immediate experience of koinonia in the physical presence of one to another and for the embodiment of the catholicity and diversity of koinonia in a community of such face-to-face communities ? It may be a theological mistake to insist that one or the other is " local church " in an exclusive sense without also saying that there is something about this pairing of face-to-face assembly and primary regional community that is ecclesiologically normative. If this pairing is normative , we must inquire what significance this structure has for our understanding of the ministries of those who preside over these communities , the pastor and the bishop . </insist.v.499><insist.v.500>The Galatians certainly found it hard to accept.

And to address that seriously , we must first of all comprehend with some clarity the historical development of our present system , appreciate its structural dilemmas today , and open our mind to radical alternatives for the future. And we must do all this , not merely academically but practically , that is , living in the present , and concerned with the immediate needs of people as well as longer-run transformations.

The foregoing are a few of the principal exponents of early socialistic theories. If space would permit , many others might be named who have expounded complex ideas of social , political , and economic readjustment ! As compared with the earlier theories , modern scientific socialism has more particular reference to economic production and distribution. Karl Marx , a social democrat and one of the earlier advocates of socialistic production , insisted on the political organization of industry. He emphasized the great service of labor in production and maintained that because of the excessive demands of capital , labor did not receive a fair share of the product. Social democracy , of which Marx may be called the founder , includes , among other theories , the collective ownership of land and capital , the abolition of competitive industry , and , consequently , the social production of wealth. And while Karl Marx was advocating social democracy in Germany , Louis Blanc was founding state socialism in France. Opposing equality , he set forth a system of distributive justice , by which , after each had labored according to his abilities , he was to receive a reward in proportion , not to capacity or product , but to his need . </insist.v.505><insist.v.506>On the other hand , he introduces a very helpful apologetic tool in showing that unbelief is inseparably linked to the dialectic of rationalism and irrationalism , which destroys all basis for intelligible predication. Unbelief is rationalistic , because it insists on the autonomy of human thought , and therefore insists that human thought is the ultimate criterion of truth and falsity , of right and wrong. On the other hand , unbelief is also irrationalistic , because it believes that the apparent order in the universe is ultimately based on disorder , upon chance . </insist.v.506><insist.v.507>Workingwomen have the same need to combine for protection that workingmen have; the ballot is as necessary for one class as for the other; we do not believe that with the two sexes there is identity of function; but we do believe that there should be equality of right; and therefore we favor woman suffrage. In those conservative States where there is genuine doubt how the women stand on this matter I suggest that it be referred to a vote of the women , so that they may themselves make the decision. Surely if women could vote , they would strengthen the hands of those who are endeavoring to deal in efficient fashion with evils such as the white slave traffic; evils which can in part be dealt with Nationally , but which in large part can be reached only by determined local action , such as insisting on the widespread publication of the names of the owners , the landlords , of houses used for immoral purposes . </insist.v.507><insist.v.508>The report acknowledges that there have been some positive changes in Turkish law and policy as the country attempts to join the European Union.However , it also calls on the EU to insist on respect for LGBT people ' s basic rights as a barometer of Turkey ' s human rights progress . </insist.v.508><insist.v.509>The reason of this global destruction is the human population explosion; we have been born as part of a plague.

Even though a child has been conceived by sin ( as most are ) , yet it is God who has given him or her existence; for no conception can be had except God causes it. There is no true corporeal guilt in the person who is conceived by rape , no more than there is guilt in the person who is the victim of rape. The baby conceived and the female raped are both victims. The rapist is the one who has committed a death-worthy crime , and it is the rapist who should be put to death ( Deuteronomy 22 : 23-27 ) . What true justice and righteousness is served by insisting on the death of the innocent baby and not insisting on the death of the criminal rapist ? </insist.v.523><insist.v.524>Let ' s stop right here. This is what absolutely drives me nuts about Keynesians. ( And by the way , I hate to do this because I like Gauti Eggertsson; he was very kind to cite three of my papers in his recent AER piece which is an excellent article. ) A Keynesian will keep insisting that you can ' t be a realistic , sensible , modern monetary economist unless you think in terms of interest rate rules. Monetary rules are too old-fashioned , and futures targeting is too , I don ' t know , futuristic ? So it ' s got to be interest rate rules. Then they develop models that show interest rate rules don ' t work very well when interest rates are at zero and further monetary ease is called for.

If this is true ( Bacon was n't known for his accuracy ) then this was only his second venture into heterosexuality. The other occasion involved a prostitute who insisted on eating chips during the failed encounter. Certainly , Rawsthorne , described as 'tall , lithe , superbly proportioned [ moving ] with the agility of a feline predator ' , was the sort of woman who inspired worldly men to do extraordinary things. By the time she met Bacon in the early 1960s , she 'd already had a child by the sculptor Jacob Epstein and been the lover of the Parisian-based sculptor Alberto Giacometti. Picasso , an ardent admirer , had painted her five times . </insist.v.527><insist.v.528>The doctrine of common grace deals with the question of how God can give good gifts to the non-elect , to the reprobate. More specifically , the question arises of how God can present the promises of the gospel to the reprobate , to those whom he has foreordained not to benefit from those promises. Van Til 's doctrine of common grace gets off to a good start , insisting on the importance of historical process. God gives blessings to the reprobate because the final judgment has not arrived. After human beings are assigned to their final destinies , there will be no more common grace. The elect will be blessed; the non-elect will be punished; and there will therefore be no blessings in common between them . </insist.v.528><insist.v.529>The whole logic of the Southern system has broken down.

UNHCR requested a total of 1.673 billion regular budget and supplemental funds for 2008. Of their clients , the vast majority returned home or were resettled within 5 years. UNRWA 's clientele is exclusively Palestinian arab; in 2007 , UNRWA cared for 4.5 million people in Syria , Jordan , Lebanon , Gaza and the West Bank. They requested 1.09 billion for 2008. To sum up : to cater to 14 of the number of people that UNHCR cares for , UNRWA 's non-supplemental 2008 budget is almost 2/3 of what UNHCR spends for all other UN-supported refugees in the world. UNRWA has resisted resettling clients for some 60 years , insisting that unlike other refugees these arabs can not go anywheres except to Israel . </insist.v.530><insist.v.531>I can see unscrupulous players tag teaming someone where Player Asshat INSISTING to Player Bob that they used to go out and rape chickens together when they were wee little ven.

On the surface this seems to be only the foolish gesture of a vain monarch who insists that the statue be worshiped as a symbol of the unity of the empire. However , when the story is read with the vision of the statue of chapter 2 in view , one realizes that the later episode actually shows Nebuchadnezzar rebelling against God 's decree. God had said , " Your kingdom will be succeeded by other kingdoms , kingdoms of silver , brass and iron. " Nebuchadnezzar replied , " No , my kingdom will endure; it will always be glorious -- I will create a statue of which not only the head will be of gold , but the shoulders , thighs and legs also.

Often , the sentencing judge will have direct experience with the company 's non-cooperation as a result of the pre-trial and trial proceedings. In those cases , the judge can explore with the CEO why the company felt compelled to be intransigent.

We tandem nursed about 14 months. My son and daughter are very close , insisting on having their beds next to each other , and having " hugging contests " as part of their play.

President Clinton must demand that Israel return immediately to the negotiation table and come into full compliance with UN Security Council resolutions or risk an immediate cutoff of U.S. military and economic aid. The Israeli government broke off the talks following an attack by Lebanese guerrillas against Israeli occupation forces inside Lebanon. Israel has insisted that Syria somehow stop these Lebanese fighters from engaging in such attacks before negotiations can resume. However , the Hezbollah militia is not controlled by the Syrian government; they operate independently and have relied on Iran as their major backer. Indeed , throughout the 1980s , the Hezbollah engaged in a series of bloody clashes with a Syrian proxy militia known as Amal. While some of the Hezbollah 's arms supplies come through Syria and Syrian forces are stationed in other parts of Lebanon , the Syrians correctly note that international law recognizes the right of those under foreign military occupation to armed resistance against the forces of the occupation army . </insist.v.541><insist.v.542>Van Til does not disparage the use of reason , logic and evidence , as many critics suppose , though there are some statements in his writings that are a bit confusing in this respect.

The society gained recognition with the publication of its Fabian Essays in 1889 , to which Shaw had contributed. Their manifesto , outlined in these essays , rejected Marxism in favor of a natural , progressive development of socialism based on social and political reforms. They insisted that violent protest was detrimental to their goals , and so initially they did not become involved in labor movements. Later , however , when Beatrice Potter joined the group , the society became more focused on workers ' rights. As a result , the Fabians helped form , in 1900 , the unified Labour Representation committee , later evolving into Britain 's Labour Party , which adopted the main tenets of the Fabian Society . </insist.v.548><insist.v.549>Went back to Sears with my husband about 4 days later and argued with the assistant manager Willie who insisted that his technician would not do this..

Furthermore , while persons are sentient , rational , conscious beings who were born innocent , no nation shares the first three of these properties , and some would insist that the establishment of most nations in existence has involved the victimization of indigenous peoples. In addition , analogies of nations to persons commit the fallacy of composition ( Calhoun , 2000 ) .

For example , they agreed to zero duty for information technology goods at the 1996 Singapore WTO Ministerial Meeting and to provisional zero duty on electronic commerce for 18 months at the 1998 Ministerial Meeting in Geneva. These two proposals were sponsored by the major developed countries and they were the main beneficiaries. Electronic commerce is an area with very high growth prospects , and a duty in this area can be a potentially lucrative source of revenue for the developing countries. Also the users will generally be those in the high-income group of the population , and as such , even from the angle of equity , a tax in this area in the developing countries can be appropriate. Thus the developing countries have really surrendered a potential major source of revenue without any benefit. They were not prepared with counter-demands for negotiating reciprocal concessions from the sponsors and beneficiaries of these proposals.

Some considerable intellectual contortion is necessary to overcome the elementary biographical facts of Marx and Engels ' lives. For Terrell Carver the intellectual relationship between the two living men , however , was very much the story of what they accomplished independently . These accomplishments were by no means theoretically coincident . After Marx ' s death Engels moved into an all-powerful role in which he invented dialectics and reconstructed Marx ' s life and works accordingly . [ 26 ] Nor is Carver alone in this kind of assertion.

The commission members emphatically rejected that approach; insisting that the evidence would speak for itself and that anyone who would read the report would come to the correct conclusions as to what needed to be done.

Feaver and Kohn nonetheless put these trends in the broader context of changes in civilian society and argue that while there is no crisis , there is cause for concern.

We should seek to establish that the biblical God is the source of all meaning and intelligibility in the world , for indeed he is the source of all meaning and intelligibility in the world. However , Van Til tries to derive from the nature of transcendental argument some additional restrictions on the apologist , restrictions which I consider unnecessary. ( 1 ) He insists that arguments for Christianity should be indirect rather than direct. Instead of proving the existence of God directly , Van Til insists that we prove it indirectly , by showing the " impossibility of the contrary. " He urges us to adopt the unbeliever 's presupposition " for the sake of argument " and show that that presupposition leads to incoherence and meaninglessness. ( 2 ) He demands that we always claim absolute certainty rather than probability. ( 3 ) He occasionally requires that we announce our entire theology " at the outset " of every apologetic encounter. ( 4 ) He occasionally requires that the argument conclude by proving the UN ( whole ) of Christian theism , rather than merely proving individual doctrines.

The plaintiff admits that there was talk about a down payment and that the defendant had insisted upon $ 2 , 000 and that the plaintiff had originally offered to pay $ 1 , 000. However , the plaintiff claims that this all took place after the execution of the memorandum and that there was no mention of a down payment in the oral negotiations which led to the preparation and execution of the memorandum. It is difficult to accept the plaintiff 's version on this point since it is hard to understand why the plaintiff volunteered subsequently to make a down payment if there had been a complete agreement of sale without a down payment at the time of the execution of the memorandum. In any event , there is at least a question of fact as to whether a down payment had been discussed prior to the execution of the agreement and had been left open for further negotiation and had been ultimately agreed upon.

And it may be expected that the CIA will more and more sharply signal that it passed its findings up the food chain , because on the basis of Ambassador Wilson 's revelations , they 'd be left to take the blame if they didn't. Then again , the media may turn its attention to the role of the Vice President 's office : After all , Ambassador Wilson claims his inquiry was initiated by a request from Dick Cheney 's office to check out the allegation.

It is to insist that there is no longer a struggle to define it , nor a successful resistance that stands in its way. It is to grant it historical and political legitimacy as a fact of life , but also to endow all its subsequent effects as its natural outcome.

Whereas those who play the legal game not only pretend but insist that their intricate ratiocination 's in the realm of pure thought have a necessary relation to the solution of practical problems. It is through the medium of their weird and wordy mental gymnastics that the lawyers lay down the rules under which we live. And it is only because the average man can not play their game , and so can not see for himself how intrinsically empty-of-meaning their playthings are , that the lawyers continue to get away with it . </insist.v.634><insist.v.635>Scott would become so stressed , Laci would insist that he go somewhere to relax.

However , the Apostle Paul has it that any attempt to be justified in any one point by the law is to fall from grace. Circumcision is the subject in Galatians chapter 5 , but circumcision is only a part of that ONE LAW. The tithe payer attempts to justify himself in this one respect : that he has given to God " His cut " , and so is justified by obedience to the law in this one matter.

Rap fans insist that performers be authentic representatives of ghetto life : that they live the life they rap about; that life conform to art , so to speak. Rap 's critics , on the other hand , are terrified that life will conform to art , that the behavior -- the drug dealing and the violence -- described by rappers will seep into the mainstream culture. The majority of ardent fans and consumers of rap are , in fact , middle-class white youths. ( Seventy per cent of those who buy rap records are white. ) It is the fear of a violent , marginalized culture 's influence on susceptible young people that fuels much of the political debate , and this fear is exacerbated by the widespread adoption of hip-hop style . </insist.v.639><insist.v.640>Underlining that only the negative aspects of the digitalisation of Cinema is often pointed out ( the fragmentation of the audience , the weakening of historical players thus the financing of independent features , and piracy ) , Ms Cayla chose to be optimistic for 2010 , by insisting on the positive effects of new technologies such as the more open environment for new talents and the development of digital distribution such as Video on Demand ( VoD ) .

The Confederate rebels insisted on their right to enslave blacks. The Nazis insisted on their right to annihilate Jews. Did such insistence settle the ethical issue ? Of course not. Ethical issues can only be settled by ethical arguments , and ethical arguments are what both Denning and Stewart are conspicuously failing to provide. Instead , the attempt is made to seduce us , by pure rhetoric , into kowtowing to the social status quo.

The World Bank , meanwhile , continued to make loans on the basis of specific projects intended to alleviate poverty and promote development , but insisted on the same SAPs and the same criteria for economic management as the IMF. Although the World Bank was not as closely involved in setting the terms of the SAPs and making the short-term loans which kept the moribund economies alive , its own lending program inevitably reinforced the new standards for 'stabilization ' , 'financial austerity ' and 'open economies'.

Aristotle , unlike Plato who saw war as an essential ingredient in creating civilization , believed peace was the normal state and war the abnormality , i.e. , a society or rock at rest tends to stay in that position. Virtually all religions insist that pax , shalom , salaam , nirvana are the desideratum of life and promise to bestow it on their followers who practice right belief , rituals , and ethics. Modern peace theorists , including Quaker Elise Boulding , remind us that peace is the condition of most of humanity most of the time. Even belligerent powers , and there is a strong correlation with being a great power and the frequency of war , remain at peace most of the time. That is , if peace is defined solely as the absence of war.

It has raised armies , equipped navies , and , triumphing over the gross power of mere numbers , it has established national superiority on the foundation of intelligence , wealth , and well-directed industry. Credit is to money what money is to articles of merchandise. As hard money represents property , so credit represents hard money; and it is capable of supplying the place of money so completely , that there are writers of distinction , especially of the Scotch school , who insist that no hard money is necessary for the interests of commerce.

Stated another way , the question is whether a State may constitutionally hale a person into its criminal courts and there force a lawyer upon him , even when he insists that he wants to conduct his own defense.

No matter where one stands on other issues , if you support marriage - as marriage you are being brushed with all the disparaging terms thrown at people who insist that there is any such a thing as objective truth in an age of moral relativism.

I am sure that on many occasions this is the only right and proper thing to do. On the other hand , a marriage in which both parties are constantly insisting on their rights is not a healthy marriage , and a society in which all citizens are constantly insisting on their rights is not a healthy society. And one could add that this attitude does not help to make the society more Christian.

But most disturbing of all was publication of the hard-line draft agreement that British and Dutch negotiators had handed to Iceland ' s finance minister on June 5 , 2009. It failed utterly to reflect the caveats that Icelandic negotiators had insist on the previous November. Bolstered by Gordon Brown ' s shrill rhetoric and Britain ' s insistence that the terms be kept secret , the EU ' s harsh take-it-or-leave-it stance created an atmosphere in which the Althing had little choice but to draw a line and insist that any Icesave settlement had to reflect Iceland ' s reasonable ability to pay. Icesave was caricatured as Iceslave signifying the debt peonage with which Iceland was threatened. The finance minister ( a former Communist leader ) seemed out of his depth in having knuckled under in the face of pressure to capitulate to unyielding British negotiators . </insist.v.695><insist.v.696>Willig could n't be reached for comment.

" Perhaps she even offers suggestions of various natural and medical treatments that might " cure " the problem. Ironically , you will sometimes hear these same people say , " It is God that opens and closes the womb.

While highlighting the enormous level of arrears of the United States ( $ 1.595 billion ) , she also points out that many other member states are making special efforts to pay up , even those that are experiencing economic difficulties. She stresses that the obligation to pay UN assessments is binding under international law , superseding any national laws. She also insists that members must provide funds to carry out the programs they decide on-they can not add new programs while cutting budgets.

At the wedding of Wendy and Harold for example , the bride insisted that each bridesmaid wear an identical pair of tiny pearl stud earrings. To insure compliance , she even bought them as gifts for her attendants. The dresses she chose for her friends were of a stomach-churning pale orange hue , she insisted that they wear the exact same color stockings , with the traditional dyed satin pumps. They were also , of course , expected to pay for the dresses and shoes themselves ( $ 250 ) and to wear them happily , even though one of the bridesmaids was seven months pregnant and was miserable in high-heels , and another was allergic to the posts of most pierced earrings ( even real gold , which these were not ) . </insist.v.704><insist.v.705>Moreover , the Communist Party is insisting that the funds of about 2 , 000 billions yen are possible to be provided by the substitution of the national debt in low interest , and decreasing the interest cost of the nation.

This is a situation that can not be viewed with equanimity by non-nuclear countries , especially as they are called upon to undertake not to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons for their own defence. At the same time , we have stated that the Government of India does not propose to manufacture nuclear weapons. This is a decision taken many years ago and is unrelated to the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We shall continue our efforts for nuclear disarmament because it is only through nuclear disarmament that discrimination would be eliminated and equality between nations established. By this time , China , which had fought a brief but successful border war with India in 1962 , had joined the other declared Nuclear Weapon States ( the United States , United Kingdom , France and Soviet Union ) . In addition to France , China had refused to sign the NPT and for that matter the Partial Test-Ban Treaty . </insist.v.708><insist.v.709>Online poker has been available worldwide for over a decade.

The presumption is that he might have been Bishop of Rome but for this unfortunate affusion in place of immersion. Certain it is that it did not satisfy the church and was a cause , if not the cause of his reprobation. Here we have the church allowing to a sick man a substitute for the action commanded by the Saviour - allowing in cases of sickness what was not permitted in health , and then prohibiting from the priesthood the persons who had availed themselves of the substitute.

The opposition to Class Counsel 's motion to dismiss filed by the Williams Objectors ( Appendix A to this Reply ) included documents that established appellants ' membership in the class. Since Class Counsel never offered contrary proof , the Williams Objectors assumed that the issue of their right to appeal had been resolved , and hence did not burden the Court with reargument on that point. Our brief ( at 7-8 ) did describe their class membership , and then in footnote 6 , page 21 , mentioned this Court 's prior ruling and reserved the right to reply , if Class Counsel insisted on challenging appellants ' status as class members . </insist.v.713><insist.v.714>John Selden was famed for his scholarship - not only was he immensely learned in English law , but his grasp of Hebrew and other Middle Eastern languages was extraordinary.

Buckly who had entered into a private covenant with thirty of their neighbors restricting the sale , lease , or occupancy of their properties to whites only. Mrs. Corrigan decided to sell her home to a black doctor , after which Mr. Buckly sued. The Supreme Court unanimously approved of the racially restrictive covenant citing the holding in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883 that private invasion of individual rights was not prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court went on to state that there was nothing in the Constitution which prohibited private parties " from entering into contracts respecting the control and disposition of their own property.

Board of Education of Topeka , Kansas. Robert Carter would once again be representing Oliver Brown and his daughter. Carter advanced the argument that his client was being denied equal protection of the law because the act of segregation denied his client equal educational opportunities which were guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The Topeka Board of Education was represented by the Assistant Attorney General of Kansas Paul Wilson. Wilson asserted that it was " shur sophistry " to suggest that Plessy and Gong Lum did not apply to Brown. This was the crux of his argument. The Assistant Attorney General also tried to counter Finding VIII which held that Negro students developed a sense of inferiority from attending segregated schools by insisting that this inferiority did not result from the objective components of the school system. Wilson also argued that Finding VIII did n't apply to the appellant in question because she was never tested by any of the social scientists cited in the findings . </insist.v.720><insist.v.721>House Republicans are insisting on public hearings and public review of the stimulus proposal before any vote is taken.

Indeed , they may well have noted the contradictory way in which Parmenides treated time and space , insisting on the everlasting existence of what really is , and at the same time denying it indefinite spatial extension . </insist.v.724><insist.v.725>Conscious of the cultural distance between the world of the first century and that of the 20th , Bultmann was particularly anxious to make the reality of which the Bible treats speak to his contemporaries. He insisted upon the " Pre-understanding " necessary for all understanding and elaborated the theory of the existential interpretation of the New Testament writings. Relying upon the thinking of Heidegger , Bultmann insisted that it is not possible to have an exegesis of a biblical text without presuppositions which guide comprehension. " Pre-understanding " ( " vorverstandnis " is founded upon the life-relationship ( " lebensverhaltnis " ) of the interpreter to the reality of which the text speaks. To avoid subjectivism , however , one must allow pre-understanding to be deepened and enrichedeven to be modified and correctedby the reality of the text . </insist.v.725><insist.v.726>But this could also just be a trap.

At trial , the prosecutor purposely twisted the facts in his closing statement to make it appear that it was George 's bullet - not mine - that killed the officer. When George and I insisted that I testify to show that it was n't George 's bullet , George 's attorney made the loudest protest. My attorney begged me not to testify. " George is already lost.

At the time Bhumibol made no point of standing for a constitution-based transition that might have denied Suchinda power. Moreover , he declined to exercise his prerogative to dissolve parliament and set elections. Such royal powers are not inconsequential simply because they are seldom used.

Because the Jews have been so crazy for peace , they have been willing to share , to give up pieces of their tiny country , for a piece of paper. The Arabs created a phony people in 1964 , called the " Palestinians " and blanketed the world with the mantra that they were the Palestinians and Palestine was theirs. There has not ever been a country or a state called Palestine. There have been Palestinians. During the British Mandate from 1922 to 1948 the Jews called where they lived Palestine. They played music in the Palestine Philharmonic. They read the Palestine Post ( now the Jerusalem Post. ) As the Palestine Brigade , they fought in the British Army in World War 2.

One might conclude from Berlin 's view of values as human inventions that he would regard them as subjective. Yet he insisted , on the contrary , that values are objective , even going so far as to label his position ' objective pluralism ' . It is unclear what exactly he meant by this , or how this belief relates to his view of values as human creations. There are at least two accounts of the objectivity of values that can be plausibly attributed to Berlin : first , that values are ' objective ' in that they are simply facts about the people who hold them so that , for instance , liberty is an ' objective ' value because I value it , and would feel frustrated and miserable without a minimal amount of it; second , that the belief in or pursuit of certain values is the result of objective realities of human nature so that , for instance , liberty is an ' objective ' value because certain facts about human nature make liberty good and desirable for human beings.

Today , the court said that in the absence of a clear congressional authorization to ignore the Geneva Convention protocols , Bush can not insist on military tribunals. And as Glenn Greenwald noted , the court went further and decided against the administration 's argument that the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force ( AUMF ) granted the executive such implicit authority , even though Congress was silent on this matter in that act. As Glenn noted , this would seem to undermine one of the Administration 's basic claims in avoiding FISA jurisdiction in the NSA wiretapping case , that the 2001 AUMF gave them this unspecified authority. Today , the court tossed that argument out with regards to detentions and military trials , and in the absence of clear congressional authority to the contrary , established the primacy of the Geneva Convention protocols , which would seem to undermine much of the Administration 's defense for not only Guantanamo but for the secret rendition program as well . </insist.v.747><insist.v.748>The last straw was Bruno 's refusal to accept the authority of the Inquisition itself.

Sixteen years later , Galileo managed to elude the more extreme penalties meted out by Bellarmine and company with a public ( and essentially politic ) repudiation of his heliocentric views; he lived to fight another day under a relatively comfortable house arrest.

Bonuses are being paid out ( and obscene ones at that ) when corporations have failed to deliver. I think all of these contracts within these corporations need to be legally reviewed and bonuses only provided , and provided as fair , not obscene , value for doing a good job. Across the world , these corporate packages have eluded shareholders. If I got wind that the insurance company that I buy my life insurance through is paying millions in coporate bonus to its executive instead of using that money to prevent my fees from going up , I 'd be at the shareholders meeting complaining and making sure that the media and every other policy holder also knew this.

Before the war , Prime Minister Howard insisted , " Our goal is disarmament. " " I couldn ' t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I ' ve never advocated that. " The problem was that George Bush 's advisers had and that is what they got. Howard told parliament that Iraq 's " possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of a nuclear capability poses a real and unacceptable threat to the stability and security of our world " .

Quwwatli had become the main champion and symbol of Syrian republicanism. His battle against the notion of a monarchist Greater Syria forced him to sharpen his defense of republicanism. He insisted that it was the true expression of the people ' s will and the natural order of things in Syria. All the same , he could not tell the Syrian public that he was for Syria first , or that Syria was too weak to rescue Palestine. Above all , he could not say that the Arab nation did not exist or that in reality the Arabs belonged to a collection of states that were bitterly divided. Quwwatli was caught between his newfound Syrianism and his life-long dedication to Arab nationalism. Although he was known as the hero of Syrian independence , he had also sworn never to raise the Syrian flag above that of the Arab nation. [ 100 ] These conflicting loyalties forced Quwwatli to dissemble during the war. In his effort to champion both , he succeeded in defending neither . </insist.v.761><insist.v.762>Why should n't there be yet another Arab state carved out of land belonging to Israel ? Because the West Bank is Biblical Israel. It belongs to the Jews by way of the Bible , by history , by the Palestine Mandate , by international law , by decency and morality. If you insist that land can only be acquired by conquest because that 's how most countries became states then , OK , Israel conquered the area in 1968 , taking it from Jordan , who took it in 1948 , when she , together with Israel 's other neighbors , invaded the newly-created state of Israel. Before that ? It belonged to the Ottomans for some 400 years. Then when the Ottomans had the misfortune to back the wrong side in World War 1 , England was entrusted with the territory to help the Jews turn it into a state . </insist.v.762><insist.v.763>Instead , there is a proposal that we enter into another agreement with China without insisting on China 's compliance with its existing agreements , which we could do by initiating a section 301 trade action against China.

Du Bois , the great black scholar , was among the first to challenge the Dunning view in a 1910 article and , later , in a 1935 book , Black Reconstruction. To him , Reconstruction politics in the Southern states had been an effort on the part of the masses , black and white , to create a truly democratic society. The misdeeds of the Reconstruction governments had , he claimed , been greatly exaggerated and their achievements overlooked. The governments had been expensive , he insisted , because they had tried to provide public education and other public services on a scale never before attempted in the South. But Du Bois 's use of Marxist theory in his work caused many historians who did not share his philosophy to dismiss his argument; and it remained for a group of less radical white historians to shatter the Dunning image of Reconstruction for good . </insist.v.765><insist.v.766>It 's great to have a happy story in the news rather than the usual tragedy , death , and destruction that readers hungrily absorb on a daily basis , even if the media insisted on finding ways to dramatize it as much as possible in order to sell even more advertising. However , the hidden lesson in the story was ignored by most of them. It is that government simply is incapable of responding with heart , determination , and compassion as well as private individuals actually do on a daily basis . </insist.v.766><insist.v.767>Bush 's excuses are falling apart on another front. After 9/11 , he and his senior advisers maintained over and over that no one could have imagined such an attack against the United States. That was not so. For years , the intelligence community had collected warnings reporting that al Qaeda and other terrorists were interested in launching a 9/11-sort of attack -- using hijacked aircraft as weapons -- against American targets. ( The final report produced by the joint inquiry on 9/11 conducted by the Senate and House intelligence committees includes a list of such warnings. ) And there is strong evidence that Bush was told of a July 2001 intelligence report that noted that al Qaeda was planning a " spectacular " attack involving " mass casualties " against an American target. But by insisting falsely that 9/11 was so far out of the box that no one could have done anything about it , Bush absolved his administration and the Clinton administration of any blame for failing to thwart the assault . </insist.v.767><insist.v.768>As far as sexed organs are concerned , the organs must be compatible even complementary by pairs , male and female.

( b ) That their coaptation should have some easing. ( c ) That it should be sufficiently exact. This is made possible by the tissue dynamic that we have just encountered with D'Arcy Thompson and Vincent Fleury. ( d ) Finally that the place of coaptive organs on the body should be favourable : the penis of the bull sufficiently median in its axis so that when he climbs on the cow he should have a reasonable chance of finding the opening of its vagina.

These sorts of stories routinely appear in trade magazines and company bulletins.

It was not , they insisted , a substitute for studying the real world , not an equation into which the facts merely had to be slotted , or a pattern into which historical events had to be forced. Each aspect of society had to be studied empirically and in detail. Only then might the unique dialectical pattern be discovered. In each circumstance it could be expected to contain particular features : Every kind of thing therefore has a peculiar way of being negated in such a way that it gives rise to development , and it is just the same with every kind of conception or idea. Just playing with dialectical phrases without studying real , empirical developments could only result in the silliness of the person who adopts such a tedious procedure .

Dulles did not wish to negotiate on Indochina until there was a marked improvement in the military situation of the French and they could negotiate from a position of far greater strength. But the Laniel Government was under mounting pressure from French public opinion to end the Indochinese war.

As September passed without any sign of weakening either among the employers or the striking workmen , the situation became so grave that I felt I would have to try to do something. The thing most feasible was to get both sides to agree to a Commission of Arbitration , with a promise to accept its findings; the miners to go to work as soon as the commission was appointed , at the old rate of wages. To this proposition the miners , headed by John Mitchell , agreed , stipulating only that I should have the power to name the Commission. The operators , however , positively refused.

We all insist much on this principle as regards the divinity of our Lord and the fact that he died to save us.

After the draft ended in the 1970s , the U.S. military became an all-volunteer force. The volunteer concept worked well through the smaller and shorter conflicts the U.S. engaged in up until the Afghanistan War , begun in 2001 , and the Iraq War began in 2003. With the conflict still raging in 2006 , the strain on the U.S. military is becoming apparant.

Augustine L mann , is it a question of an apostasy , that is , of a partial and limited falling away , but of the apostasy , according to the forceful Greek expression with the definite article , that is to say , of the falling away of the nations and of a great number of Catholics from Jesus Christ and the Church . . . </insist.v.813><insist.v.814>It was n't long before the right-wing Heritage Foundation followed suit and took aim at this aspect of the reform bill as well.

Khartoum continues to refuse troops from countries outside of the African continent , and to resist granting adequate land and water access rights to UNAMID or night flying rights. Khartoum insists on the right to shut down UNAMID communications during military operations and requests that UNAMID notify Khartoum in advance of all its military movements.

Because military means of " humanitarian intervention " effect the premature deaths of human beings , defending such missions may require that we forsake our ordinary distinction between killing and letting die. On the one hand , in civil society , we uphold the moral significance of this distinction. On the other hand , during wartime , advocates of military forms of " humanitarian intervention " relax the distinction , sometimes going so far as to characterize war opponents as " cowardly " , " incoherent " , or even " immoral " for failing to intervene to stop the slaughter of people by criminal regimes. But advocates of military intervention often seem to want to have it both ways , insisting that military action , which will ( in the modern world ) result in the deaths of innocent people , is sometimes necessary , while denying that positive assistance is morally obligatory in other sorts of cases.

At the Twenty-seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1986 , Gorbachev acknowledged that differences existed among the Soviet allies and that it would be unrealistic to expect them to have identical views on all issues. There has been no firm indication , as yet , of whether Gorbachev would be willing to grant the Soviet allies more policy latitude or insist on tighter coordination with the Soviet Union.

Unfortunately , I did n't like their models of underwear , and they did n't have the right size , so I did n't take any. I took my place in the queue to pay for the other clothes I 'd found. When it was my turn , she asked me if I 'd seen the underwear. I said yes , but I did n't find my size. She then promptly took a pair of underpants and started folding them out , insisting that they ought to be big enough.

[ 155 ] Fourth , they may choose to participate personally in in-house ethics and compliance training programs. All these actions , especially if they are announced publicly and made visible to all employees , would send a powerful signal regarding the corporation 's commitment to legal compliance , ethical business practices , and personal responsibility in pursuit of the company 's objectives.

These theologians begin with three divine persons whose unity is derived from their shared divinity. While the Greek orthodox Trinity does a great job of demonstrating the interrelation of the three persons , it does not clearly support the substantial unity of God , the central doctrine of Judeo-Christianity. When Jones recites the Athanasian creed 's " the Godhead of the Father , of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit is all one , " he can affirm only the divinity of each; he can not claim a substantial divine unity of them all. In this formulation " Godhead " can refer only to each of the persons individually , not as three persons of the same Godhead , as the Trinity is normally understood. Jones ' dramatic images of the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit frolicking together as children make for great religious literature , but it is not Judeo-Christian monotheism. Augustine insisted that the Trinity has " a single action and will , " so he would find Jones ' language quite unusual , if not unorthodox . </insist.v.848><insist.v.849>Through its massive attacks on Lebanon , Israel has resorted to the same tactics of which it accuses its Hezbollah enemy : terrorizing innocent civilians in order to influence government policy. Just as the attacks by Arab extremists against Israeli civilians have hardened Israeli attitudes towards the peace process , so have Israel 's attacks against Lebanese civilians , which have resulted in far more casualties and will likely make it all the more difficult for Lebanon and Syria to compromise further with Israel. The U.S. has acknowledged that Syria has already agreed to demilitarize the Golan Heights , allow for international monitors , sign a nonaggression pact , and pursue normal diplomatic relations with Israel. Yet it is not willing to insist that Israel move forward with the peace process . </insist.v.849><insist.v.850>The purpose of rules 22.1 ( 1 ) [ or ( 2 ) ] and ( 3 ) is to ensure that parties apply their minds to the question whether a preliminary plea is to be insisted on at the time when the record is closed. This is part and parcel of the philosophy of the Ordinary Cause Rules which requires the expeditious disposal of litigation. If a preliminary plea has been repelled at the options hearing , whether because there is no rule 22 note , or because the party concerned indicates that he is not insisting on it , or because it has been repelled by the sheriff and proof allowed because the sheriff is not " satisfied that there is a preliminary matter of law which justifies a debate " ( rule 9.12 ( 3 ) ( c ) ) , it would , in my opinion , be quite unjust to permit that party to reinstate his preliminary plea by amendment unless the other party had first by his amendment introduced new material which justified the preliminary plea of new. If this were not the principle to be applied , where would be the end of reinstated preliminary pleas ? At least in theory it would be in the infinite . </insist.v.850><insist.v.851>( 1 ) I affirm the " unity of truth , " a phrase Douglas Wilson once used over 20 years ago when we taught a class together.

Baptism is performed at all , simply because the Scriptures direct us to perform it; therefore we feel bound to inquire what it is that they direct , and to do that.

One highly embarrassing example is the initial mistranslation of a remark the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made and the following interview , held by seemingly a CIA interrogator who falsely accused the President of telling lies. The democratically elected ( other than W.

Moreover , 5 of them insisted on having their true names mentioned in the research.

One of the respondents , then , contacted me asking to conceal his real name because if not , he may face unnecessary trouble. So , I contacted 2 of the 4 remaining respondents who insisted on leaving their names unchanged. But I decided to use a homogeneous method and give all respondents pseudonyms , because declaration of respondents ' real names may create bias against or with their statements , since they are all public figures with fans and foes.

But the situation was complicated by the disputed returns from Louisiana , South Carolina , and Florida , whose total electoral vote was 19. Both parties claimed to have won these states , and double sets of returns were presented to Congress. Adding to the confusion was a contested vote in Oregon , where one of the three successful Republican electors was declared ineligible because he held a federal office. The Democrats contended that the place should go to the Democratic elector with the highest number of votes; but the Republicans insisted that according to state law , the remaining electors were to select someone to fill the vacancy. The disputed returns threw the outcome of the election into doubt. As tension and excitement gripped the country , two clear facts emerged from the welter of conflicting claims. Tilden had undisputed claim to 184 electoral votes , only one short of the majority.

In his many letters , speeches and articles on the situation Fr. Mulry has ever insisted that it is against principles and not against persons , namely Mr. Buckish nor Mr. Gilmore , that we are contending , and furthermore that we are contending not merely as Catholics but also and especially as citizens. Briefly summarized , the points of the case emphasized by Fr. Mulry are these : </insist.v.891><insist.v.892>The problem with this argument is that it ignores two critical points. First , if some Japanese or Western banks with heavy exposure to the troubled Asian economies were forced to write off their loans due to widespread debt default , this would have an impact that would be difficult to contain. The failure of large Japanese banks , for example , could trigger a meltdown in the Japanese financial markets. In turn , this would almost inevitably lead to a serious decline in stock markets around the world. That is the very risk that the IMF was trying to avoid in the first place by stepping in with financial support. Second , it is incorrect to imply that some banks have not had to pay the price for rash lending policies. In fact , the IMF has insisted on the closure of banks in Korea , Thailand and Indonesia. Moreover , foreign banks with short term-loans outstanding to Korean enterprises have been essentially forced by circumstances to reschedule those loans at interest rates that do not compensate for the extension of the loan maturity . </insist.v.892><insist.v.893>Incumbent-protection ca n't be the only factor involved.

Millett assailed the use of power and domination in the description of sexual activity and re-interpreted several undervalued works by women. One female-authored text on which she anchored her remarks was Charlotte Bronte 's Villette , a text that Millett argued had fallen victim to masculine critical prejudice because it refused to submit to the patriarchal social status quo. Even though Millett 's position on literature reflected an unproblematic conception of the literary text as a representation of life , her work is especially valuable for challenging the fixity of gender hierarchies and of gender itself , insisting that gender is culturally acquired sexual identity rather than a biological essence. Her reading of the texts of self-proclaimed homosexual Jean Genet , for example , indicates how easily masculine and feminine can be made , as terms , to slip; and how much they encode master and slave positions . </insist.v.895><insist.v.896>It depends upon the person.

In fact Lillian is directly quoted several times defending Frances ' decision not to resume her career.

I do n't want her to try to do too much at first. " When Frances herself was interviewed in July 1944 with Lillian present , press accounts state that Frances " shushed " Lillian when Lillian said that Frances had thought about pursuing a nursing career instead of going back into show business. In these contemporary first-hand interviews , Frances followed up Lillian 's comment by quickly stating that she intended to make a show business comeback as soon as possible . </insist.v.898><insist.v.899>Like Japan and the smaller ' Asian tigers ' , China did not develop by following the rules of the Washington consensus.

The current economic crisis is bringing a lot of attention to the issue of government regulation of the financial industry. The financial industry includes banks , stock markets , financial investment firms , and insurance companies. Policymakers must decide how much or how little government should be involved in overseeing or restricting these types of businesses. Some say that government regulations should be tightened. These people argue that the fact that the government did not regulate these businesses enough contributed to the current crisis. Others insist that too much government regulation has a negative affect on industry. These people insist that regulatory efforts will not necessarily help to improve the economy . </insist.v.902><insist.v.903>He invited the concerned parties to come back to the path of negotiation based on justice and truth . Suspension was neither an option nor a solution. The United States and the European Union three had unwarrantedly insisted on suspension , while they knew that was an unfair and unacceptable precondition for negotiations. Suspension had been in place for two years , and IAEA had repeatedly verified that Iran had fully suspended what it had agreed to suspend in each and every report from November 2003 to February 2006. So , it had had an experience of suspension , but there had been neither results nor solutions. If the time they had spent insisting on suspension and the efforts they had exerted to impose sanctions had been invested in genuine negotiation , it would have yielded much better results . </insist.v.903><insist.v.904>Consequently , in sitting as judge and jury to speak , it would require of the magistrate in Diplock court ' fashion to remind himself ' once having been convinced of the defen-dants guilt , to set aside any preconception or prejudices , in handing down out a sentence. Quite clearly , under such a system any defendant with a record , once charged would , faced with the inherent presumption of guilt , understand the need to prove his innocence. Many would also quickly come to understand , that even when innocent , copping a guilty plea might be preferable to pleading not guilty and subsequently incurring the possible wrath a vengeful magistrate. The then arbitrary nature of British justice , would not be lost on the bobby on the beat ' either , Any arrest where actual evidence other than the word of an officer ( s ) was absent , could result not only in a charge , but would also practically guarantee a verdict of guilty.

In the past two years , more than 300 cities and four states have passed resolutions calling on Congress to repeal or change parts of the USA Patriot Act that , activists say , violate constitutional rights such as free speech and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. Barring that , the resolutions declare that their communities will uphold the constitutional rights of their residents should federal law enforcement agents come knocking on the door of local authorities for assistance in tracking residents.

But it is the very keystone of the whole structure of legal mythology to insist that all earthly problems can and must be solved by reference to this great body of unearthly abstractions or , in short , that they can and must be solved by the lawyers . </insist.v.928><insist.v.929>Annan will follow his established routine.

He will , predictably , call for resuming talks unconditionally with Iran , echoing Tehran 's suggestion of " serious " negotiations.

The necessity to salvage this " strategic direction " may have been behind Putin 's conspicuous silence during the final rounds of the Iraq debate in the United Nations in February and March of 2003.

Do the EU and Russia share the same objectives in managing their common neighbourhood or does the prospect of EU membership , however distant if at all possible it might be at this time , for some of the common neighbours put the two sides on a collision course ? Perceptions are important here the inability of some EU member states to overcome their genuine fears of Russia and therefore insist on EU and NATO membership for those outside hoping to get in coupled with Moscow ' s propensity to have its say exclusively along its western periphery suggest that both sides consider the other as ' revisionist ' and prone to a zero-sum game type of relationship . </insist.v.934><insist.v.935>While you may insist on a traditional white church wedding , it 's important to know that you 're allowed to improvise on the content of the ceremony.

Yet even now this was not labour in the proper sense . [ 51 ] Labour begins , according to Engels , with the making of tools. But even then the fundamental distinction between humans and animals has not yet been made. Animals , says Engels , change the environment by their activities in the same way , even if not to the same extent , as man does , and these changes ... react upon and change those who made them . [ 52 ] It is not hard to see here the kind of dialectical process of natural development which Engels thought united the natural with the human world. Nevertheless , he was far from seeing this as a one sided identity. There was , just as in Marx and Engels ' early writings , not only an identity but also a difference between natural and human history. This is why Engels goes on to insist : </insist.v.938><insist.v.939>It was primarily due to the attraction of the ever-multiplying number of heresies that Ignatius insisted on the monarchial form of church government. If all doctrine originated in one person in each church , then all members could be expected to conform to that person 's teachings , and any disagreement with the " pastor " would automatically constitute heresy. This would end , supposedly , the divisions that were threatening to dissolve Christianity and impose a nicely unified facade before a still pagan world , and it was for this reason more than any other that the churches complied . </insist.v.939><insist.v.940>Tom McLaughlin points out some specific instances of media bias in the presidential campaign.

Another was humanism the view that human beings are of primary importance , and that avoiding harm to human beings is the first moral priority. Berlin therefore held that , in navigating between conflicting values , the first obligation is to avoid extremes of suffering. He insisted that moral collisions , even if unavoidable , can be softened , claims balanced , compromises reached. The goal should be the maintenance of a precarious equilibrium that avoids , as far as possible , desperate situations and intolerable choices. Philosophy itself can not tell us how to do this , though it can help by bringing to light the problem of moral conflict and all of its implications , and by weeding out false solutions. But in dealing with conflicts of values , the concrete situation is everything ( 1990 , 17 18 ) . </insist.v.944><insist.v.945>In late 1832 , he agreed to return to Ottoman territory to receive a ferman of pardon from the Sultan.

Disappointed , Grada evi was forced to obey the terms and rode on to Belgrade. He entered the city on October 14 in the manner of a true vizier , riding a horse decked out in silver and gold and accompanied by a large procession. He was greeted as a hero by the Muslims in Belgrade and treated like an equal by the local pasha. Grada evi stayed in the city for two months , during which his health deteriorated ( as was documented by local doctor Bartolomeo Kunibert ) . He left the city for stanbul in December , but as his daughter was still very young , his wife remained in Belgrade , joining him in the spring of the following year . </insist.v.945><insist.v.946>As noted in the Concerns section above , it is the approach of this website that certain branches of the Hebrew Roots movement can be spiritually harmful to Christians. Those which insist that outward man-made rituals are necessary in some way to promote spiritual growth can ensnare Christians in a bondage to attempting to get close to God by works of the flesh. And those which subordinate the New Testament , as if it is merely a poor and inferior addendum to the Old Testament , rather than the revelation of the Good News of salvation available through the blood of Jesus Christ , can lead Christians away from the true Gospel into the same sort of legalism condemned by Christ in the Pharisees of the first century . </insist.v.946><insist.v.947>These words of Mao Tse-tung establish that the CCP was a petty-bourgeois party not only because of its peasant composition but also in its ideology. Consequently , during the entire Anti-Japanese War , the CCP , by supporting the KMT ' s leadership , not only insisted on class collaboration in its propaganda but showed openly in its practice that the workers should increase production to aid the government in the common resistance against Japan. It rejected the exorbitant demands presented by the workers to the national bourgeoisie , charging that the Trotskyist policy of class struggle was a policy of betrayal to aid the enemy , thus slandering the Trotskyists as traitors. Naturally , in the workers ' real struggles the CCP was always on the side of the national bourgeoisie and against the workers ' reasonable demands , even sabotaging these struggles . </insist.v.947><insist.v.948>It is here , in the least prosperous regions , that the human impact of technological change is most keenly felt.

The ICFI and , in particular , the British Trotskyists of the Socialist Labour League demonstrated great political prescience at the 1966 Congress and its aftermath in opposing all efforts to denigrate the fight against Pabloite revisionism.

" The 1966 Conference of the IC expressed this clearly in insisting that the IC , through its struggle inside the FI , represented the continuity of the movement. Against Voix Ouvri re and Robertson , we insisted that only in the fight against Pabloism had Marxists preserved and developed the theory of the revolutionary party , of Bolshevism.

I could also mention those who call themselves Simonians after Simon , and those naming themselves Helenians after Helen , his consort. There are Christian sects named after Marcellina , Harpocratian Christians who trace themselves to Salome , and some who follow Mariamne and others who follow Martha , and still others who call themselves Marcionites after their leader , Marcion.

Our Women carried a steady stream of articles on the subject , addressing the question of whether equal wages would mean the sack for female employees and reporting on struggles. In 1969 it published a prize-winning short story about a woman who enters an all-male workplace. The boss wants to start bringing in women on lower pay to replace the men. The heroine , who insists on equal pay , thwarts his plans. There were quite a few small demonstrations on this and other issues. On International Women ' s Day 1952 , for example , the Newcastle group organised a 60-strong march to raise complaints about unemployment , housing , education , hospitals and food prices; a few days later they traveled to Sydney to lobby State Parliament. In 1964 a hundred people attended an equal pay conference in Canberra . </insist.v.952><insist.v.953>The advance of pro-Taliban militants in northwest Pakistan , fuelled by peace deals struck by the government three months ago , is contributing to the Taliban s ability to strike at coalition forces in Afghanistan , especially in the east just across the Pakistani border. Given heightening U.S. casualties in Afghanistan  " nine American soldiers were killed Sunday by Taliban militants at a U.S. base in Kunar Province bordering Pakistan  " Washington is less likely to acquiesce to Pakistani peace deals with militants and instead insist on military operations. Pakistan will have to confront domestic opposition and go back on the military offensive in the tribal areas , working closely with U.S. and NATO forces to control the Afghan-Pakistani border. Although such operations may be unpopular in Pakistan in the short-term , they are necessary if Pakistan wants to limit the chances of future U.S. unilateral military strikes that could lead to long-term destabilization of the country . </insist.v.953><insist.v.954>I did not give up.

These terms routinely are recited in our collective litanies of what needs to be addressed , but far less frequently made concrete and specific in policy plans and prevention strategies. As a community , we need to consistently insist that government officials commit to a long-term response to HIV that treats human rights as a central theme rather than an isolated issue that can be bargained away when politics get in the way.

These commentators may have exaggerated the practical impact of the decisions , however. Though the Court did insist that even in war executive detention of suspected enemy combatants must be subject to some form of review by a neutral tribunal , it suggested rules of procedure for any such review that omit important traditional protections for people accused of crimes.

Celsus maintains the Platonist vision of divinity. God is the Absolute Good of the The Symposium or the Ultimate Intelligence , beyond the Demiurge , of the Timaeus; God is the sunlike Logos in whose radiance all things become differentiated and intelligible. " What the sun is to visible things ... so is God to intelligible things " ( 111 ) . Christian literalism derails philosophical subtlety by displacing carefully differentiated concepts into gross figures : " A true son of God , " writes Celsus , " like the sun that illuminated the world by first illuminating itself , ought first to have been revealed as a true god " ( 64 ) .

Israel grows more prosperous and self-sufficient while the social , economic , political and demographic problems in the Arab countries worsen , yet the appeasers insist time is working against Israel. Some Israelis believe there will be real peace if only the " Palestinians " sign an agreement even though when they themselves shop in a souk , they do n't believe anything the Arab owner says without verifying it for themselves. In Newspeak , " disputed territories " meant land not held permanently by one of the Superstates; " disputed territories " is how Israel 's diplomats describe land they own by international law but are afraid to say so.

If the girl should be spared because she is innocent , much more should the innocent baby be spared since he/she is even more an innocent and helpless victim. Death should only be imposed upon a person as the wages of sin or high crime , not as the wages of innocence and victimization. If the innocent girl has her baby murdered through abortion , she is no longer innocent , but has become guilty of murdering an innocent and helpless human being.

Berlin also made a larger argument about making choices. Pluralism involves conflicts , and thus choices , not only between particular values in individual cases , but between ways of life. While Berlin seems to suggest that individuals have certain inherent traits an individual nature , or character , which can not be wholly altered or obscured he also insisted that they make decisions about who they will be and what they will do.

They insist that patients with CFIDS , fibromyalgia and MCS provide irrefutable objective evidence of their disabilities , yet reports from the insurers ' own medical departments are not subjected to the rigorous scrutiny which reports from claimants ' physicians must endure. The qualifications , medical experience and specialities of the insurers ' anonymous " in-house " physicians are unknown , and the outside physicians paid by insurers to perform independent medical examinations are often grossly unsuited to diagnose patients with these complex , poorly understood conditions. After waiting several months for a decision , a denied claimant may simply be told that " a preponderance of medical evidence points to a psychological illness , although this preponderance is never produced. Similarly , claimants who asked for ERISA reviews ( see below ) from one insurer received identical , boiler-plate letters asserting that " our decision still stands. " Those who asked what was needed to perfect their claims were never given this important information . </insist.v.1100><insist.v.1101> I appreciate the fact that the Secretary of the Treasury has reemphasized that increased lending activity is the only legitimate purpose for taxpayer funding of these institutions.

Yet , the government is more vigilant in attacking private threats to its monopoly over first-class mail delivery than in expediting the mail. First-class mail service is significantly slower than it was 40 years ago , in part because of an intentional policy of reducing next-day mail deliveries. In areas in which the postal service competes directly with private companies , such as overnight express mail and parcel post , the government has been whupped shamelessly. Citizens can not be indebted to the government for mail service when it is federal restrictions that prohibit a far wider array of private services . </insist.v.1102><insist.v.1103>After all , the mills started out not even knowing how to make recycled paper. Now almost every paper company makes some , plus there are new deinking mills. Fixing the new deinking technology makes sense if customers are clamoring for the paper made from their pulp. After all , no virgin pulp , no matter how cheap , can destroy the markets for our deinking mills if customers insist on postconsumer content. Suppliers would be stocking their shelves with wide varieties of recycled paper if customers would accept nothing else. Printers would realize they 'd lose business if they did n't have recycled paper at affordable prices. Remember , that single distributor in Los Angeles was well-informed because a major customer insisted on recycled paper , benefiting all other potential recycled paper buyers , too . </insist.v.1103><insist.v.1104>51. The importance of achieving an intelligent appropriation of the faith can also be established by examining the nature and purpose of education. As we have noted elsewhere , " a truly liberating and elevating education is incomplete without the study of theology or religion. " 34 We must continue to encourage the study of religion in our society as a whole because , as Cardinal Newman insisted , religious truth has an inherent value and is " not only a portion but a condition of general knowledge. " 35 Educated persons should know something of the history , teachings , and practices of the various world religions and be especially versed in the Judeo-Christian tradition , which shaped Western civilization in general and our own culture in particular. Furthermore , they should be aware of the religious aspects of other disciplines , such as literature , history , and art , as well as the religious dimension of our contemporary culture.36 </insist.v.1104><insist.v.1105>i have a tenant who is moving out at the end of the month and i have just recieved my electricity bill today only to realise dat it is very huge due to her using an electric heater ! i told her in october last year that she isn ' t allowed to se an electric heater as the house has central heating. this was just after i receved a $ 300 electric bill in one month after she moved in. i receive my bills every quarter and now it is $ 600 ! she is insisting on having back her security deposit but i can not pay this bill ! what is my right ? her deposit is only $ 260 . </insist.v.1105><insist.v.1106>Meanwhile HR 1207 and S604 , legislation to open up the Fed ' s books to a complete audit , continue to gain momentum in Congress as the people continue to insist on real transparency of the Federal Reserve.

Besides the Hechalot published by Jellinek in 1873 , Schmidt mentions as a Hebrew Enoch source the Sefer Hechalot of R. Ishmael ( Lemberg , 1864 ) , but insists that " the Hebrew Enoch contains material that appears to have been drawn from both Ethiopic and Slavonic Enoch . . . as well as from other sources , " thus regarding it , as S.

The side of the spirit of Davos is split between those whose vision of the future involves an unremitting harshness of strategy and institution-building and those who insist that such a vision would create an untenable system , which could not last. At the moment , it is a very divided camp. The side of the spirit of Porto Alegre has other problems. They constitute politically merely a loose alliance of variegated movements all over the world which , today at least , meet together within the framework of the World Social Forum ( WSF ) . Collectively , they have no clear strategy as yet.

What can I do to convince her otherwise ? </insist.v.1110><insist.v.1111>The more ethnically and culturally diverse America becomes , the harder we must all work to affirm our common civic culture -- the values and democratic institutions we share and that define our national identity as Americans. This means we should resist an " identity politics " that confers rights and entitlements on groups and instead affirm our common rights and responsibilities as citizens. Multiethnic democracy requires fighting discrimination against marginalized groups; empowering the disadvantaged to join the economic , political , and cultural mainstream; and respecting diversity while insisting that what we have in common as Americans is more important than how we differ. One way to encourage an ethic of citizenship and mutual obligation is to promote voluntary national service. If expanded to become available to everyone who wants to participate , national service can help turn the strong impulse toward volunteerism among our young people into a major resource in addressing our social problems. It will also help revive a sense of patriotism and national unity at a time when military service is no longer the common experience of young Americans . </insist.v.1111><insist.v.1112>Of course , Washington insiders insist that the balls are , as one put it , " for the great unwashed "; true insiders go to private dinners or just stay home.

They sometimes think that the teaching of the Church is that the Pope is infallible; therefore , he ca n't sin. That 's nonsense , although the present Pontiff goes to confession , I understand , at least once a week. He 's got to have something to confess for it to be a valid sacrament administered to him. Others think that he always says the best thing at the right time. No , the Church has never insisted upon the fact that the Pope will always say the best thing at the right time. Rather , the teaching of the Church would allow for the Pope perhaps to postpone out of cowardice , a right thing. Or when he says the truth , when he teaches the truth , he might do so in a way that includes an ambiguity . </insist.v.1115><insist.v.1116>In a sense , Gramsci 's concept led historically to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. To escape the dominance of right-wing nationalist intellectuals in the German academy , Weber insisted on the legitimacy of value-neutrality. To escape the dominance in the Italian intellectual arena of centrist liberalism represented by value-neutrality , Gramsci insisted on the organicity of the intellectuals which was interpreted to mean their subordination to political leadership. If the persecution of Galileo provided the moral tale for the claim of intellectuals to freedom from those who said they incarnated Establishment ( Christian ) morality , the persecution of Soviet biologists by Lysenko/Stalin provided the moral tale of the claim of intellectuals to freedom from the party that said it incarnated antisystemic morality . </insist.v.1116><insist.v.1117>Let me begin by asking you two questions as you look at v8-11 of Titus 3. What things should be insisted on if a new church or even an older one is to grow and make a difference for Jesus Christ in the midst of an increasingly anti Christian culture ? And what things should be avoided ? Have a think for a moment. Well did you see the contrast between verses 8 and 9 ? You see Paul mentions three things to Titus here in chapter 3 that are to be stressed or insisted on , which is a better translation , because they are excellent and profitable for everyone and others that are to be avoided because they are unprofitable and useless. So first , in v8 he says implicitly : </insist.v.1117><insist.v.1118>Socialization can be an immensely effective tool , having the dual capacity to do both great good and great harm. Thus , it is essential that it be entrusted to those who use it with extensive knowledge and discipline.

Purity of use is the minimum standard . </insist.v.1118><insist.v.1119>Dave and Angie speculated about Clarice 's hysterics. Ada and Angie doubted when Ray was confident he 's run Olive out of town.

Olive denied knowing Willis , but blew it by letting it slip to Angie that she knew he was in San Diego. Russ and Dave whispered about her post-partum fixation as a confused Clarice insisted to Ada she has to leave town with the baby because she does n't know who to trust. Sharlene told Molly she and Russ will be moving away and warned her not to believe everything Willis tells her. Carol assured a worried Olive that Angie has no proof against Willis , then denied Willis had any romantic interest in Alice. Russ was hurt and confused when Sharlene complained about the pervasiveness of his family. Sharlene was shocked when Angie told her Willis was in San Diego . </insist.v.1119><insist.v.1120>Carl Clemen in 1898 found no less than twelve separate traditions in Enoch and made much of the changes of person " as betraying the composite character of the work. " 162 Charles suggests that Enoch is " built up on the debris " of an older Noah saga and insists that " the Parables are distinct in origin , " as are the cosmological sections.163 Every possible theory has been suggested by the experts to account for the book. As R. H. Charles notes , every scholar divides up the Books of Enoch differently and assigns different dates to them.164 As early as 1840 , M. Stuart had the perspicacity to note that " the tone and tenor of the book has many resemblances to passages in the Zend Avesta "; 165 while Sieffert sees part of it by a Chasid of the age of Simon Maccabbee and part by an Essene before 64 B.C. , Philippi finds it written entirely " in Greek by ONE author , a Christian , about A.D. 100.

During his stay in India each time , he spent a week at Sri Ramanasramam. He adores Ramana and Nisargadatta. This time he attended the Kovalam Seminar [ in India 's Kerala state ] for the first time. The first thing which bothered him was that the organisers and Ramesh kept insisting that the attendees of the seminar who had already paid a fortune [ by Indian standards ] for the seminar ( 1000 Euros ) [ approx. $ 770 US ] could always donate more money. On top of this , the man who organised the whole thing , gave each of the 150 attendees an envelope to contribute 1500 Rupees [ c. $ 40 US ] each for the workers in the hotel , to thank them for the hospitality , etc ...

Instead , they see the showdown as part of a broader market-based adjustment. Pharmacy is moving inexorably towards a more rational and market-based payment system. " AMP is a relatively small part of the story , " explained Adam J. Fein , Ph.D. , founder and president of Pembroke Consulting. " Pharmacists are being exposed to economic realities that they have n't faced before that are removing protections that protected them from fundamental economic realities. Retail pharmacy is now experiencing what has happened in other retail sectors over the past 25 years. Pharmacies need to get big , get focused , or get out.

The principal assures me it does , and the reason she 's able to say so with certainty is because you measure.

Some jump in to ask questions. Yet conventional wisdom dictates that the mediator should let the parties engage in their catharsis uninterrupted There are two problems with this. First , lawyers not clients usually deliver the opening so it is rarely a catharsis for anyone save the lawyer. Second , too many lawyers hear only so much of the other side ' s case as is necessary to refute it. As CEDR correctly points out : There is a difference between hearing and listening. Hearing involves the capacity to be aware of and to receive sound; listening involves not only receiving sounds but understanding their meaning. That is why so many experienced mediator-advocates are today waiving their openings , insisting instead that the other side particularly the other side ' s executives read their written submissions in lieu of an oral presentation. If openings are used to let a party have his ( not his lawyer ' s ) day in court and allow him to express his anger they are invaluable. If not , written submissions are more effective . </insist.v.1138><insist.v.1139>All the propaganda paid off.

And he went to Memphis , Tennessee , to support a strike of garbage workers in that city. There , standing on a balcony outside his hotel room , he was shot to death by an unseen marksman.

Word of the brush-off left the actress shattered , and filming was delayed again. Shortly afterward , Monroe was bedridden with a bronchial infection and missed two more days on the set. When Monroe was working , director George Cukor would often punish his fragile star by insisting on dozens of unnecessary retakes , undermining her confidence.

These goals are a tall order , particularly at an agency that was widely ( and rightly ) acknowledged as one of the best in Washington for many years , and one that has strived to constantly improve both its process and its substantive analysis.

[ 3 ] By bringing to light often subconscious presuppositions and models , and scrutinising their validity , philosophy identifies errors and confusions that lead to misunderstanding , distort experience , and thus do real harm. Because philosophy calls commonly accepted assumptions into question , it is inherently subversive , opposed to all orthodoxy , and often troubling; but this is inseparable from what makes philosophy valuable , and indeed indispensable , as well as liberating. Philosophy 's goal , Berlin concluded , was ' to assist men to understand themselves and thus operate in the open , and not wildly , in the dark ' ( 1978b , 11 ) . </insist.v.1155><insist.v.1156>rent year. This notice they repudiated , insisting that they were not tenants of the plaintiff at all; they utterly deny having ever recognized him as their landlord. Well then they have placed themselves in this dilemma. They were either tenants of the plaintiff or they were not. If they were , their tenancy was duly determined by sufficient notice before the commencement of the present action. If they were not the plaintiff ' s tenants they continued to be what they were ever since the expiration of McCaffrey ' s lease on the 15th November , 1887 , mere trespassers on the plaintiff ' s property without shadow of right , and so in June , 1888 , when the distress warrant against McCaffrey was executed , not in a position to claim any privity with McCaffrey , whose interest had terminated in November , 1887 , and who has not since claimed to have any interest in the premises. They can not , therefore , insist by any defence to the present action that a new tenancy by estoppel had been created between McCaffrey and the plaintiff by the execution of the distress warrant against McCaffrey in June , 1888 , and that such new tenancy had not been determined by any notice to quit given to McCaffrey . </insist.v.1156><insist.v.1157>While China continues to insist its military expansion is purely defensive in nature , yesterday the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs expressed his doubts : They are developing capabilities that are very maritime focused , maritime and air focused , and in many ways , very much focused on us. </insist.v.1157><insist.v.1158>For what it 's worth , " Money " disputes it all as fluidly as he fires off one of his lightening-fast combinations.

If Brando thought acting wasn ' t for grown ups , maybe this lay in the problem of acting as opposed to being , that cinema still demanded too much action for an actor who was given to the relative stillness of the gesture. And yet there ' s a curious appropriateness to this for a critic looking to make sense of Brando ' s career. We ' re left not searching out the narrative arc of a great career , but the various details and touches throughout that career that wouldn ' t insist on Last Tango in Paris being a highpoint , per se , but instead a useful starting point.

Although he requested , and initially was granted , permission to proceed [ 422 U.S. 806 , 837 ] pro se , petitioner has expressed no dissatisfaction with the lawyer who represented him and has not alleged that his defense was impaired or that his lawyer refused to honor his suggestions regarding how the trial should be conducted.

This might be an argument for preferring veterans for elected and appointed positions , but the establishment of all-volunteer armed forces in the 1970s has severely contracted the pool of such potential candidates. Nor is it entirely clear that a brief tour as a conscripted eighteen-year-old private actually prepares someone to rule on issues of grand strategy decades later.

In addition , Western banks would agree to fold additional loans into the IMF loans , to produce a package of loans which the indebted countries would be asked to accept.

The Athanasian creed insists that Christians should " neither confound the Persons , nor divide the Substance. " Jones succeeds in the former but fails in the latter.

The foreign supporters of the PA the European Union , the Israeli Left ( this includes the current Israeli government ) , and the American State Department did the only thing they could do : they ignored what the PA said and substituted their own scripts.

This also was the practice of the Reformers. For purposes of this dialogue , it is important to note the pope 's insistence on the " unity and identity " of the sacrament of Order , " which no Catholic has ever been able to call in question , " despite the fact that there are slightly different rites for ordaining deacons , presbyters and bishops , ( 403 ) and that the pope refers to the three " orders " in the plural when discussing the rites.

While on the one hand most seminary-level textbooks on systematic theology and hermeneutics by highly educated theologians omit tithing , on the other hand the practice is quickly becoming a requirement for church membership in the very denominations which insist on solid Bible-based doctrines. There is also increasing evidence that lay persons who question the legitimacy of New Covenant tithing are usually criticized and ignored as being troublemakers or weak Christians.

" Generally the plots are simple and frequently improbable. However , the point was not to produce a literary masterpiece " ( p. 119 ) . Here you can see the penury of Vogel 's literary judgment. The Book of Mormon is indeed a literary masterpiece and it obtains its quality through repetition , allusion to biblical narrative , and internal allusion the very elements Vogel finds faulty. I am not the only reader who has insisted on the complexity of Book of Mormon narrative.

The preceding analysis leads to the conclusion that the complementarity of local and regional ministry is normative within the ordained ministry of the church , paralleling the normative complementarity of the face-to-face eucharistic assembly and the primary regional community. It would be a mistake to insist that either the parish/congregation or the diocese/synod is exclusively the local church. Likewise , the doctrine of ministry would be distorted by insisting that either the presbyter or the bishop is the only theologically necessary ordained minister , thereby dismissing the other , bishop or presbyter , as practically necessary but theologically insignificant. Lutherans often have insisted that the bishop is a pastor with a larger sphere of ministry , without seeing the distinctiveness of the role of a pastor to a communion of communities , each led by its own ordained minister. Recent Catholic theology often fails adequately to explain why priests are theologically necessary , in addition to bishops , and not merely practically necessary to the church . </insist.v.1229><insist.v.1230>However , the home minister is believed to have told the delegation that a CBI probe would be time-consuming.

Berlin credited to Herder the insight that belonging , and the sense of self-expression that membership bestows , are basic human needs; but it seems unlikely that he would have had to learn this lesson from Herder it is more probable that it was his own appreciation of these needs that attracted him to that author in the first place. He was sharply aware of the pain of humiliation and dependency , the hatefulness and hurtfulness of paternalistic rule. His individualism and emphasis on liberty were qualified by his understanding of the human need for a sense of belonging to a community an awareness sharpened , if not generated , by his own experience of exile , as well as by the influence of his mother 's passionate Zionism.

To that end , they must insist that government act openly and transparently to the greatest extent possible. In the Twenty- First Century , this entails making its data available online and easy to access. If government data is made available online in useful and flexible formats , citizens will be able to utilize modern Internet tools to shed light on government activities.

What analysis of this story suggests , in fact , is the presence of a process that actually took place in Europe as well , and which has been thoroughly expounded on.103 As opportunities for expression grew , and print media outlets increased , societies developed discourses on themselves , and , in effect , essentialized themselves. Furthermore , this process is similar to the imagined communities that Benedict Anderson posits for nationalism. Again , however , his focus on that category ignores smaller community development.104 In fact , I propose that larger discourses on the nation , the body ( sexuality ) , and even language did not arise until discourses on the self , made possible through the expression of historical solidarities at the local level , had emerged. Until people developed a way to articulate who they were in a limited field to those along side them and to those on the outside , they did not have the tools to link themselves to larger discursive ( imagined ) units , even with the appearance of such mechanisms as Anderson 's print capitalism . </insist.v.1240><insist.v.1241>Upon closer analysis , however , there are two worthwhile responses to this concern. First , as noted above , the Supreme Court seems likely to insist on other structural or procedural guarantees of the neutrality of the decisionmaker , even though that person can be a military officer.123 Insulating the hearing officer from the base commander 's authority , or requiring appellate review by a wholly separate and specialist appellate unit , are possible steps that reviewing courts could require.

Unless we insist on government legislation that obliges industry to take a leading role in responsibility for waste , industry will not seriously introduce waste reduction measures into its products and packaging.

In both cases this Court upheld the convictions , holding that neither an uncounseled waiver of jury trial nor an uncounseled guilty plea is inherently defective under the Constitution. The language which the Court so carefully excises from those opinions relates , not to an affirmative right of self-representation , but to [ 422 U.S. 806 , 841 ] the consequences of waiver. 4 In Adams , for example , Mr. Justice Frankfurter was careful to point out that his reference to a defendant 's " correlative right to dispense with a lawyer 's help " meant only that " [ h ] e may waive his Constitutional right to assistance of counsel . . . , " 317 U.S. , at 279 .

The European Commission will certainly insist that EU members should authorize it for negotiating the problem with the USA on behalf of the European Commission. However , according to the European laws in force , the European Commission doesn ' t have such rights.

Development on the other hand fosters security. While I accept that today the notion of security transcends security in the military sense , it is also true that other issues encapsulated within the idea of security can not be realised without military security. It is for this reason that Adam Smith , as far back as 1776 , observed that " the first duty of the sovereign , that of protecting the society from the violence and invasion of other independent societies , can be performed only by military force " . For this reason , he insisted that the defence budget should constitute the first charge on the treasury . </insist.v.1271><insist.v.1272>Whether real or apparent , this confusion has brought fresh fuel to the arguments of those opposed to scientific exegesis. The diversity of interpretations only serves to show , they say , that nothing is gained by submitting biblical texts to the demands of scientific method; on the contrary , they allege , much is lost thereby. They insist that the result of scientific exegesis is only to provoke perplexity and doubt upon numerous points which hitherto had been accepted without difficulty.

As Doug Wilson and Steve Wilkins claim in their Southern Slavery as It Was ( Canon Press , 1996 ) , most slaves were very happy second class citizens because their godly masters treated them very well. ( In a talk in Moscow , Idaho in February , 2003 , Wilkins made the outrageous claim that Islam was a violent religion because it did not have the Trinity. ) Here are the real conformists : top males who insist that everyone conform to their wills and the commands they claim come from their gods . </insist.v.1273><insist.v.1274>They hired an employee in 2005 who ended up stealing my credit card on file , buying thousands of dollars of computer equipment online , and shipping it to a border town just north of Mexico.

Therefore , whenever overseas believers come to visit or give training to the local churches , the churches tend to present their warmest hospitality with a table full of wonderful delicacies. When eating out , they always insist on paying the bill , showing appreciation and love for their fellow believers. Co-worker W shared that once during a training mission , he ate out together with the local co-workers. After the meal , an accompanying co-worker of his and a local pastor 's wife caused embarrassment by insisting on paying the bill. Mainland co-workers regard hospitality as an important duty and feel obliged to pay the bill while on the other hand , knowing about their church 's financial situation , we do not expect them to pay. Co-worker W concluded that next time they should reach an agreement on who to pay the bill beforehand , for example , by taking turns to pay. Mainland co-workers are not well-off , yet they have much dignity and can give to visiting brothers and sisters.

Though Tshekedi insisted that he personally had nothing against the Council , and that in recommending its abolition he was merely following the wishes of the Tribe , there can be little doubt that he was only too glad to be rid of it. If he were to be effective ruler of the Bangwato rather than a puppet of the Ratshosas , they had to be broken. A first step towards achieving this was to abolish the Council in which they would be a dominant force. As far as the British administration was concerned Tshekedi seemed to giving into reactionary elements in the morafe , for as Captain Neale lamented , there were many progressive Natives in the Bamangwato Reserve , who apart from the Ratshosas , wish the old style of autocratic rule to be definitely finished with.

They vehemently insist a preacher ( the passage only addresses bishops , however ) or deacon must have been married only one time or else he is not qualified for the ministry. When questioned some of them will even go as far as saying , " The passage definitely does n't mean to have one wife at a time.

He argues that the class struggle can either result in ruin or revolution . Which possibility actually materialises is clearly dependent on the course of the class struggle. In this respect Engels ' thought reproduced towards the end of his life exactly the patterns which he and Marx had first described in the Communist Manifesto in their youth. There the fate of capitalism is described as either proletarian revolution or the common ruin of the contending classes .

A methodological naturalist would insist on explaining all phenomena , however strange , in natural terms. Elijah setting fire to the water-drenched sacrifice , for instance , would be explained in terms of lightning striking or some such thing. The latter is the philosophical stance that insists that there is nothing beyond the natural no God , no supernatural , no nothing. ' Naturalism is a metaphysical doctrine , which means simply that it states a particular view of what is ultimately real and unreal. According to naturalism , what is ultimately real is nature , which consists of the fundamental particles that make up what we call matter and energy , together with the natural laws that govern how those particles behave.

These officers were told that the " primary result " of the Rio conversations " should be the creation of joint Defense Commissions in Washington and Rio for the purpose of preparing staff plans for the joint defense of Northeast Brazil , " but that the conversations " should not involve the question of the stationing at present of large forces of American troops in Northeast Brazil.

There is , however , no reason to think that the gospel of Luke wishes to contradict the gospels of Mark or Matthew. Good practice in biblical interpretation would rather say that we should interpret the brief statement without a context in Luke in the light of the longer statements with context given in both Mark and Matthew. We must conclude that Luke is also speaking the language of moral obligation in justice and love rather than law. To dismiss a wife because a man had met another woman he preferred and to leave this wife and the children of the marriage without a family in a world that was built on families was a violation of both justice and love and , therefore , in the eyes of Jesus , adultery. If to the words of Luke we add all we know about the person of Jesus , we must once again see Jesus insisting , with all the force at his command , on the rights and dignity of the woman and on the moral obligations that flowed from this . </insist.v.1321><insist.v.1322>And those people are embarrassed by the rantings of obscurantists who live in bunkers on their compounds and insist that the earth is only 10 , 000 years old.

In its heyday , the Soviet Union girdled half the globe , from Lvov to Kamchatka , yet never found it hard to find people willing to die for an abstraction called Mother Russia. At this moment , the far end of Hawaii lies 5 , 500 miles from this room. Portugese territory is 3 , 000 miles closer to Teaneck. But would not the nerve fibers of every good American here this morning bristle to learn of an attack on Hawaiian soil ? Given our constant willingness to memorize such abstractions , to re-memorize them as they change over time , and then to die for them , it should be possible to train very large numbers of people to live their lives for the general good ( as opposed to insisting on economic incentives ) . As people grow used to the idea of living in a just society , they may no longer require substantial economic incentives in order to create beneficial innovations. Eventually , the planet may tend toward becoming a loose confederation of kibbutzim , featuring almost perfect equality . </insist.v.1328><insist.v.1329>7. Given the magnitude of this case , it was also clear error for the Circuit Court to have decided these issues with such inadequate procedures. Contrary to defendants ' suggestion ( Br. 42 ) , we do not insist that judges conduct trials to approve settlements , but they must provide procedures commensurate with the issues to be resolved and the amounts at stake. For example , the district court in Amchem Products , Inc. , v. Windsor , 117 S.Ct. 2231 ( 1997 ) , held an 18-day evidentiary hearing , after many weeks of discovery , in order to provide an appropriate record for the appellate courts. See Georgine v. Amchem Products , Inc. , 83 F.3d 610 , 621 ( 3rd Cir. 1996 ) . At the very least , something more than five hours of non-evidentiary argument was required to probe the factual and legal issues raised by the settlement. Moreover , there is surely no basis for Class Counsel 's assertions ( Br. 55 ) that what emerged from that hearing were " findings of fact " to which some deference is owed , or that the " trial court found that there would be substantial benefits to the members of the class from the foundation " ( Br. 63 ) ( emphasis added ) . </insist.v.1329><insist.v.1330>Two leading theorists of the discipline of non-violent conflict resolution , John Burton and Roger Fisher , insist that all conflict stems from identical causes ( though they do not agree on those causes ) and the same techniques designed to ameliorate small groups ' differences by fulfilling basic needs or by blending interests can at the national and international level manage conflict and/or end the need for war. Perhaps because both of these men , like Gene Sharp , the theorist of civilian based defense , were writing to persuade secular academics and military strategists of the value of their perspectives , they divorced themselves from religious and moral precepts and ran away from rather than seeking , any direct contact with modern pacifists. Instead , they advocated a secular method for bringing secular results creating a win/win situation as a way of managing rather than solving conflicts . </insist.v.1330><insist.v.1331>SPEER : That was in 1943 when Himmler wanted me to get a high rank in the SS. He had often wanted it before when I was still an architect. I got out of it by saying that I was willing to be an ordinary SS man under him because I had already been an SS man before. Thereupon , Gruppenfuhrer Wolff provisionally filled out an application form and wanted to know what my previous SS activities had been in 1932. It came up during his inquiries that in those days I was never registered as a member of the SS , and because of this they did not insist on my joining as I did not want to become a new member now . </insist.v.1331><insist.v.1332>Similarly , Perle told journalist John Pilger in 2002 that " if we just let our vision of the world go forth , and we embrace it entirely and we do n't try to piece together clever diplomacy , but just wage a total war ... our children will sing great songs about us years from now.

Fifty years ago , when Europeans and Americans still distinguished high culture from popular culture , and when classical learning was still highly esteemed in colleges and universities , C. P.

" Snow did more than warn of the growing split between the old culture of the humanities and the rising culture of science. He took Britain 's literary aristocracy to task for its dangerous dismissal of scientific and technological progress , which Snow believed offered the solutions to the world 's deepest problems. In a vitriolic response to Snow , the literary critic F. R. Leavis defended the primacy of the humanities for a civilizing education , insisting that science must not be allowed to operate outside of the moral norms that a first-rate humanistic education alone could provide. The Snow-Leavis debate spread also to this side of the Atlantic , triggering for a time serious and searching discussions regarding the aims of higher education and the importance of the humanities . </insist.v.1335><insist.v.1336>6. The threat posed by the International Criminal Court to Israelis should not be underestimated.

It is derived from the fundamental Marxist theory that under the modern capitalist system including that in the backward countries it is the urban class that leads the rural masses.

In other words , if local people are responsible or the state is responsible , that 's where the primary funding ought to come.

Jesus , to be sure , was as insistent as his fellow townspeople , but his insistence had a different basis. Whereas the people of Nazareth insisted upon having the privilege of looking down their noses at the Son of God , Jesus insisted upon the fulfillment of the will of our heavenly Father. He told them that the prophesy of Isaiah had been fulfilled in their hearing , and demonstrating that they had no power over him , he escaped their clutches and preserved his life from their evil designs. Jesus did not insist on his own way but upon the truth , the pursuit of virtue , and the fulfillment of God ' s plan of redemption for His people.

For example , Bultmann 's existentialist interpretation tends to enclose the Christian message within the constraints of a particular philosophy. Moreover , by virtue of the presuppositions insisted upon in this hermeneutic , the religious message of the Bible is for the most part emptied of its objective reality ( by means of an excessive " demythologization " ) and tends to be reduced to an anthropological message only. Philosophy becomes the norm of interpretation , rather than an instrument for understanding the central object of all interpretation : the person of Jesus Christ and the saving events accomplished in human history. An authentic interpretation of Scripture , then , involves in the first place a welcoming of the meaning that is given in the events and , in a supreme way , in the person of Jesus Christ . </insist.v.1391><insist.v.1392>It is not easy to combat Jewish naturalism in public life and at the same time keep oneself free from racial hatred , which is itself but a form of naturalism. Yet it must be done. On March 25th 1928 , the Congregation of the Holy Office abolished the association called The Friends of Israel , which in action and language had departed from the mind of the Church and of the Fathers and had adopted a mode of procedure abhorrent to the liturgy , thus falling into naturalism. Nevertheless in that same decree , the Church insists upon the fact that she habitually prays for the Jewish people which was the custodian of the divine promises down to Jesus Christ , and this , in spite of , nay rather on account of , their subsequent blindness. Actuated by this spirit of charity the Apostolic See has protected this people against unjust treatment and , as it condemns every kind of hatred and jealousy between nations , so in a special manner it condemns hatred of the people once chosen by God , namely , that hatred commonly designated as ' Anti-Semitism.

Wellhausen insists that the 8th century version ( i.e. Ibn Ishaq ) was accurate , and later versions were deliberate fictions designed to alter the 8th century story. Caetani and Cammens suggest that most sira were invented to construct an 'ideal ' past and a justification for contemporary exaggerated exegesis of the Koran. Most scholars conclude that the stories about Muhammad prior to becoming a prophet are fictitious. In his important critique of the hadith Goldhizer argues that many hadith accepted even by the most rigorous collectors were 8th and 9th century forgeries with fictitious isnads. These hadith arose out of quarrels between the 'Umayyads and their opponents both sides freely inventing hadith to support their respective positions. The manufacture of hadith speeded up under the 'Abbasids who were vying with the 'Alids for primacy. Even Muslims acknowledged a vast number of forgeries [ ~90 of hadith were discarded ] , but even so the collectors were not as rigorous as could be hoped. Even in the 10th century over 200 forgeries were identified in Bukhari.

It involved a conscious recognition both of the theoretical elements in any empirical study and the necessary empirical basis on which any theoretical generalisation must stand. And once again Engels ' critics largely rely on removing one side or the other of his approach; they then insist that what remains proves that he was either a Hegelian intent on pushing the natural world into the preconceived forms of the dialectic , or a positivist who had abandoned the key terms of Marx ' s dialectic . </insist.v.1407><insist.v.1408>[ Such " paedobaptist writers " are the defenders of the Biblical baptism of whole households.

Yet , in reality , our culture is still now , just as our founders insisted back then strongly ( if insecurely ) secular. While there was much fear of a societal breakup from moral values ( like abortion and gay marriage ) in this last election , it is important to see that this is nothing new; it is just the latest round in the ongoing saga of America ' s struggle with itself. Since our Revolution , the same wars have been fought between those who fear that reforms will make America an unlimited secular , pluralistic society , versus those who want to take that same idea all the way to the end , to where it finally does meet the declared promise of our Republic . </insist.v.1439><insist.v.1440>I would never offer to pay half the bill if a guy asked me to dinner.

The employer there operated manufacturing plants in Bessemer and North Birmingham , Alabama , and a third in Burlington , New Jersey. A different certified union represented each plant 's employees , and contract negotiations were taking place at each plant during the same period of time. The unions at both Alabama plants demanded contract termination dates that would coincide at all three plants , to which the employer refused to agree. The Board upheld the trial examiner 's conclusion that contract duration is a mandatory subject of bargaining and that insisting on a specific expiration date was not evidence of bad-faith bargaining. Further , the Board found it unnecessary to analyze the impact , if any , the unions ' contract demands had on the scope of the certified single-plant units.

This personal engagement serves several critical law enforcement goals. First , by involving a high-level executive in the sentencing process , the corporate icon proceeding commands the attention of uppermost corporate management. The criminal proceeding is no longer a matter entrusted solely to lawyers. Second , if the company 's control system has been deficient , thus permitting the criminal activity to occur , the icon proceeding may highlight the deficiencies and publicly commit the CEO to improvement. Third , if the company 's top managers have been complicit in the crime or if the company has sought to thwart the government 's investigation of the crime , those facts , too , may be brought to light in the icon proceeding.

Vaillant , as a good Catholic , meets the challenge : While the Hebrew Enoch is " badly constructed , confused , and murky , the Christian Enoch is reasonable , orderly , and clear. " So it was the Christians who really organized the old Jewish materials and in the process " invented another history , " which lets the Jews out.195 In the same spirit , Weisse , Hofmann , and Philippi all insisted that Enoch was a Christian work , on the " dogmatic principle , " according to Charles , that Christianity had to be vindicated " in its pure originality.

So it is that Engels writes , To me there could be no question of building the laws of dialectics into nature , but of discovering them in it and evolving them from it. [ 69 ] It was not only in relation to natural science that it was important not to impose dialectical laws from the outside.

Herbert Hoover wrote to a friend on August 8 , 1945 , " The use of the atomic bomb , with its indiscriminate killing of women and children , revolts my soul. " [ 60 ] Such attacks mounted over the next decade and a half , leading Medford Evans to write in a 1959 article in William F. Buckley 's National Review , " The indefensibility of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima is becoming part of the national conservative creed " [ 61 ] Even the notorious hawk Edward Teller would later insist , somewhat disingenuously , that he too had opposed use of the bomb , explaining , in 1970 , to Harvard biologist and Nobel laureate George Wald , " My reason for opposing the dropping of the bomb on Japan was that this action seemed to be wrong and unjustified.

" New Jersey sports authority chief George Zoffinger , who had criticized the Giants deal as too costly for the state , said yesterday that a roof could allow the state to bring in moneymaking events like the NCAA Final Four - ca n't argue with that - but that it 's too expensive for the state to pay for - or that - and concluded that there could yet be a coming battle between the state and the teams over the roof issue.

At that point , Republican leaders looked over Andrew Johnson 's handiwork and expressed their displeasure. Congress immediately refused to seat the senators and representatives of the states the president had " restored. " Instead , Radical leaders insisted , Congress needed to learn more about conditions in the postwar South. There must be assurances that the former Confederates had accepted their defeat and that emancipated blacks and loyal whites would be protected. Accordingly , Congress set up the new Joint Committee on Reconstruction to investigate conditions in the South and to advise Congress in laying down a Reconstruction policy of its own. The period of " congressional " or " Radical " Reconstruction had begun . </insist.v.1456><insist.v.1457>The bishops heard of the contemplated measure through Dr. Globke in the Ministry of the Interior , and they reacted promptly. On November 11 , 1942 , Archbishop Bertram , in the name of the episcopate , addressed a letter of protest against the planned compulsory divorce legislation to the Ministers of Justice , Interior and Ecclesiastical Affairs. The intervention of the bishops , he insisted , was not due 'to lack of love for the German nationality , lack of a feeling of national dignity , and also not to underestimation of the harmful Jewish influences upon German culture and national interests. ' The bishops merely felt called upon to emphasize that the duty of humane treatment also existed toward the members of other races. Among the persons affected by the contemplated measure , Bertram went on , were many thousands of Catholics whose marriages , according to Catholic doctrine , were indissoluble. Respect for the religious rights of the Catholic Christians was an indispensable condition for the peaceful co-operation of Church and State , which had never been as necessary as in the present situation. The bishops therefore hoped , the letter ended , that the government would withdraw the planned divorce ordinance . </insist.v.1457><insist.v.1458>Testimony in the Japanese parliament , broadcast live on Japanese television in January 2008 , challenged the premise and validity of the Global War on Terror.

The advent of the new NAFDAC , then under Prof Dora Akunyili , did much magic in the industry. It gave much credibility to the local industry. It encouraged the small and medium-scale manufacturers of pharmaceutical products in this country. This is because NAFDAC insisted on quality , worldwide , people started seeing products coming from Nigeria as quality products. The advocacy going on and the sustained propaganda on patronizing Nigerian pharmaceutical products and locally manufactured goods gave impetus to those who manufacture here. And for the importers , that is , our neighbours in Ghana , Togo , and so on where Nigerian products have been banned , Nigerian drugs were not acceptable in Ghana before 2000 , but today , Nigerian drugs are highly acceptable not only in Ghana , but in the whole of West African sub-region and other parts of the world . </insist.v.1470><insist.v.1471>You will recall that after exhausting all legal avenues to invalidate his electoral victory in 2000 , they " encouraged " him to relinquish his power voluntarily.

After all , economic analysis has become the essence of antitrust , in the courts and the enforcement agencies , independent of the political party in power. Republican presidents appointed economically-oriented antitrust scholars like Judges Posner , Bork and Easterbrook to the circuit courts , and President Clinton has done the same by elevating Justice Breyer to the Supreme Court.

Religion has nothing to do with this as Christianity and Islam are in effect the same , worshipping the same God , accepting the same prophets and dividing only after the birth of Christ whom Islam accepts as a prophet but not the son of God. I have no problem with headscarves , if somebody feels they must wear one , although it makes young females look like nuns; but to insist on wearing a full veil is in my opinion a form of attention seeking or deep lack of confidence in onesself.

" For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders " , etc. Mark 7 : 21. Here our Lord traces these sinful acts back to their source , and declares that their fountain is the " heart " , and not the will ! Again; " This people draweth nigh unto me with their lips , but their heart is far from me " Matt. 15 : 8.

It depends entirely on the Magician how he is served. The greater the man , the greater must be his teacher. It follows that the highest forms of communicating daemons , those who know , so to speak , the court secrets , disdain to concern themselves with matters which they regard as beneath them.

These plays adopted the Aristotelian primacy of plot , which often overshadowed characterization. Well-made comedies depended on accident rather than character development to achieve the inevitable happy ending. Shaw refused to follow what he considered to be the artificial form of the well-made play , insisting that they bore little resemblance to real-life situations. In Mrs. Warren 's Profession , the action is character driven with little plot development , unfolding through conversations that shift back and forth among the players. The conclusion of the play also breaks with tradition. Shaw frustrated the audience 's expectation that comedies end with all conflicts resolved. Vivie , his main character , does appear happy at the end of the play as she turns " buoyantly " to her work , which soon gains her full attention. Her conflict with her mother , however , has not been resolved. Mrs. Warren leaves Vivie 's office after refusing to shake hands with her. While Vivie appears momentarily relieved , Shaw suggests through his characterization of her that she may later regret her treatment of her mother . </insist.v.1524><insist.v.1525>India 's leftist parties object strongly to the accord.

Wellhausen ( Einl. in die drei ersten Evangelien ) is rather disposed to accent the " Semiticisms " ( Aramaisms ) in the Synoptic Gospels in contrast with the Attic Greek. Nobody now , claims the N.

This , they believe , will eventually persuade the world ' s rulers to adopt a kinder , gentler sort of market economy.

In addition , more highly educated women insist more on relationships based on affection. With the revolution , the number of consensual unions based on mutual agreement , which are fully recognized by law , also began to increase.

Athens had reached the point of rejecting independence , and the freedom she now wanted was freedom from responsibility. There could be only one result. If men insisted on being free from the burden of a life that was self-dependent and also responsible for the common good , they would cease to be free at all.

If gasoline imports indirectly support Iran 's nuclear ambitions , then $ 2.775 billion in cash for conventional U.S. weapons and military technology clearly allows Israel to focus on development and deployment of its illicit nuclear arsenal. Recently released CIA files long ago forecast that such an arsenal would not only make Israel more " assertive " but also more reluctant to engage in bona fide peace initiatives. Cutting the massive indirect U.S. subsidization of Israel 's nukes and insisting that Israel sign the NPT would go further in averting a nuclear arms race and conflicts in the region than targeting hapless Iranians at the gas pump. It would also demonstrate to the American public that the president and Congress , even under the pressure of AIPAC , wo n't blatantly violate U.S. foreign aid laws by publicly pretending Iran , rather than Israel , is the region 's nuclear hegemon.

' The French sent out a special mission to Saudi Arabia , seeing a chance to break into the all-American preserve , the chasse gard e , which they had been trying to enter for the past quarter-century. The fact that Saudi Arabia , the critical source of oil for Europe , was in the hands of an all-American consortium , was now more than ever exasperating to the Europeans , who saw their oil dependent on the vagaries of American companies.

As we know , this way of defining the role of the intellectual was used by the world 's Communist parties to insist that intellectuals had to subordinate their personal analyses to those of the collectivity , which in turn was considered to be the party , since the party laid claim to represent the interests of the working class.

Eikenberry insists that for such facets to be established , requires trained and honest Afghan officials. That cadre of Afghan civilians , he says , does not exist and would take years to build. He warns and holds fast to the view that the US is being sucked into a prolonged and expensive commitment in Afghanistan because its forces will end acting up for the Afghan government.

Wilson rejects the Arian view because it subordinates the wife to the husband as the Arians subordinate the Son to the Father. Sabellianism is equally unacceptable because it allows for only nominal distinctions among the persons and the family structure would fall to the temptation of egalitarianism and feminism.5b One interesting implication of Wilson 's analogy is that the children are analogous to the Holy Spirit. While rejecting the Arian view , Wilson still insists on the authority of father in the family that would suggest a similar hierarchy in the Trinity as well. In his essay Jones gives equal weight to each of the persons and there is no notion of any ranking of the Father over the Son or the Holy Spirit. Furthermore , Wilson 's analogy , just as Jones ' own language , suggests an independent will for each of the persons of the Godhead as well as the family , undermining once again Judeo-Christian monotheism and Augustine 's insistence that God has " a single action and will , " and therefore implying tritheism . </insist.v.1560><insist.v.1561>The next day , the world was in awe at Bhumibol ' s intervention.

When Ronald Alley , Deputy Keeper of Art at the Tate Gallery , was compiling the first Catalogue Raisonn of Francis Bacon 's paintings in 1962-63 he made strenuous efforts to locate works from this thinly represented but formative period; while he was evidently attached to the idea of their historical significance , Bacon took a different view , certainly with regard to those which antedated the painting he considered his 'Opus 1 ' , Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion ( 1944; Tate , London ) .

In 1962 he claimed that the genesis of his paintings came whilst daydreaming. In fact his methods were often more orthodox. The works on paper and lists that came to light after his death indicate that he collected a wide range of material to use as points of reference.

" The defendant in that case , indicted for federal mail fraud violations , insisted on conducting his own defense without benefit of counsel. He also requested a bench trial and signed a waiver of his right to trial by jury. The prosecution consented to the waiver of a jury , and the waiver was accepted by the court. The defendant was convicted , but the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that a person accused of a felony could not competently waive his right to trial by jury except upon the advice of a lawyer. This Court reversed and reinstated the conviction , holding that " an accused , in the exercise of a free and intelligent choice , and with the considered approval of the court , may waive trial by jury , and so likewise may he competently and intelligently waive his Constitutional right to assistance of counsel.

W. J. Chetwode Crawley speaks of an illadvised and unsuccessful attempt , lasting intermittently from 1829 to early in the 1860 's , to introduce the English version into the Irish chapters. He is referring to the Irish Grand Chapter at its constitution in 1829 , when it attempted to follow the Zerubbabel story , but , owing apparently to the custom of conferring certain step degrees to qualify the Candidate , met formidable difficulties. Thus , at times in the nineteenth century , in some parts of Ireland , one version was worked , and in another the other version. A special committee appointed in 1856 to inquire into the confusion completed its labours in 1863 , and as a result it was decided to insist upon the story of the repair of the Temple as the motif of the traditional history , the principal officers being designated J. , H. , and ' S. instead of , as in England and elsewhere , Z. , H. , and J . </insist.v.1585><insist.v.1586> It ' s not my story , insists Tomlin.

All of us have various college committee responsibilities , and all of us maintain certain minimal standards of professional development things such as publications , conference presentations , or something very much along those lines. ( All of these endeavors are , by the way , generously supported and encouraged by the College as a whole. ) These are not responsibilities that we consider optional or only for a favored few.

National identity in Syria became ever more confused as politicians insisted ever more vehemently for the eradication of the foreign borders of Sykes-Pico. The lesson most Syrians drew from the war was that a revolution in the Arab status quo was necessary. Very few took the view that the competing unity schemes were the source of inter-Arab enmity and distrust that Syria needed stability , not revolution. Syrians cast about for unity at any price the faster the better. Iraq , almost over night , replaced Jordan as the north star of Syrian unity efforts. A new power in Syria politics took shape in the north of the country during the war , centered in Aleppo. The People ' s Party , seeking to bring together the disparate factions of the Syrian opposition , turned to Baghdad for a solution to the country ' s problems. Perhaps federation or union with their eastern neighbor would help them dislodge Quwwatli and the Damascenes who had monopolized power since the country ' s formation.

As rental housing becomes more expensive , large complexes are the only rentals being built. Today , large complexes provide housing for one out of every four renters. Considering these complexes are normally in direct competition with one another , many of the owners and management companies claim a subservient resident landlord helps to rent their apartments. Yet , if one uses the property management companies ' own studies , there is little to support such a belief. In the 1980 's a book was published by a corporate landlord who controlled over 40 , 000 units. In his nationwide survey ( somewhat self-serving ) of over two thousand tenants who listed their reasons for choosing their new dwelling , there was not one shred of evidence that pointed to landlords as the reason for even one tenant choosing their apartments.

Yet neither do I conform with the conclusions of behavioralist scientists and others who insist that such things as motives are wholly unknowable. Similar to the conclusions of certain interpretivist anthropologists , this kind of thinking tends to arrogantly render the comments of the people themselves as worthless , or at least thoroughly suspect.

" Utilitarianism " is the ethical theory according to which one ought to act so as to maximize the utility ( usually construed as happiness ) of the greatest number. If through killing some people in war , one will thereby secure the well-being and/or happiness of the whole group , then utilitarianism deems killing not merely permissible but , further , obligatory. There is a sense in which a utilitarian constraint is built into just war theory , given its proportionality requirement.

Three years later , after Kadalie 's downfall , the communists accused him of having opposed their attempt to reorganize the union in industrial sections , introduce democratic controls of funds and elections , and pursue an active strike policy. When he had insisted on retaining dictatorial powers and on appointing officials himself , the communists on the national council had threatened to expose ' the disgraceful misappropriation and squandering of funds , by officials great and small , of whom Kadalie was 'the arch pilferer'. In addition , an influential group of Europeans in England and South Africa , representing the British labour movement and the yellow Amsterdam International , had promised him support and recognition on condition that he expelled the communists and adopted a moderate policy. 10 Having done this , he declared that ' strikes were wicked , useless and obsolete. 11 </insist.v.1616><insist.v.1617>Do n't start paying for it , then whinge when you 've set it up that way.

There is no field at all; or if you insist on thinking in terms of ideas like that of a field , this field is always completely determined by the action of the particles which produce it. You shake this particle , it shakes that one , but if you want to think in a field way , the field , if it 's there , would be entirely determined by the matter which generates it , and therefore , the field does not have any independent degrees of freedom and the infinities from the degrees of freedom would then be removed.

In particular the missions in Haiti and Guatemala are at issue , but including other such missions , the total cost over the biennium is estimated to be $ 142 million or about 5.5 of the total budget. With existing cuts in the budget , the Secretary General argues that " I have no flexibility to implement additional mandates within existing resources. " The Secretary General argues that the General Assembly should chose to cut programs if it is unwilling to vote new monies. The United States insists that the financing be found in the existing budget and that no new assessments be authorized. The EU and many other countries argue that no resources exist and that the missions should be paid for by new budgets. The United States insists on the need for consensus , blocking support for the SG 's proposal. The Committee then decides to postpone its decision on where to find the funds until after the review of the regular budget cuts in May.

True freedom of choice and society 's interest in seeing that justice is achieved can be vindicated only if the trial court retains discretion to reject any attempted waiver of counsel and insist that the accused be tried according to the Constitution. This discretion is as critical an element of basic fairness as a trial judge 's discretion to decline to accept a plea of guilty. See Santobello v.

There is here a reaction against the reduction of the inspired text to a series of theological theses , often formulated in non-scriptural categories and language. What is asked of narrative exegesis is that it rehabilitate in new historical contexts the modes of communicating and conveying meaning proper to the biblical account in order to open up more effectively its saving power. Narrative analysis insists upon the need both to tell the story of salvation ( the " informative " aspect ) and to tell the story in view of salvation ( the " performative " aspect ) .

The only safe way to start home schooling was to start before the child reached school age , or to move to a new school district where no one knew the child existed. When parents got caught , they had no legal excuses , no useful precedents , and usually , no money to hire the kind of lawyer who would fight for an unwritten freedom.

The use/mention distinction is not one of his strong points , though it is perhaps pedantic to insist on it in contexts where no harm arises.

Questions about Heidegger and Nazism seem to me to be very , very complicated . ) </insist.v.1728><insist.v.1729>Christian scholars exercised to preserve the " originality " of Jesus in the case of Enoch , as with the Dead Sea Scrolls , have leaned over backward in insisting that Enoch is a work totally alien to the New Testament. In 1840 , M. Stuart finds that " the reader who has never pursued at much length the study of sacred criticism , can not well imagine how much light is cast by it [ I Enoch ] on various parts of the New Testament; particularly on the Apocalypse. . . . And yet how different are the two compositions , although partial and even general resemblances are so frequent ! " 182 He assures us that Enoch and the book of Revelation were written by " two Jews writing at the same period , having the same general theme and object. . . . Both authors . . . deal altogether in visions and symbols. " 183 To rescue the originality of the New Testament , he explains that the two books are independent inventions , as " both authors . . . range the world of imagination " and freely fabricate.184 </insist.v.1729><insist.v.1730>In interaction there are also what we might call exit assessments  recognition that we have done all we can do and thus have no motive for continuing. This is typically a recognition that we have accomplished what we needed to together , or that a coparticipant understands the communication , or can and will do certain things. On the other hand , the recognition can be that the coparticipant is fixed on a course of action in which we can not or do not wish to intervene further. In either case we find it no longer useful to worry about communicating a specific point or eliciting cooperation on a particular matter.  Nor do we then need consider whether our intentions or thoughts should be modified or abandoned given our coparticipant 's alternative knowledge , perspective or understanding. That is , we no longer need to accommodate to find a meeting place for our ongoing interaction. We judge , for example , that our visitor understands the directions well enough to drive back to town. Alternatively we may assess that no matter how much we insist that their planned route is not possible , they will go their own way.  </insist.v.1730><insist.v.1731>Therefore , if anthropologists insist on an evolutionary explanation for the different languages , then they must likewise postulate extremely long periods of isolation and inbreeding for the different tribes , practically as long as the history of man himself. This in turn means that each of the major language groups must be identical with a major racial group. Therefore , each " race " must have had a long evolutionary history , and it is natural to assume that some races have evolved more than others. This natural association of racism with evolutionary philosophy is quite significant and has been the pseudoscientific basis of a wide range of racist political and religious philosophies that have wrought untold harm and misery over the years . </insist.v.1731><insist.v.1732>Only one congressman , Oregon 's Democratic senator Ron Wyden , has insisted on probing the legality of the CIA 's techniquesso much so that Wyden has blocked the appointment of Bush 's nominee , John Rizzo , from becoming the CIA 's top lawyer. Rizzo , a CIA official since 2002 , has said publicly that he did n't object to the Justice Department 's 2002 " torture " memos , which allowed the infliction of pain unless it caused such injuries as " organ failure . . . or even death.

" 159 Acting on such an assumption , E. Murray went overboard and saw in Enoch nothing but a jumble of separate treatises on disconnected subjects , clustered around an original book of only thirty verses ! 160 From the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century , dismantling ancient writings into many original components was a favorite game of the learned; so J. B. Frey , while hailing the book of Enoch as a work of supreme age and importance , still insists that it is really not a book of Enoch but rather an Enoch literature consisting of very disparate works that have only the name of Enoch in common , as if " Enoch " could not have written on more than one subject.161 </insist.v.1733><insist.v.1734>2. Thou Shalt Always Move The Art Forward Cliche is our enemy. But to be better than cliche , we must embrace it , know it intimately , and at the last minute , insist on the new. Stories have progression over the years , they are the same but different for our age. Learning what came before is vital to avoid trodding over old territory. Every genre has its historic high and low points , key turns , breakthroughs in form , and creators who insisted on nothing less than shattering the tired and old. You have a genre , a type of story you love to tell. It is a story that has a long tradition , riddled with cliches which at the time were breathtaking new advances. Now is the time to find your contribution , to break with what came before , but to honor the tradition of your genre by knowing it inside and out and respecting its contribution to now . </insist.v.1734><insist.v.1735>Why , after such a long and lethal period of purposeful silence , did Pius XII say something , even something as inadequate as he did ? He spoke out only after he had been strongly pressured by the Americans and the British to explicitly condemn the mass murder of the Jews , which he nevertheless steadfastly refused to do. Two weeks before his Christmas message , the British minister to the Vatican , Francis d'Arcy Osborne , was completely exasperated by the Pope 's silence. On December 14 , he even took the extraordinary diplomatic step of censuring Pius XII bluntly while speaking to the Vatican Secretary of State. Osborne recorded that he virtually commanded that the Vatican " should consider their duties in respect to the unprecedented crime against humanity of Hitler 's campaign of extermination of the Jews. " But during the years when the Germans were mass-murdering the Jews , Pius XII chose again and again not to mention the Jews publicly. Nevertheless , his defenders insist that , his purposeful omission notwithstanding , he was speaking about them all along; they ignore that until his vague ( one sentence ) Christmas utterance well over a year after the Germans initiated that mass murder , Pius XII had been absolutely silent.

Many began to insist that we pay shipping both ways - even when they were on their 3rd or 4th motherboard ! ! The only way to combat this was to tighten our policies and begin charging more restock fees , and institute a tech support fee for products that ran perfectly well at standard clock speeds , though they were unstable at faster speeds. We were rewarded for this by people who would post messages on Usenet or on some of the web surveys about how we were ripping them off , and claiming they were being charged for product that they 'knew ' was defective.

For Taft , in the course of explaining at great length why Section 20 did not really mean a thing , went out of his way to include in his opinion a rousing defense of labor unions. Of course , this defense did not do the unions any good after Taft got through with it. The point is that Taft was insisting to his fellow-lawyers the only people who ever read or understand judicial opinions that is disappointing the unions he was merely following The Law. The choice , however distasteful , was forced upon him. For it is part of the legal legend that no lawyer not even when he becomes a Supreme Court justice ever does any more than explain what The Law is and how it applies.

Sinners are continually acting upon the principle of self-ownership; and practically insist upon their right to dispose of themselves as they please , without being accountable to God or man.

Rey forwarded the petition but strongly advised Stanley against seeing the Chiefs : he saw this as yet another manoeuvre by Tshekedi to delay implementation of the Proclamations. The High Commisssioner responded to the Chiefs by telling them that they could submit any statements they might like to to make not merely in vague and general terms , but with sufficient precision to enable me to understand , and consider any points or suggestions which they would desire to represent.

He had actually wondered a bit at that , remembering well the captain 's treatment of him in the beginning , when she had regarded him as nothing more than a tool , no more sentient than a tricorder or a spanner. Over the years , however , the Ocampa , Kes , and later , Seven of Nine , had helped Janeway see how her view was too rigid and narrow. Gradually , the captain had come to accept his development into a fully sentient being.

Sir Leon , she suggests , was right to insist the EU must pursue its challenge to the Helms-Burton Act through the WTO in spite of the delicacy of the task. Washington 's threat to pull out of the WTO if it ruled against the Act and provoke the collapse of the world trade system was gross blackmail she suggests. She also sees the US embargo against Havana and the EU 's refusal to negotiate a trade and aid deal with Cuba unless the government of President Fidel Castro improves its human rights record as a pretence that does n't stand up . </insist.v.1749><insist.v.1750>The newspaper Le Monde , whose headline asked if Bush was to thank for the flicker of hopefulness in the Arab world , published a reply from official but unnamed French voices.

These were a north African church who had parted ways with the international Catholic Church early in the fourth century , insisting on stricter standards. The majority of African Christians were Donatists , but Augustine was extremely successful in winning them over to the Catholic Church. He printed leaflets , preached sermons and wrote songs against them , and when none of that worked , he encouraged the Imperial forces to use fines and imprisonment to force the Donatists to convert , which worked very well. This sermon comes from a series covering the whole of 1 John , and is on the theme of love. Love is a central Christian theme that transcends history and should be preached on today as well as 1600 years ago , but Augustine ' s take on it comes from the years of his anti-Donatist campaign , and is very much tied up with his policy of tough love towards them using violent means for the sake of their salvation. The church ran with his theory throughout the Middle Ages . </insist.v.1751><insist.v.1752>P.

One dealer may swear all supplies disappeared years ago , another may insist it never existed , and a third may have all you want for a few bucks.

They insist that the United States must put pressure on Israel for unilateral concessions , end sanctions against Iraq , and meet their other demands -- without any reciprocal action on their part -- as the only way of defusing the crisis . </insist.v.1777><insist.v.1778>As we look over the list of the early leaders of the republic , Washington , John Adams , Hamilton , and others , we discern that they were all men who insisted upon being themselves and who refused to truckle to the people. With each succeeding generation , the growing demand of the people that its elective officials shall not lead but merely register the popular will has steadily undermined the independence of those who derive their power from popular election. The persistent refusal of the Adamses to sacrifice the integrity of their own intellectual and moral standards and values for the sake of winning public office or popular favor is another of the measuring rods by which we may measure the divergence of American life from its starting point . </insist.v.1778><insist.v.1779>This year , campaign officials insist that they are gaining in the polls against Democrat Barack Obama.

His stance on the rise of Indigenous voices has drawn attention since his version of race in Guatemala is oddly disembodied , with little evidence of the race hatred that poisons the society. Rather than race , in his telling , class divides and land disputes among peasants are the society 's main faultlines. Apparently for Stoll there are no connections between class and race. And he denies the politics of race by insisting that above all , intra-ethnic conflict reigns. So his analysis can not explain why most of the dead are Indigenous-eighty-three percent according to the government truth commission report . </insist.v.1780><insist.v.1781>While insisting that the subject matter of sociology is distinct from that of other sciences , Durkheim also insisted that the sociologist should approach his subject matter in the same state of mind as the natural scientists. Regarding the social sciences of his day as analogous to alchemy before the rise of the natural sciences , he condemned them as having dealt " more or less exclusively with concepts and not with things " . </insist.v.1781><insist.v.1782>The spread of Islamic customs and practices to Europe , North America and Australia means that immigrant Muslim women continue to be treated as they are in Islamic countries. Moreover , because any women is regarded as subject to punishment if they are not completely covered , rapes of non-Muslim women are becoming common. Daniel Greenfield deals with one aspect of this : the non-response , the lack of indignation , by feminists. He notes that " [ r ] ather than confront the threat to women posed by Islamic law , feminist authors like Naomi Wolf are instead claiming that the wolf is really a misunderstood poodle. " They do not support their sisters who try to fight back in Muslim countries; they side with Islam law , ducking the issue by insisting that the wearing of a head schmatta will make women free. How very curious . </insist.v.1782><insist.v.1783>There is an old Japanese story of the Tea Master and the Ruffian that makes this point. The Lord of Toas Province in Japan , Lord Yamanouchi , was going to Edo ( now Tokyo ) on an official trip and insisted that his tea master accompany him. The tea master was reluctant. He was not a sophisticated city person and not a samurai. He was afraid of Edo and the dangers he might face , but he was unable to refuse his master 's request. His master , however , in a conscious attempt to boaster the tea master 's confidence , attired him in Samurai clothing with the customary two swords. The Lord thought that among the other samurai on the trip , the tea master would become invisible . </insist.v.1783><insist.v.1784>It should be unnecessary to insist that the above ideas apply only to the Absolute. Toothache is still painful , and deceit degrading , to a man , relatively to his situation in the world of illusion; he does his Will by avoiding them. But the existence of " Evil " is fatal to philosophy so long as it is supposed to be independent of conditions; and to accustom the mind " to make no difference " between any two ideas as such is to emancipate it from the thralldom of terror. </insist.v.1784><insist.v.1785>the white Methodists , as preachers.

These mechanisms are designed to settled cases without the necessity of going to trial. There is a distinction between arbitration and mediation. Arbitration is legally binding. Both parties are bound by whatever the arbitrator happens to award. There can be no appeal from an arbitration award absent a showing of mutual mistake in fact , or fraud on the part of the arbitrator. In contrast , mediation is nonbinding. A mediator simply acts as a go-between for the parties and engages in shuttle diplomacy in order to fashion an agreement. Either party can terminate mediation at anytime , and insist on trial. Very few contested divorces or custody cases proceed to trial without first going to mediation or arbitration. As with other court appearances and proceedings , mediating a case represents a significant investment in time , money and attorney fees and should be prepared for the well in advance . </insist.v.1787><insist.v.1788>Registrar Mike Chingori of the Gandiya formation told VOA Studio 7 reporter Sandra Nyaira that Gandiya ' s parishioners hope the police will keep their word this Christmas weekend.

For the return of social justice in the modern world , the same great truth must be insisted upon unceasingly. If we define social justice in the members of a society as the virtue by which the members are enabled to direct all their actions towards the common good of the society , we can hope for its triumph over the cold , calculating naturalism of individualistic liberalism and over the harsh , brutal naturalism of materialistic collectivism , only when Christ ' s members have again grown accustomed to their solidarity in Him. When once men realise that what is done for their fellow-men is done for Christ and to Christ they will readily see that social life must be so organised that each member of Christ may have a just and fair opportunity of living in accordance with his sublime dignity . </insist.v.1789><insist.v.1790>However , there are a couple inherent problems with this bill.

Secondly , the plan is not allowed to sacrifice any manufacturing jobs , can not " decrease the likelihood of ... affordable electrical service " and must prove economically beneficial for the state.

[ 46 ] Soviet entry also destroyed the possibility that Japan 's Ketsu-go strategy would succeed in inflicting heavy casualties on the Allied invading force , ultimately leaving the Japanese with little choice but surrender. Truman insisted that firming up Soviet involvement was his principal reason for going to Potsdam. Upon receiving Stalin 's confirmation , he exulted , Stalin will " be in the Jap War on August 15th. Fini Japs when that comes about.

In addition to her own efforts , this success owed something to the arrival of more married women , which improved the climate in the plant. It also owed something to the support she got from the CPA. She began by encouraging other women to demand and win a mirror in the dressing room , a small victory that laid the basis for bigger ones. ' It was essential , I felt , that the women themselves got their own confidence to front up to the [ union ] delegate and the boss and feel their own power.

If accomplished by force , without consent or with someone incapable of consent , sodomy is a felony in all states in the same way that rape is. Homosexual ( male to male ) sodomy between consenting adults has also been found a felony but increasingly is either decriminalized or seldom prosecuted. Sodomy with a consenting adult female is virtually never prosecuted even in those states in which it remains on the books as a criminal offense. However , there have been a few cases , including one in Indiana , in which a now-estranged wife insisted that a husband be charged with sodomy for sexual acts while they were living together. Traditionally sodomy was called " a crime against nature. " Sodomy does not include oral copulation or sexual acts with animals ( bestiality ) . </insist.v.1799><insist.v.1800>Both my parents are gone , so I ca n't comment on that , but a few years ago I visited a retired uncle ( and his wife ) who insisted on picking up every tab.

The miners proposed that I should name the Commission , and that if I put on a representative of the employing class I should also put on a labor union man. The operators positively declined to accept the suggestion. They insisted upon my naming a Commission of only five men , and specified the qualifications these men should have , carefully choosing these qualifications so as to exclude those whom it had leaked out I was thinking of appointing , including ex-President Cleveland.

Molly had nothing to offer when Therese questioned her about Willis. Dave refused to let Rachel try to persuade John to change his mind , but did promise to attend her exhibition. Iris ordered Molly to drop Dennis the way she did Michael 's predecessor or she 'll be sent back to the farm. Jeff told John that Dave left Pat 's after he told them about the suit.

This is true , but it is crucial to understand that Providence can acquire various meanings depending on the circumstances.

Communitarianism is the theory that individual freedoms have weakened the bonds of community , and that as a result , individual rights must be balanced against the more moral interests of the community. They never explain exactly what the interests of the community are , but they do insist they use a " more moral set of values " to create communities , compared to the selfishly motivated immorality our forefathers used to write The Bill of Rights. The communitarians insist the best way to foster the " new morality " is through neighborhood associations , small groups of unelected , " concerned citizens " who rule the community by consensus . </insist.v.1814><insist.v.1815>Yet leftists could sound like hard-nosed defenders of the national interest when necessary.

And certainly The Law , when it moves at all , does so by flapping clumsily and uncertainly along , with its eye unswervingly glued on what lies behind. In medicine , in mathematics , in sociology , in psychology in every other one of the physical and social sciences the accepted aim is to look ahead and then move ahead to new truths , new techniques , new usefulness. Only The Law , inexorably devoted to all its most ancient principles and precedents , makes a vice of innovation and a virtue of hoariness.

But , in proceeding with the discussion , it is necessary not only to discard all subjective prejudices , desires , or mechanical analogies , but to free ourselves from traditional formulas ( not , of course , principles ) . We must face the concrete living facts , whether desirable or undesirable , particularly the decisive influence of the situation created after the Second World War on the Chinese events. We must also take note of the specific function Stalinism played in these events , the distortion or deformation imposed by its rule on the events and their consequences. In a word , we should seriously and flexibly apply the dialectic method of Marxism to observe the facts , analyze the facts , and by analysis of the causes and effects of the realities , obtain a correct understanding , and thus form a correct appraisal of possible developments . </insist.v.1824><insist.v.1825>She lifted a remonstrative hand.

The fundamental difference between governments established by people and governments established by wolves is wolves do n't need words to justify the use of brute force , people do.

Courses or seminars provide a more structured approach to the formation of conscience. For example , undergraduate students can be gathered for a seminar on the question of premarital sex , contraception , and abortion. An open atmosphere is needed so that the students can speak freely about the prevailing attitudes and peer pressures on campus , as well as about their own outlooks and modes of decision making. A skillful leader can use the discussion as a basis for bringing out the Christian teaching that insists that sexuality is best understood in terms of personal relationships and that intercourse is a sign of the total commitment associated with marriage. In dealing with this and all areas of personal morality , the Catholic tradition must be presented as containing a wisdom that illuminates the mystery of human existence and encourages behavior that is in the best interest of the individual and society . </insist.v.1836><insist.v.1837>Nov. 22 , 2004 - The attorney for Jason Futch , as well as Futch 's father , both have contacted the Fulton County prosecutor and asked her to delay the trial until after the first of the year. No reason was given. Prosecutor Shakura Polk says she told both the attorney and the father that she would not agree to a delay , and she would insist the trial begin as scheduled , on Dec. 14. So far , the judge has not been asked to rule on any such request , which could be submitted early -- weeks before the trial -- or could come as late as when the trial begins , when the judge would rule on the request. Regardless of when it might come , Ms. Polk says she will continue to oppose any delay . </insist.v.1837><insist.v.1838>Catholic tradition thus adds to scripture , insisting on certain matters as essential which the NT ignores.

Her lack of sympathy prompts her mother to declare , " my God , what sort of woman are you ? " to which Vivie replies , " the sort the world is mostly made of , I should hope.

The whole point of the compromise was to pick up a handful of votes that have , so far , eluded Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , especially from Nelson , from Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman , or from Maine Republican Olympia Snowe. Nelson said Wednesday that the outlines of the deal sounded better to him than the previous proposal , but would n't commit one way or another to it. Snowe -- the only GOP member who 's really considered a possible supporter of the reform plan -- seems not to like the Medicare buy-in proposal. And Lieberman , whose 2008 campaign heresies Democrats let slide last year , is doggedly insisting that even a trigger for a public option would be an unacceptable affront to his principles . </insist.v.1849><insist.v.1850>All the Dutch Tribunist chiefs , Gorter , Pannekoek and Roland Holst were filled with enthusiasm for Dietzgen at the point to study it thoroughly , to comment on it and to translate it ( 9 ) . Insisting on the role of the " spirit " and in the class struggle was a direct call to Workers ' spontaneity overflowing the rigid framework of the social democrat and labour bureaucracy. It was a direct call to the fight against the Revisionist doubts and the fatalism which regarded capitalism as " eternal " and " imperishable " , like the matter. It was especially a call to energy and enthusiasm of the working class in its fight against the existing system , fight which required consciousness , spirit of sacrifice and has its cause , in short in moral and intellectual qualities. This call to new proletarian ethics , the Dutch Marxists found it or believed to discover it in the Writings of Dietzgen ( 10 ) . By the critic of the traditional bourgeois materialism and popularised and simplified Marxism , the Dutch theorists developed in fact a new form of " proletarian " morals and class-consciousness. Dietzgen was for them only one revealing direction of Marxism , whose concepts had been distorted by the Reformist vision . </insist.v.1850><insist.v.1851>The British terra-terrorists are aided by their government , which insists on giving out the exact locations of the test plots.

If you look at the evaluations for Ford , GM and Chrysler you 'll find the current situation with regard to bankruptcy pretty well anticipated. The really interesting question becomes who can get to Level 5 performance in each of the critical operational and strategic categories in time enough to survive ? Of the three Ford looks to be the only one - and why ? Because Alan Mullaly came in and started insisting on honesty , team leadership , good management controls and facing brutal realities. And he started almost three years ago while the management of GM and Chrysler fought rearguard actions ( though to be fair Nardelli and his team took what actions a very bad hand let them to some extent; but they also badly mis-read the future as well. Thinking a plan for a 13mil year was satisfactory ! ) </insist.v.1852><insist.v.1853>Exactly as Ignatius insisted , all church meetings today are under the absolute control and presidence of the monarchial bishop , or any " minister " whom he approves , and no " layman " dares interfere with this " divine order. " But this " divine order " is entirely against the Word of God. " For where two or three are gathered together in my name , " says Jesus , " there am I in the midst of them. " [ Matt.18; 20 ] All it takes to make a true " church meeting " is the presence , not of a " minister " but of Jesus himself , who promises his attendance when so few as two meet in his name. This must be a disgusting thought indeed to Pentecostal " pastors " who feel that all manner of horrible evils would result if the church were ever left to its own devices. The worst that could happen is that it may actually choose to be a " Book of Acts Church " in truth rather than in word alone . </insist.v.1853><insist.v.1854>Arnold again goes into minute detail about Frances ' everyday life and behavior without providing substantiation or sources. Even so , there are several factual errors in this section , including stating that 1953 was two years after Frances ' release ( she was paroled in 1950 , formally discharged in 1951 ) , and that Wes insisted that Frances get a job. Ruth Farmer states clearly in tape recordings that it was Frances herself who volunteered to go to work when the family 's finances were in trouble . </insist.v.1854><insist.v.1855>We can rest contentedly in our sins and in our stupidities , and anyone who has watched gluttons shoveling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating will admit that we can ignore even pleasure.

What has become clear is that humanity can not long survive a global order of things in which terror without end lies at the center of power , with those who rule most of us in most places still deploying limitless violence to keep things as they are. The conditions for another global cataclysm are quickening. Our technologies have brought us to the point where we can destroy ourselves and much of the chain of life that sustains us either quickly with nuclear weapons , or slowly simply by staying on the course that those in power insist upon , and insist on defending with a spectrum of violence that extends from the midnight knock on the door through the torture chambers to the incineration of cities , lands , and peoples. Even Martin Luther King ' s call for nonviolence or nonexistence no longer is enough , now it also must be democracy or nonexistence , a full and final recognition of our collective vulnerability and our interdependence , one world , with every voice heard equally , or none . </insist.v.1856><insist.v.1857>As an American , it was especially appalling to witness the role of US diplomats at this meeting. I had to watch as they fought to prevent the UN from including the specific , time-bound goals that African governments and civic groups had called for just one month ago at a summit in Nigeria. One of these was to deliver AIDS treatment to 80 of the people who need it in Africa by 2010. While US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said the US approach to AIDS is " rooted in partnership with Africa , " the US insisted this clear target be left out of the UN plan . </insist.v.1857><insist.v.1858>As a result of their dual citizenship in modem times , the Jews , while retaining their primary allegiance to their own nation and their devotion to the ideal of the domination of the natural messias , have been able to use their positions of power for the furtherance of their national programme which , as I have so often insisted , is necessarily and inevitably opposed to the rule of the supernatural Messias , Christ the King. And now , unfortunately , the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd , 1917 , would seem to result in the perpetuation of this anti-supernatural , anti-Christian anomaly. The text of the letter addressed by Arthur James ( later Lord ) Balfour , then British Secretary of State for , Foreign Affairs , to Lord Rothschild , is as follows : </insist.v.1858><insist.v.1859>In a point-by-point refutation of " Facts Count , " Laksin exposes the allegations as a politically-motivated smear effort : " Time and again [ " Facts Count " ] insists that The Professors cites no evidence for a given claim when even a cursory reading of the text and its sources would confirm the opposite.

" </insist.v.1859><insist.v.1860>It 's not Brokaw 's fault. Or Jim Lehrer 's or Gwen Ifill's. The problem is the commission that has been invested with pseudo-constitutional status to run the debates but in fact weakly defers to candidates and clings to antiquated formats. No serious candidate would skip a debate. So the commission should use its leverage to insist that the debates are interesting to voters , rather than safe for candidates. Allow moderators to be more aggressive - and call-out candidates for lame answers- and then allow the candidates to go at it over the issues that matter most without time constraints . </insist.v.1860><insist.v.1861>Cheney decided not to give Bush the entire national intelligence estimate on WMD in Iraq , but only a one-page summary of " key findings " , which excluded caveats , including the energy department 's and state department bureau of intelligence and research 's statements that the aluminum tubes that Cheney and the neo-conservatives insisted were proof of Saddam 's ongoing nuclear weapons programme " more likely are intended for conventional weapons.

There is an answer for them : it 's the collector 's knife , a knife that sits in a dust-free display cabinet , separate from its sheath , and never gets handled. The truth is , there is no such thing as a knife blade or sheath arrangement that will not scratch the finish of a blade , if the blade is ever used. A working knife will be inserted and withdrawn a thousand times from its sheath , and if just one speck of sand , dirt , or debris makes its way into the sheath , it will lead to a scratch or group of scratches , scuffs , and scars on the fine metalwork. See the related topic on my Handles Page. This is one of the reasons that some makers sand the knives along their length , to hide the natural wear marks within a pattern of sanding : applicable for low end utility knives , and it 's a matter of preference . </insist.v.1864><insist.v.1865>Pakistan Tightens Laws on Honor KillingsPakistan has finally taken serious steps to stop honor killings and treat them like the horrendous crimes that they are , but critics insist that much more needs to be done.

It is the second time that the Holy See uses the phrase in recent years , the other being in the text of the prayer approved of by Pope Pius XI for the consecration of the human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Holy See is evidently insisting upon the fact that there is no longer any chosen people or race , except in so far as the Jews , who were the custodians of the divine promises until the time of Jesus Christ , despite their official rejection of the Supernatural Messias , have not ceased to be the members of His own race. Certain nations have at times shown themselves , to some extent at least , dazzled by the belief that they were the chosen people or race , in the natural order. The pagan cult of race is but a modern manifestation of naturalism . </insist.v.1867><insist.v.1868> Ideally one would like to pick up a lump of paint and throw it at the canvas , he declared memorably.

Kerry called for sending more troops to Iraq , insisting that 'it would be unthinkable now for us to retreat in disarray and leave behind a society deep in strife and dominated by radicals. ' Kerry also asserted that he would still have voted to authorize President Bush to invade Iraq even if he knew [ as of course he DID ] Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , a position that he only clearly retracted after losing [ that is , coming close enough to have it stolen ] the election.

But as we have seen , in the Bible one can be married apart from any vow , commitment , or even love. Biblically , a couple can be married without " vows , " or they can make vows and not be fully married. Those who say otherwise have swallowed a foreign concept of marriage at the expense of the Scriptures. Nowhere in the Scriptures is a " vow " ever linked with marriage. The term " vow , " or forms of it , is found in 68 verses and not one time is it associated with marriage. When these facts are presented to one of these sacramentalists the author has found they often become very insecure. They realize , contrary to what they have been taught , the Bible does n't support their position.

Let 's see. To his credit Kerry is cognizant of the aforementioned issues and has promised changes if elected. However , promises do n't mean a thing if he ca n't deliver the goods. President Bush on the other hand has made terrorism and the war in Iraq the chief provisions of his campaign. Sadly , it was only during the Republican National Convention that the Texas native began to seriously address the economy. But what about conservatives who insist that Bush is a religious man whose actions " are guided by God ? " What about them ?

The survey by Vector Research and Development Inc. of Toronto found that 55 of respondents feel Ottawa should attach strings to transfer payments to halt the privatizing of public services by the provinces. Albertans , typically more suspicious than most of federal politicians encroaching on provincial turf , are somewhat less inclined than people in other regions of the country to tie the provinces ' hands. Yet even there , 45 of Albertans believe Ottawa should insist that any federal money given to the provinces be spent only on public , not-for-profit services. At the other end of the scale , Quebecers were most opposed to the idea of federal money being used to pay for services provided by for-profit contractors . </insist.v.1884><insist.v.1885>Humphreys County - In this appeal , Tennessee Insurance Guaranty Association insists the trial court erred in determining ( 1 ) the employee was permanently and totally disabled , ( 2 ) the last injurious injury rule did not apply and ( 3 ) the employee 's permanent and total disability benefits accrued beginning March 14 , 2001.

I have been taking sightings and soundings on them for many years and can not find a more satisfactory distinction between the two than straight chronology. The first six years or so , from 1915 to about 1921 , belong to Dada. Duchamp and Picabia rocked New York during World War I. In Zurich Hugo Ball and his friend Richard Huelsenbeck stumbled on the unbeatable nonsense name that made a dozen reputations , especially Tristan Tzara's. The biggest and socially most significant eruption of Dada took place in Berlin at the end of the war; it has been sadly neglected. The two big Paris seasons of 1920 and 1921 replayed with a few adaptations the two Zurich seasons of 1916 and 1917.

[ Ed. note : Actually not so much , as several readers point out. ] ( And in any case Royals owner David Glass has insisted the team wo n't leave town. ) Stewart also indicated that it helps that Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt has offered to pay $ 100 million toward stadium upgrades , while Glass offered to kick in just $ 20 million in his own megabucks; this could yet be just the opening salvo in a bitter three-way negotiation the likes of which has n't been seen since , well , yesterday . </insist.v.1896><insist.v.1897>Dear lord.

In most cases , the donors ' descendants manage and invest these huge piles of money , distributing a portion each year to nonprofit groups of all kinds ( the IRS insists that at least 5 percent is given away each year ) .

Please note that , in fairness to them , I say " some " witch doctors and medicine men , because even most of them are happy to mix Western medicine with native herbal cures and then throw in some spiritual stuff , chanting and rattle shaking , for flavoring . </insist.v.1904><insist.v.1905>Dishonest apologists insist on these standards for everyone but themselves and in every subject but their own. Honest apologists avoid suppressing material evidence , even as they seek to downplay the significance of controversial information. Traditional Mormon history has had ( and continues to have ) both honest apologists and dishonest apologists. Many " New Mormon Historians " are also honest apologists for what they see as the essential truths of Mormon theology and the basic goodness of the Mormon experience. These New Mormon Historian apologists often seek to downplay the significance , or " to put into context , " any evidence they find which may discomfort believing Mormons. Traditional Mormon apologists discuss such " sensitive evidence " only when this evidence is so well known that ignoring it is impossible. Personally , I have always tried to write both as a New Mormon Historian and an honest apologist for the Mormon faith and experience.

Since Inuit culture is traditionally quite sensitive to the feelings that kindle an act of violence , rather than focusing upon the act itself , Inuit societies tended to recognize that controlled expression of ill feelings had the best chance of exorcising violent tendencies from people . </insist.v.1909><insist.v.1910>In the Nigeria-Biafra War , people insisted that we could not let Biafra break away from Nigeria because it would cause a chain reaction , and then every tribal group in Africa would secede from its parent state , resulting in a terrible case of continental anarchy. There was no good evidence for that fear. Wars of secession are usually caused by specific internal problems , not generic continental problems. Attempts at secession- whether successful or unsuccessful- do not always cause a chain reaction of such attempts . </insist.v.1910><insist.v.1911>In a situation where the government insisted on a contractor supplying masonry blocks which exactly matched existing , the board found that the contract only required a reasonable match and held that the contractor was entitled to its extra costs incurred to perform to the higher standard.

The Bible itself bears witness that its interpretation can be a difficult matter. Alongside texts that are perfectly clear , it contains passages of some obscurity. When reading certain prophecies of Jeremiah , Daniel pondered at length over their meaning ( Dn. 9 : 2 ) . According to the Acts of the Apostles , an Ethiopian of the first century found himself in the same situation with respect to a passage from the Book of Isaiah ( Is. 53 : 7-8 ) and recognized that he had need of an interpreter ( Acts 8 : 30-35 ) . The Second Letter of Peter insists that " no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of private interpretation " ( 2 Pt. 1 : 20 ) , and it also observes that the letters of the apostle Paul contain " some difficult passages , the meaning of which the ignorant and untrained distort , as they do also in the case of the other Scriptures , to their own ruin " ( 2 Pt. 3 : 16 ) . </insist.v.1912><insist.v.1913>Others would also draw , for Truman , the grave implications of using such hellish weapons. Truman noted presciently in his diary on July 25 , 1945 , after being fully briefed on the results of the Trinity test , that the bomb " may be the fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley Era , after Noah and his fabulous Ark. " [ 5 ] Leading atomic scientists cautioned that surprise use of the bomb against Japan could precipitate an uncontrollable arms race with the Soviet Union that boded future disaster for mankind. The warnings reached Truman 's closest advisors if not the President himself. Truman nevertheless authorized use of atomic bombs against Japan , always insisting he felt no " remorse " and even bragging that he " never lost any sleep over that decision. " [ 6 ] For over sixty years , historians and other analysts have struggled to make sense of Truman 's and his advisors ' actions and the relevance of his legacy for his successors in the Oval Office . </insist.v.1913><insist.v.1914>Most of the Primavera statistics from the American population oughtn t be surprising , such as 75 wanting the government to communicate when programs are over budget , why they are over budget , and what the steps will be to fix the process.

That ' s what AT &amp;T and m-Qube are counting on . </insist.v.1915><insist.v.1916> Number portability is a very important competition tool since it enables customers to change operators without losing their phone numbers. This makes it easier for consumers to make up their mind to switch operators and is a crucial factor for the development of competitive markets. I therefore have to insist that EU rules on number portability are observed in all 27 Member States , effectively and without discrimination , said EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding. Unfortunately , Bulgarian customers are not able to retain their fixed number when they change operator since this service is not yet available. I urge the Bulgarian authorities to act as fast as possible so that Bulgarian consumers can add to the 24 million fixed lines that have been ported since the rule came into force in 2003. </insist.v.1916><insist.v.1917>Practically it should not cost you much provided you are willing to fight the case on your own. In the Consumer Courts ( District Forum , State Commission and the National Commission ) , concerned individuals like you can directly file a complaint petition and can secure relief. The prescribed procedures are simple and these are no court fees , in contrast to the Civil Courts. These quasi-judicial bodies are also supposed to decide within 90 days of lodging the complaint and without insisting on too much technicalities. But in practice there is lot of delay is yet another matter </insist.v.1917><insist.v.1918>Do n't Drink &amp;DivorceA man in India got drunk and divorced his wife. As Muslims , he was able to divorce her simply by reciting " talaq , talaq , talaq. " Neighbors heard and wo n't let the couple get back together , insisting that because the divorce was valid , they can no longer live as a couple - even though the husband regrets his actions. This is what happens when religious law takes precedence over civil law . </insist.v.1918><insist.v.1919>Consider again abortion. Many Catholics insist that the Church 's opposition to abortion is not religious and is not based on revealed truth but on natural reason. Some years ago , Ronald Dworkin wrote a book in which he claimed that no rational person could believe the fetus was human and that therefore restrictive abortion laws were necessarily religious , and hence unconstitutional. Who decides , with regard to the proposed duty to use secular reasons only , who is right about whether a view is secular or religious ? At least on the American scene there is hardly a disputed church-state issue that can not be recast in arguably secular terms . </insist.v.1919><insist.v.1920>" During my husband 's last materialization , " she had said in the invitation , " he insisted that you be present forthe next.

It was essential for the union to be both political and industrial , and therefore it should free itself from the Joint Councils of Europeans and Natives , which had brought about his resignation. Africans would get their freedom by fighting , and not by begging , Kadalie told an audience of more than 1 , 000 in Johannesburg. 'Prepare yourselves to go to gaol , prepare yourselves to be hung if you want freedom. ' They must stop work on the mines , railways and docks ' if the government insists on dragging the native question into the elections'. 72 He had canvassed votes in 1924 for Hertzog 's party , yet it 'grossly violated ' the promises it made to the people. 'We were fooled , but never again. 73 These were the opinions also of James Gumede , the ANC president. Speaking on the same platform as Kadalie , he urged the people to raise their voice 'so that we fill all the gaols. They must demand liberation , the franchise and seats in parliament; oppose Hertzog 's imperialism; and secure a republic representing all nationalities irrespective of colour . </insist.v.1921><insist.v.1922>In this ancient poetry , it 's all about the beloved. It 's about that voice and how it feels to hear his voice. It 's about the power of their love and all of that irresistible attraction that inspires him to invite her to come away. They insist upon this love. Over and over again , in this ancient poetry , these two lovers insist upon the importance of their love for each other. They wo n't give it up. They wo n't let it go. Their love is that important . </insist.v.1922><insist.v.1923>It was a sharp turnaround from comments he made in English two days earlier in the capital , Nairobi.

OK ? It 's all very explicit , on the table. It 's kind of interesting that these reports do not elicit any reflection on the reasons why the United States invaded Iraq. You 've heard those reasons offered , but they were dismissed with ridicule. Now they 're openly conceded to be accurate , but not eliciting any retraction or even any reflection . </insist.v.1924><insist.v.1925>There is a limit to how much foreign payment an economy can make. Higher domestic taxes do not mean that a government can turn this revenue into foreign exchange. This reality is reflected in Iceland ' s insistence that payments on its Icesave debts , and related obligations stemming from the failed privatization of its banking system , be limited to some percentage ( say , 3 percent ) of growth in gross domestic product ( GDP ) . There is assumption that part of this growth can be reflected in exports , but if that is not the case , Iceland is insisting on conditionalities of its own to take its actual balance-of-payments position into account . </insist.v.1925><insist.v.1926>Nathan Dershowitz , another of Rabbi Lanner 's lawyers , said he found " serious factual errors " in the appeals court decision and would file a petition asking for reconsideration.

The union ' s The TCFUA ' s power ability to ensure that award conditions apply to Outworkers has is already been weakened limited by the changes introduced in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 such as the limitation to right of to access to employers ' premises. The Committee is aware that the parties to TCF awards need to present their respective cases to the Commission and it will be up to the Commission to make a decision in the at context of the current Act. The government only intervenes if it feels necessary. However , if the government maintains its current position and insists the outwork allowable matter be restricted to the bare minimum , and if the commission concurs , advances achieved with the Homeworkers Code of Practice will be seriously undermined . </insist.v.1927><insist.v.1928>Further west , a collection of bronzes was exhibited , including a copy of a monument to Frederick the Great , whose original stood in Unter den Linden in Berlin. Near it , Joe spied a group of shields and swords that reawakened his boyish love for tales of knights and medieval chivalry and his memory of the events on the streetcar that morning. As far as he was concerned , they could have skipped the next cases of hosiery , yarn and gloves from Saxony , but since Adam , of course , still insisted on seeing everything in order , Joe simply suffered through those exhibits , as well as the fancy fabrics from there and Nuremberg . </insist.v.1928><insist.v.1929>It is not hard to see why Rove fastened on McKinley as Bush 's precursor. McKinley was an amiable governor around whom Mark Hanna , the Karl Rove of the day , could raise enormous sums of money from industrial and financial circles. But Rove also insisted on a more far-reaching parallel : with the Civil War a fading memory , the Republicans of 1896 could no longer run as the party of the Union and needed to forge a new politics. McKinley , " the advance agent of prosperity , " as he was known , offered himself as a tribune not only of the new business class but also of an emerging industrial society , as against Bryan 's appeal to agrarian values and to the dispossessed. McKinley made Republicans the party of the future. And he brought new voting blocs to the Grand Old Party. Rove noted in a 2002 speech that McKinley " attempted deliberately to break with the Gilded Age politics " he had inherited by appealing to " Portuguese fishermen and Slovak coal miners and Serbian ironworkers , " all of whom he made a very public point of receiving at his Ohio home in the course of his " front-porch campaign.

The way to muscle this legislation into law is for the House to give up its bill , bring the Senate bill ( after it ' s passed with 51 votes ) up for a vote , pass it , and have Obama sign it. But here ' s the thing. The Senate bill doesn ' t have the Stupak amendment , so the dozen or so House Democrats who insisted on taking abortion out of the bill so that they could vote for it face a terrible choice. They will either have to vote for it and betray their principles and their voters and the fight they waged before. Or they can say no and risk torpedoing the bill . </insist.v.1930><insist.v.1931>Called saying some customer wanted information and credit hist on my busines.. barely spoke english , kept saying he needed to verify business info.. misrepresented himself as with credit agency.

The first of the hearings was held in Washington , D.C. , where local protests against the list of invited guests led to a decision to place the planning of future hearings in the hands of local committees , and to insist that time be made available for testimony from anyone who requested to appear. In addition , written testimony was welcomed , and booklets containing a transcript of all the advice received were printed and made generally available . </insist.v.1932><insist.v.1933>In fact , developing countries have repeatedly been missing out on opportunities for negotiating reciprocal concessions or for limiting their own concessions. For example , during the preparations for the Uruguay Round of MTNs , the major developed countries had insisted on including three new subjects in the negotiations , viz. , services , IPRs and investment. All three were finally included in the negotiating agenda , though the developing countries put up stiff resistance right up to the end. With the benefit of hindsight , one can now say that with a proper negotiating strategy , the developed countries could have been persuaded at that time to give up at least one of these subjects in return for an agreement to negotiate the other two. Also , permitting the very entry of services and IPRs into the negotiations in this forum for trade in goods was a very major step; and the developing countries could have rightfully asked for major concessions from the sponsors at the time of taking that step. But as the situation developed , they could neither stop their entry nor exact a price for it . </insist.v.1933><insist.v.1934>Maybe your groups are more generous or financially able than some of mine have been. There was one group I hung out with for a while , and it seemed like every time we went through the process you describe above , we would n't make the total bill , or would n't have anything left for a tip. Some of us ( the same ones over and over ) always chipped in to make it finally work , so that the server did n't get screwed.

No path leads more surely to critical acclaim these days than the White House confessional.

But money is the only way readily to influence academia from the outside ( or even , on a large scale , from the inside ) . Universities will insist upon making their own hiring decisions , of course , and many of those decisions will not support the desired goal , at least at first. But some inevitably will , and even a small increase in available jobs , research funds , and postdoctoral positions can be significant in a field that rarely sees more than three or four jobs advertised in a year . </insist.v.1936><insist.v.1937>As to claims for punitive damages themselves , they are valuable not only because they can produce an award that makes a case worth bringing ( or as here , increase its worth in settlement ) , but they also serve the very important function of focussing the attention of the jury on the misconduct of the defendants. Furthermore , the trial court did not dismiss the punitive damages claim , but insisted that defendants put on their case. However , even if the punitive damages claim were not winnable in this case , future individual plaintiffs might have had a better record ( bolstered , for instance , by the disclosures in the case brought by Minnesota - see A. 75 ) , but that opportunity has been surrendered forever for the entire class . </insist.v.1937><insist.v.1938>He revealed that the two warring sides had in principal agreed to the proposal " but President Kibaki insisted that the Kenyan government should appoint members of the commission.

The Daily News ' Juan Gonzalez reports today that BUILD " reported to the IRS in January that virtually all its $ 5 million budget for 2005 and 2006 was coming from Forest City Ratner , " the Nets owner 's development company. BUILD COO Marie Louis , while insisting that her group is a " grass-roots organization , " did n't seem to dispute the fact that its only source of income is the developer it was supposedly formed to butt heads with : The $ 5 million , she said , is still being negotiated with Ratner , and until then none of the group 's staff is drawing a salary.

The cornerstone of that argument was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) . Now , the concern over such an arsenal has shifted to Iraq 's neighbor , Iran , which the United States suspects of trying to develop a nuclear-weapons program. Though U.S officials insist that military action against Iran is not on the agenda at this point , many observers say they hear dangerous echoes of the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. One of the most prominent voices in recent days to warn against a quick rush to war in Iran is David Kay , formerly the Bush administration 's chief weapons inspector in Iraq. Kay resigned after no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq . </insist.v.1945><insist.v.1946>3. Thou Shalt Insist On Meaning Ask any writer of genre fiction or high art and you will discover the secret of success for both is the same : finding the thing in any story that inspires YOU. And that means insisting that in every story we tell even an assignment we don ' t like or is not ours that we search for , and insist we find our way into , what it ' s about. To do so , we must lay our message into the B Story. Do not proclaim your Good Intentions in the A Story , bury it subtlely , and powerfully beneath the surface in the helper story that helps your hero , and us , learn the lesson. Billboarding your Good Intentions in the A Story is a bore , but not addressing meaning in the B Story is half-finished work. To find meaning is to find inspiration , and only art snobs refuse to find it in assignments and genres they think are beneath them.

While Tshekedi insisted that he had distributed Mogomotsi 's cattle according to custom , and that he had in fact been generous to Baboni since mothers were not expected to inherit from their sons. Nevertheless he had allotted certain cattle to Baboni out of sheer consideration for her. ' Apart from complaining about the distribution of the cattle , Baboni wanted control of the fixed deposits which Mogomotsi had made for his daughter. Furthermore she wanted custody of the child; as Tshekedi emphasised , in the absence of the father , the mother was the natural guardian and entitled to custody . </insist.v.1955><insist.v.1956>I got the $ 77/yr rate on the WINBACK promotion , but she WOULD NOT give me $ 12.95 for putting my credit card on file.

Usually this softness ' has been displayed by the developing countries under three considerations. First , they agreed to some of these measures in the spirit of cooperation , for example in the areas of textiles , leather , jute , etc. , as the developed countries , during those days , needed support in their adjustment process in these sectors. Second , in some cases which were more prevalent during the Uruguay Round , they agreed to some concessions under intense pressures from major developed countries. The entry of services and IPRs into the WTO and the agreements on financial services and telecommunication services are some important examples. Third , more recently there has been a tendency among the developing countries to be over-enthusiastic in being accommodative. They have agreed to the proposals without getting or asking for adequate time for proper examination of the implications. The agreements on zero duty on information technology goods and electronic commerce are the main examples . </insist.v.1965><insist.v.1966>Democrats should n't let him. But rather than challenge Bush 's motives , they should embrace the amnesty proposal and immediately up the ante. To begin with , they should insist that Bush not play immigration politics by excluding people of other nationalities from amnesty. Then they should focus on worker protections. Since illegal aliens often lack language skills and are poorly organized , such workers are easy targets for unscrupulous employers. As The American Prospect 's Alexander Nguyen pointed out in his article , " High-Tech Migrant Labor , " workers in guest programs are often at the mercy of their employers , who must sponsor them. If they 're fired or laid off , they 're forced to leave the country. ( Last year , business balked at proposed worker protections , killing a plan for low-wage immigrant labor similar to one conservatives like Gramm favor. ) Furthermore , a Department of Labor study found clear evidence of economic intimidation -- about one-fifth of employers illegally underpay foreign temporary workers . </insist.v.1966><insist.v.1967>The article in The Standard was perfectly correct in insisting upon the Christian principle of exclusion of hatred of the Jews as a race. The inculcation of that spirit of charity towards the Jews , however , is not the only Christian principle that has a bearing on the problem. To work for the return of society to Christ the King , and so secure the triumph of the supernatural spirit of the Mystical Body in social life , is surely a Christian principle. The Jewish nation in an organised entity opposed to the treatment of our fellow human beings as members of Christ. We , must , therefore , combat their naturalism. Some Catholics seem to forget that the Jews who , in their terrible opposition to God , were plotting the death of our Saviour were so pious and God-fearing and good that they would not go into the hall of Pilate ' s palace , that they might not be defiled but that they might eat the pasch.

Heath insisted that the companies must not cut supplies to Britain. The oilmen insisted that , if they did not treat all their foreign customers fairly , they would risk expropriation. With Sir Eric , Heath was specially angry; he reminded him that BP was half-owned by the government. But Drake , having taken legal advice , said that he could only obey if he were told which other countries should suffer , and that he must have his instructions in writing.

Could we admit this it must still have its usual and primary meaning in the case under notice , because the context and known circumstances do not require departure from its usual and proper signification. But the plea is not admitted . </insist.v.2008><insist.v.2009>On August 1 , Eva Joly , who had been hired as a federal prosecutor a half-year earlier , published her article in La Monde that appeared in many other countries , criticizing Britain 's behavior. But most disturbing of all was publication of the hard-line draft agreement that British and Dutch negotiators had handed to Iceland 's finance minister on June 5 , 2009. It failed utterly to reflect the caveats that Icelandic negotiators had insist on the previous November. Bolstered by Gordon Brown 's shrill rhetoric and Britain 's insistence that the terms be kept secret , the EU 's harsh take-it-or-leave-it stance created an atmosphere in which the Althing had little choice but to draw a line and insist that any Icesave settlement had to reflect Iceland 's reasonable ability to pay. Icesave was caricatured as " Iceslave " signifying the debt peonage with which Iceland was threatened. The finance minister ( a former Communist leader ) seemed out of his depth in having knuckled under in the face of pressure to capitulate to unyielding British negotiators . </insist.v.2009><insist.v.2010>Last night , right after Choir rehearsal , someone gave my wife and me a piece of paper. A $ 1 , 000 , 000 note with the question on it : " Will you go to heaven when you die ? " Daniel was the person speaking to me , another holy worker began talking to my wife. Daniel insisted that GOD was to fear. The judgment would be terrible , we were all sinners and not worthy. I answered that I could not worship a GOD that I had to fear. Because my GOD was full of love and very forgiving. GOD leads my life everyday and HE does not let me fall in sin just to boost HIS ego ( what a thought ... ) . Daniel told me that his GOD was a GOD of wrath and jealousy.

There is no validity to the notion that limited struggles , especially those involving small powers in a peripheral region such as the Balkans , are destined to escalate to continent-wide conflagrations that will drag in the United States. Yet that is the logic underlying not only the U.S.-led mission in Bosnia but also the drive to enlarge NATO.

The core idea of non-profit charitable organizations is a laudable one. The execution has been an alarmingly under-regulated , under-scrutinized and in general , an enormously costly failure when defined by the actual positive accomplishments they can honestly claim. The only solution is an all-out war on these institutions , a war that will make their war on tobacco seem amicable by comparison.

As soon as the preachers of the white Methodist church , in Philadelphia , came to the knowledge of this , they opposed it with all their might , insisting that the house should be made over to the conference , or they would publish us in the newspapers as imposing on the public , as we were not Methodists.

For months , Los Angeles ' most prominent political figures and police officials , along with the city 's most influential media , had been insisting that this legal claim by B.I.G.

Yet here was one of the most respected district court judges in Southern California declaring in open court that the LAPD 's lead investigator on the B.I.G. murder case for the past six years had deliberately concealed hundreds of pages of documents.

" In 1946 , nationally syndicated columnist Jimmie Fidler ( who regularly reported about Frances ' troubles ) quoted a letter he received from Lillian , in which she stated : " [ Frances ] is handicapped by the fact that she was a stage and screen star. That is the one thing she wants to forget and wants others to forget.

They would have to share in the process of defining goals if they were to share in implementing them. The consultants agreed and went further. They insisted that popular participation would turn on whether people were convinced that the bishops would in fact act upon the advice they received.

Normally the relationship causes few problems since all new love affairs have a settling effect on both sexes. In 75 of the cases , the male guest departs in two to three months seeking greener pastures and things return to normal. If the stay continues past the three month break-in period , they usually set up a permanent household. If the guest has been there for that long without any problems , have him sign the lease if you like. ( In many areas , you can also insist they move if you like. ) When female tenants have other women , related or not , share the unit , the stay may have a tendency to last longer but should be handled in the same manner. With male tenants the problem is less of a factor , not only because single men make up less than 40 of single person households.

" North of my property , things are selling for $ 350 to $ 400 per square foot , " but the city offered only $ 188 per square foot for her art studio , local property owner Patricia Ghiglino told the Washington Post. " The city 's offer is not fair compensation.

If George and I were not so exhausted and disheartened , we would have insisted on handling our own case. But they would not let us talk and discuss this. The prosecutor had quickly figured out from looking through my files and our legal papers that were in the car that we were well-educated , and politically and legally astute.

Special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was commissioned to gather the evidence. Starr eventually sent 36 boxes of evidence to the capitol. They catalogued his investigation of Clinton 's finances , a sexual harassment suit filed by Paula Jones and sting operations mounted by the prosecutor to uncover the details of the Lewinsky affair. Nearly 500 pages summarizing the report were quickly posted on the internet. For the next month , the house judiciary committee waded through the report.

From the local church they can get more money by insisting that no one give any money outside but only through their local church treasury. But then from the great multitude of us on the outside , they can get more money by appealing to us to give directly and so they do. That means that the so-called storehouse tithing with them is simply an expedient way of getting money. It is not based on any sincere conviction. It is not based on Bible doctrine. Therefore it is not altogether honest and seems certainly selfish.

Even though it would have been difficult beyond 1952 to continue the war without American aid , the French never permitted participation by U.S. officials in strategic planning or policy making. Moreover , the French suspected the economic aid mission of being over-sympathetic to Vienamese nationalism. The director of the economic aid program , Robert Blum , and the DCM of the American Embassy , Edmund Gullion , were subjected to French criticisms of their pro-Vietnamese views , although the American Ambassador , Donald Heath , remained staunchly pro-French. Thus , French officials insisted that American assistance be furnished with " no strings attached " and with virtually no control over its use. Underlying this attitude was a deep-seated suspicion that the United States desired to totally supplant the French , economically as well as politically , in Indochina . </insist.v.2059><insist.v.2060>This time around the PMA ' s posture has been characterized by continuous provocations against the union.

" The idea that a military experience is a solution for acting-out , rebellious and out-of-control young people is a deeply held belief among many American citizens. But as a way of dealing with out-of-control young people in early 21st century American society , this idea has basically become a myth ! Both the military and military schools are no longer what they used to be. They still can offer a discipline and guidance for the young person who simply is floundering and needs some direction. The military and its schools fail , however , to provide effective help for those out-of-control young people who stubbornly insist on doing what they want , when they want , however they want . </insist.v.2062><insist.v.2063>" When the Michigan Legislature consolidated elections back in 2003 , many of us thought that school districts would do the fiscally responsible thing and voluntarily move their elections to November , when it could be held at no cost to them , " said Switalski. " Instead , districts have stubbornly insisted on holding their own elections on a separate date with abysmal turnout and then complaining to the Michigan Legislature about a lack of funds. This can not continue and I urge the Michigan Senate to seize this opportunity to make government more efficient. " </insist.v.2063><insist.v.2064>254. Remarks on the Preceding Motions. The motions to concur and to non-concur being the opposite and sole alternative each of the other , a negative vote on the one is the same as an affirmative vote on the other. Such , however , is not the case with the three motions last described. After refusing to recede , or to insist , or to adhere , there is still a choice between the other two , and hence a negative on one is not an affirmative vote on either of the other two . </insist.v.2064><insist.v.2065>This is in fact the formula of our Magick; we insist that all acts must be equal; that existence asserts the right to exist; that unless evil is a mere term expressing some relation of haphazard hostility between forces equally self-justified , the universe is as inexplicable and impossible as uncompensated action : that the orgies of Bacchus and Pan are no less sacremental than the Masses of Jesus; that the scars of syphilis are sacred and worthy of honour as such. </insist.v.2065><insist.v.2066>I went to a Catholic grammar school in New Jersey with a lot of Italian immigrant kids. The nuns , who ironically were Italian immigrants themselves , insisted that the new kids learn English as soon as possible.

Then each child was on their own . </insist.v.2066><insist.v.2067>Our nation and the world will never be secure until the conspirators who staged the 9/11 attack are brought to justice. We must therefore insist that the Democratically controlled Congress immediately launch a new and truly independent 9/11 investigation , one that is non-partisan , adequately funded , and empowered with the authority to subpoena witnesses and evidence. The pentagon security videos and the black boxes , currently being withheld , may hold the answers . </insist.v.2067><insist.v.2068>It 's time for some straight talk on U.S. foreign policy as it relates to Africa. While Obama administration officials and the U.S. African Command ( AFRICOM ) representatives insist that U.S. foreign policy towards Africa is n't being militarized , the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. While Africans condemned U.S. military policy in Africa under the Bush administration , the Obama administration has not only mirrored Bush 's approach , but has in fact enhanced it. President George W. Bush established Africa as a foreign policy priority in 2003 , when he announced that 25 of oil imported to the United States should come from Africa. Like the Cold War , the Global War on Terror establishes a rationale for bolstering U.S. military presence and support in Africa. Yet official pronouncement of U.S. policy is routinely presented as if neither of these two developments occurred. Unfortunately , the more evasive we are about our intentions on the continent , the more we invite not only skepticism , but even resistance . </insist.v.2068><insist.v.2069>I come here today to insist the communitarian platform is too powerful to ignore anymore.

Marianne took pity on Jeff when he asked all the wrong questions about her family. Jeff was pleased when Marianne rebuffed Daryll in favor of inviting him to stay for dinner. Brooks made himself scarce when Jim came over. Beatrice smiled to herself when Jim insisted he was n't jealous of Brooks. Daryll admitted to Michael that Molly has gotten into trouble with Sharlene because he forgets how young Molly is. Ada told Gil and Mac that Clarice had been using the name Delaney. Marianne was upset with Michael and Glenda for interrupting her coffee and cake with Jeff. When Jim criticized her obsession with Sally , Beatrice pointed out Brooks does n't share his views. Ada , Gil , and Mac realized they need to keep Iris from learning Clarice is in Bay City . </insist.v.2072><insist.v.2073>You greatly misunderstand the role that GOVERNMENT is supposed to play in situations like this. They are not supposed to be the first ones on the spot. They are the ones who GUARANTEE that the event will be INVESTIGATED , not covered up like your esteemed private airlines company would like it to be. What could have been done , what should be done , when will it be done ? Those are all questions that GOVERNMENT is intended to enforce. To insist that government is going to be everywhere in every instance is the kind of UNREASONABLE expectations that only someone who wants to criticize would assert . </insist.v.2073><insist.v.2074>The body-soul issue is one that has been debated and discussed for many centuries and in many religions and cultures. It is certainly present in the modern State of Israel. Many Yeshivot refuse to allow their students to fight in the army. They insist that they are protecting Israel spiritually through their learning and physical protection should be taken care of by others . </insist.v.2074><insist.v.2075>When Sekgoma II became Chief he insisted that as a result of their reconciliation , his father had altered his will verbally and allotted the bulk of his house and cattle to him. Indeed Sekgoma said that Khama had ordered the will to be burnt. The Resident Commissioner accordingly advised Tshekedi that Khama had altered the will verbally. But it had not in fact been burnt , and it was unclear whether verbal declarations made in overrode an English-style will. In tradition , such a will had no place. But then Khama in his fifty year reign had overridden many other customary laws and introduced the concept of the King 's own personal property. If the will of 1907 was held valid , then Tshekedi was a very rich man , while the young Chief Seretse would be heir only to his late father Sekgoma 's not insubstantial herd. For the time being this did not become an issue , since by Tswana law Tshekedi as Regent was responsible for administering the property of his ward. But it was to be the subject of great bitterness between uncle and nephew twenty-five years later . </insist.v.2075><insist.v.2076>Jewish ethics , then , differs from the Christian in insisting that man , now as in the beginning , still has the power to discern between right and wrong and to choose between them. The consciousness of sin , and the helplessness of the sinner , are not taught or recognized. Therefore Jewish ethics is not tinged with quietism or Asceticism. Resignation and submission are not among the tendencies it fosters or justifies. Resistance to evil , and its discomfiture by remedial and positive good , is the keynote of Jewish morality , individual as well as social. Pessimism and optimism alike are eliminated by a higher synthesis; the former as negative of the inherent godliness ( or morally purposed creation ) of the universe and the essential worthiness of human life , the latter as ignoring the place assigned to man in the economy of things , and , with its one-sided insistence that " whatever is , is right , " paralyzing man 's energies. Meliorism , the conscious effort at improvement , perhaps expresses the character of Jewish ethics . </insist.v.2076><insist.v.2077>January 19 , 1996 : At a closed-door meeting of the General Assembly Working Group on Strengthening the UN , US Representative Madeleine Albright reiterates her government 's position that the UN must undergo a " major " changes.

Finally , Europe could help with institution building and peacekeeping in NK after a peace deal is reached . </insist.v.2084><insist.v.2085>Weber contrasts with Durkheim on both counts. By insisting on the impossibility of a " pre-supposition-less " sociology , he afforded the observer a more active role in the generation of scientific knowledge. The precise role of the observer , moreover , is guided toward empirical data and problems , which are significant to him from a cultural point of view. And by insisting on the centrality of subjective meaning as the basic ingredient of action , including social action , Weber gave both the actor and the investigator a more active role. In regarding the actor as meaningfully oriented to his environment , Weber insisted that a significant portion of the variables that " explain " human behavior had to be found in the pattern of meanings given to his environment and behaving in accord with these meanings. The actor 's own definition of the situation , in short , contributes to explaining his behavior. Also , by insisting on the importance of subjective meaning , Weber saw the task of the observer - that of empathetic understanding - as calling for a more active effort than observing and recording the phenomena that nature produces . </insist.v.2085><insist.v.2086>Through his allies in London he put pressure on the Dominions Office , whose Secretary , J.H. Thomas , was deeply embarassed by the fact that a military expedition had been launched into one of the territories for which he was responsible without any reference to him. Indeed Thomas and his officials did all they could to secure a way of restoring Tshekedi while at the same time saving the face of the local administration. They insisted that Tshekedi withdraw any claim to have jurisdiction over the whites living in his territory. Tshekedi at first showed great reluctance to do this : but Jennings and Buchanan put great pressure on him to do so. They argued that if he remained in exile and under suspension Rey would achieve his objective and enact the Proclamations in Gamangwato . </insist.v.2086><insist.v.2087>Much recent scholarly interest in Bacon has focused on the drawings controversy : whether the many preparatory sketches and studies found in the artist ' s studio and elsewhere after his death studies which , while he was alive , he insisted he never produced could be genuine. ( It seems pretty obvious that some are , and some aren ' t. ) A room at the Tate ( Archive ) is devoted to some genuine-looking sketches , over-painted photographs and doctored images , while Francis Bacon : Incunabula by Martin Harrison and Rebecca Daniels is a spellbinding pictorial record of the most significant of Bacon ' s visual sources. The entire fantastic compost of rags , paints , brushes , magazines , torn-out pages and tattered reproductions laid down over decades in Bacon ' s South Kensington mews has been reconstructed entire at the Dublin City Gallery , the Hugh Lane. While the artist ' s living space was almost monastic in its austerity , his workroom was a materialization of the rich , sedimented strangeness of his inner world. To him , both discipline and chaos seem to have been indispensable . </insist.v.2087><insist.v.2088>Yet such claims , insists Adamthwaite , only reveal their " ignorance of the operation of the then operating Temple ritual.

In 1974 , they changed their line since Israel ' s existence had never been imperiled. But they insisted that if it had been , they would have defended Israel; what remains consistent is their defense of the oppressor nation , which is now a small imperialist power in its own right. They went from defending the Zionist ethnic cleansers to mere indifference . </insist.v.2094><insist.v.2095>If the limits on that authority are severe , say £ 100 , 000 to settle what may be a viable £ 2 million claim , and the mediator is informed of this in confidence , he may insist that the other parties be made aware of this; they can decide for themselves if they want to proceed on that basis. If an insurance carrier comes to the mediation with a £ 1 million limit to settle a £ 5 million claim , the mediator may insist that a representative of the top-up carrier be present or be available by telephone. In cases which require final approval from a Board of Directors or some other governing body , the mediator may insist that the party present be armed with authority to effectively recommend the outcome. And in cases where a party comes with £ 25 million of authority to settle a £ 100 million claim , the mediator may insist on nothing at all. Each case is different and each presents its own problems. But the mediator can not effectively deal with any of them unless he knows the limits of each party ' s authority -- prior to the mediation . </insist.v.2095><insist.v.2096>More than 1 , 000 steelworkers bowed their heads to pray in the McBride Union Hall in Gary last Thursday night before heading to picket the huge Gary Works steel plant. For the first time in 27 years , U.S. Steel , now a division of the newly renamed USX corporation , was shut down. In all , 23 , 000 members of the United Steelworkers union walked off their jobs at 16 plants in nine states , from Pennsylvania to Utah. The workers insist that the company has locked them out , while management calls the action a strike. By any name , predicts Union Spokesman Gary Hubbard , " it 's going to be a long fight. " The walkout began after negotiations on a new contract broke down. USX rejected a union offer of a wage freeze , insisting that the company needs pay-and-benefit concessions to stay in line with industry labor costs.

I was desirous of putting on the extra man , because Mitchell and the other leaders of the miners had urged me to appoint some high Catholic ecclesiastic. Most of the miners were Catholics , and Mitchell and the leaders were very anxious to secure peaceful acquiescence by the miners in any decision rendered , and they felt that their hands would be strengthened if such an appointment were made. They also , quite properly , insisted that there should be one representative of labor on the Commission , as all of the others represented the propertied classes. The operators , however , absolutely refused to acquiesce in the appointment of any representative of labor , and also announced that they would refuse to accept a sixth man on the Commission; although they spoke much less decidedly on this point.

This was especially true given that my term as President would come to an end on December 31 , 2000 and the organization was scheduled to install a new president and new set of officers at our year-end convention. Many of us were acutely concerned that we should have the information from the commission as to whether some of the people being considered for officer positions had been implicated in protecting or supporting Lanner so our nominating committee could remove them from consideration.

One of Del Ponte 's key sources of misinformation in her witch hunt against Gen. Gotovina ( and other Croat generals ) has been Savo Strbac , a former government secretary in the rebel Serb self-styled Krajina para-state. Investigative journalist Brian Gallagher has incisively uncovered that Strbac was a high-ranking official of the RSK ( Republika Serpska Krajina ) .

In that controversy , Van Til insisted that there is " not one point of identity " between God 's mind and man's. Clark believed this view had skeptical implications. He insisted that God and man are capable of entertaining and believing the same propositions. Beyond this , the debate went through many complicated twists and turns. However , Clark never denied , in my view , the point that God 's mind and man 's were different in their metaphysical nature. Nor did Van Til deny that God and man could believe the same proposition. Therefore , in my view , the controversy was really unnecessary and largely based on misunderstanding. Van Til in my view was at his worst when he was debating with other Christian apologists . </insist.v.2125><insist.v.2126>Yet they should always be borne in mind and insisted on; for the creation of healthy public sentiment in an assembly is as important for its success as the observance of the laws of politeness is necessary to the comfort and well-being of a community.

Anyway most of what the Government was insisting on had been pretty well conceded already. The Foreign Minister , should insist on removing the explicit primacy of EU law if the Government was sincere , he would also insist on striking out the European diplomatic service and a series of other proposals that would lead to a European State. He said it was not so much a White Paper as a white flag .

As far as I am concerned , what we have is an acting Presidency led by Goodluck Jonathan. If the president says he is back in the country , let him follow what the Constitution says. He should write a letter to the National Assembly reporting for duty. Why is there so much desperation ? And it is not enough for him to say that he is back in Nigeria.

Bacon only painted a handful of female confidants , insisting that he must know his sitters intimately. Isabel Rawsthorne provided unique focus for the artist : she was his preferred female muse and inspired a greater number of small portrait canvases than any of his other friends , accounting for at least eighteen works between 1964 and 1983. From these , only three paintings in diptych format survive , amongst which the present work is outstanding. Bacon and Rawsthorne first met in the late 1940s at the home of Erica Brausen , who represented both artists at her Hanover Gallery in London.

But most disturbing of all was publication of the hard-line draft agreement that British and Dutch negotiators had handed to Iceland ' s finance minister on June 5 , 2009. It failed utterly to reflect the caveats that Icelandic negotiators had insist on the previous November. Bolstered by Gordon Brown ' s shrill rhetoric and Britain ' s insistence that the terms be kept secret , the EU ' s harsh take-it-or-leave-it stance created an atmosphere in which the Althing had little choice but to draw a line and insist that any Icesave settlement had to reflect Iceland ' s reasonable ability to pay. Icesave was caricatured as Iceslave signifying the debt peonage with which Iceland was threatened. The finance minister ( a former Communist leader ) seemed out of his depth in having knuckled under in the face of pressure to capitulate to unyielding British negotiators . </insist.v.2151><insist.v.2152>So all you men who are complaining about how your partner spends you money like its hers , well in a way it is , in terms of being compensation for the HUGE financial opportunity cost that your partner has to experience in the raising of your kids.

While Paul does not condemn those who manage to receive full-time support , neither does he teach that full-time support is the normal will of God for advancing the gospel ( 1 Cor. 9 : 12 ) .

But , Muhammad 's storytelling was boring and he was mocked by an-Nadr ibn al-Harith who insisted that his own tales of Persian kings were far more interesting. ( After the battle of Badr the prophet had his revenge and slew an-Nadr. ) Muhammad himself appreciated a good story and incorporated pretty bits of folk tale into the Koran where he could. However , this provided a dilemma for Muhammad. If he merely reproduced tales he would be accused of plagiarism , but if he changed them he would be accused of falsifying. He could n't just invent new stories , for his imagination was vivid but not creative. All of his characters talk the same way and he has very little sense of action.

" " Because it is different than other churches , there is more evidence of spiritual power here , " was his answer. " Do you know why that is ? " " Well , you stand for some thing , " he admitted. " And yet , " I said , " you would like to have us remove one of the standards that , according to your own testimony , makes our church one of power and blessing.

The productive nature of the historical creation of categories is given a positive valence from the outset; being made known to be Velama sets off indicators for right action and success. Vizianagaram , alternatively , is given no specific jati affiliation at this point , significant since Velama-ness is clearly critical for Bobbili. While being non-Velama is not given a negative valence at this point ( it is merely neutral ) , it does later serve as a productive anti-pod to Velama-ness . </insist.v.2161><insist.v.2162>Edward Norton turned down the project when he was first approached but Marvel insisted that he meet with director Louis Leterrier , and Norton relented.

But no screenwriter was ever hired and Norton did a substantial page-one rewrite by himself. Anne Thompson explains : With about two months to go before the movie started filming , Norton did a page one rewrite knowing that he couldn ' t do anything radical , because sets were being built , locations found , etc. The entire Brazil sequence was already story-boarded.

Although he insists that he appreciates Vivie 's unconventionality , he continually tries to avoid conflict and embarrasses easily.

He knows that the danger is all the greater because art is now clogged with a noisy , opaque logorrhoea of theory that prevents a work from coming into direct , media-free contact with its viewer ( its reader , its listener ) . Wherever he can , Bacon therefore blurs his tracks to throw off interpreters who try to reduce his work to an over-facile programme : he bridles at using the word horror with regard to his art; he stresses the role of chance in his painting ( chance turning up in the course of the work an accidental spot of paint that abruptly changes the very subject of the picture ); he insists on the word play when everyone is making much of the seriousness of his paintings.

The gleanings from the latest focus groups by the White House or a sample-of-one phone poll of Dick Morris by the President ? Above all , because they so often changed their minds after sponsoring a UN resolution , why could n't he jump through the same hoops ? They foisted presidential appointees on him and then made him take the rap when they failed at their allotted tasks.

While Franco and his friends more or less openly prepared to put this plan into effect , the liberals in the government did nothing , except make token gestures of displeasure. Even after the army generals in almost every city in Spain had mutinied in July , the government continued to insist that all was well. Had things depended on the ' moderate ' bourgeois republicans , Franco would have enjoyed overnight success. What thwarted him was the reaction of the workers. In most of the main cities and towns of mainland Spain the officers mutiny was immediately followed by more or less spontaneous uprisings of workers to seize the barracks , and disarm the army . </insist.v.2181><insist.v.2182>" Bush has claimed that his executive powers allow him to bypass more than 1 , 100 laws enacted since he took office.

Resisting efforts to humanize or personalize the Japanese , they objected strenuously to inclusion of photos or artifacts that would place human faces on the bombs ' victims and recall their individual suffering. For them , the viewpoint should have remained that of the bombers above the mushroom cloud , not the victims below it. It is worth noting that , prior to the change in military policy in September 1943 , U.S. publications were filled with photos of Japanese war dead , but no U.S. publication carried photos of dead American soldiers.

There were the inevitable accusations that the Justice Department was motivated by politics - the firm took out an ad in the New York Times to publish a letter from four Democratic Congressmen calling the indictment " a very thinly veiled attempt by the Bush administration to accomplish by bullying and intimidation what it has not been able to do by law - to end class-action lawsuits ... .

A theology without a metaphysical horizon could not move beyond an analysis of religious experience , nor would it allow the intellectus fidei to give a coherent account of the universal and transcendent value of revealed truth. If I insist so strongly on the metaphysical element , it is because I am convinced that it is the path to be taken in order to move beyond the crisis pervading large sectors of philosophy at the moment , and thus to correct certain mistaken modes of behaviour now widespread in our society " ( 83 ) . </insist.v.2195><insist.v.2196>Weich declined to identify the other lawyers , but he insisted that no political appointee at the Justice Department " would permit or has permitted any prior affiliation to interfere with the vital task of protecting national security , and any suggestion to the contrary is absolutely false.

Though there are several passages in the gospels where Christ mentions divorce , the definitive passage is Matthew 19 : 1-9. Some will quote one of the other passages where the Lord does n't mention any grounds for divorce ( Mk. 10 : 11-12; Luke 16 : 18; ) and insist there are no grounds. But this forces Christ to contradict himself in Matthew 19 where He does mention grounds. None of the other passages add anything to what is recorded in Matthew 19 , so this is the passage we will concentrate on . </insist.v.2197><insist.v.2198>At Tate Britain is a glorious centenary show of paintings by one of our greatest modern painters , Francis Bacon. It ' s more than 20 years since the last Bacon retrospective at the Tate , but the Bacon industry has been chugging steadily away in the interim. His studio which the Tate declined , astonishingly was transported to Dublin , and opened there with much fanfare over the vast archaeological operation of decoding the layers of source material and detritus which comprise the studio floor. Then there was the revelation of the cache of Bacon drawings ( shown at the Tate in 1999 ) after the artist himself and the leading Bacon expert David Sylvester had spent their lives insisting that Bacon never drew. Other exhibitions have taken place most recently Bacon in the 1950s at the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich ( 2006 ) and various books have appeared . </insist.v.2198><insist.v.2199>The oil and gas companies , their industry groups and think tanks , take the opposite stance.

In his case the arbitration plea was inserted only after the record had been closed. The minute of amendment in which it first appeared was not supported by a rule 18 note.

What makes this whole process develop ? Why does it change ? There are any number of religious and philosophical theories which try to answer this question by insisting that the motor of change lies outside the historical process with god , or in the unchanging pattern of human nature or in the eternal features of the human soul. Marx and Engels rejected these approaches as mystical and , literally , supernatural. They insisted that the processes which drove the development of nature and society forward must be internal contradictions , not supersensible entities like god , the soul or , as Hegel had argued , the general essence of human consciousness existing somewhere in the ether beyond the consciousness of actual living human beings . </insist.v.2205><insist.v.2206>My mom got the same call just a minute ago.

My mom immediatly got me on my cell phone calling walmart. Our local walmart didn ' t know about the scam , but knew enough to say that they aren ' t giving away any vouchers. The funniest thing was- the intire time I was on the phone with Walmart the girl with the scam stayed on the phone patiently. When I found out it was indead a scam , my mom hung up on her.

The skeptic refuses to take the farmer 's advice because the latter could not possibly give Carnell 's " report of reason. " His colleague , however , trusts the farmer and the story ends with him at his goal " refreshing himself " and the skeptic standing in frustration at the fork. I submit that it is Augustine 's story , not Carnell 's , that is the true Christian parable. The skeptic insisted on strong belief but lost the prize; his partner had faith and won it. Many Christians miss the implicit rebuke of the doubting Thomas , who like Augustine 's skeptic wanted strong belief. Recall what Jesus said : " Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe [ better : have fiducia ] " ( Jn. 20 : 29 ) . Smith 's claim that virtually all of the renderings of 'emunah and pistis as " believe " are significant mistranslations is well supported by this verse . </insist.v.2209><insist.v.2210>Champions of sovereignty reject the validity of any military mission that does not bear directly upon the attacking nation 's interests. But war advocates who believe that leaders are not morally obliged to weigh the interests of all people equally may insist ( somewhat less emphatically ) that no nation could be required to help outsiders in need , though this may sometimes be permitted. " Humanitarian interventions " , by definition , do not involve the " vital interests " of the intervening nations. Accordingly , it is sometimes said that the military personnel in such cases are acting supererogatorily , " above and beyond the call of duty " . In this view , the beneficiaries of military intervention should simply be grateful that any form of assistance whatsoever has been offered. The idea here is that , since the intervening nations are doing the recipients of their action a favor , to which they are in no way entitled , they have no grounds for complaint when the mission is not a resounding success . </insist.v.2210><insist.v.2211>ASA urges the USTR to insist the EU meet its obligations.

" The Lord knows in some " unequally yoked " marriage situations the unbeliever will not be content to remain married to a believer and will break the marriage. In cases like this the believer is simply to " let him depart. " No individual can guarantee another 's actions and neither can they force another to do what they want or what is even right. Every individual , whether saved or not , has a free will , so a believer can not force his spouse to stay in a marriage if she is determined to go. Again , the Scriptures say " let him depart. " The believer is not " bound " in such a marriage. In some cases if the believer insisted to stay with the unbeliever and followed him when he departed , violence may result; but " God hath called us to peace. " Strife , contention , and violence are not conducive to peace , so " let him depart.

He also insists that the senses inform us reliably of variations in the qualities of what is , so that earth , aither , fire , and water , the four roots of all things , can all be distinguished from one another through their essential sensible qualities. These four are beginningless , indestructible , and equally balanced in power and quantity. As in Parmenides , all other sorts of stuff arise as mixtures , and everything found in the world is structured from them. The creation and destruction of everything else that may seem to be is nothing more than the mingling of these four and their subsequent separation. Only the four elements really are , and all the rest are but temporary situations involving the elements , not things strictly so-called. Thus Empedocles takes the four world-masses of the Ionians and revises them to meet Parmenidean requirements . </insist.v.2216><insist.v.2217>It 's conceivable that a new home for the Saints could end up being build with federal disaster recovery funds.

The Master Therion does not care a scrap of yesterday 's newspaper whether he was Marius de Aquila , or whether there ever was such a person , or whether the Universe itself is anything more than a nightmare created by his own imprudence in the matter of rum and water. His memory of Marius de Aquila , of the adventures of that person in Rome and the Black Forest , matters nothing , either to him or to anybody else. What matters is this : True or false , he has found a symbolic form which has enabled him to govern himself to the best advantage. " Quantum nobis prodest hec fabula Christi !

The first call was from Joe DiMaggio Jr. , son of Monroe 's second husband , Joe DiMaggio , at 7 to 7 : 15 p.m. The conversation was pleasant and Monroe seemed in good spirits. The second call came from Peter Lawford at 7 : 40 or 7 : 45 p.m. Her speech was now slurred and almost inaudible.

To this Berlin added a caution ( evocative as much of Max Weber as of Herzen ) about the unpredictability of the future. Berlin 's belief in the power of human agency was qualified by an awareness of how the consequences of any course of action are unknowable , and likely to be quite different from what was intended. This led Berlin , on the one hand , to stress the need for caution and moderation; and , on the other , to insist that uncertainty is inescapable , so that all action , however carefully undertaken , involves the risk of error and disastrous , or at least unexpected and troubling , consequences. The result was an ethic of political humility , similar to Weber 's ethic of responsibility , but lacking its tone of grim , stoic grandeur . </insist.v.2229><insist.v.2230>" I regret any pain my actions , or inactions , caused , " Willig told some 400 students in his 45-minute speech.

If subsequent writers labor on an original screenplay as script doctors , they must contribute more than half of the final screenplay to receive credit. The Guild compares the final cut of the film against both drafts , favoring story and characters over dialogue. And as I said before , most of Norton ' s changes were dialogue driven. The conclusion was that Penn would get sole screenplay credit. Zak Penn ' s original script was also said to include two pivotal scenes from his 16-year-old screenplay attempt : Bruce Banner jumping out of a helicopter , and the scene where Banner tries to get intimate with Betty , but his rising heart rate becomes an issue . </insist.v.2235><insist.v.2236>Elena Bonner , wife of Andre Sakhorov , both strong advocates of human rights , is an amazing woman , with an indomitable spirit , and , a reader put it , " a clearly articulated moral clarity. " She and Sakhorov have insisted on Israel 's " right to existence within safe borders. " She asks why human rights advocates actively protest the treatment of the Guatanamo prisoners , but are unconcerned about Gilad Schalit. She quotes Sakhorov saying " All wars that Israel has waged have been just , forced upon it by the irresponsibility of Arab leaders "; " With all the money that has been invested in the problem of Palestinians , it would have been possible long ago to resettle them and provide them with good lives in Arab countries. " As one reader remarked , " How eloquent she remains , and her end quote should be clipped and posted by all who care about the world retaining its essential proclivity toward decency , respect for Life and Freedoms.

He or she must be deeply knowledgeable about the region and willing to engage in bona fide negotiations , rather than merely insisting on unilateral concessions under the veiled threat of military force. An American envoy must also break with the curious but useless tradition of " strategic ambiguity " regarding the Israeli nuclear arsenal.

The Court recognizes , however , ante , at 819-820 , n. 15 , that it has squarely rejected any mechanical interpretation of the Bill of Rights. Mr. Chief Justice Warren , speaking for a unanimous Court in Singer v. United States , 380 U.S. 24 , 34 -35 ( 1965 ) , stated : " The ability to waive a constitutional right does not ordinarily carry with it the right to insist upon the opposite of that right. " </insist.v.2243><insist.v.2244>Just what is dangerous about this tendency ? A devotion to feelings enables a people to dispense quickly with judgment. There 's no waiting around to ponder pros and cons , no careful consultation of a variety of points of view , no turn to the past to consider the lessons of history. The greatest danger of a reliance on feelings as one 's guide to behavior , opinion , and judgment is absolutism. " Absolutism " is the championing of a categorical judgment -- either pro or con -- to the exclusion of qualification , discussion , or process. It is to insist that only one way is " right. " As you can see , Americans ' typical reliance on personal standards in their individualism and on the practical in their utilitarianism , intensifies the tenacity which the absolutist is likely to stand fast in his position. Justice Oliver Windell Holmes had this to say about such certainty : </insist.v.2244><insist.v.2245>Syncretism , writ large , acquires a new comprehensibility under Brown 's explanation. Committed pragmatically to relativism in the domain of religion , politicians , priests , and intellectuals needed to insist that one god was as good as another , except in the case where his adherents insisted that he was better than any other , or even exclusively the God to the detriment of all others. For at least one emperor , Alexander Severus ( 222-235 ) , this was a matter of conscious policy : " In his domestic chapel , " as Edward Gibbon reports , " he placed statues of Abraham , of Orpheus , of Apollonius and of Christ , as an honour due to those respectable sages who had instructed Mankind in the various modes of addressing their homage to the supreme and universal deity " ( in Toynbee [ V 549 ] ) . Yet like modern multiculturalism , the Severan type of syncretism could only have been a piece of official propaganda , or at best a half-hearted pose of the elites , since the adherents of the many cults remained parochial in their outlook. Those who revered Abraham did not also revere Orpheus and Apollo , nor did those who revered Christ also revere Apollonius , who , taking Philostratus at his word , was a remarkably rivalrous fellow for a sage . </insist.v.2245><insist.v.2246>Some Americans have gone considerably beyond this [ equality of opportunity ] in their equalitarian views , insisting that no man should be regarded as better than another in any dimension , and that there should be no difference in status whatever.2 </insist.v.2246><insist.v.2247>I thought the rule was the person that asked the person out on the date , paid unless during the date setting conversation an alternate payment scheme was discussed.

Some of these practices , like insisting that the company has a clearly drafted code of ethics , or that management implement a coherent and aggressive compliance program such as that suggested in Caremark , are obvious. There are consultants who can assist in the design of such programs. Indeed , the shaping of compliance programs is now a vigorous growth industry . </insist.v.2248><insist.v.2249>In The Violent Bear It Away , O'Connor draws large and startling figures , and she shouts her message so modern , apathetic readers will take note. She uses Tarwater a strange , violent , grotesque figure to present her vision to a hostile audience and show them in extreme terms the importance , difficulty , and urgency of God 's message. O'Connor insist that her readers take Tarwater seriously because what he has to say and show is of dire importance , difficult though it may be to fathom and to stomach. In some ways , Tarwater is larger than life because he is used to emphasize O'Connor 's beliefs about the intense , bizarre , and incomprehensible nature of God. But any attempt to rationalize that he or his vocation are not to be taken entirely seriously , is to then assume the rationalist position that O'Connor rejects. By presenting an extreme character and extreme situations , O'Connor forces modern readers to look at the most terrible aspects of Christianity. Like a prophet , she presents an uncompromising vision , which she views as necessary to point readers to the mysterious and unpalatable truths of the Christian faith . </insist.v.2249><insist.v.2250>Lagos The Save Nigeria Group ( SNG ) made up of eminent personalities like Prof. Wole Soyinka , Prof. Pat Utomi , Alhaji Balarable Musa , Pastor Tunde Bakare among others , yesterday insisted that President Umaru Yar'Adua must be impeached </insist.v.2250><insist.v.2251>The days that followed were a case study in damage control.

Ridgewood insisted that it had n't glommed onto a tournament that was still technically committed to another club. Finally , after sniping at one another directly and through the press for weeks , Westchester officials and PGA Tour executives found themselves together in Halpern 's White Plains office on Martin Luther King Day. By Halpern 's account , the possibility of litigation was n't so much threatened as implied . </insist.v.2251><insist.v.2252>Anaxagoras insisted that space is infinitely divisible , and then argues that each and every one of the indefinite number of kinds he is dealing with may be , and is , present in every finite region of space. The indefinitely large number of kinds present no problem , since they can form indefinitely small proportions of the whole. So half of what is here may be iron , one quarter wood , one eighth the hot , and so on , indefinitely. Since every region of space , however small , has every quality and kind of stuff present in it , there are no pure samples of any quality or kind of stuff at all. However , some kinds of stuff and some qualities in any given region in space will be stronger , that is , they will make themselves more or less manifest to the senses , while others will fall below the threshold of perception and remain entirely undetected. Hence our senses suggest to us as we gaze on the smithy ' s work that all that is present on the anvil is hot iron , when in fact there is bone and cotton as well , and even the cold , though in small quantities . </insist.v.2252><insist.v.2253>Of course , we arrive at this conclusion after death has come.

Something happens between these deaths. Somehow we forget. We do n't insist . </insist.v.2253><insist.v.2254>CONCLUSIONS William Arnold was the first person to allege Frances Farmer was lobotomized. He provides absolutely no supporting evidence , either documentary or otherwise , in his book. Conversely , many people intimately connected with the case are on record , using their names , saying no lobotomy ever was performed on Farmer. The Farmer family has always insisted no operation took place. Nurses who were there at the time insisted no operation took place. Definitive archival records clearly show that Frances was not operated on. Western State was excited about their lobotomy program and certainly would not have kept an operation on Farmer secret for any reason; Keller and Freeman were both eagerly seeking press coverage of the lobotomies , and were in fact successful in garnering copious press for the program at Western State . </insist.v.2254><insist.v.2255>The vital issue is not the activities in which Government engages , but the conditions under which it engages in them.

" I do not think that we would say that modern authors of best-selling physics text books must qualify as great physicists. Instead , we would insist that , in order to be a great physicist , one has to make an important original contribution which enlarges the store of physical knowledge.

If the Democrats really want to spend that kind of money for war , at least they should find some way to pay for it , such as cutting spending for some of the Pentagon ' s elaborate and unnecessary new weapons systems or by eliminating some of the tax breaks given to the wealthy. Instead , the Democrats insist on borrowing it from primarily foreign financial institutions or from future government revenue. By the time it is paid off with interest , the total cost will likely be more than twice the $ 100 billion the Democrats claim the war is costing. The costs of paying off the increased national debt as a result of this war will result in severely restricted funding in health care , education , housing , public transit , and environmental protection for decades to come. But that is of little concern to the Democrats , who place a higher priority in allowing Bush to fight the Iraq War as he sees fit . </insist.v.2262><insist.v.2263>In a meeting in Washington with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in late May , Papandreou presented a Greek-Czech initiative for a 48-hour pause in the allied bombing of Yugoslavia to give Milosevic time to respond to NATO ' s proposed peace plan and enhance prospects for the adoption of a U.N.

In Singer v. United States , 380 U.S. 24 , the Court held that an accused has no right to a bench trial , despite his capacity to waive his right to a jury trial. In so holding , the Court stated that " [ t ] he ability to waive a constitutional right does not ordinarily carry with it the right to insist upon the opposite of that right. " Id. , at 34-35. But that statement was made only after the Court had concluded that the Constitution does not affirmatively protect any right to be tried by a judge. Recognizing that an implied right must arise independently from the design and history of the constitutional text , the Court searched for , but could not find , any " indication that the colonists considered the ability to waive a jury trial to be of equal importance to the right to demand one. " Id. , at 26. Instead , the Court could locate only " isolated instances " of a right to trial by judge , and concluded that these were " clear departures from the common law.

Lutherans have been concerned with whether the papal office is necessary for salvation. Today , when the pastoral nature of the papacy and its reform have been taken seriously by the Catholic Church itself , the question of the papacy may be perceived in a different way , in terms of the ecclesial necessity of the papal office. To what extent may such an office of universal ministry be needed for the unity of the church in a koinonia of salvation ?

They fear that protecting religious liberty will allow religion , and religious people , to be above the law. Part of what is at work is a notion of equal treatment trumping liberty. Equal treatment is seen as more important than individual liberty , liberty requiring unequal treatment.

Let ' s be clear on what ' s principled here , ' ' she said at the time of her opponent , US Representative Michael Capuano.

The designer may prefer to have things put in motion in such a way that his/her/its intentions unfurl and reveal themselves as time goes by. The pattern in a piece of cloth made by machine is as much an object of design as the pattern from cloth produced by a hand loom. In other words , in a sense that would conform to the normal usage of the terms , one might want to say of something that it is produced by laws , is chance with respect to our knowledge or theory , and fits into an overall context of design by the great orderer or creator of things. In short , Dembski 's filter does not let Behe 's designer off the hook . </insist.v.2289><insist.v.2290>As a woman , I prefer to pay for the first date or two.

But how is it when , if the same would trouble himself to find a buyer for one hundred zuz , he could get one , but he did not , and sold out for two hundred zuz , and was insisting upon the immediate payment of the remainder ?

They fled to the regional capital , Goma , where it was said the government was building a stronger defense against the rebel army. The UN is making an attempt to settle the conflict by encouraging both sides to not disrespect the " humanitarian situation " by continuing to fight. However , the rebels insist the government army fired on them to begin with restarting the conflict.

The couple 's first two children , Sophie ( born in 1855 , and named by her grandmother without Sisi 's being consulted ) and Gisela ( born in 1856 ) , were installed in a nursery near Sophie 's apartments , and raised by attendants chosen by -- and loyal to -- their grandmother ( as were those who had been chosen to attend Elisabeth upon her arrival in Vienna ); Sisi had little power over their upbringing , and little contact with the girls at all. She did insist that the children accompany her and Franz Joseph on a state visit to Hungary in 1857 , during which they became ill and little Sophie died -- a misfortune which became used as proof that the young Empress was unfit to be a mother . </insist.v.2306><insist.v.2307>Dave advised patience about Russ 's impotence , but Sharlene felt her aggressiveness was fueled by her insecurities.

Almost from the beginning in Painting , 1946 , now too fragile to have made the trip from MoMA to the current exhibition at Tate Britain the painter evinced a fascination with sides of meat , a motif that recurs in his later crucifixions and couplings. When asked about its preponderance in his imagination he was ready with a dual response.

St. Albert and St. Thomas insisted upon both an organic link between philosophy and theology and autonomy for each. The Holy Father does not here say what this autonomy amounts to , but does bemoan the fact that " from the late Medieval period onwards the legitimate distinction between the two forms of learning became more and more a fateful separation. As a result of the exaggerated rationalism of certain thinkers , positions grew more radical and there emerged eventually a philosophy which was separate from and absolutely independent of the contents of faith. Another of the many consequences of this separation was an ever deeper mistrust with regard to reason itself.

He holds that there is a gigantic struggle going on in the world , between Jewish nationalistic bourgeoisie ( political Zionists ) and Russian Bolsheviks , for world domination , and that Russian Bolsheviks were and are much cleverer than the Jews , so that instead of Russian Bolshevism being an instrument employed by the Jews , as the Jewish banker boasted at Buda-Pesth , the Jews are simply tools in the hands of the Bolsheviks. Such he insists , is the whole truth about Zionist-Bolshevik unity. In his opinion , because the Jews who are ruling in the United States are not American nationalists but Jewish nationalists , the whole U.

Yet it was in practice , and not the abstract knowledge of disciplines , that assessment of learning and ideas would come , as would the pressure for disciplinary learning and disciplining of development. Dewey praised the concreteness ideas gained from embodiment and testing in practice.

Ken pressed Rachel to have dinner with him while Mac and Jamie are in Chadwell , then insisted she 'll soon be ready for a showing. Michael and Glenda shared their summer plans with Ken.

Notice the tense of the word " hath , " it is present tense ! " The woman which HATH a husband ... , " that is , the husband she is married to at the present time , not a former husband she is divorced from. The only divorce mentioned is that of death ( " loosed " ) . There is no indication the woman was ever divorced or that she was ever married before. Those who insist the " husband " is a former , divorced husband are so biased in their opinions that they will wrest and sacrifice the truth of this passage to protect their treasured position that a divorced person can not remarry until their former spouse dies. But anyone who reads the passage objectively will see that it says no such thing. If the woman did marry another man while still married to her present husband , she would be both an adulteress and a bigamist , but it says nothing about her being so if she had a former husband . </insist.v.2347><insist.v.2348>WORCESTER City boss John Barton insists putting the boot into struggling Stalybridge Celtic at St George 's Lane tomorrow will be the perfect tonic for his side as they advance towards the Christmas and New Year period. more ... </insist.v.2348><insist.v.2349>Russia has indicated that it is open to a greater international aspect .

Because they decided that approach was better and they changed the definition , first among themselves , and then they had decided to enforce that private opinion upon the broader society. Next , they insisted that the law recognize their new definition by giving it an equivalent status to the " traditional " notion of private property. Well , we can see where this is headed.

It would be pointless to urge them to look in the direction of a chair and confirm the presence of images or precepts in their own field of vision for they are committed in advance to denying the existence of any such entities and they would insist that all that they could mean by 'seeing a chair ' is covered by some behavioural story involving an actual chair ( or , in the peculiar case of an hallucinatory experience , involving some putative chair ) . </insist.v.2358><insist.v.2359>" We will insist on resolution 1244 and relevant documents being implemented by the leadership of UNMIK , " Churkin said.

Intentions are , strictly speaking , morally irrelevant in utilitarianism. If a military campaign does not lead to an overall improvement in the state of affairs for all members of the moral community , then , according to classical utilitarianism , the executors of war have acted wrongly , even if they had the best of intentions. In contrast , the just war tradition demands that the jus ad bellum requirements be fulfilled , including right intention and just cause , in order for a war to be waged justly. Only a war waged with moral intention could be conducted justly , but some justly waged wars are conducted unjustly , viz. , those in which the requirements of jus in bello are violated . </insist.v.2371><insist.v.2372>Thus it was that Komer landed in Saigon on the run.

He himself wrote the pacification section in 'ambassador Bunker 's weekly message to President Johnson; he participated in the MACV commanders ' conferences; he commented to Bunker and Westmoreland on any number of issues that were hardly within his bureaucratic purview , such as proposed military operations and South Vietnamese political developments; he made private suggestions to Bunker for programs he wanted MACV and other agencies to adopt. Above all , he was determined not to he lost in a big military machine; he would act like a four-star general and insist on being treated like one , even to the extent of demanding a special license plate for his official car. As his hand-picked military deputy , Maj. Gen. George I. Forsythe , later put it : " The whole arrangement was like a grain of sand in an oyster.

The general Messianic Jewish movement tends to have more of an emphasis on reaching non-Messianic Jews with the claims of Jesus as the Messiah. Thus while the Jews involved in certain branches of Messianic Judaism do maintain their Jewish traditions and customs , they may have little interest in persuading non-Jews to adopt those traditions and customs. In fact , the typical Messianic Jewish rabbi may well insist that Gentiles have no need to keep the weekly Sabbath or the annual Holy Days , observe any portion of the Biblical dietary restrictions , or follow any other physical guidelines. They view all of these things as being just part of a specific covenant between God and the Jews , not as laws or even principles which non-Jews need adopt as Christians . </insist.v.2375><insist.v.2376>That does not mean that the Inquisition 's hands were clean. The Holy Office played a crucial role in the persecutions : it diabolized Witchcraft. Inquisitors defined Witchcraft as a heresy , not a Pagan " superstition. " That one word spelled the difference between life and death. Superstition was a minor sin , meriting no more than a mild penance. Heretics were killed. Inquisitors like Heinrich Kramer ( author of the _Malleus Maleficarum_ ) wrote the earliest Witch hunting manuals , tracts that spread the fear of Witchcraft throughout Europe. Finally the Inquisition eliminated the good Witch. It insisted that all Witches got their powers from the Devil. There was no such thing as a good or neutral Witch.

In July , Kaset threatened that a coup was still possible.

But as a way of dealing with out-of-control young people in early 21st century American society , this idea has basically become a myth ! Both the military and military schools are no longer what they used to be. They still can offer a discipline and guidance for the young person who simply is floundering and needs some direction.

Canadian leader Bob White said , " You do n't need a union to walk backwards.

To put this in perspective , the largest loan prior to this was the $ 48 billion package that the IMF gave to Mexico in 1995 following the collapse of the Mexican peso. As with other aid packages , the IMF loans come with conditions attached. The IMF is insisting on a combination of tight macro-economic policies , including cuts in public spending and higher interest rates , the deregulation of sectors formally protected from domestic and foreign competition , and better financial reporting from the banking sector. Although politicians in each country initially resisted these conditions , they ultimately accepted them and so far at least , seem to be pursuing them.

In all but three states the age of consent is 18 , and the age above which the female is no longer a child varies , although 14 is common. The theory of statutory rape is that the girl is incapable of giving consent , although marriage with a parent 's consent is possible in many states at ages as low as 14. Intercourse with a female child ( below 14 or whatever the state law provides ) is rape , which is a felony. Increasingly statutory rape is not charged when there is clear consent by the female , particularly when the girl will not cooperate in a prosecution.

While we may firmly believe that true , deep , and disciplined learning comes only from personal engagement in serious problems , unless we can find a way to harness this idea to orderly learning and institutional imperatives for planning and accountability , it is very difficult to make this insight the basis of widespread schooling. This dilemma needs to be solved if we are to create a robust , pervasive orientation towards learners ' understandings and motivations in our schools at all levels. Even if we are successful in fostering the individual talents of teachers so that they can regularly improvise ways of holding student and subject together , no institution can rely on genius every day by all participants.

Because later discoveries do not fit into their mindset . </insist.v.2402><insist.v.2403>AutoSport.com - Team US F1 still looking for 2011 entry : Team US F1 boss Ken Anderson insists his outfit has not yet given up on its dreams of entering F1 in the future , despite telling its staff to stop work on its current car </insist.v.2403><insist.v.2404>Christ , is to preach him in all his offices; and to declare his law , as well as his gospel , both to believers and unbelievers.

Finally we get to the point where we are about to pass this law. We have improved it with some of the amendments that were moved and passed in the debate in the chamber last week , yet the government has rejected some of those key amendments. The Democrats believe that these amendments should be insisted upon. We urge the ALP to reconsider its position. They were amendments that were hard fought for during the debate. Senator Bolkus gave good reasons for moving those amendments and supporting them. I hope that we do not see the government 's backflip on privacy reflected in an ALP backflip. So let us make this legislation stronger than it is. We have waited long enough - let us get it right.

For example , tradition dictates that it 's " bad luck " for the bride and groom to see each other on their wedding day prior to the ceremony. Have you ever wondered where this idea came from ? It 's quite ancient , and has to do with arranged marriages and religious traditions in which the groom often did n't know who the bride was until her veil was raised during the ceremony. So why do modern couples -- most of whom already live together -- insist on playing 'hide the bride ?

But at this point the church would be getting itself into impossible difficulties in trying to judge intimate motives through some form of quasi-judicial process. It would be trying to make judgements concerning the almost infinite variety of motives that can bring people to a divorce. It would be trying to divide divorced persons into the two simple categories of guilty and innocent parties , though reality is rarely that neat. It would run the serious risk of becoming involved in the emotional charge and counter-charge that can accompany many divorces . </insist.v.2422><insist.v.2423>The headlines tell us that President Obama is committed to working towards a nuclear weapons-free world.

This goal , Obama tells us , will not be reached quickly perhaps not in my lifetime. Further , he says , so long as nuclear weapons exist , the United States will maintain an effective arsenal to deter any adversary. In this , the justification for nuclear weapons remains the same : the elites of every nuclear-armed country always have insisted that nuclear weapons are only for deterrence. With enough nuclear weapons still in existence to destroy civilization and to damage irreparably all life on earth , its time to take a closer look at deterrence. </insist.v.2423><insist.v.2424>Only to find Ms. Gandy insisting that abortion could be banned if a pro-abortion person did not replace Justice O'Connor : " The most recent case , the one that you referred to from Colorado , was a 5-4 decision and Justice O'Connor was the swing vote in that case.

Speaking of the collection for the needy saints of Judea , one of the most noteworthy examples of true " tithing " practiced by the New Testament church , Paul nowhere teaches that anyone give a certain percentage of their income but rather insists : " Every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give; not grudgingly , or of necessity ( lit. 'out of compulsion ' ); for God loveth a cheerful giver. " [ II Cor.9; 7 ] Paul had no desire to see compulsive giving practiced by the early church , even if the giving was directed toward those who were truly deserving of it , because he knew such giving would never please God . </insist.v.2426><insist.v.2427>From the passages listed above , it should be clear to any believer that the Bible gives three grounds of legal , scriptural divorce. Fornication as found in Matthew 5 and 19; death as seen in Romans 7 and 1 Corinthians 7; and desertion found also in 1 Corinthians 7. The Scriptures mention no more or less for a New Testament believer. Furthermore , in every case of divorce , the two parties are no longer bound to each other in any marriage sense. Notice in 1 Corinthians 7 : 11 how the woman who leaves ( divorces ) her husband is considered " unmarried. " Some who adhere to the legalist position insist that " unmarried " in verse 8 means " never married , " but the Bible has a way of correcting biased , " private interpretation ( s ) . " The simple fact is when two people are divorced ( even if it is unscriptural ) the Bible does n't treat them as still married in any way. They are both " unmarried " until they rejoin or marry another . </insist.v.2427><insist.v.2428>2.

' The Antients ' proceeded cautiously , seeking for every step the full accord of the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland , and insisted in the early negotiations that all their Masters and Past Masters then constituting their Grand Lodge should be members of any new and united Grand Lodge; ultimately they gave way on this point , but not until they had been made to realize that there was not a building in London large enough to hold a Grand Lodge based on such a generous qualification . </insist.v.2429><insist.v.2430>We insist we are fully protected from warrantless government invasions of our homes.

Now Searle may dismiss this as " anti-scientific " but it is not inimical to science as are , for example , superstition , obscurantism or pseudoscience.

What procedures will they either undertake themselves or insist that military authorities observe before a person is subjected to lengthy detention ? And to what extent will courts take upon themselves the task of determining the underlying facts ? By limiting its grant of certiorari in Rasul , the Court deliberately deferred its own rulings on those questions , presumably to allow both the executive branch and the lower courtsas well as academic commentary , and , should it bestir itself , Congressto wrestle first with those issues , now that we know definitively that courts will in some fashion scrutinize the actions of the authorities at Guantanamo . </insist.v.2448><insist.v.2449>Yorkshire Building Society charges a £ 100 administration fee and will increase the interest rate on the mortgage by 1 percentage point on loan-to-values over 75 per cent , while Northern Rock ( LSE : GB0001452795.L - news ) will not give consent-to-let if the customer 's loan-to-value is above 70 per cent.

Watani Tyehimba told me that much of Tupac 's anger at Biggie Smalls , Puffy 's most successful rapper , was based on professional jealousy : Tupac was in jail , and Biggie 's single " One More Chance " was No. 1 on the charts.

How did he figure this list out without somehow using " human reasoning ? " Why is his list the ultimate , divine list , an no one else 's ? What makes his list right , and mine wrong , for example ? The fact is that we can not simply divide up biblical teaching into " that which matters , " and " that which is irrelevant. " There is no such list in the Bible. Thus , in an effort to argue that no one actually knows anything , one ends up actually claiming to be the one , infallible purveyor of truth ! </insist.v.2519><insist.v.2520>I think that Edward Norton will be back but he will most likely insist on at least co-writing it and more control on what 's in the final cut.

Plus if there really is 70 minutes of extra footage , I wonder if they could cut it into an origin story for the DVD. For what I 've heard of the cut out stuff , you could use the footage of the his talk with Dr. Samson as a backbone in the style of Hulk : Grey and maybe have Edward Norton record short narration type stuff. I think it would be a good way to set up the film and make it all work well.

The statized properties and enterprises of the new regime have never been placed under the supervision and control of the masses , but are , under occupation by the Soviet army , operated and monopolized by the Communist bureaucrats of the Kremlin order.

Of course , these special interest can be served by means of government regulation of private or social enterprises. For example , the growth of the cable television was restrained by government regulation for over twenty years at the behest of broadcasters. There is , however , good reason to think that it is easier for the government to place contextual rules on government operations than on the operations of private or socially controlled enterprises. In some , but not all cases , there is less resistance from public enterprises than from private or social enterprises to contextual goals , mainly because the former do not have to worry about the effects of meeting contextual goals on revenues or profits. While public bureaucracies do have the means of resisting the directives of higher level government , they usually do not have quite the same standing with legislators as private or social enterprises do. And , at any rate , public enterprises are more likely to use their power to insist on autonomy in defining their main goals rather than in fending off contextual goals . </insist.v.2526><insist.v.2527>Anyway , I am now pg again and i am being monitored 100 times better in a different hospital , however when i saw my consultant just before Xmas , I think he thought it a bit strange I was insisting on an elective section so early in this pg.

There I was taught that baptism was the foremost distinctive of " The Restoration Movement , " which was regarded as having " restored " the New Testament Church , particularly by insisting that " baptism is essential to salvation. " In the homiletics class where young preachers were taught the art of preaching , we were advised to conclude every message with an appeal for people to get baptized and thus become Christians. Though they would deny that saying " baptism is essential for salvation " was a form of " baptismal regeneration , " the explanation was untenable. The basic message was that salvation and the forgiveness of sins was effected and enacted in the rite of baptism. So in essence their theology of baptism was a form of sacramentalism somewhat unique among Protestant churches , but with definite likenesses to Roman Catholic theology. A Church of Christ minister once explained that " a person contacts the blood of Christ when he is submerged in the water of baptism. " This is akin to the transubstantiation explanations in the sacramental theology of Roman Catholicism . </insist.v.2534><insist.v.2535>In Iraq , we must insist that Bush turn the control of the country over to the UN as soon as possible , and that the country not be looted for his oil company buddies and GOP business interests.

Therefore I do not agree with some comrades who object to this discussion. But I should also insist that we must proceed with the discussion in a fully responsible way , both for the revolutionary tasks and for our party , and in a circumspect , exact , and precise manner. It is absolutely wrong to criticize at will the party ' s past policy with giddy and bombastic gestures which create confusion and centrifugal tendencies in the party. The experience of history has already taught us that a political party is most susceptible to centrifugal tendencies under the pressure of a great event , especially in face of growing difficulties in its conditions of work . </insist.v.2539><insist.v.2540>that circumcision is done at a very early age because it is easier to control the infant who is unable to refuse to be circumcised , whereas an adolescent could easily totally disagree. Furthermore , as the child grows older , his parents ' emotions towards him become stronger and therefore , prevent them from letting the procedure be done because they do not want to hurt him. Boyd dealt with the social significance of circumcision. He said that it gives the individual a feeling of helplessness , because when he experiences extreme pain as a vulnerable child who is unable to defend himself , he learns that such violence is inevitable throughout his life in order to survive.

We will seek to shorten divestiture times and encourage merging firms to identify a buyer when proposing settlement. These steps will reduce the time in which the merged firm will have control over the assets it must divest. They will also help the Commission ensure that the buyer is viable. If the buyer appears weak , and the Commission staff has learned about potentially superior alternatives during the investigation , the merging firms can expect some hard questions about their settlement proposal. In addition , we will be more skeptical of relief that requires discretionary post- divestiture actions by respondent , as may arise when the divestiture involves technology transfer or a supply contract , and we will more often insist on crown jewel provisions in such cases. In order to enhance the stand-alone viability of divestiture packages , we will be more skeptical of proposals to divest a narrow package of assets. In consequence , you should expect to see us more frequently insisting that divestiture packages go beyond the narrowest conceivable set of assets that would restore competition where there is a competitive overlap . </insist.v.2543><insist.v.2544>A student-initiated lawsuit would seek to affirm ownership of the thousands of pictures they have shot for the Daily Californian before the contract flap.

By the time of the Revolution , American political leaders and thinkers had been acutely aware of the ambitiousness of our government ideals and insisted that we must distinguish ourselves from European nations. As they observed the role of the most complex of the arts in European societies -- none of which were democracies -- they saw that arts were enjoyed only by the privileged. They had in mind lavish gardens of sculptured mythological figures , rooms of huge paintings depicting mythological fantasies , and expensive stage productions in which the aristocracy actually took part. In those contexts , the arts were expensive , and what was even more worrisome , they were patently not devoted to instruction or spiritual uplift . </insist.v.2551><insist.v.2552>Unlike in America , European countries are moving toward a model of insisting on environmental and consumer safety that requires assessing thousands of chemicals for their potential toxic effects.

Without compliance henceforth , the products of hundreds of US companies may be excluded from European markets , and according to Mark Schapiro , author of Exposed : The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products , " only five percent of all chemicals in the US have undergone even minimal testing. " Further , new EPA requirements consider the " costs to industry " in assessing threats to public health as a reason to side with industry and keep regulations minimal.

It could not be learned whether there has been American involvement in any specific incident in Iran , but , according to Gardiner , the Iranians have begun publicly blaming the U.S. , Great Britain , and , more recently , the C.I.A. for some incidents. The agency was involved in a coup in Iran in 1953 , and its support for the unpopular regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi who was overthrown in 1979 was condemned for years by the ruling mullahs in Tehran , to great effect. This is the ultimate for the Iranians to blame the C.I.A. , Gardiner said. This is new , and it ' s an escalation a ratcheting up of tensions. It rallies support for the regime and shows the people that there is a continuing threat from the ' Great Satan.

The only possible relation between wages and the size of the family is that the size of the wages should regulate the size of the family.

Meanwhile , exponents of multiculturalism insist new arrivals make no effort to assimilate; to do so would be " genocidal , " a notion that makes a mockery of real genocides. Instead , long-forgotten grudges are nursed against the white populace. Native citizens take to flight as the neighborhoods around them , the norms in their hometowns , are debased for the convenience of low-paid immigrants and well-heeled businessmen.

After all , that which is ' possible ' for students and workers is determined by the extent to which a given university is supported by the state. Demanding more than what is currently ' possible ' is simply insisting that the state alter the circumstances that define that ' possibility ' until the people who use these institutions are satisfied by their experiences within them . </insist.v.2565><insist.v.2566>In a break with such authors , the present work contests the notion that caste , and its corresponding " caste system , " was a central feature of Indian society as late as the nineteenth century. My attempt to question the validity of current visions of caste turns its attention to the notion of the link between expression-of-solidarity and formation-of-identity; Velamas came to insist that an understanding of their jati was intricately connected to the story of the martyrdom of Velamas for their king.3 The tale told here hints at an alternate model for caste , whereby its commonly attributed hierarchical and imbedded-in-culture implications were only partially accepted by those who invoked jati names and categories. The telling of the story of the siege of Bobbili in northern Andhra will prove a means to demonstrate the much more metaphorical than substantive understanding of jati in that period.4 In this case , jati appears to have existed apart from caste in the nineteenth century , and yet , through reference to this story of the Velamas , did change into , by the twentieth century , something that we recognize as caste itself , a mere 150 years after the siege . </insist.v.2566><insist.v.2567>Biblical scholars insist that the formative period of the Jewish people was the Exodus events , symbolized by the destruction of Pharaoh ' s force in the Red Sea , and memorized poetically by Marian ' s song that proclaims Yahweh is a man of war.

Adam was not only speaking for himself when he said this , he was mainly speaking of marriage itself as an institution. Some will insist that " What therefore God hath joined together ...

The supernatural outlook insists that we are a race whose highest life , the divine life of grace , by which the Blessed Trinity dwells in our souls , was lost by the fall of Adam , but restored by our Lord Jesus Christ. Naturalism denies the existence of any life higher than natural life and maintains that social relations must be organised on that basis. As members of Christ we are bound to work for the return of society to our loving Saviour , so that social organisation may be permeated with the reality of the supernatural life of grace. Pope Pius XI insists on this in the encyclical on the Kingship of Christ. Let us now take two examples of how our efforts to combat naturalism will bring us into conflict with the Jews in their preparations for the naturalistic Messias.

The International Committee stressed the necessity of basing the development of the Fourth International on the lessons of past struggles. It also insisted that the fight against Pabloite revisionism was a politically and theoretically decisive element of the history of the Fourth International not a diversion from other , more important , tasks of party building. It was precisely in the persistent struggle against the revision of Marxism that the Trotskyist movement fought the ideological pressures exerted by the bourgeoisie and developed its revolutionary perspective. This conception of the historical and political implications of the struggle against revisionism was opposed by two tendencies that had been invited to the Third Congress , in order to determine whether principled political collaboration was possible Voix Ouvri re and James Robertson 's Spartacist tendency.

Fanatical Jews of the Middle Ages attributed the wonderful works of Christ to the potency of the Incommunicable Name , which He was accused of abstracting from the Temple and wearing about Him. It is well known , of course , that the Ineffable Name early acquired Christian import , and we may well suppose that in many early Royal Arch ceremonies this was the one insisted upon.

So like an electricians ' union that demands some guy get paid $ 100 an hour to throw a switch , they insisted DiCaprio was unqualified . </insist.v.2576><insist.v.2577>... Given that Saddam Hussein 's capture did not become the turning point that some commentators claimed it would be -- " the beginning of the end , " former CIA director James Woolsey said at the time -- the White House did not insist that Zarqawi 's death would lead to progress in Iraq. Bush was reasonably realistic when he spoke about the successful strike : " Zarqawi is dead , but the difficult and necessary mission in Iraq continues.

" But slashing an experiment and attempting to stop science is the height of ignorance. " The Sacramento Bee editorialized , " A technological revolution like this ca n't be kept on course by masked fools with scythes.

One of the first things we went over was errors in scientific thinking. What was one of these major errors ? Relying on anecdotes as proof of your hypothesis. Notice I said " major.

In March 1925 , it noted reports that [ 113 ] Turkey and Poland were a discussing Military Entente between themselves and Rumania , even while the Turkish Government was also insisting upon its uncompromising policy over Mosul. The Daily Telegraph thought [ 114 ] this must be due to Soviet support , and to a promise from Moscow of unlirlljted financial and military support for Turkey. The Morning Post similarly accused Mustafa Kemal 's foreign policy of relying on Soviet Russia , and flinging away the allegiance to the Moslem World. [ 115 ] The Morning Post again stressed the danger from Russia and stated " ... if there were any statesmanship left to Turkey she would rather seek the friendship than incur the hostility of the British Empire " [ 116 ] . </insist.v.2582><insist.v.2583>It is not a cardinal sin , this fault , and sometimes it squints toward virtue. It might be argued , for example , that only arrogant men would insist on building the U-2 spy plane within a time frame which the military experts said could not be met. Yet in the days before satellite surveillance , the U-2 spy plane was the most useful means of keeping the peace. It assured this country 's leaders that Russia was not planning an attack. But if arrogance built the plane quickly , it also destroyed it. For surely it was arrogant to keep it flying through Soviet airspace after it was suspected that the Russians were literally zeroing in on overflying U-2s . </insist.v.2583><insist.v.2584>He wrote a memo saying : " The man came forward voluntarily - he is not on trial , " and that an appearance before the FAC would give " disproportionate importance to his evidence " . The Defence Secretary insisted that Dr Kelly should appear , saying that not putting him forward would be difficult " presentationally " , a word much used by Alastair Campbell , Mr. Blair 's director of communications , during his evidence before the inquiry. Sir Kevin told Lord Hutton that he had " glanced at " a question-and-answer crib sheet for MoD press officers - drawn up by Pam Teare , the director of news at the MoD , and Martin Howard , the deputy chief of defence intelligence - as part of the strategy to confirm Dr Kelly 's name to journalists , but he maintained that he had played no part in formulating it . </insist.v.2584><insist.v.2585>I 've always been suspicious of those lofty reading lists that insist that Bush likes nothing better than curling up with Camus or boning up on The Hidden World of Islamic Women ( no doubt with some tissues at the ready ) .

Liz asked Marianne to help convince Jim to let her stay at his house since he needs her stabilizing influence. Ray reassured Beatrice he wo n't abandon the boys to Olive. John insisted he wo n't let Pat fall into an old pattern of self-destructiveness , but Keith felt he was irrational to try to prevent her from pursuing an independent life. John told Jeff they need to expose the true nature of the man Pat 's infatuated with. Michael told Molly that Glenda ditched him to remain in Long Island with her old boyfriend. Daryll told Marianne he cares too much about her to care about her past foolishness with Chris. Liz described her deep family ties with Jim , then lied to Beatrice that Jim feels awkward about the attention she demands because of her family problems.

Three days later , the U.S. embassy let on that Narong had earlier been denied a visa for suspicion of involvement in heroin trafficking. It fit Narong ' s reputation and his huge , unaccountable fortune. Now with a convenient excuse , on April 3 the NPKC generals and the party leaders substituted Suchinda as nominee. Many people believed Narong ' s nomination had been Suchinda ' s clever subterfuge. Still , even if it was long anticipated , Suchinda ' s nomination came as almost a second coup. As the four opposition parties attacked the government , students draped the Democracy Monument in black to symbolize the death of democracy. But there wasn ' t much else they could do. On April 7 , General Sunthorn and Arthit Urairat , the new speaker of the lower house , submitted Suchinda ' s name to the king. Absolving himself , Arthit insisted that Sunthorn made the nomination alone as NPKC chairman. Ignoring the public outcry , King Bhumibol signed off on Suchinda ' s appointment. The next day , the former Democratic MP Chalard Vorachart sat down in front of parliament and announced a fast to the death if Suchinda refused to step down . </insist.v.2592><insist.v.2593>The detective seemed to become confused , though , after Sanders and Frank got him to acknowledge that the FBI was focusing its investigation on the " Mack-Muhammad theory " of the case.

He had been considering placing a wiretap on Muhammad , Katz admitted. Why , the attorneys asked , would he do that ? Because Muhammad was still a suspect in the murder , answered Katz , apparently forgetting that he had earlier stated that Muhammad was not a prime suspect. Katz acknowledged that there was one piece of evidence that implicated Muhammad in this crime : a witness who had placed him at the scene on the night of the murder . </insist.v.2593><insist.v.2594>For 40 years we have known that the extraordinary population of explosion in a finite planet would over-reach finite limits.

Car drivers must always look out for pedestrians walking all over the place. Special care must be taken if passing a green traffic light. Car drivers should also respect priorit  droite , a centuries old rule that gives right of way to traffic coming from the right if no signs indicate otherwise. While suitable for traffic moving at horse carriage speed , nobody has ever considered repealing the rule when car speeds made it unworkable. Be warned that if you assume that others will give way because you arrive from their right , you 'll cause a lot of accidents.

The professional and personal division was symbolized by the " blue wall " that separated technical services from the reference section of the library. Regardless of the realities of the new structure , the librarians were all agreed. In the new model they would do everything they could to offset this tension. They would encourage a holistic vision of the profession. Librarians would , they insisted , henceforth , think of themselves as librarians with both technical and public service responsibilities.

At one level , his habit of working in triptychs , and at a deeper one the suggestiveness he often in fact achieved , not just in triptychs but in single paintings , militates against that very insistence. It is hard to look at such works as the Crucifixions of 1962 and 65 , Lying Figure ( 1969 ) , Triptych , Studies from the Human Body ( 1970 ) or Triptych March 1974 without a sense of prelude , climax and aftermath though not necessarily in that order. Some such adumbrated narrative , an intimate human drama about to be embarked on , concluded or aborted also haunts the restrained and very beautiful portrait studies of a suited Man in Blue , his face and hands bright-lit on a deep blue ground , that are at once the most readable of all Bacon ' s male figures , and the most ambiguous . </insist.v.2611><insist.v.2612>These queries answer themselves.

Hanni argued that everyone  s tastes are so different that rules are insane. Dr. Heymann surveyed the scientific research ( almost none ) and summarized her own studies , which basically indicate that any food slightly dampens the perception of the characteristics of any wine  makes that wine a little less acidic , a little less sweet , etc. Burke insisted that people should do this pairing stuff to have fun , not to follow orders; and even Jon , whose section goes to great lengths to explore intricate pairing niches , admitted that sommeliers sometimes drive him crazy insisting on pairings that are absurd . </insist.v.2613><insist.v.2614>And Shane insists he won ' t shy away from dirty nappies and late-night feeding.

Opponents of allowing women to compete for combat billets argue that it is too dangerous to put women in the position of becoming prisoners of war. Without a doubt , there is a much greater probability for acts of sexual molestation and rape with the addition of women to the front lines. The " front lines " in modern combat , however , are fluid. Although they were technically in support roles , two female U.S. soldiers were taken captive and one was sexually abused by the Iqaqis in the Gulf War. This situation made those who were already skeptical about putting women in such a compromising position further question whether women should be subjected to the horrors of combat. Many , however , argue that adult women who make the decision to join the military are aware of the consequences ( Minerva , Spring 1994 ) . </insist.v.2615><insist.v.2616>WASHINGTON - Disputing the findings of the commission investigating the Sept. 11 terror attacks , President Bush continues to insist there was a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida . </insist.v.2616><insist.v.2617> Duane sorry I was confused by your comment , I have insisted , really !

Each country , being desperately dependent on Arab oil , was insisting on having its maximum supplies. The abortive earlier discussions within OECD had only revealed the extreme differences of view. The Embargo , when it struck , provoked the most embarrassing show of European disunity since the Common Market began. The two governments which behaved worst , in the view of the companies , were Britain and France , who were both , having moved towards a more pro-Arab foreign policy , determined to get their reward in the form of undiminished oil.

We have set the parameters of the debate by putting these ideas before the Governor-elect so forcefully , and so soon after his election.

The mother asked Dr. Sa ' adawi to publish some information on the matter. Dr. Sa ' adawi reported that after having published her article on the historical and cultural aspects of circumcision , the magazine refused to allow her to publish any medical information on it. However , Dr. Sa ' adawi gave brief information on the sensitivity of the prepuce , its immunological function and the harm of removing it. Then , she explained the psychological problems and the traumatic experience that the child is exposed to , and the pain involved , even if it is done under anesthesia , because local anesthesia does not penetrate the five layers of skin , and she also said that general anesthesia is dangerous. Moreover , she explained that circumcision is one of the causes of male sexual frustration and male violence against women , especially their wives . </insist.v.2626><insist.v.2627>Sometimes this " crowdedness " can come in later years when an aging parent is taken into the home who requires or demands constant care that is beyond the ability of the wife to give.

The offensive led by the FBU executive against the erosion of firefighters ? and control staff ? pay has now become a defensive battle. Quietly the 40 claim has been allowed to fall out of sight. Now the 16 deal phased over two years , first tabled by the employers in July 2002 , has become the favoured option. Symbolically the Morning Star has removed the 40 headline claim from its banner on the front page. The dispute is now as much about saving the conditions of FBU members and existing levels of firecover for the public as it is about pay. This is the root of the FBU ? refusal to negotiate whilst the employers insist on acceptance of modernisation and the Bain Report as a precondition to a negotiated deal on pay. Following the worrying phoney war over Christmas , during which the FBU membership were left to drift , the FBU has begun to set out a policy of long-term guerrilla action taking the dispute forward into 2003 . </insist.v.2629><insist.v.2630>Singer : The U.S. Senate has a heavy responsibility in this matter.

But why did Engels believe that a finished , all embracing system of knowledge was an illusion ? One of the fundamental tenets of the dialectic is that the world is in a state of continuous change.

They may also insist on the release and possible publication of the code that makes up the Microsoft operating system. But the issue remains as to how the courts can possibly make a company such as Microsoft comply with these demands.

And since they believe the church can grant a marriage , they also believe it can annul one. Since to them the act of marriage is a decree of the church and not the physical union of the man and woman , the church can easily dissolve a marriage as if it never existed by simply decreeing it. As unbiblical as this position is , many Fundamentalists have been swept away by tradition and agree with the Catholics in insisting the act of marriage is essentially a sacramental ceremony God uses to join a man to his wife . </insist.v.2672><insist.v.2673> He says we can not afford the $ 16 billion that we have tried to add back for domestic appropriations and the $ 4 billion that we seek to add for veterans ' health care.
