<cultivate.v.train><cultivate.v.1>There are times to cultivate and create , when you nurture your world and give birth to new ideas and ventures. There are times of flourishing and abundance , when life feels in full bloom , energized and expanding. And there are times of fruition , when things come to an end. They have reached their climax and must be harvested before they begin to fade. And finally of course , there are times that are cold , and cutting and empty , times when the spring of new beginnings seems like a distant dream. Those rhythms in life are natural events. They weave into one another as day follows night , bringing , not messages of hope and fear , but messages of how things are . </cultivate.v.1><cultivate.v.2>Crop insurance subsidies are also estimated to increase cultivation in areas subject to high levels of nutrient loss. While nutrient loss estimates take into account land erodibility , they may not accurately reflect differences in fertilizer applications on less productive lands. These lands in cultivation due to insurance subsidy changes are estimated to have higher potential phosphorus leaching and nitrogen loss to groundwater , surface water , and estuaries than do average cultivated croplands. In contrast , cropland enrolled in CRP tends to have below-average levels of potential nitrogen and phosphorus losses , possibly because the program tends to attract lands from arid regions where factors driving nutrient loss rainfall runoff and rainfall-based soil erosion are less intense. Once CRP acreage is removed from cultivation and the approved ground cover is established , nutrient transport from the land would be even less . </cultivate.v.2><cultivate.v.3>Land Tenure. Everyone living in a Yao village believes in the concept of communal ownership. The land around the village belongs to the village and is under the authorized management of the village headman. The persons who cleared the land have the right to cultivate it , and it will be theirs for as long as they stay in that village. If a man leaves the village , his kin in the village have a prior right to cultivate the land , subject to the headman 's decision. If nobody in the village uses the land , outsiders may be asked to cultivate it. Since the Yao have come to live in permanent villages , about 97.2 percent of families own the land they work and very few rent land in the reserved forest . </cultivate.v.3><cultivate.v.4>The Palm House is part of the First Farm Display , presented by the Royal Botanic Gardens as a theme park dealing with the early tools , farming methods , and the efforts of the first European settlers to cultivate the land , circa 1788.

Is it the best our democratic government has to offer us ? If investors from distant lands with no tradition of agriculture can come and cultivate it , it should not be difficult for Pakistanis to do it , what with an agricultural heritage and knowledge going back to pre-historic times. Instead of wasting government funds on retrogressive schemes like the Benazir Income Support Programme that make beggars of able-bodied citizens rather than helping them stand on their feet , couldn ' t the government spend them on helping landless farmers cultivate the land that it wants to throw away to foreign investors ? </cultivate.v.6><cultivate.v.7>Cooperation between farm owners and archaeologists is often a tenuous thing. As the economy of agriculture becomes increasingly difficult , the drive to cultivate more land increases , along with the number of crops grown per year. Further , increased productivity brings more marginal land under the plow. Use of deep or chisel plowing adds greater depth to the disturbance of land already being cultivated and obstructions to plowing are more likely to be removed from fields. All these factors have lead to increasing destruction of archaeological resources . </cultivate.v.7><cultivate.v.8>1.

However , some tribes learned to fertilize the soil. The Iroquois placed a fish in each corn hill and so were able to use the same corn fields. They did not plow , but cleared the land of any superficial weeds with tools made from deer antlers. Then they used a digging stick to make a hole for a few kernels of corn and the fish. They planted beans around each corn plant. That way , no poles or trellises were needed because the beans would grow up the corn stalk. Squash was planted in between the corn hills. This practice took advantage of the necessary space between the corn plants. Once the squash plants grew large enough , they would shade out most other plants and eliminate the need for further weeding. All three plants could be cultivated together , saving labor . </cultivate.v.15><cultivate.v.16>26. Of the Time when the Kings of the Franks became of age. Barbarians who do not cultivate the earth have , strictly speaking , no jurisdiction , and are , as we have already remembered , rather governed by the law of nations than by civil institutions.

The latter is used for cut-and-carry feeding of animals as free grazing areas are no longer available. Within the arable area , two farm section units can be identified the enset-garden close to the hut and non-enset crop fields away from the homestead. A large number of enset and coffee plants are grown in a relatively small land area around the homestead ( see Table 1 ) . Women mange the enset-coffee garden and are responsible for harvesting and processing. Table 1 shows that coffee covers a relatively small area per unit of production compared to cereals , which makes it suitable for growing in densely populated areas where there is scarcity of cultivated land . </cultivate.v.28><cultivate.v.29>Wild rice is actually a cereal grain. A tall , aquatic plant of the grass family a genus that is completely separate from that of rice. This annual grass grows in shallow water ( up to 4 feet ) in slow streams and rivers and even along the shores of certain lakes. It is the seeds of this plant that we call wild rice. Conditions were favourable and the number of choice spots in southern Canada stretching from Manitoba to central Quebec allowed wild rice to grow naturally in abundance every year. Wild rice has also been called Canada rice , Indian rice and water oats. It is known around the world today but is rarely found outside of Canada and the United States. Wild rice is considered a highly nutritional grain and is recognized by its chewy texture and nutty flavour. The food value is equal to that of cultivated cereals and today many want to increase Canada 's production for human benefit as a nutritious food source but also to supply food to waterfowl for increased game hunting . </cultivate.v.29><cultivate.v.30>They have no towns , no forests , and but few marshes; their rivers are generally frozen , and they dwell in a level country of an immense extent.

It consists of a complex network of perennial rivers , riverine forests and fertile floodplains , an unusually flat area where no piece of land is more than 47 metres higher than the rest. The region is populated by over 80 000 people , most of whom are subsistence farmers making their living on the banks of the Zambezi , Kwando , Linyanti and Chobe rivers. In addition to fishing and hunting , they keep cattle and cultivate the land. When the Chobe and Zambezi rivers come down in flood , over half the land can become inundated with water.

CDFIs cultivate specialized knowledge about the communities in which they do business. They forge deep relationships with their customers and community leaders. This translates into a willingness and commitment to spending time on individualized service , and specialized programs that are often too time-consuming or costly for mainstream financial institutions to implement. For example , many CDFIs offer non-conforming mortgages or loans. Others make accounts available to customers with limited or poor credit history. Mainstream institutions , on the other hand , tend to offer a few generic programs designed to capture the broader market . </cultivate.v.40><cultivate.v.41>Many of the government ministers and elites who seize commercial farms do not have the training or skills to cultivate the land , and hence are absentee landlords on fallow lands.

The teacher should guide their study and try to cultivate students ' abilities to study and research. To promote students ' interest and motive in their English study , the teacher should adopt various methods to guarantee that students participate actively in classroom teaching. The results of many studies indicate that the teacher should respect and try to satisfy the needs of students , take into accounts students ' age , personality , earlier knowledge and learning experience while choosing appropriate textbooks and teaching methods as well as designing classroom activities. Thus it has been universally acknowledged that ELT should be leaner centered and that students should play the leading role in English classroom . </cultivate.v.45><cultivate.v.46>Erosion damages extend beyond the cultivated land far into the surrounding environment. Off-site costs include : roadway , sewer , and basement siltation; disruption of drainage; undermining of foundations and pavements; gullying of roads; earth dam failures; eutrophication of waterways; siltation of reservoirs and harbors and channels; general flooding; damage to public health from blowing dirt; plus increased water treatment costs.

If dairy manures is used to provide fertility , weed pressure can be particularly intense. In addition to cultural practices that limit weed pressure , such as composting of manures , use of black plastic mulch , and cover cropping with smother crops , organic farmers must be equipped to mechanically cultivate weeds. Failure to cultivate effectively results in reduced crop yield , increased hand labor costs , or both. Just as a single herbicide or two can not provide effective weed control , one or two cultivation implements will rarely provide satisfactory weed control. Experienced organic farmers rely on a variety of cultivation tools to cope with various weed and crop combinations . </cultivate.v.50><cultivate.v.51>Since 1983 , The Berry Botanic Garden has been working to cultivate a very special frozen garden , the Seed Bank for Rare and Endangered Plants of the Pacific Northwest.

More than 200 acres of land lies barren with nearly 150 families of the three affected villages of Gobindapur , Patana and Dhinkia villages failing to cultivate their lands due to clashes between anti and pro Posco activists . </cultivate.v.62><cultivate.v.63>When we received the order we came together and sent a petition to the President. We told him that we are law-abiding citizens with no source of income aside from the income we get from farming. Since we are not rich enough to buy land to cultivate , we cultivate public land near the Castle. Before we started cultivating the area , it was bushy and many people used the place as their toilet. Now the Department of Parks and Gardens say it is their land so we should quit. What shall we live on if we stopped farming ? We told the President that our initiatives should be appreciated by the Department of Parks and Gardens because some people like us [ had been ] roaming the streets stealing and doing other illegal things , and [ now ] we were living a decent life.

Those in contact with the Hans were more developed economically and culturally. The feudal landlord economy was dominant during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Productivity was more or less on the Han level but the peasants were exploited harshly by the landlords who seized large tracts of fertile land. The situation in Jinghong , Menglong and Xiding was different. Vestiges of primitive communal land ownership still remained. There , the majority of land was public property. Commune members owned paddy fields and tea plantations , and could reclaim and cultivate communal land. However , private land ownership was fairly developed in Menghai , Mengsong and Mengla counties. Landlords and rich peasants possessed most of the arable land there , as well as the tea plantations , forests and wasteland. Poor peasants were subjected to exploitation in various forms . </cultivate.v.65><cultivate.v.66>We should try not to fall under the influence of such a guru. If possible , our guru should be like Nagtso Lotsawa ' s : he lived with Atisha for nineteen years during which time he couldn ' t see the tiniest stain or fault in him. We should try to cultivate a guru like that one in whom we can ' t find even a single shortcoming. Similarly , Kh drub Rinpoche offered praise to Lama Tsong Khapa : No matter how the buddhas , with all their wisdom , try to see if you have breached any of your vows , even a minor downfall , they won ' t be able to find a single one. This emphasizes that we should choose a guru who keeps his vows properly . </cultivate.v.66><cultivate.v.67>Teacher preparation and support are critical components as well. Don Pemberton ' s vision and entrepreneurial skills have brought a fully-paid , job-embedded advanced degree program to the school ' s teachers. The UF education school has orchestrated a set of research-focused learning experiences that cultivate new teacher skills related to differentiated instruction , data driven decision-making , culturally responsive teaching , classroom management , and leadership while giving individual teachers opportunities to specialize in literacy or second language learners. What 's most striking is that the education school program is highly adaptive. It 's equally helpful to a recently minted novice who had little training in how to teach in a high needs school; an alternative certification recruit who knows her content but has few pedagogical skills that enable her to teach it to diverse learners; or a veteran teacher who needs to develop new research-based skills in literacy and assessment . </cultivate.v.67><cultivate.v.68>The explicit link between reductions in drug crop cultivation and the provision of development assistance has led to incidences of reverse conditionality , where local communities threaten to cultivate , or actually begin to cultivate drug crops as a means of gaining access to development interventions. 38 The provision of compensation for eradicated crops has exacerbated the process. Not only have the authorities been unable to prevent households from restarting cultivation after payment has been made , 39 there is also evidence that compensation has encouraged some farmers to start cultivation in order to receive subsidies [ 10 ] . 40 </cultivate.v.68><cultivate.v.69>Jackson hopes mimicking nature 's methods will help farmers worldwide. Soil fertility is a particular problem in Africa , where small-scale farmers have removed large quantities of nutrients from soils without using enough manure or fertilizer to replenish them.

Drawing on folk and fairy stories and the mythology of forests , Mulgrave also told the dark tale of The Boy Who Ran From the Sea , who forever runs , like a river , between the dark heart of the woods and the open sea , and finds no rest in either. And his plight was echoed in the stories of all the characters , " all at sea " or " like fish out of water " , caught between a desire for exploration and the breaking of boundaries , and a longing to find a way back to Eden , or at least a kind of home . </cultivate.v.71><cultivate.v.72>If the paddock is not worked up , cultivate the land deeply either side of the line when soil conditions are suitable , being careful not to lose the survey line.

Hence , farmers were unable to cultivate crops during the dry periods , which is about 4-5 months. In some years the rains would fail resulting in crop failures. This situation prompted our ancient kings such as Parakrambahu1 , who ruled the Eastern part of Sri Lanka in 1140 A.D , to build large reservoirs and construct canal systems. Thus , gradually an intricate system of reservoirs and canals developed. A main feature of the civilization in ancient Sri Lanka was the development of an irrigation technology. Thousands of small irrigation tanks of varying sizes and shapes , particularly in the Dry Zone , provided water for domestic activities and also for crop production. However , at present most of the tanks have got silted and people living in the dry zone have to face immense problems in obtaining adequate water for normal domestic activities and also crop production. Crops in these districts fail causing considerable loss to the farmers and seriously affecting food security in the country . </cultivate.v.73><cultivate.v.74>Do nurserymen deliberately steer us in the direction of crude hybrids because they know they will not increase as fast , if ever , as the true species ?

Some of these ceiling lands were given to Katkari men who agreed to undergo the family planning operation ( vasectomy ) . The government has done proper surveys and given legal possession of the land to only 6 families till date ( + the nine families in Pulachiwadi who could get legal ownership in August 2003 ) . 131 Katkari families do not have legal possession of the land 28 years after distribution of the ceiling land. Effectively , these families are landowners on paper but they do not have possession and can not cultivate the land due to government apathy . </cultivate.v.75><cultivate.v.76>First we may examine the nature of the available labour force. Windsor Forest has a total population of about 2 , 350 of which approximately 250 are Negroes , 60 Chinese , and 2 , 040 East Indians. Only a few Negroes cultivate rice lands , but probably about 100 are employed during the harvesting season as casual labourers. The majority of the Chinese are either businessmen or farm managers , only one or two of the younger men actually working on the land. Amongst the East Indians there are 928 farmers who cultivate lands in the area under consideration , operating between them some 1 , 470 acres for the 1956 autumn crop. The distribution of size of total holdings amongst these farmers is shown in Table 3 . </cultivate.v.76><cultivate.v.77>Perception. The Perceptive Powers should be cultivated in early childhood.

You are poisoning your young minds with these evil qualities. My advice to the youngsters and students is eat sattvic food; cultivate sattvic behaviour and keep the company of sattvic people right from this early age. I often observe that youngsters today join bad company the moment they enter the school or college and continue to move about in the company of bad people. With the result , they cultivate bad qualities , resulting in bad behaviour. Frequently they are not even aware of the subtle changes taking place in their behaviour towards elders , parents , teachers and society. They think that they are on the right track , since they are pursuing education in a good educational institution. The education they are pursuing may be good , but the core of their heart is polluted due to bad company.

However , grandma had other land that she called " terre jardin " ( translation : arable land ) about a good while away on foot or horseback from where she had her domicile in La faitee.

Buying and selling of rights in land is common , and a man can obtain from $ 250 to $ 400 for the rights in one acre of rice land.

Such analysis shows that although their contribution is extremely important , it is invisible and not taken into account. Although they toil in the land , women have no right to own it. Land is the property of men. Even when most of the rural men immigrate to developed countries and stay there for many years , they still control the land cultivated by women who are in charge of the families welfare.

Greenland is a terribly inhospitable place , but I had no idea how inhospitable before I read this. They were completely unable to cultivate any fruits or vegetables or wheat.

I do n't know anyone in business who has not been confronted with the realization that vital experience has not been captured or passed on ... when someone retires , leaves a position or leaves the company. And most of us have experienced a competitive threat based on superior expertise. But the solutions proposed usually are n't based on an understanding of how people actually learn ( rather than how we wish they would ) and do n't often result in the development of judgment and wisdom.

If you make a mistake , always play through it; do n't stop to correct it. Make a mental note of where the mistake was and play that section again later to see if the mistake repeats. If it does , fish out a small segment containing that mistake and work on it. Once you cultivate the habit of playing through mistakes you can graduate to the next level in which you anticipate mistakes ( feel their approach before they occur ) and take evasive action , such as slowing down , simplifying the section , or just maintaining the rhythm.

However , this is not an unqualified relationship. Farmers possessing no oxen at all can hire them for ploughing , harrowing and threshing , or alternatively hire a tractor. Perhaps the main problem facing most farmers is the difficulty of acquiring more lands , now that the prevailing market prices for rice make it worth his while to cultivate more.

Yes; land has the power of producing more than is needed by those who cultivate it , if by CULTIVATORS is meant tenants only. The tailor also makes more clothes than he wears , and the cabinet- maker more furniture than he uses. But , since the various professions imply and sustain one another , not only the farmer , but the followers of all arts and trades -- even to the doctor and the school-teacher -- are , and ought to be , regarded as CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND. Malthus bases farm-rent upon the principle of commerce. Now , the fundamental law of commerce being equivalence of the products exchanged , any thing which destroys this equivalence violates the law. There is an error in the estimate which needs to be corrected . </cultivate.v.126><cultivate.v.127>The families lived together and worked the farm until 1938.

The Iorie family would eventually move again and purchase a farm in Florida. All of them would continue the family tradition and cultivate the land in Ipswich , Wenham , and Florida.

Throughout its 107 years , it has nurtured many well-rounded and highly capable pharmacists with important roles as leaders in the modern medical setting. Shigenobu Onda , the founder of the university , believed that this institution would serve to cultivate pharmacists who will advance the field of pharmacy , support healthcare and improve people 's lives through the supply and prescription of medicines. At present , the size of the elderly population is growing in Japan , and as a result , pharmacists play an even greater role in today 's diverse healthcare. Consequently , pharmacists need to attain even higher levels of knowledge and skills. In accordance with these strong social demands , our university established department of Pharmacy and Health Sciences ( a 6-year program ) ( enrolment limit : 300 ) and department of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences ( a 4-year program ) ( enrolment limit : 60 ) in the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in April 2006 . </cultivate.v.131><cultivate.v.132>education , and consistent rejection of Palestinian owners ' rights to cultivate or graze sheep on their land ...

Under the guise of this term , they have nearly turned over the entire soil of the virgin grasslands in this Banner. Day after day , the cultivated land has gradually been turning to desert. The fake wasteland now has become real wasteland. The desert is expanding and drought is on a rampage , and if one wants to recover the ecosystem it could take at least two to three hundred years. The contractors and the officials who contracted the land have already gone , but the desert is left forever to the local people. It is extremely distressing that similar cases are still happening in our region ( Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region ) 's eastern grassland and grassland cultivation is still out of control.

To the contrary , loss of land for urbanization , industrial purpose and civic needs will continue , leaving less land for crop production. The global per capita availability of land will further decrease from currently 0.24 ha to 0.17 ha within the next 20 years , in Asia from 0.15 ha to merely 800 m2 . </cultivate.v.138><cultivate.v.139>One major effect of placing a pond in a wetland area is to control water supply and reduce the danger of flooding. So ponds have made areas which were normally impossible to cultivate in the wet season , now available for farming. Presence of ponds trapping water have also maintained soil moisture content of surrounding land well into the dry season , thus extending the growing season for vegetables. Farmers have found that both effects result in increased crop production from dimba gardens adjacent to their ponds . </cultivate.v.139><cultivate.v.140>Industrial society has traditionally supported mass production and mass consumption with a priority on development , but has now transformed into a society based on knowledge and information , backed by sophisticated network systems.

Indeed , the 21st century is the era of the knowledge-based industrial society , where the economy is built on knowledge and information. To respond to the demands and requirements of present-day society , the College of Engineering of Tamagawa University has cultivated human resources who can generate , cultivate and convey useful knowledge to society as well as professional engineers who can assume leading roles in this knowledge-based industrial society. The College readies people to be active on the global stage , equipping them with skills in engineering that is in harmony with nature and engineering that is people-friendly.

However , soon they realised that the marigold crop needed more water than other crops and the small pond within their land was beginning to run dry. They approached Singh , who owns a tubewell.

Previously nomadic hunter-gatherers began to cultivate these cereals in the vicinity of Mehrgarh , about 1 , 000 years after agriculture began in the fertile crescent , when rice was being cultivated in Thailand. They erected sturdy houses of mud brick and also grain storage buildings because the growing season was so short. The rearing of goats , sheep and cattle had replaced hunting by about 8 , 000 years ago. However there seems to have been little further development until during the period from about 6 , 000 to 5 , 000 years ago , when Mesopotamia developed extensive trade with the Indus region . </cultivate.v.146><cultivate.v.147>Ramchandra , migrated to bigger town as a labour has now decided to remain the village and cultivate his land.

On-farm cultivation will increase the economic value of NTFPs to landowner families , but will decrease NTFP access for landless families. On-farm cultivation of high value NTFPs may reduce pressure to harvest from the wild , but may increase incentives to clear forest to cultivate these new crops. Expansion of international markets for NTFPs will drive up prices , increase overharvesting of NTFPs in forests , encourage on-farm production , and increase the contribution of NTFPs to local and national economies . </cultivate.v.150><cultivate.v.151>Restoration helps us claim our place and our purpose in the natural world.

To do one of these is to do all of them. In this context , the practice of yoga is the practice of ecological restoration. As I become alive to the prairie , the prairie becomes alive in me.

Farmers can not afford to cultivate traditional crops on a large scale because the market does not support them. Only a few farmers in each village cultivate such crops , but do it on a small plot of land for the sole purpose of home consumption , and not for sale in the marketplace. The suggestion was raised several times , that the government should set the market rate for such crops as it has done for others , based on the nutritive value of the crop. If the government will support farmers in this way , many agreed they would revert back to traditional agricultural farming practices and crops. Another suggestion raised was that the government should support crop insurance plans so if the traditional crops do n't yield , farmers are not faced with an entire loss; they can redeem a portion of the expenses incurred in the cultivation . </cultivate.v.154><cultivate.v.155>Stash Wild Raspberry Herbal Tea Raspberries grow wild in the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere and in some parts of the southern hemisphere as well.

Students learn about each system  s composition , shape , physiological functions and the systematic role it has on manifesting life  s phenomenon . </cultivate.v.185><cultivate.v.186>In order to cultivate and train open-minded graduate students or doctoral candidates , the Program in Cultural Studies offers a focus on multidisciplinary research. Students are expected to develop their understanding of contemporary culture and society , and , in particular , the problems of contemporary China. After it is fully established , the Program will collaborate with relevant overseas institutions. At Shanghai University , it will utilize the resources of the Dept of Sociology and the Dept of Chinese Literature , both nationally reputed , respectively , for their Social Studies and studies in Contemporary Chinese Literature. For the time being , PCS will offer courses for graduates and doctoral candidates specializing in Cultural Studies and will not enroll undergraduates . </cultivate.v.186><cultivate.v.187>Sprinkler irrigation systems have become most spread and established among other irrigation systems in Lithuania. Irrigation systems are most common for vegetables and cultivated pastures. Irrigation is very effective in dry summers but it may also cause harm if used improperly . </cultivate.v.187><cultivate.v.188>The only proven models we have for existing sustainably as humans ( the only way humans have ever actually existed sustainably ) are hunter-gatherer societies , who did cultivate their landbases in many subtle ways , the important difference from agricultural socety being that they directly depended/depend on the health of their wild landbase where agricultural society depends on fighting/destroying the health of it ' s wild landbase. One way preserves the land , one way rapidly destroys it. Hunter-gatherers are tied to a limited resource base; a culture that kills too many Bison will soon after starve. This gives incentive to not get too big or too greedy. If an agricultural society gets too big or greedy , however , it just clears more land to plant more grain and so on , and so on , untill . it becomes sustainable ! </cultivate.v.188><cultivate.v.189>Knowledge represents the most strategically valuable resource of any organization. For organizations seeking to cultivate valuable knowledge , knowledge ecosystems embody a 'bottom-up ' ( i.e. grassroots ) knowledge management strategy that combines knowledge technologies , organizational stimuli , and knowledge exchange processes . </cultivate.v.189><cultivate.v.190>With the exception of a few , small evergreen huckleberry farms near the coast , huckleberries and bilberries have not been cultivated. Attempts to cultivate these species have been made , but most ended in failure. These failures can usually be attributed to a lack of knowledge about the crops and their growing requirements , growing the crops in areas where they were poorly adapted , trying to transplant plants from the wild , and lack of improved cultivars . </cultivate.v.190><cultivate.v.191>Students cultivate the skills that are applicable in raising and managing animals by learning about the diseases that are discovered during the process of raising animals. Students learn the causes of diseases , symptoms , diagnosis , prevention and treatment methods. This course covers the following topics : diseases related to the digestive , respiratory , circulatory , urinary , reproductive , nervous , and endocrine systems , muscle , bone and skin related diseases , eye , nose , teeth , oral cavity diseases , tumor , external wounds , burns and addictions to feed or medicine . </cultivate.v.191><cultivate.v.192>Appropriate site selection is extremely important for ginseng and goldenseal production. Although both species may be cultivated in other habitat types and even in artificially shaded , intensively managed fields , success is much more easily achieved in environments which resemble the natural state of both species . </cultivate.v.192><cultivate.v.193>The estimate provided by the Central Statistical Authority ( CSA ) is on the low side , with only 5.53 million ha of land under annual crops in any one year ( excluding Eretrea and Tigray ) during the period 1980/81 - 1991/92. Based on the assumption that the proportion of land under permanent crops ( fruit trees and trees used for beverages such as coffee and tea ) is only 5.3 per cent of the total cultivated area , an additional 0.31 million ha of land under permanent crops. This gives a total cultivated area ( both temporary and perennial ) of 5.84 million ha , according to the CSA reports </cultivate.v.193><cultivate.v.194>Land for mining : land has been expropriated for mining such as the case in Bisha , Adi Nefas and Augaro where the farmers can not cultivate their land and use it for other purposes that is useful for their livelihood. Further more , such investment has environmental and social impact which the communities are not compensated for . </cultivate.v.194><cultivate.v.195>The machine in the photo on the right is called a Simba Unipress ( as it has one row of wheels ) and we use it to cultivate and consolidate the top few inches of our fields before we plant our next crop.

As the caterpillars eat all kinds of different trees , all rich in tannin , the silk is beige to brownish toned. Tussah silks are wildcrafted and thus may be considered " organically raised " . They are naturally tan , and generally are stronger and more resilient than cultivated " white " silks . </cultivate.v.198><cultivate.v.199>Everywhere around us we see green plants , even in large cities. When there is no other choice , you can use dandelions from cities ( if they do not grow nearby polluted areas ) . There are three ways to obtain good and pure herbs : to cultivate them by yourself , to pick herbs in the wild or to buy them at a specialised shop. When you cultivate herbs yourself or pick them from the wild , you can best dry them to conserve them. It is often important on what moment you harvest the herbs. When you pick herbs from the wild a good determination is very important . </cultivate.v.199><cultivate.v.200>If the run-off water is stored in the land itself , it would be available to plants when there is water shortage. In some parts of the dry zone , small ponds called " Pathahas " have been used to collect and store rain water. Such a water collecting system on farm would enable farmers to cultivate crops during the dry seasons. It also tends to increase the ground water level , thereby making plant growth possible even during the dry season . </cultivate.v.200><cultivate.v.201>We supply bulls and goats to the poorest of the poor villagers , identified by their Village Development committees. The livestock has helped cultivate more land , reduce the number of migrant workers and provide additional income . </cultivate.v.201><cultivate.v.202>Teacher Collaboration : What Do They Do ? Despite the obstacles to collaboration between vocational and academic teachers , there are grounds for optimism : First , both groups of teachers share an orientation toward good work habits and related skills such as punctuality and ability to understand and follow directions. Second , both vocational and academic teachers aspire to cultivate students ' capacities for complex reasoning and problem- solving. Further , the boundaries and divisions are fundamentally at odds with values central to public education , and it is a commitment to deeper values that enables some schools and their teachers to bridge subject and departmental boundaries . </cultivate.v.202><cultivate.v.203>10. No person who is not a registered commoner shall be allowed to work in or cultivate any land of the commonage upon shares or at all . </cultivate.v.203><cultivate.v.204>This is especially so when misfortunes such as terminal illness befall us. We may blame God , and later blame ourselves or people around us. We should cultivate a habit of neutrality regardless of whether good or bad things come our way. Otherwise , we can become very bitter about life when negative things happened. Looking for someone or something to blame only serve to prolong our own suffering. Death is an enemy when we resist it , but the moment we accept it , it turns into an ally . </cultivate.v.204><cultivate.v.205>Remember that local people have different ways of thinking and concepts of time , this just makes them different , not wrong. Cultivate the habit of asking questions ( rather than the Western habit of knowing the answers ) . </cultivate.v.205><cultivate.v.206>Newly Qualified Teachers ( NQT ) need to concentrate on organising themselves both in and out of the classroom , as well as getting to grips with discipline and marking. However , all too often teachers neglect to cultivate the most valuable resource of all : the experience of their senior colleagues. Finding a teaching mentor and utilising his or her skills can make all the difference in that vital induction year . </cultivate.v.206><cultivate.v.207>As with emmer and einkorn wheat , it is not uncommon to find wild and domesticated barley fragments together in archeological sites. In areas of the Fertile Crescent , fully cultivated emmer wheat and two-rowed barley have been recovered from ancient sites , accompanied by wild-weed einkorn , ryegrass , and other weeds considered pre-adapted to cultivation. It is still highly questionable whether or not the selective pressures imposed on wild grasses , as suggested by the cultural evolution model , caused the morphological changes that resulted in domesticated varieties of cereals . </cultivate.v.207><cultivate.v.208>These gardens are likely references to the Garden of Eden , but it has also been proposed , by Bottiglia , for example , that the gardens refer also to the Encyclop die , and that Candide 's conclusion to cultivate " his garden " symbolises Voltaire 's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions , as they find themselves at the end of the novella , are in a very similar position to Voltaire 's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported the Encyclop die : the main characters of Candide live in seclusion to " cultivate [ their ] garden " , just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition , there is evidence in the epistolary correspondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing the Encyclop die. [ 63 ] Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating " his garden " suggests his engaging only in necessary occupations , such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire 's own view on gardening : he was himself a gardener at his estates in Les D lices and Ferney , and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own , it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.

Weifang Gaoxin Bilingual School produced the design to help students cultivate a habit of reading classics. ( cns Photo ) </cultivate.v.210><cultivate.v.211>Like many wild and cultivated fruits , wild strawberry belongs to the Rose Family ( Rosaceae ) . These perennial herbs form loose bluish green carpets speckled by clean white flowers. Wild strawberries arise from short thick rootstocks anchored to the ground by tough wiry roots. Long purple- , red- or brown-tinted stalks bear three-parted leaves 5 -15 cm ( 2-6 " ) above a fibrous crown. Large teeth line the edge of the often bluish green leaflets. The terminal tooth of each leaflet is usually shorter ( smaller ) than or equal to adjacent teeth. This characteristic is often enough to distinguish wild strawberry from wood strawberry ( Fragaria vesca ) whose terminal tooth is larger and longer than adjacent teeth. Horizontal runners , called stolons , arch from the parent plant. Where they touch down , a new daughter plant develops . </cultivate.v.211><cultivate.v.212>It is important to find a teacher who embodies the qualities you seek to cultivate through yoga. The personality of the instuctor should not eclipse the essence of the practices themselves , but it is important to find a teacher who guides you in a clear and inspiring manner , both through their words as well as their presence. It can be valuable to find out if the instructor you are working with is certified and how long they have been practicing and teaching yoga. Though it is also important to remember that there are yoga teachers , including the founders of yoga and many of the great contemporary teachers , who are not " certified " and yet possess a natural gift for transmitting the spirit of yoga cultivated through the experience of their practice and their teachers. There are many attributes to a good yoga instuctor. Some of the more important qualities include clarity of communication , sensitivity of touch with hands-on assistance , intuitive awareness of students , versatility in teaching to beginners and experienced students , familiarity with posture modifications , ability to convey the spirit of yoga philosophy , and a calming , uplifting voice . </cultivate.v.212><cultivate.v.213>A rotavator is used to plow the field.

Oh no , the common man is every bit as guilty; otherwise , people and nations would have rebelled long ago ! There 's a destructive urge in people , the urge to rage , murder , and kill. And until all of humanity , without exception , undergoes a metamorphosis , wars will continue to be waged , and everything that has been carefully built up , cultivated and grown will be cut down and destroyed , only to start all over again ! </cultivate.v.215><cultivate.v.216>Results from previous long term soil studies in the same region were used to validate a computer model. The effects of different management were then projected over 25- and 100-year periods. According to the model , management strategies play an important role in determining carbon content. Land which has been used to cultivate cereal and then turned into continuous pasture would contain the most carbon. After 25 years , it is projected to contain 1.7-1.8 times more carbon than land which continues to undergo traditional three-year crop rotations . </cultivate.v.216><cultivate.v.217>The boro production target for this year was set at 1.75 crore MT , but the DAE is now expecting an excess yield of about 5 lakh MT , the officials said adding that growers cultivated the variety on several thousand more hectares of land than the targeted 45 lakh hectares , reported our Rajshahi correspondent . </cultivate.v.217><cultivate.v.218>This spring , Doepola is all eager for his second cultivation as he and his wife happily weed the row of paddy seedlings in the garden outside their house which will be transplanted in the last week of April.

" </cultivate.v.218><cultivate.v.219>So practitioners ' lives are usually very smooth or even boring in ordinary people 's eyes. We should understand that in cases where family members are ordinary people , their smooth lives are due to their kinship with practitioners and not due to their own blessings. If we cultivate well , Teacher can create the best cultivation environments and paths for us since our environments are for us to assist Teacher in Fa-rectification and not for us to live ordinary lives. If we indulge in daily comforts and become attached to them , we will not advance diligently in cultivation , and our good environments could be lost at any time . </cultivate.v.219><cultivate.v.220>Wild rice and maize are the only cereal crops native to North America. Wild rice is a tall aquatic grass with a grain that is two or more times the length of the long grain rice of Asia. Until relatively recently , wild rice was difficult to cultivate , largely because of how easily the ripe grains would fall from their stalks. For centuries , Native Americans harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants , bending the long stalks over the canoe and shaking off the grain . </cultivate.v.220><cultivate.v.221>After thousands of years of cultivation , it is difficult to establish the identity of the original wild progenitor of domestic rice. Researchers struggle with whether present " free living " rice is truly wild , a cultivated escapee , or something between : cross-pollination , genetic exchange , expanding landscapes , and shrinking natural habitats have distorted genetic qualities between wild and domestic species. " Weedy " forms of rice have also evolved over time , escaping into unmanaged natural habitats , flourishing at the edges of agricultural landscapes , and exchanging genetic material with both wild and cultivated varieties . </cultivate.v.221><cultivate.v.222>The teacher 's journey continues well beyond teacher education , just as it has begun well before.

Many posters portrayed Israel as the ancient land of the Bible , ideologically linking the new Israel with a rich historical past. Others focused on Israel as a place of unspoiled beauty and fascinating history , as well as a place for limitless adventure. Similar imagery had been used in earlier decades to persuade new immigrants to settle and cultivate the land. Now , these posters transformed pioneer imagery into marketing strategies for the tourism industry. Another category of posters portrayed Israel as a thriving , modern nation. Depictions of the sleek designs of EL AL airplanes against the backdrop of modern cities underscored the link of modern Israel with other world metropolises . </cultivate.v.228><cultivate.v.229>Most people think ( or claim ) that you have to study and practice meditation for years before you can become a " meditation teacher.

Truffles begin to appear several years after the inoculated seedlings are planted and production can continue for decades. The onset and duration of production depends to some extent on the species of host tree. Yields vary dramatically : some farms produce as much as 150 pounds per acre each year while others produce little. Typical yields in Europe range between 25 and 35 pounds per acre each year , but as methods improve many more farms are achieving yields in excess of 100 pounds per acre . </cultivate.v.233><cultivate.v.234>Among displaced people in North Darfur , 83 percent had relied on agriculture for income. Now , only 4 percent can earn income from farming. Expanding populations and competition for resources have restricted access to the land and inputs needed to cultivate crops , such as fertilizer and seeds , forcing camp residents to rely on assistance for food. Tensions between displaced people and local host communities increased as displaced families settled on agricultural land to stay close to the relatively safe villages nearby . </cultivate.v.234><cultivate.v.235>The Burkinabe ( the name for people from Burkina Faso ) eat an estimated average of 180 kg of cereals per person per year.

Upon their arrival in San Francisco Mr. Glendenning engaged in teaming , but soon afterward came to Santa Clara County , in the autumn of 1850. He bought out the squatter ' s right of an English occupant of what was supposed to be Government land , located about three miles west of Santa Clara , on what is now the Homestead road. At the time that Mr. Glendenning purchased the farm upon which Mrs. Glendenning and the younger members of the family reside , it was mostly covered with brush and large trees; and while soil was productive , yet he and all others of the early pioneers of the Golden West , labored hard to clear and cultivate the wild land , and endured many hardships in years of drought ( such as 1864 ) , so well remembered by the pioneers. After these lands had been improved and buildings erected upon them , the owners of the Alviso grant made claim to the property , and Mr. Glendenning was compelled to purchase their right , paying $ 30 per acre for two hundred acres , after having paid other parties for the land ! </cultivate.v.236><cultivate.v.237>According to the village headman , before the village used to do well in rice farming and since the closure of the irrigation system in 1984 the villagers still want to do rice farming. There is a total of 60 hectare of land which could be used for rice farming; the villagers still want to cultivate the land given Government ' s help to improve the irrigation system. There are 20 farmers who can utilize this 60 hectare of land . </cultivate.v.237><cultivate.v.238>The two varieties of cassava studied showed 78 similarity of different species of the section Glaziovinae; M. glaziovii Muell. and M. pseudoglaziovii Pax et Hoff. showed a high index of similarity based on electrophoresis analysis. A high similarity of 78 was found also in species of the section Gracilis. The same high similarity was found in species of the section Heterophyllae. Within this section , in the species M. pilosa and M. corymbiflora , the highest electrophoretic similarity to the cultivated M. esculenta Crantz coincided with morphological affinities between these two species and cassava. Probably they are part of the complex from which the cultigen had originated ( Nassar , 1978 ) . </cultivate.v.238><cultivate.v.239>What are some of the broad implications of these findings ? Genetically and morphologically , cultivated einkorn is quite similar to wild einkorn in general. Now that the specific wild ancestral line has been identified as being even more similar to the crop , we can better appreciate why einkorn 's domestication was so easy and quick. The crescent 's archaeological record shows that at most a few centuries were required for the transition from hunter-gatherer villages harvesting wild plants to farming villages planting fully domesticated crops. For einkorn ( and probably for the other founder crops as well ) , that transition required changes in only a few genetic loci , which account for the few morphological changes distinguishing the crop from wild einkorn ( 1 ) . </cultivate.v.239><cultivate.v.240>These are " Yala " season and " Maha " season.

An illustrative example of this is the Nuba ethnic group in Sudan , who manage a remarkably high level of variation within cultivated sesame and sorghum in the Nuba Mountains. The Nuba people are geographically isolated and culturally diverse in religion , language , material inventory , agricultural practices and rituals involving crop plants , and this contributes to the diversity of their cultivars. The genetic diversity of sesame and sorghum is promoted by their many different uses , the cultural diversity of the Nuba , and the different micro environments. As an example , specific cultivars of sorghum and sesame are identified by their particular oil content , seed colour , and resistance to locust attack or disease ( Bedigian &amp;Harlan 1983 ) . </cultivate.v.242><cultivate.v.243>The legis ( ation requires that no licence will be issued to cultivate cannabis unless the grower has a contract with a processor.

Victoria authorities continue to have no confidence in the credibility of certified seed . </cultivate.v.243><cultivate.v.244>Although the land-rental market gives the land poor an opportunity to rent some farmland , it does not fundamentally alter their potential to increase or diversify their crops ( Table 10 ) . The survey indicated that subsistence workers tend to specialize in maize production , on average cultivating 1.3 ha of maize in either season. Only half of the households in this group cultivate beans , and less than one-third cultivate rice , typically on very small fields. In keeping with the limited land resources of this group , other annual crops and commercial-scale tree crops are rarely grown . </cultivate.v.244><cultivate.v.245>The idea is to occupy land located near big metropolitan areas , cultivate the land using organic methods , diversify production and work cooperatively. The produce can then be transported to the city without incurring as high transportation costs as they would if the occupation site were far from urban populations. " The MST 's new strategy is one of the most important in attempting to end the hunger of 46 million Brazilians.

Co-teacher Lisa Walford , a 20-year student of Iyengar expertly directs you to experience the pose in your body , allowing you to viscerally feel its shape. The Iyengar method of holding the pose for a longer period than most hatha flow classes with attention on the fine details of the pose cultivates a profound respect and understanding of asana.

Teacher should inspire and guide students to discover linguistic rules and practice what they have learned to develop their linguistic competence , by organizing classroom activities , enable students to learn for themselves thus cultivate a good learning habit for them. To achieve the ultimate goal , teacher has to possess three characteristics according to Scrivener in order to create an effective learning environment : respect ( a positive and non-judgmental regard for another person ) , empathy ( being able to see things from other person ' s perspective ) , and authenticity ( being oneself without hiding behind job titles , roles or masks ) . Apart from being a guide and a facilitator in the study of students , the teacher is expected to be a good listener for students ' worries and problems , a psychologist to relieve students ' anxiety and fear and a personal tutor to help students have a better understanding of themselves and actualize their potentials . </cultivate.v.252><cultivate.v.253>Already in 1991 the diocese , without having agricultural machines of its own , sowed and harvested crops from 60 ha. In 1992 it bought several machines including two tractors , a sowing-machine , a mower , a plough and other tractor-drawn implements to cultivate the land. In 1993 the machine fleet was extended , which allowed to cultivate all the arable lands. The fields were sowed with barley , rye , buckwheat and potato. A large area was used to sow grains. The bulk of the grain was brought to Smolensk for milling. By that time , a cow-shed for 20 milk cows and a pigsty for 50 pigs had been built . </cultivate.v.253><cultivate.v.254>Indigenous knowledge of nature has ensured the survival of many people in fragile habitats. But it is a knowledge centred not on exploitation but on the harmony of the natural world. All flora and fauna have a place in an ordered universe made up of humankind , nature , and spirits. And indigenous cultures help to protect the natural world from destruction through religion and rituals. Animals are commonly held in respect and their numbers maintained , often through careful management. Those following the Bishnoi religion in India , for example , have survived many droughts because they will not kill and animal or a tree. They breed cattle selectively , monitor the feeding of their camels , and live on milk , yogurt , and a few cultivated crops. Many people have developed a detailed understanding of animal behaviour. Those living in tropical forests , for example , recognize that where two different ecological zones meet , the hunting is more productive. Many even grow crops or trees to attract certain animals and increase their numbers . </cultivate.v.254><cultivate.v.255>Damage is generally higher in silty , medium textured , well-drained soils and in soils cultivated for at least 12 years.

Contrary to the opinion of many Hokhims that the farmers should learn to plan and work self-reliantly , the leasing contracts oblige the farmer to cultivate a certain crop according to the needs of the kolkhozes as well as to the judgement of the surveyor who determines which crop will succeed best on which soil. Tenants complained that they were obliged to plant cotton while they could make much higher profit if they planted maize. [ FN 82 ] ( They did admit that they were not able to judge the suitability of the soil for every crop. ) Others , though , said that they decided themselves what to plant according to the needs of the kolkhoz.

This way of managing the land in no way reflects the predominant conception of economically sound land use of the majority of the population since it is focused on subsistence and not for the market. Therefore , the Amazon region is considered " tierra bald a " or land without an owner to them. Anyone can own the land if he cultivates it. This point of view is also the basis for the governmental settlement programs which can be seen all over the Amazon region and for the spontaneous taking of land by landless immigrants and land speculators. Paradoxically , this serves as a valve for land reforms that have not been implemented or can not be enforced in adjacent regions . </cultivate.v.257><cultivate.v.258>Colorado winemakers cultivate spirit of success if you can t use tomatoes , try tomatillos or pineapple for that same sweet-tartness " .

She thus prefers to be under the authority of her brothers. This is what explains why the land is confiscated by men. " Finally , according to Wolof tradition , a women whether she is married , divorced or a widow can not own land. She is entitled only to the right to use it. Thus , all the fields belonged to the husband who could redistribute some patches of land to his wives. These fields were , in general , used to cultivate groundnuts while the big field belonging to the husband was reserved for growing millet . </cultivate.v.259><cultivate.v.260>In the past , farmers cultivated during the wet season and elephants are not interested in visiting farms during that time as jungles provide abundant support for them. Yet , today , farmers cultivate throughout the year in a disorganized manner. As a result , during the dry months , wild animals come into cultivated areas in search of food , Mr. Jayewardene said. " It is too late to undo what has been done. However , the best solution is to create an awareness among villagers on the economic benefits they could gain through the wildlife in the area. For instance , they can be taught to use elephant dung to make paper , act as nature guides and so on. It is important to make them aware of the need to protect wildlife in the area. This way , the farmers will see a reason to protect the wild animals while finding an alternative way of safeguarding their crops , " he said . </cultivate.v.260><cultivate.v.261>All this shows that if we cultivate pure guru devotion , we ' re sure to attain realizations , as illustrated by a story of three of Atisha ' s disciples Dromtnpa , his translator and secretary; Am Jangchub Rinchen , his cook; and Gnpa Wangchug Gyeltsen ( the Great Neljorpa , or Mahayogi ) , who spent all his time in meditation Atisha was always going to give him teachings and he remained in seclusion. So Mahayogi thought , I spend all my time in meditation whereas the others don ' t meditate at all. I must have higher realizations. Atisha was aware of this , so called them all together and examined them. He found that of the three , Dromtnpa had the highest realizations , Am Jangchub Rinchen the second highest , and Mahayogi the least.

Mixed crops of sorghum and/or millet , with peanuts , legumes , or tubers , are then cultivated for approximately three years. Farmers then return the land to fallow for periods up to fifteen years , turning to different fields for the next cycle. Preparation of a field begins with cutting heavy brush and unwanted low trees or branches that are then laid on the ground. Collectively owned lands are parceled out during the dry season , and the fields are burned just before the onset of the first rains , usually around March. Farmers work most intensively during the rains between May and October , planting , weeding and protecting the crops from birds and animals. Harvesting begins in September and October with the early varieties of sorghum. The main harvest occurs in November and December.

These small tanks are concentrated in the dry zone. In the past , these tanks were an integral part of the eco-system and played a dominant role in the socio-economic and cultural aspects of the village leading to a prosperous rural sector by providing irrigation to cultivated large extents of land. However , cultivable extent from these small tanks have decreased gradually with siltation .

Such retrocession which applies to both men and women has made it possible for many men to have personal plots of an average area of 0.20 hectares. This is a form of land ownership which reduces the inequalities between the sexes and embraces the attendant socio-economic realities. Women are among the major economic agents of the Senegal Valley and , for that reason , they should be able to dispose as they wish of factors of production , the most fundamental of which is the land. Besides , almost everywhere in the Valley , all themselves , plots of land funded by NGOs or Embassy funds , group women into Associations for the Protection of Women and exploit. These are , in general , market gardening zones , which they cultivate with the help of power-driven pumps installed at the bank of the Senegal River . </cultivate.v.315><cultivate.v.316>Find Tomorrow ' s Leaders.

This unfair control of land sends many landless people to the north of the country , to the rainforests , where there is available land for them to live on. Over three million impoverished people have moved into the Amazon since the 1970 ' s and have deforested the rainforest by using the slash and burn method of cultivation , building roads , creating towns and clearing fields ( ROA ) . Once this land is cleared though , it looses the valuable nutrients that once helped sustain a lush beautiful forest. Because of the lack of nutrients people can only cultivate the land for so long before they have to move on to another patch of land , creating a never ending cycle of cutting down more and more of these tropical forests. Brazil , more concerned with keeping their rich land developers comfortable and separated from the poor than preserving their natural resources , even campaigned for this movement of peasants into the forest with a catchy slogan , Land without people , for people without land ( ROA ) . </cultivate.v.317><cultivate.v.318>The effects on agricultural development of these state organisations are varied and not easily assessable. Direct benefits for peasant farmers are likely to be quite limited , in particular for food crops and especially for farmers in semi-arid areas. A simple , and far from comprehensive , measurement of success is the farmers ' adoption rate of modern varieties. In 1994 only 2 of the maize crop in Tanzania were planted with purchaced certified seed of modern varieties ( World Bank 1994 ) . This is a very low level , however , a considerably larger proportion of land is likely to be cultivated with retained seed of hybrid and composite maize varieties. This is reflected in the study area ( see section 1.3 ) , where only few of the farmers , interviewed during the survey , purchased modern varieties of seed and only for a few crops ( sunflower , hybrid maize and rice ) and in very limited volumes. The vast majority of the study area is planted with seed of landraces , which are developed and maintained by farmers themselves , using local knowledge of plant genetic resources . </cultivate.v.318><cultivate.v.319>Across the country , there are many examples of the military wielding absolute authority to suppress landless peasants in areas where they directly control the land. In Okara , a conflict ensued between local tenants and the army that had unilaterally decided to change the terms of contract from share-cropping to rent-in-cash. While share-cropping pertains to an arrangement whereby the tenants share both the input and the output with the owner or whoever controls the land , the rent-in-cash arrangement dictates that land is cultivated in exchange for money , or rent. The additional benefit of share-cropping to the tenant is that his right over the land is recognised by law. The Okara farm tenants , who had resided on the land and were responsible for tilling it , feared the new system of contract would empower the army , who were not even the owners of the land , to displace the poor tenants from their homes . </cultivate.v.319><cultivate.v.320>Photo inset was taken in the late 60 's and is of the Griffith Bellingham Hybrid 'Shuksan'.

Rake the soil to even it out , leaving shallow grooves. Broadcast the seeds evenly over the entire area , then , using the back of the rake , smooth the soil over the seedbed.

Alternate strips , or fields , are sowed ( usually to wheat ) and left unplanted ( but cultivated to control weeds ) . Such rain as does fall soaks into the fallow ground and is not dissipated by plant growth. Moisture " stored " in this fashion for 1 year is usually sufficient to sustain a crop the 2nd , after which the process is repeated. Dryland farming is a human adaptation to the severest part of the prairie environment , and requires a hardy breed of agriculturist to withstand the adversity of dry cycles for the prospect of bounty in relatively rainy ones.

As mentioned earlier , the villages allocated to villagers pieces of land for fields and plots around their houses which varied in size in different parts of the country. To encourage mechanized farming and to facilitate the guarding of the fields , villages were told to develop a system of block farming ( bega kwa bega ) whereby land was divided into squares and allocated to individual families to cultivate in addition to a collective farm on which villagers were obligated to work on three days a week in exchange for the public and social services the village was to offer . </cultivate.v.368><cultivate.v.369>The incidence of tenancy is still substantial in some regions. The banning of tenancies and imposing restrictions on leasing out has only led to tenancies being pushed underground. As long as a class of landowners who shun physical labour and vast army of landless agricultural labourers and marginal peasants coexist , any legal ban on tenancy will remain a dead letter. As tenancy is contracted secretly in violation of the law , the tenant ' s position always remains precarious and consequently , the tenant has no incentive to cultivate the land efficiently. And in several regions , landowners keep the land fallow or raise only one crop where two could be raised. They do not lease out the land for fear of losing their rights if they let it out illegally. Apart from the fact that a total ban on the creation of tenancies is unworkable , there are also serious doubts about the advisability of prohibiting leasing out of land . </cultivate.v.369><cultivate.v.370>The 1975 land reform legislation of the former Government made all ruml lands public property and prohibited private ownership of land by individuals and organisations.

The size of a village is naturally proportioned in number of inhabitants to what the land dependent on it requires for daily work , and to the artisans who find enough employment there in the service of the farmers and labourers : but these artisans are not quite so necessary in the neighbourhood of towns to which the labourers can resort without much loss of time . </cultivate.v.377><cultivate.v.378>A.

Approximately 16 sorghum varieties representing a diversity of crop traits and well adapted to local production conditions and household requirements were cultivated in Mkulula village in the beginning of the 1990's. All such landraces produce tall plants which provide supplementary fodder for livestock and have broad tolerance to pathogens ( disease , insects , fungi and virus ) .

Slow diffusion of modern varieties into the farmers ' portfolio of varieties is common , although there are examples of successful large-scale introductions of modern varieties. The variability in conditions of plant growth in small-scale rainfed agriculture is high and individual modern varieties are not likely to perform optimally in all micro-niches. Adoption and allocation of part of a farmer 's fields to a modern variety often involves compromises ( e.g. the modern variety may yield more grain but less starch , or may take a longer time to mature and demand more inputs ( leaving less resources for other varieties and often increasing the vulnerability of crop production ) ) .

It is asked whether a nation may lawfully take possession of some part of a vast country , in which there are none but erratic nations whose scanty population is incapable of occupying the whole ! We have already observed , in establishing the obligation to cultivate the earth , that those nations can not exclusively appropriate to themselves more land than they have occasion for , or more than they are able to settle and cultivate. Their unsettled habitation in those immense regions can not be accounted a true and legal possession; and the people of Europe , too closely pent up at home , finding land of which the savages stood in no particular need , and of which they made no actual and constant use , were lawfully entitled to take possession of it and settle it with colonies ...

' </cultivate.v.418><cultivate.v.419>But as this informal field study has revealed , some of the wild plants used locally for consumption at times of food shortage , have the potential to become valuable staple foods and important alternatives to the usual food crops cultivated by farmers. National as well as international agricultural and food policy research institutions may become interested and may want to initiate further in-depth research regarding the potential for the domestication of some of the species used as sources of wild-food. Wild plant species , which farmers value highly and appreciate when it comes bridging a food gap , should be studied and their biophysical performance , if necessary , improved. Research may be undertaken to improve some of the potential wild plants ' palatability. The study team identified a number of useful indigenous food producing tree species which could easily be domesticated by farmers , if the proper propagation methods for different species of plant could be acquired and applied instead of farmers relying on the uncontrolled occurrence of wildlings. It has to be stressed , that where environmental degradation is accelerating such as in many highland areas of Ethiopia , germplasm collections of wild-food plants should be initiated before potentially valuable traits are lost for ever . </cultivate.v.419><cultivate.v.420>For the past three or more years , " Ku Dong Club " has accumulated more than 300 investors , and the capital everyone provided has now helped Lai with the land of six acres to cultivate.

Then , around 10 , 000 BP , some of the Neolithic Age tribes began to cultivate Wild Emmer , instead of relying on the wild supplies. Initially the plants would have had ears with a brittle stalk or rachis , similar to the wild form , each fragmenting into separate spikelets when ripe. The tribes-people , probably the women , would have naturally selected the larger intact ears when they harvested the grain. This subconscious selection led to the rachis gradually evolving from the brittle wild form into a non-brittle form.

Locality data for 86 cultivated and 28 wild S. purpurea populations were used in conjunction with environmental data layers and Maxent , a maximum entropy application for predicting species distributions. Interpredictivity analyses and principal components analysis revealed that the predicted distribution of wild S. purpurea is nested within the cultivated distribution and that the ecological niche ( defined by environmental characteristics ) of cultivated S. purpurea has expanded relative to that of wild populations. Significant differences between wild and cultivated populations were detected for five environmental variables , corresponding to the expansion of S. purpurea during the domestication process from its native habitat in the Mesoamerican tropical dry forests into less seasonal habitats.

High rollers include Primaxis , Vengrowth , Covington , and TD Capital out of Toronto , Growthworks in Vancouver , and the Business Development Bank of Canada , based in Montreal. Pat DiPietro , Senior Partner at Vengrowth , feels that there is now a strong investment culture in place in there : " Entrepreneurial activity did n't really start in Canada until the mid-1980s. Through the efforts of people like Mike Copeland and Terry Mathews , a lot of people who were stuck in the bigger corporations were encouraged to strike out on their own. " He continues , " The strong influx of people from Europe and Asia has helped to cultivate an idea-rich society here. Silicon Valley had a several-decade head-start on us , but we are beginning to make headway. Canadian firms are now starting to get recognised on the world stage; they are no longer just small-time local players " .

But how will he cultivate again without the plough ? With eight animals and a big patch of land , Ramadasu is tragically still very poor. And now he resorts to the final option - sell his animals.

Then they can be self-sufficient like any other green photosynthesizing plant. Other orchids such as the heath spotted orchid ( Dactylorhiza maculata ) require contact with the fungus for the whole of their lives. They can perhaps survive for a year or two without the mycorrhiza , which is what the association of fungus and orchid root is called , but they require the partner if they are to continue to thrive and flower. There are some orchids such as the bird 's nest orchid ( Neottia nidus-avis ) which have no chlorophyll at all in their leaves. They can not carry out photosynthesis and are totally dependent on their mycorrhiza. Thus , survival of many kinds of orchid depends on the survival of their fungi; orchid cultivation is only possible if the fungi can be cultivated too . </cultivate.v.513><cultivate.v.514>As rice boomed , land owners found the need to import more African slaves to clear the swamps where the rice was grown and to cultivate the crop.

Both are highly valued as medicinal herbs with a long history of collection from wild populations. Attempts to cultivate these herbs in natural forest environments have met with mixed results due to the exacting site requirements and a general lack of published information regarding cultural practices. Recent investigations of sites harboring wild populations of ginseng in New York , Massachusetts , North Carolina and Tennessee have yielded interesting data regarding the ecological niche of this woodland herb. This new data will be very useful to potential growers of both ginseng and goldenseal since both plants have similar native habitats . </cultivate.v.526><cultivate.v.527>Other commonly used herbs can easily be threatened by overuse by the herbal community.

From Jefferson 's Corps of Discovery to the Homestead Act to massive federal irrigation , road - building , and energy producing projects , the challenge was not limiting use of land but rather getting it settled , cultivated and developed. However , as the population increased and people began to congregate in cities , the need arose for local governmental control to put some limits on the movement of industry and commerce into residential areas and to keep residents from becoming nuisances to each other. These limitations generally took the form of zoning ordinances regulating incompatible uses , building heights , setbacks , densities , etc. However , as population density grew and spread , some began to recognize a need for planning.

The degree of agriculturalism practiced by a nation determines its civilization and its right to claim land. Those nations that do not cultivate their land have " no reason to complain , if other nations , more industrious and too closely confined , come to take possession [ FoL1 ] of a part of these lands. " 8 While this seemed to be a clear license to claim uncultivated , albeit settled lands via the doctrine of occupation , Vattel put limits on his theory. A nation , he argued , has the right to exclude other states from its territory , even where the nation leaves some land uncultivated; it is up to each nation to determine how to develop its lands. Furthermore , " no nation has a right to expel another people from the country they inhabit , in order to settle in it herself.

However , the quality of hemp fibre drops quickly after maturity and so it is not a commercial proposition to produce a double ( ie seed/fibre ) crop . </cultivate.v.563><cultivate.v.564>In recent years significant increases of cultivated ginseng grown under artificial shade have occurred primarily in British Columbia and Ontario , Canada.

The straw from the previous crop ( winter barley ) is removed and farmyard manure is spread. Then the disc harrow is used to cultivate the stubble 10-15 cm deep and turnip is seeded as a couch crop with the second disc harrow run. In spring , after applying glyphosate , the basic tillage is done in two steps with a heavy ripper ( 20-25 cm ) and a heavy harrow. Then a bed shaper is used to shape the ridges and the stoner is used to collect large stones and put smaller stones into the furrows. With the planter two rows of potatoes are laid in each ridge. The farm states that erosion has not worsened in comparison to traditional conservation methods ( also refer to conservation on certain crops " potatoes " ) . </cultivate.v.573><cultivate.v.574>Most of the prairie sod was turned under with oxen and breaking plows and later with steel plows. The remainder disappeared in the face of heavy grazing and competition from introduced grasses. Farmers also suppressed fires , which once had discouraged woody plants and alien species from invading the prairies. The few prairie remnants that survived often were wet areas that had been used to harvest wild hay. Many of those sites later would be doomed by dredges and tiling machines that made drainage easier , and also by continuing pressure in the twentieth century to cultivate more land . </cultivate.v.574><cultivate.v.575>I would guess that a cultivated orchid species might grow bigger and live lonbger than its wild counterpart of the same species , etc. That at least would seam logical to me , since the cultivated speceis are likely to be fertilized more regulalry , and the environment is more likely to accurately be adjusted to permanently be closer to ideal conditions than might occur in nature , if the grower knows what they are harshly doing. Also I know that plants within the species wo n't be exactly the same , and the orcvhid grower might totally decide to moderately cross two orchids that are in the same species and share some trait that does not occur in all orchids of this species to try to sequentially promote this trait which might have gotten lost in the wild ( where natural selection or chance might have caused this trait to not be propagated ) . </cultivate.v.575><cultivate.v.576>On January 28 , 1664 , Lauzon ceded ile Saint-Paul to Claude de Robutel de Saint-Andr , Jacques Le Ber dit Larose and Jean-Baptiste Lavigne.

Subsequently , it became clear that the supposed wild emmer used by MCFADDEN and SEARS in resynthesizing spelta wheat was not really wild at all but had a tough rachis and was therefore a cultivated emmer. This led to the question whether an amphiploid between a truly wild emmer and T.tauschii would have a fragile rachis even though wild einkorn x T. tauschii does not. With the B genome present and presumably acting toward the same type of fragility as that determined by the A genome , it seemed possible that the fragility of the wild emmer might be epistatic in the amphiploid between it and T. tauschii. It was this emmer type of fragility that DEKAPRELEVICH found in the Georgian wheat . </cultivate.v.579><cultivate.v.580>Contribute to Succession Planning. Plan now for your workforce needs tomorrow.

Refinement of harvesting and cultivation techniques by selectively choosing plumper seeds eventually transformed fields of grain into crops with thinner husks , stronger and less brittle rachises , stalks with increased seed clusters , larger and more dependable yields after harvesting and threshing , increased nutritional value , and spare seed for storage. These newly cultivated crops could have eventually replaced their wild counterparts in importance.

The growing season is 120-150 days and in normal seasons full crop water requirements are met throughout the growing season. In some lowland areas the long dry season results in increased salinisation of The Gambia River and an emphasis on saline tolerant rice varieties. The principal crops cultivated in this agro-ecology are early millet , groundnut , rice ( rain-fed upland and lowland , irrigated lowland , mangrove and mangrove salt-tolerant ) , maize , vegetable , sesame and cowpea . </cultivate.v.631><cultivate.v.632>Attention is drawn to the change in mindset in countryside management with grant schemes paying money to farmers who encourage biodiversity. Subsequent chapters cover every aspect of how to reintroduce wild flowers from selecting seed and propagating wild flowers to growing them in a variety of situations meadows , hedgerows , woodland and ponds. One chapter concentrates on the most threatened group the cornfield annuals. This is vital information for any land owner or manager wishing to develop habitats rich in plants. Subsequent chapters will fascinate naturalists for they highlight how butterflies , birds and other wild life are responding to the creation of areas rich in plants , nectar and seed. Detailed advice is given on over thirty species of butterflies how to cultivate the plants they need to lay their eggs on and recommendations on the flowers producing the best nectar . </cultivate.v.632><cultivate.v.633>The Buddhas of the three times prostrate to the vajra guru three times a day morning , noon and evening.

This we may think of in terms either of the unit of land having less labour spread on it , or of the unit of labour being spread over more land. Thus , if we pass from 30 " hours " on 40 land-units to 25 " hours " on 40 land-units , we get the same ratio ( 5 to 8 ) which we should have got had we passed from 30 on 40 to 30 on 48 ( 5 to 8 again ); but of course the total crop on 48 land-units under 30 " hours ' "; cultivation will be greater by a fifth than that on 40 land-units under 25 hours ' cultivation . </cultivate.v.634><cultivate.v.635>Based on the hypothesis that over thousands of years a plant could experience numerous morphological changes , is it not possible for a once-domesticated plant to revert to some semblance of a wild version ? We have already mentioned how it has been suggested that wild grass species , once cultivated , could morphologically transform within 300 years when transplanted into seedbeds. An example of this morphological change could appear as brittle rachises becoming " semi-tough " enough to be identified as cultivated . </cultivate.v.635><cultivate.v.636>To preserve water quality in farm ponds , lakes , streams and rivers , it is a good idea to plant crops at least 30 feet from the edge of the vegetation along the water area. This distance minimizes the impact of agricultural runoff on the water quality. Leaving a vegetational edge around wetlands can also reduce the risk of saline soils developing , which occurs frequently when wetlands are cultivated too close to the edge . </cultivate.v.636><cultivate.v.637>For a growing child , it is essential to have knowledge on development in various fields.

In addition , administrations are often dominated by large landowners ( cf. 2.1.2 ) . National governments also fear that if decentralization occurs too quickly , then the unity of the country may be threatened. Therefore , they attempt to assign as little responsibility as possible to the provincial and local levels with respect to land allocation and land management. In many countries no continuity in agrarian reforms is guaranteed due to the rapid changes in administrations. The implementation of the measures is often too much for the bureaucracy. Only strong administrations are in a position to put through unpopular measures. All of these complications make it more difficult to reach the original goals of agrarian reforms . </cultivate.v.638><cultivate.v.639>- Develop a plan of action.

Hence , you must cultivate and put into practice the sathwa guna in the youthful age itself. If man wishes to experience manavatwa ( humanness ) and reach Daivatwa ( Divinity ) , sathwa guna is very essential. It is only when you consciously cultivate sathwa guna that you will be able to attain sathwic nature.

He did not loose heart. He has a small patch of cultivable land. He decided to grow crops and vegetables. Hence he devoted his time and energy on agriculture. He works very hard. He utilizes the small patch of land to the optimum. He has to hire ox , plough and ladder to cultivate the land and purchase seeds and fertilizers to grow crops and vegetables.

From a cross-sectoral linkages perspective , any activities that reduce or halt the degradation of agricultural lands and minimize the likelihood that farmers will look for new areas to cultivate are probably good for biodiversity conservation , as they will decrease the rate that wild-lands are converted to agroecosystems. Moreover , many of the techniques used to reduce soil erosion and maintain soil fertility also increase the heterogeneity of agroecosystems , and the density of trees they contain. Both of these factors can contribute to biodiversity conservation in that they provide habitat and corridors for non-domesticated species . </cultivate.v.654><cultivate.v.655>Flax. In light loamy soils with many perennial weeds the highest yield of stems and linseeds and the lowest amount of weeds are in the soil that was stubble cultivated and ploughed in late autumn. The lowest yield and the highest amount of weeds ( especially perennial ones ) are in the soil that was ploughed early autumn. Soil preparation for flax in spring has an aim to eradicate weeds , to preserve more moisture and to loosen the topsoil. It is useful to cultivate the soil not deeply and to harrow it before sowing of the flax. The highest yield of fibre and linseed is achieved when seeds are sown with row spacing of 7.5 cm sowing the seeds at 1.5-2 cm depth. The sown field should be rolled . </cultivate.v.655><cultivate.v.656>The extensification of land does not only involve an enlargement of the arable area , it also involves a rural-to-rural out-migration. The villagers rent land and are engaged in rural labor work in other regions of the country. A large number of villagers believe that in the future more people will out-migrate for off-farm work and that within the village territory , more people will take up sheep fattening. These two trends of development can already be observed in the village. An increasing number of households are depending totally or mainly on off-farm incomes , particularly cultivation of rented irrigated fields in irrigation schemes outside the Valley. These people live outside the village for the larger part of the year and return only for the winter period. For them , cultivation in the village has turned into 'hobby farming ' of little financial importance. Some farmers do not cultivate any land in Im Mial or get any of the returns for the on-farm cultivation at all. The other trend is that some farmers have started raising sheep for the meat , not for milk. The sheep are fattened mainly on purchased crop residues . </cultivate.v.656><cultivate.v.657>Minimize and cut down not just oily foods.

Even the grasses of deserts , or other inhospitable localities , which are dry , woody and unpalatable the greater part of the year , may , when young or when refreshed by rain , furnish nutritious fodder or pasture. The value of wild grasses , however , is generally considerably lower than that of the cultivated sorts. The latter are better cared for , have readier access to food , less of a struggle for existence , and so are apt to grow more luxuriantly and yield a better quality of hay or fodder . </cultivate.v.659><cultivate.v.660>Since 1967 , Israel has made use of Ottoman legislation dating back to the middle of the 19th century in order to declare land to be " State land. " According to that law , all lands are considered " State Land " unless proven otherwise. To formally register land as private property , one must cultivate it for at least ten years. If the land is not registered , one would be considered the owner as long as he cultivates it and pays taxes on it.

Two parallel canals located at a short distance constructed in different time periods under the sponsorship of Swiss and Nepal Government provide adequate water permanently to irrigate the entire arable land of the VDC. This has facilitated farmers to diversify the product and cultivate their land on the seasonal basis. However , a farmer of the village laments that the pattern of cropping system has not changed. Farmers follow the traditional farming pattern of sowing food grains such as paddy , wheat , maize and millet. Nevertheless , both production and productivity of these crops has been increasing over the years. High value crops such as vegetable , potato , garlic , onion , cardamom and fruits farming are in practice in each of the household for the home consumption only. Commercial farming has not taken place yet. In addition to this , a well equipped government owned agriculture farm is also located at the center of the VDC.

Crop varieties are adapted to optimise performance when cultivated under resource constraints. Resource- poor farmers , who do not own a team of oxen and a plough , have to wait until the better-off farmers have finished ploughing their fields to rent an ox-team ( payment in kind is the weeding of a similar area - a labour task which is significantly greater ) . Fieldwork data from Ikuvala and Mkulula villages indicate that farmers who do not own an ox-team use a higher proportion of early maturing varieties than the better-off farmers who own oxen and a plough and are able to plant immediately after the onset of the seasonal rain . </cultivate.v.702><cultivate.v.703>Having been founded as the Department of Industrial Management in 1979 alongside the founding of the University of Incheon College of Engineering , our Department was reorganized into the Department of Industrial Engineering in 1985 , added evening programs in 1987 , and finally , was renamed into the Department of Industrial Management in 2006.

This type of layout is related to the terrain specificity and in that village fields are arranged in rows that stretch from the lowest floodplain to the elevated area - a low escarpment of the Vistula 's ice marginal valley with a village located on its crest. Almost all villages were founded on the end moraine dunes and in the outwash fans frayed by the post-glacial waters. The characteristic feature of the Dutch colonization was the fact that each settler cultivated the land in one piece as opposed to the colonization under the German law , in which the settler was required to cultivate the land in the three-field system. The land cultivated by the settlers in Mazowsze was usually characterized by low quality and sandy soils. However , this aspect was largely dependent on the locality; for example , the villages of Nowy Kazu , Wilk w Nowy , and Kpa Zawadowska , were founded on good quality soils , while the soil in Nowy Secymin or lad w was of lesser quality . </cultivate.v.704><cultivate.v.705>" Water released from Mettur enters the delta region by June 20th , so that crop cultivation can be completed by July 15th.

This gives 0.33 ha/person of food crops and 0.68 ha/person of cotton , or a total cropped area per person of just over 1 ha. With a labour force of 3.7 ME/farm , this is equivalent to 1.86 ha/ME. An average of 2 head of cattle and 10 sheep and goats were also kept. At that time , most people were living in ujamaa villages ( Tanzanian collective villages ) , and had to spend an average of 1.5 hours/day walking to and from their cultivated plots . </cultivate.v.706><cultivate.v.707>Several actions in the 1920s also increased the region 's vulnerability to drought. Low crop prices and high machinery costs ( discussed above ) meant that farmers needed to cultivate more land to produce enough to meet their required payments. Since most of the best farming areas were already being used , poorer farmlands were increasingly used. Farming submarginal lands often had negative results , such as soil erosion and nutrient leaching. By using these areas , farmers were increasing the likelihood of crop failures , which increased their vulnerability to drought . </cultivate.v.707><cultivate.v.708>Przewalski 's Horse and Man : By the late eighteenth century , mustangs were well established in nine western states and numbered between two and five million.

The greatest destruction of the mustangs has accrued in this century; huge numbers were captured and used in both the Boer War and World War 1. Others were caught and used as cow ponies , and many more were shot to be used as pet food and fertilizer.

The patrilineage used to assure all women a parcel of land to cultivate , but women were increasingly having to ask permission from men to use their fallow land , or go about 'begging ' land , as Bukh calls it , borrowing land from men that do not belong to her lineage. This situation has become more complicated with cocoa production. A man might not give land to his daughter as he is afraid that it will be alienated from his lineage; if the daughter plants tree crops , then her children , who might not belong to their father 's lineage and not their mother 's , might claim the trees , and the land will then be passed on through the children 's father lineage.

A suggestion that some of this communal pasture should be divided up into individual plots for intensive cultivation of fodder , was vigorously resisted on the grounds that any resident should have the opportunity to keep a cow and have access to grazing facilities.

Furthermore , there is a shortage of laborers which puts them in a position to choose where they want to work.

Many farmers expressed the difficulty they face , or have faced , in finding laborers willing to work for them in the cultivation of traditional crops. Though some people said that laborers are not willing to accept produce as a wage , realizing the importance of traditional crops , most of the women were willing even to take 25 less wages in cash or kind , than cash crops . </cultivate.v.742><cultivate.v.743>As a young man growing up in Troy Grove , Hickok 's family , who were farmers , also operated a station on the Underground Railroad , helping escaped slaves to freedom.

" ( 23 ) The five sky floods signify disastrous flood following heavy rain as the reason to transplant perennial common wild rice. Common wild rice usually grows in shallow marshes 30-50 cm deep because depth &gt; 1 m is too great , while &gt; 2 m drowns it.

With the advent of micropropagation techniques ( tissue culture ) , legislation to prevent seed export would be ineffective in preventing Australian plants from being cultivated elsewhere. The only way in which Australian plants could be protected from exploitation overseas would be through an international protocol which prevented the tissue culture of native plants. Ms Davies pointed out that there was a significant anomaly in the fact that an Australian could be heavily fined for picking a wildflower from the bush , but that overseas agronomists and plant breeders could , with a licence , remove genetic resources in the form of plant material to cultivate elsewhere.

Though African diaspora in Europe and the United States are willing to pay U.S. $ 50/kg for air-freighted Eru , the volume of trade is tiny relative to that supplying the national and cross-border markets.

Usually a large percent of plantation labour was drawn from areas which were generally least developed such as the Highlands. At the time of Self-Government in 1973 , approximately 50 , 000 workers were employed in about 1 , 200 plantations throughout the country. [ 34 ] Many of these labourers lived on the plantations , sometimes with their families , for many years as casual employees after their initial contract expired. Where plantations were localised gradually by a share takeover , there might probably be little immediate displacement of plantation labour. However , where plantations were redistributed to people in areas of serious land shortage , it was likely that there would be huge displacement of labour. When most of the displaced workers returned to their respective areas , they might not be able to find employment to support themselves and their families. Their rights to cultivate customary land might have been taken over by other members of their customary groups in their long absence. Generally , this would broaden the existing gap between better-off areas where plantations were located and less better-off areas where there were no plantations . </cultivate.v.748><cultivate.v.749>After the British Conquest of 1760 , seigneurs speculated on the land they still had left to grant.

It is of importance that the landlord should be encouraged to cultivate a part of his own land. His capital is generally greater than that of the tenant , and with less skill he can frequently raise a greater produce. The landlord can afford to try experiments , and is generally disposed to do so. His unsuccessful experiments occasion only a moderate loss to himself.

The advent and spread of high-yielding tropical soybean varieties in the 1990 ' s that are capable of being grown anywhere in the Amazon region has acted to let the Genie out of the bottle , creating the potential for substantially higher production in a region long thought inhospitable to soybeans. The scope for a radical expansion of cultivated row crops in the region is now a reality and the Amazon has effectively become Brazil ' s final frontier for commercial soybean farming. Only time will tell how great a contribution the region will make to the country ' s agricultural economy and export capacity , but as you travel the region it is apparent farmers sense the beginning of boom times ahead for soybeans . </cultivate.v.755><cultivate.v.756>Native to the peaty meadows of southern Alabama and north-western Florida , this is a very difficult lily to cultivate but still easier than Lilium catesbaei .

Simply cut the runner between the mother plant and daughter plant , carefully remove the daughter plant from the soil and replant with the root crown at the same level as it was when you removed it. The best time to establish the plants is during the moist season from fall to early spring. For best results , plant in a loose soil rich in organic matter or humus. To develop a continuous strawberry carpet , mulch well keep the weeds pulled. You might want to combine the berries with native bulbs such as nodding onion ( Allium cernuum ) which can poke and flower through the carpet. For the first year or two cultivate the soil around your starter plants so that the runners will root readily. Sow seeds in the fall over a sand-humus mixture as alternate method of propagation. Some wild forms seem to have larger flowers than the norm and deserve special attention . </cultivate.v.761><cultivate.v.762>Striped Bass : When I was cooking in Boston in the 1980s , my chef conscientiously boycotted wild striped bass , which was at the brink of extinction due to overfishing. In the ensuing years , several states banned the harvest of this toothsome fish , and elsewhere , aquaculture operations sprung up to farm-raise it. Both efforts , I ' m happy to say , were successful. The farm-raised fish are a hybrid of wild striped bass and white bass which , while lacking the deep fish essence of the wild , offer the delicate flesh and pleasing savory flavor characteristic of stripers. Thousands of ponds and tanks cultivate these delicious food fish throughout the United States , making them not only an excellent culinary choice , but a sustainable domestic industry for small-scale and large scale growers alike. Thanks to responsible fishery management , wild striped bass has rebounded from its 1980s lows , and is now permitted as a limited catch.

If she inherits her uncle s lands , they should be retroceded to her children. The advent of the Catholic religion brought about significant modifications in the practice of Serer customs.

Denying the existence of an aggressive , potentially violent component within the male psyche is no more enlightened than the opposite course of equating manhood with aggression. A man unable to recognize and come to terms , on a level much more personal and direct than a " politically correct , " guilty acknowledgment of collective male misdeeds , with his own aggressive and destructive impulses , with his capacity for wildness , will be unable to access and use his deepest , most instinctual masculinity for fear it will get out of control.

At the present time , the contents of the educational system does not reflect practicality and is unable to cultivate the awareness of the application in mathematics , so there is a disparity between the requirement of the age and the mathematics teaching in practice. Improvements in the mathematics teaching are demanded. Two tasks are to be carried out -- one is the improvement of the original matter of mathematics teaching , more mathematics studying should be derived from the practice , and the background knowledge of students should be used to cultivate the understanding of mathematics.

In Wadi Rima ( Yemen ) , about 75 of all farmers cultivate three or more separate plots of land. However , fragmented landholdings are sometimes amalgamated or enlarged by marriage , inheritance or the purchase of land with remittances from migrants. Land fragmentation has the advantage that different parts of the farm are irrigated and hence cultivated at different times thereby phasing labour and management demands on a single farm.

( 1 ) The story begins by placing women not as 'owners of land ' but rather as 'owners of crops'. ( 2 ) They have rights to cultivate , and rights to dispose of crops and crop income , but not rights to allocate or alienate land. Their ultimate rights to use land are associated with their position toward men- as mothers , wives , sisters and daughters. More importantly , when land becomes scarce or rises in value , or when rights are formalized through titles or registration , these rights to use land are revealed to be secondary and tenuous. The right to receive turns out rarely to be as compelling as the right to give. Men use their position of dominance in society to 'expropriate ' women 's rights to land. ( 3 ) Women , whose rights to farm a plot of land were guaranteed by marital or kinship status , lose these rights and face a diminished tenure status that underlies and reinforces a greater economic and social insecurity.

As kuth ceased to be cultivated , it was retained by the lineage and not split among the descendants. Lineages became responsible for setting the rules on exclusion , management and alienation , access having been determined by the original settlement report . </cultivate.v.883><cultivate.v.884>General manager Andy Elworthy showed how crops are grown on six-foot-wide raised beds.

The Akbash Dog has its unique combination of molosser and sighthound qualities. This breed was developed at least 3 , 000 years ago; their white color distinguishes them from predators. Archeological evidence suggests that the earliest civilizations arose in the parts of the world currently occupied by Iran , Iarq , Syria , and Turkey 10 , 000 years ago and began to domesticate animals and cultivate ( or domesticate ) plants. In short order there would have been a need for livestock protection dogs to care for the livestock. The white breeds of livestock protection dogs include the Great Pyrenees of the Pyrenees Mountain area in France and Spain and the Maremma of the Maremma Mountains of Italy. A reasonable but not in any way proven hypothesis is that white ( Akbash ) dogs were developed in Turkey and spread . </cultivate.v.902><cultivate.v.903>Finally , the new strategy is about strengthening the structure of the IT industry.

In normal situations , a season 's crop failure should not lead to an emergency. If crops fail , farmers should turn to what they have in storage. If the stores are exhausted , they turn to their cash savings. If the savings are wiped out they turn to the local government. If the local government fails them they run to the central government.

Participants then grappled with the question of whether the professor should allow the Vietnam and Gulf War veterans to reflect on their past military service as a service-learning assignment. The overall group consensus was that the professor should encourage the veterans to serve at a local Veteran 's Administration hospital or get more active in a Veteran 's Affairs group and use this as the basis of their service-learning. If the veterans were reluctant to do this , then the professor should encourage them to reflect on their military service in relation to research conducted in the library. The group agreed that the service and the reflection was significant , and that faculty should always cultivate the spirit of service in their classroom instruction. Perhaps the veterans could reflect on their service in a group presentation to the class.

If farmers in these two systems do not have enough capital but have a large area of land , they can not adopt modern agricultural methods for production. Tractors , power tillers , etc. remain beyond their means. By using age-old ploughing techniques these farmers can only cultivate the surface of the land and this will not help increase its productivity.

The grain binder has been replaced by the swather which cuts the grain and lays it on the ground in windrows , allowing it to dry before being harvested by a combine. Plows are not used nearly as extensively as before , due in large part to the popularity of minimum tillage to reduce soil erosion and conserve moisture. The disk harrow today is more often used after harvesting to cut up the grain stubble left in the field. Although seed drills are still used , the air seeder is becoming more popular with farmers.

It is not advisable to level the ploughed soil , because then it dries longer in spring and the work starts 2-4 days later. It is not useful to level the soil in spring as well , because the yield reduces. In spring when soil conditions allow , the field is harrowed. Loose soil is cultivated by harrow and compacted soil is shallowly ( at a depth of 6-8 cm ) cultivated and harrowed and it is rolled before sowing.

This document is of prime importance in the history of the land question. " It is essential to the prosperity of a new colony in which there are neither slaves nor convicts , " say the Commissioners , " that there should be a constant supply of free labourers willing to be employed for wages. If there be not a constant supply of labour for hire , no extensive farm can be cultivated , no large or continuous work carried on. To secure that constant supply of labour for hire , two things are necessary : that the requisite number of labourers shall be conveyed to the colony and , when so conveyed they should continue as hired labourers , until the arrival of other emigrants to supply their places in the labour market . </cultivate.v.948><cultivate.v.949>( f ) If these low lying regions are taken over , the cultivators will be left landless , the thatch and firewood choppers and the fishermen will lose their means of livelihood.

Because of unfavourable climatic conditions , exorbitant profit making by the chettyars , unfair price fixing without taking into account agricultural output and consumer goods , the landowning farmers position was reduced to that of landless labourers ( coolies ) .

Between 1912 and 1914 the farm was put into operations on the east hill , about one and a half miles outside Athabasca. Experiments with cultivation methods , new varieties of grain and other new crops , and animal breeding were to be done on these government run and owned farms. The Demonstration Farm also provided homesteaders in the region with practical advice on how to cultivate their land more efficiently. The local availability of such useful advice made the area more attractive to homesteaders. It meant better yields , more settlers , and higher land values.

The minimum rainfall needed for the hardiest of Chad 's varieties of millet , called berebere , is 350 millimeters. The western area of the zone is dominated by the Chari and Logone rivers , which flow north from their sources in southern Chad and neighboring countries. The courses of these rivers , joining at N'Djamena to flow on to Lake Chad , create an ecological subregion. Fishing is important for the peoples along the rivers and along the shores of Lake Chad. Flood recession cropping is practiced along the edges of the riverbeds and lakeshore , areas that have held the most promise for irrigation in the zone. International donor attention focused on this potential beginning in the mid-1960s. Particular attention has been paid to the traditional construction of polders along the shores of Lake Chad.

The spread of crops and varieties from their centres of diversity to other parts of the world first took place with long distance trade. The colonial period greatly increased the exchange of crops and germ plasm worldwide. In the nineteenth century the US department of agriculture played an instrumental role in increasing the crop diversity of US farmers ( Fowler 1994 ) . With the rediscovery of Mendel 's genetics and the increasing dominance of seed companies , the formal diffusion of germ plasm has increasingly become restricted to the release of modern varieties . </cultivate.v.971><cultivate.v.972>Covey describes the hypothetical scenario of a man in the woods working like a maniac to saw down a tree.

Medicinal properties in plants are mainly due to the presence of secondary metabolites which the plants need in their natural environments under particular conditions of stress and competition and which perhaps would not be expressed under mono-culture conditions. Active ingredient levels can be much lower in fast growing cultivated stocks , whereas wild populations can be older due to slow growth rates and can have higher levels of active ingredients. While it can be presumed that cultivated plants are likely to be somewhat different in their properties from those gathered from their natural habitats it is also clear that certain values in plants can be deliberately enhanced under controlled conditions of cultivation ( Palevitch 1991; Uniyalet al.2000 ) . </cultivate.v.973><cultivate.v.974>From October to December , food security is expected to improve in the north , as improved civil security will enable people to access and cultivate more land , leading to a decent harvest in November/December.

Different grasses make different demands. All of course require sufficient food and water , but what is enough for one may bring another to the point of starvation. A water supply which produces luxuriant growth in a certain grass may prove injurious to another , perhaps closely related , species. Thus Sheep 's Fescue can make a comfortable living where Meadow Fescue would suffer seriously. On the other hand , Meadow Fescue and Orchard Grass would languish in wet and sour soil , where Blue-joint Grass , Meadow Foxtail and Fowl Meadow Grass would grow luxuriantly.

Sathya ( truth ) , dharma ( righteousness ) , santhi ( peace ) , prema ( love ) , and ahimsa ( nonviolence ) . It is only when we cultivate and exhibit these five human values in our daily lives that we will be entitled to be called human beings. Human being is a repository of trigunas , namely , sathwa ( calm serenity ) , rajas ( passionate activity ) , and thamo guna ( sloth , slumber ) . Unfortunately , today , we find the rajo and thamo gunas more active in human beings. We do not find even a trace of sathwa guna anywhere. Hence , it is of utmost importance today that people are taught and encouraged to cultivate sathwa guna , perform sathwic karmas and finally reach the abode of sathwic guna . </cultivate.v.1013><cultivate.v.1014>The proportion of practice problems in the mathematics teaching in primary schools in China is the highest of all countries. There are still problems that puzzle teachers and researchers of mathematics teaching in the primary schools , such as the problem of training in the skill of mathematics. Some questions are not related to the everyday life of students , and are intended to be merely compiled. Most questions of practice problem have no redundant known parameters and have one unique answer. The form of the descriptions of questions is humdrum and almost all of them are described by text. Not enough effort was made to cultivate the abilities of solving problems. So , the keys to reform are the following : </cultivate.v.1014><cultivate.v.1015>Weed infestation is generally very high in tidal swamps and only small areas ( 0.5 hectares ) can be cultivated if manual labor alone is used.

In 1990 , when we first sowed the seeds for our prairie , retired neighbor to the south , Claus Christianson who owns a 10-hp tractor , a leaf blower , and a weed whacker came over to ask why we worked so hard to kill the " good lawn " and cultivate " weeds. " Last year , Claus 's wife , Mary , came by to ask us if they could cut some coneflower , black-eyed Susan , and queen-of-the-prairie to use in an arrangement for an elegant dinner party they were hosting that evening. She left with ample materials for beautiful bouquets. The Christiansons may have grass , but they appreciate and respect what we are doing and understand why we 're doing it.

She became a widow and was left with land assets to raise her family. She decided to cultivate the land and grow crops. Nani raised a good crop but began to face the problem of marketing her produce. She thought of a solution in a male dominated sphere. She decided to dress and act like a man when she went sell her crops. She wore a turban and clothes worn by men. In this way she was able to get a fair price and market her produce successfully. Her skills and qualities came to be recognized and valued and she became the head of the local governance body called the panchayat.

Fundamental to that was the cultivation of land , for cultivation ties those who sow to being still there to reap , and it is cultivation above all else which leads to land becoming " settled " . The rule developed that the fact that land was known to fall within a possibly enormous area over which there roamed a nomadic people , who did not cultivate the land , did not remain , did not build , in short did not settle the land , was not inconsistent with the acquisition of it by people who did cultivate , did remain , and did build : people who did " settle " . This had support in international law. In his Law of Nations ( 1758 ) Vattel argued that failure to cultivate land meant failure to take lawful possession of the land , so leaving the land available for acquisition by settlement by those who later on did settle and cultivate it . </cultivate.v.1023><cultivate.v.1024>Another distinct quality of the wild orchid is its vigour and resistance to diseases and insects , plus its ability to withstand adverse environmental factors , and the fact that it can produce a great quantity of seeds at one time. In some cases , there is still a need to repollinate the already cultivated and hybridised orchids from wild orchids once more in order to regain some of the missing features in response to the market trends of the moment. So , it can be clearly seen that wild orchids are the source of essential factors and play an important role in the continuing development and maintenance of healthy hybrids. Thus they should always be highly regarded and preserved with utmost care . </cultivate.v.1024><cultivate.v.1025>The wildest form of this plant is relatively small ( 1..1.5m ) compared to its cultivated cousins. It grows in a distinctive way , forming very long , thin branches. The leaves are also relatively small and do n't have clear congruity to those of c.pubescens. The flowers are tri-coloured , sometimes bell-shaped , sometimes not. Purple ( rarely almost white ) petals have golden spots surrounded by white. Sometimes they look very much like certain c.baccatum var. praetermissum flowers. The spots are , however , not clearly divided in two sections , as praetermissums ' tend to be. The typical fruit is a small , round berry with 5 very clear calyx teeth ( see photos ) . When raw it is dark green , when ripe it is bright red and quite hot . </cultivate.v.1025><cultivate.v.1026>The early settlers who arrived were faced with many hardships and met with much misfortune in attempting to clear and cultivate the land , build homes for their families and establish businesses. It was a constant battle filled with tragedy and suffering , often resulting in the loss and abandonment of hope. The severe drought of 1818; the increases in population upon completion of each canal and the resulting poverty and starvation; the depression in the early 1830 's and 1840 's and the Irish feuds and raids contributed to the drudgery and misery of settlement life. Their lot was difficult and bitter , and it was a struggle merely to stay alive . </cultivate.v.1026><cultivate.v.1027>The Sabbatical Year : The land of Israel is worked for six years and then left without being cultivated for the Sabbatical Year.

This is illustrated by the fact that only 2 of the cultivated area in Tanzania is planted with certified seed. The majority of the cropped area is planted with seeds of landraces , e.g. varieties which are developed and maintained by farmers themselves , using local knowledge and local management institutions. Very little is known about the quality and social dynamics of local plant genetic resource management , and the links and interactions between local plant genetic resource management systems and formal plant genetic resource institutions are limited and weak. There is therefore a need to gain a better understanding of local plant genetic resource management systems , as a first step towards establishing a partnership between local and formal institutions . </cultivate.v.1028><cultivate.v.1029>Travel may be on the downturn in the new economy , but as the results of our First Annual Travel Photo Contest show , the readers of Wild Blue Yonder magazine are still out and about training their artistic eyes on a variety of flora and fauna , color and culture , skylines and street scenes from Boulder to Bangkok and beyond.

Stones might be put around or over these if they were handy , but often they were not , and the witness trees must be relied upon after the stake was gone. Too often the first settlers were careless in fixing their lines with accuracy while monuments remained , and an irregular brush fence , or something equally untrustworthy , may have been relied upon to keep in mind where the blazed line once was. A fire running through this might sweep it away , and if nothing was substituted in its place , the adjoining proprietors might in a few years be found disputing over their lines , and perhaps rushing into litigation , as soon as they had occasion to cultivate the land along the boundary . </cultivate.v.1030><cultivate.v.1031>Agricultural crops should be grown in crop rotation where forecrops for cereals would be fodder and technical crops.

With the result that they cultivate bad qualities , resulting in bad behaviour. Frequently , they are not even aware of the subtle changes taking place in their behaviour toward elders , parents , teachers , and society. They think that they are on the right track , since they are pursuing education in a good educational institution. The education they are pursuing may be good , but the core of their heart is polluted due to bad company.

Therefore , as a facilitator of the conceptual change process , the science teacher educator functions in a variety of specific roles. These roles require the educator to 1 ) know how students learn; 2 ) use expertise to structure an environment that promotes meaningful learning; 3 ) purposefully design tasks that lead to conceptual understanding , promote professional attitudes , and foster reflective practice; and 4 ) use assessments that inform instruction yet cultivate meaningful strategies for learning by students. The question now remains , " What does a 'facilitator ' do ? " We propose that facilitators probe , prod , model , and mentor.

With this understanding , allowing the farmer the right to cultivate the land and other people to eat the produce of the field is an attempt to increase the efficient use of land in society. If the value of the land as a pathway for travelers is greater than the value of the land as farmland , then the field will remain as a passageway. However , if the value of the land as farmland is greater than the value of the land as a passageway , then the farmers will cultivate the land , provided the transaction cost from cultivating the land is lower than the expected benefits from the produce. These examples correspond to the Coase Theorem , as absent transaction costs , the land will achieve its maximum efficiency , but with sufficient transaction costs , then the land will not be used productively and will remain barren. With this understanding of Deuteronomy 23 : 25 and 26 , the law can be viewed as a biblical precedent of the Coase Theorem . </cultivate.v.1085><cultivate.v.1086>The flood affected peasant Nurul Amin , 38 , at the village Gobordhan under Aditmari upazila told , " My one bigha land for seedbed of aman paddy has been damaged by recent flood.

Lease of lands to tenants occurs mainly because of landlords leaving the village for better employment in cities. The transfer of lands to non-cultivating creditors has also tended to produce the same effect. These tendencies are brought out in the quinquennial statement of holdings in the district for the year 1952-53. In 1952-53 out of total area of 1 , 15 , 630 acres [ For details , refer Table No. 13 on page. ] under inam tenure in the Kolhapur district as much as 62 , 210 acres or about 54 per cent. was in the hands of non-agriculturists receiving rent from the tenants cultivating the land.

Some households cultivate commercial crops , such as chilies , cacao , and coffee. Others specialize in livestock production , including cattle and pigs. Table 6 shows the size of the herds in the hillside zone and their distribution among households. About one-quarter of the farm families surveyed in the hillside zone owned cattle , with herds ranging from a few to 125 head. Most of these ranches produce milk for local cheese manufacturers or for sale to a regional milk-processing facility that has collection centres at various points in the department. About one-quarter of these ranches typically the more isolated ones raise beef cattle for sale in regional markets. Many hillside farmers hope to establish ranches , as cattle ranching is less risky and more profitable than other regional agricultural enterprises. Humphries ( in press ) calculated that a rancher with only three milk-producing cows can realize profits as high as those of the average producer of basic grains , but with considerably less effort and risk. The relative profitability of basic grains and cattle production is discussed briefly in Chapter 6 . </cultivate.v.1092><cultivate.v.1093>The average land size for farming is around one hectare per household. The land is 100 percent cultivated by manpower , which means that there is a lot of unproductive land as a man can typically cultivate just a small portion of the land in a day just enough to feed his family.

One set mainly opens the palm and the other mainly spreads the fingers apart. When stretching the hand to play wide chords , use mainly the set of muscles that open the palm. The feeling is that of spreading the palm but with free fingers; i.e. , spread the knuckles apart instead of the fingertips. The second set of muscles simply spread the fingers apart. This spreading helps to widen the palm but it interferes with the finger movement because it tends to lock the fingers to the palm. Cultivate the habit of using the palm muscles separately from the finger muscles. This will reduce both stress and fatigue when playing chords , and improve control. Of course , it is easiest to use both sets of muscles simultaneously , but it is useful to know that there are 2 sets of muscles when planning exercises and for deciding how to play chords . </cultivate.v.1102><cultivate.v.1103>Ian is now a teenager , but he and his " Oma " continue to garden together.

Light hand-ploughs , drawn by oxen , are most frequently used , and the cost of these is low.

There are seven tractors in the village , most of them light Fergusons costing about $ 3 , 500 each including a mould-board plough. These can be bought on hire-purchase and are operated on duty-free gasoline. They are used almost exclusively for ploughing , but occasionally a farmer may be seen threshing his padi by driving over the straw with a tractor instead of using bulls to tread out the grain.

Southeast Asia has a monsoon climate with distinct dry ( fall/winter ) and wet ( spring/summer ) seasons. In order to meet rising needs of food and fiber for an increasing human population , irrigation infrastructure has been constructed to make it possible to cultivate second and/or third crops in the dry season ( mostly in fall/winter months ) . Multiple-cropping agricultural systems provide essential food sources for large flocks of free-grazing ducks that move frequently from one post-harvested field to the next to feed on leftover rice grains , as well as insects and snails , as part of integrated pest management strategies. It is important to note that when wild waterbirds migrate to Thailand in the fall/winter , they likely use the post-harvested rice fields and second rice crop fields as their food and water resources. Therefore , rural landscapes with a double-or triple-paddy rice cropping system provide an opportunity for mixing wild water-birds with domestic poultry , an important precondition for transmission of avian influenza virus among waterbird populations , and between wild waterbirds and domestic poultry ( see Fig. 1 ) . </cultivate.v.1128><cultivate.v.1129>It is unclear if farmers will take land out of pasture to put into crops , as they did when commodity prices were high in the middle 1990's.

Furthermore , measures have been put in place to control foot-and-mouth disease , and with the January approval for limited volumes of Argentine beef sales to the European Union , beef production becomes more attractive. The lack of credit availability also works against the development of pasture for crop production.

These so-called cleaning crops , seem to vary from farm to farm. Onions , for example , are a cleaning crop for some growers. A long-season and uncompetitive crop , growers know onions must be nearly weed free , so they make frequent cultivation a priority for this crop. This frequent , shallow cultivation offers benefits similar to fallowing strategies , encouraging successive flushes of weeds that are removed by subsequent cultivation events. While the need for repeated cultivation may be viewed negatively in the short-term , the long term effect is depletion of the seedbank. Potato and sweet corn are cleaning crops for some growers. These crops can be aggressively cultivated and weeds kept at a minimum.

Writing original compositions is thus a most excellent exercise for the cultivation of thoughtpower . </cultivate.v.1137><cultivate.v.1138>The essential ingredients of global knowledge and skills include foreign language proficiency and a deep understanding of other cultures. American schools are notorious for not preparing students to cultivate such knowledge and skills. A report released by the Committee for Economic Development , a Washington D.C.-based organization , stated in February 2006 : Many American students lack sufficient knowledge about other world regions , languages and cultures , and as a result are likely to be unprepared to compete and lead in a global work environment. Most American schools do not offer foreign languages until high school. Although foreign language teaching starting from high school is too little too late , not all high school students are required take a foreign language , especially a non-Western language . </cultivate.v.1138><cultivate.v.1139>Village representative 2 : At that time , the grasslands were excellent even if this place was partially agricultural and partially grazing area.

Wild populations will have to decline further before cultivation is a viable option. The trade is characterized by fluctuations in supplies , often to the extent of disrupting the trade balance. For slow growing species , if controls on collection are not strictly enforced , wild populations will be more seriously eroded before cultivated material is available ( Cunningham 1994; Iqbal 1993 ) . </cultivate.v.1140><cultivate.v.1141>If they had gone no farther than to say that the difference in land has OCCASIONED farm-rent , instead of CAUSED it , this observation would have taught us a valuable lesson; namely , that farm-rent grew out of a desire for equality. Indeed , if all men have an equal right to the possession of good land , no one can be forced to cultivate bad land without indemnification. Farm- rent -- according to Ricardo , MacCulloch , and Mill -- would then have been a compensation for loss and hardship. This system of practical equality is a bad one , no doubt; but it sprang from good intentions. What argument can Ricardo , MacCulloch , and Mill develop therefrom in favor of property ? Their theory turns against themselves , and strangles them . </cultivate.v.1141><cultivate.v.1142>A second wave of Koreans flowed into the Yanbian area during the period of Japanese colonial rule in Korea.

So parents have to appreciate and eat good and healthy food for children to learn to do so. In some families the parents and others itself have fussy food habits. Children will then find nothing good or worthwhile to pick up healthy food habits. Parents being the first role model for their children should eat a lot of vegetables and fruits and cereals and wholegrain for a child to learn to eat them. To cultivate this habit it is good for the whole family to have their meals together. Dinner could be the meal that all eat together. This will also be a means where the child learns table manners and to be polite to all . </cultivate.v.1144><cultivate.v.1145>Well ...

You see , we are a little bit crazy here in Finland. If you have ever been to a genuine Finnish sauna , you know it 's true. In fact , the Finnish Chile Association will try to cultivate a new pepper suitable for our harsh climate. Why ? The answer is : why not ? Chile - or capsicum ( if we try to be a bit formal ) - is not just about plants. It 's an attitude.

This is a good place for entertaining , for example , and so it 's usually covered in a hard surface like flagstoneunmortared to allow water to percolate downward and to provide habitat for soil dwellers. Raised decking makes a good choice for the hardscape of the inner area , both because it leaves the soil below unstressed and because it gets you up high , where you can look out into the native plantings beyond. The inner area is also an appropriate place for you to put special plant collections , preferably corralled by a fence or stone wall or other feature that sets them apart from the looser native landscape. Here you can cultivate exotic perennials under your watchful eye . </cultivate.v.1147><cultivate.v.1148>" We want to encourage students to do more online reading at home because if they can cultivate this habit of reading at home , it will help them to consolidate their English.

The renters are required to pay only 30 yuan ( approximately 3.50 US dollars ) per mu ( 0.067 hectare ) per year. Thirty percent of this money becomes the Banner Government income and seventy percent goes to the Sum Government. Based on this calculation , Zalaid Banner Government and Sum Governments that provided lands for cultivation have earned at least 23 million yuan ( approximately 3 million US dollars ) from land contract business. This means the governments have made a considerable amount of money.

It also focused on ways faculty can integrate meaningful community service into the existing curriculum. If the spirit of service can be cultivated on community college campuses across the country , then the civic democracy objectives of service-learning will surely be achieved. If community service can be shown to enhance the curriculum , classroom learning , and student life , then America 's community colleges will play an even greater role in building a stronger civic democracy with greater appreciation and understanding of America 's tremendous social and cultural diversity . </cultivate.v.1151><cultivate.v.1152>Humans began to cultivate food crops about 10 , 000 years ago. Prior to that time , hunter-gatherers secured their food as they traveled in the nearby environment. When they observed some of the grains left behind at their campsites sprouting and growing to harvest , they began to cultivate these grains. From these humble beginnings agriculture began. Slash and burn , an early type of crop culture , remains today a truly sustainable agriculture , one that is independent of fossil fuel energy. In such a system , about 10 hectares of productive land is held in fallow for each planted hectare. With this rotation system , a hectare is planted once every 20 years , allowing the soil to reaccumulate vital plant nutrients. Although the practice requires large acreages and large labor inputs , the crop yields are adequate. For example , corn with ample rainfall can yield about 2 , 000 kilograms per hectare ( kg/ha ) . </cultivate.v.1152><cultivate.v.1153>The First Training : Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life , I vow to cultivate compassion and learn ways to protect the lives of people , animals , plants and minerals.

This unfortunate incident was reported to the Bolga Naba who invited both the incoming and outgoing Directors of BNI and the Regional TUC [ Trade Union Congress ] Chairman for amicable settlement. At the end of this dialogue , it was agreed that we go back and grow low crops such as groundnuts , beans , etc. It was based on this , that we went back to comply with the terms. We were again met with fierce resistance. This new development was again brought to the notice of the Bolga Naba who invited the BNI Director again for further discussion. While dialogue was continuing , service personnel were seen cultivating the land to the provocation of the people , thus heightening tension in the area . </cultivate.v.1155><cultivate.v.1156>The Yucatan Peninsula is within the putative area of domestication of the Mesoamerican gene pool of lima bean ( Guti rrez-Salgado et al. , 1995 ) . Traditional agriculture in this region has intensified over the last 30 years , leading to changes such as reduction in the richness of cultivated species and its landraces , reduction of the vegetation harboring wild species that surrounds croplands , shortening of fallow periods , increased agrochemical use , and greater incorporation of farmers into the external market system ( Reyes and Aguilar , 1992; Lazos-Chavero , 1995; Ku-Naal , 1995; Remmers and Ucan , 1996 ) . Despite these changes , lima bean remains the fourth most important crop among Mayan farmers in the region. This fact is reflected in high morphophenological diversity in landraces ( Ballesteros , 1999; Debouck , 1979; Mart nez-Castillo et al. , 2004 ) , making the Yucatan Peninsula the region with the highest richness of domesticated P. lunatus varieties in Mexico ( Ballesteros , 1999 ) . </cultivate.v.1156><cultivate.v.1157>With habitat reduction elephant populations have broken up and some herds have been pocketed in smaller patches of jungle.

The dominant cultural practice of cocoa production in the region involves leaving natural trees and/or planting of trees on forest lands. These trees are selectively cleared and various types of food crops are planted. The main essence of farmers leaving trees and intercropping in their cocoa farms is to provide shade for the cocoa trees. It is also a means of diversifying production to enhance profitability and minimize risks . </cultivate.v.1162><cultivate.v.1163>Farming : To cultivate the land and harvest crops for food the Indians use a system of slash-and-burn.

Those tenants who had held land for a period of not less than six years immediately preceding the first day of January 1938 were declared to be " protected tenants " . Such tenants could not be evicted , unless they ceased to cultivate the land personally or unless the landlord wanted to cultivate the land personally. It provided for the fixing of reasonable rent.

How can a right to the land be based upon a difference in the quality of the land ? How can varieties of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics ? This reasoning is either so subtle , or so stupid , that the more I think of it , the more bewildered I become. Suppose two pieces of land of equal area; the one , A , capable of supporting ten thousand inhabitants; the other , B , capable of supporting nine thousand only : when , owing to an increase in their number , the inhabitants of A shall be forced to cultivate B , the landed proprietors of A will exact from their tenants in A a rent proportional to the difference between ten and nine. So say , I think , Ricardo , MacCulloch , and Mill. But if A supports as many inhabitants as it can contain , -- that is , if the inhabitants of A , by our hypothesis , have only just enough land to keep them alive , -- how can they pay farm-rent ? </cultivate.v.1202><cultivate.v.1203>Even though 'land ' is considered as a type of 'capital ' , it should be noted that it is also nature 's gift to mankind. In this sense , it is also considered as a different kind of property on which those who work on it should have rights to use it on a sustainable basis. Land being a nature 's free gift , it should be used in a way that it is not destroyed for its use by the posterity. The coming generation of people also have equal right to this nature ' gift. 'Destroying it in the name of private property would also mean that it is a 'inter-generational injustice'. Therefore , from the perspective of natural law that those who cultivate the land have the right to its ownership until they cultivate it for their use. This is especially so the land that is being used for the basic needs or for the subsistence. The people who depend on natural resources for subsistence should not be alienated from these resources whether it is land , forest or other resources . </cultivate.v.1203><cultivate.v.1204>With the ox plows , we will be able to cultivate more land and grow more food to feed our families.

These diversified farming systems share a common " infield/outfield " land use pattern in which household labor and soil fertility inputs are concentrated on a central group of intensively-farmed plots ( that is , the " infield " ) . These central plots are usually terraced , and often cover 5 to 15 percent of total land area. Terraces reduce the impact of climatic accidents on crops through improved moisture retention during drought , reduced erosion and soil nutrient losses during heavy rain , and are easier to cultivate than sloping land. Sloping land ( that is , the " outfield " ) is devoted to uses , including animal grazing , forestry , bush-fallow cultivation , other marginal crop production , and gathering activities , which require fewer and reduced levels of inputs. This infield/outfield pattern is not observed in the pastoral areas where there is a seasonal use pattern in different elevation belts ' Nor does it occur in the traditional slope agriculture systems of several ethnic groups in southwest China ( for example , the Yi and Miao in northeast Yunnan ) which are based on balanced use of scattered hill slope plots . </cultivate.v.1251><cultivate.v.1252>I talked to people from the countryside.

Differences in the environmental characteristics of the regions occupied by cultivated and wild populations could reflect human influences ( e.g. , transportation , watering , fertilization , protection , clearing of competing plants ) that facilitate the persistence of cultivated genotypes in regions where , in the absence of the human contributions , the species does not occur. Alternatively , the expanded geographic range of cultivated populations relative to their wild ancestors could be a result of artificial selection for characteristics that allowed populations to inhabit a wider diversity of habitats . </cultivate.v.1259><cultivate.v.1260>There are particular problems with some Rhododendrons , where species seem to merge with one another , and cultivated plants may not always be truly representative of wild populations.

It can hybridize with cultivated Brassica crops and some such offspring are in turn cultivated ( e.g. , canola oil plant ) , while other strains are considered weeds.

For instance , farmers in Chandia ( Pakistan ) apply the following rotation schedule : sorghum-fallow-oilseed. ( Halcrow 1993b ) As the cropping pattern in many spate irrigation systems is dominated by monocultures and large areas are planted at the same time , the impact of pests and diseases can be dramatic. The use of pesticides and insecticides is very rare as most farmers lack the financial resources to apply these products. Following a number of insect attacks , which affected the quality and quantity of the crops , several types of crops were no longer cultivated by the farmers in the Sheeb area ( Eritrea ) during the 2000-2001 cropping season. ( Kahsaye 2002 ) Changing of sowing dates is one of the control measures used to cope with outbreaks of pests and attacks by birds.

Not only that , we increased our population , forcing us to cultivate more , which facilitated an increase in population , which in turn demanded more cultivation; this continues to this day , in what Daniel Quinn , author of ' Ishmael ' famously calls the ' food race.

The major form of agriculture was and remains sheep grazing , although large areas have been cultivated in the past , especially during the 1939 45 war. Since the 1970 's there has been an increase in arable agriculture with some ditches filled in and field drainage installed. Although these areas are generally species poor , they provide valuable areas for some species : in winter large flocks of Lapwing , Curlew and Golden Plover feed on the invertebrates of the pasture , while Grey Partridge , Corn Bunting , Tree Sparrow and Mute Swan spend much of their time on the arable areas.

Typically ripening very late and developing tolerable acid levels only after frost , this grape makes a strongly characteristic , herbaceous , grapey but unfoxy , tart , varietal wine with light color and soft tannins. Because of it 's unusually high acid content ( 3-7 compared to 0.5-1.2 for cultivated wine grapes ) , the grape requires skill in the winemaking process to produce a drinkable product without extreme amelioration. Very late harvest , even after frost , helps make better wine from it. It is probable that this is the grape that Thomas Jefferson 's winemaker Philip Mazzei used for his " colonial style " wine in his experimentation with native grapes ( collected from the treetops ) . Mazzei and his assistants found the wine to be quite agreeable ( Mazzei drank his and his men sold theirs for a shilling a bottle ) .

Under such conditions the number of oxen available to a farmer must have had a decided effect on the amount of land he could profitably work. With present-day prices it has become profitable for the farmer to pay for labour , and the presence of seven tractors in the village as against none in 1939 , is an indication of the fact that farmers will procure power if they have the land , plus customers to hire their tractor . </cultivate.v.1293><cultivate.v.1294>Smallholder land is a more programmed land that mostly cultivates for cash crops.

With the vast open prairies waiting to be cultivated , Norwegian settlements like New Norway valued families of boys , with strong backs to clear the land and build the towns.

Instead of setting his family to work on the land , he steered them toward music , ideas and education. Sivert lured a piano teacher to New Norway with an offer of cheap rent.

This task requires them to clear any vegetation , turn over the soil , plant , weed , and harvest the crops; the latter job may necessitate carrying loads of taro or kape ( kava ) several kilometers. Men also go fishing together , though this activity is considered more like sport than work. Women look after the Household , take care of children , weave mats , and make tapa.

Some land was only cleared of macchia ( scrub vegetation - Fr. maquis ) when it was required for cultivation. Within the bounds of a chioso an area would be cleared by burning and digging out roots ( diceppare ) , enclosed by a wall and cultivated for a time , then perhaps left to return to macchia.

A reliable purchase price is also a troublesome factor for cultivators. Some medicinal plants are traded to India from Nepal at a much cheaper rate , resulting in the devaluation of indigenous products.

Most land is farmed in very small holdings : The average holding in the mid-1990s was about 1.5 hectares ( less than 4 acres ) . About half the land in India is cultivated by farmers owning more than 4 hectares ( 10 acres ) . However , few farms are larger than 20 hectares ( 50 acres ) because of limited land reform. Most Indian farmers , particularly those who own smaller farms , cultivate their land by hand or by using oxen. India ' s agricultural industry benefited from the government-implemented Green Revolution , which encouraged the use of high-yielding crop varieties , fertilizers , and carefully managed irrigation. The Green Revolution took hold in the 1970s and has resulted in a steady growth in production of food grain. Agricultural production faces occasional declines because of irregular monsoons or other climatic problems. These declines disrupt the economy and spur inflation . </cultivate.v.1310><cultivate.v.1311>The following should be remembered. First , distributing land to people will not solve their problems. The ownership of the land is inconsequential; what counts is the production from the land. Secondly , merely delegating the management of land to someone will not yield the desired production.

This is part of the ADS approach to gradually wean away Katkaris from the bonded labour on brick kilns by demonstrating alternative livelihood strategies. The campaign resulted in cultivation on small patches of eight Dalli Plots , measuring over 30 acres. The Katkari families were assisted in obtaining plough , bullocks , implements , etc. and were also given seeds. Crops cultivated were sweet potato , chilly , okra , cluster bean , bottle gourd , bitter gourd , brinjal , finger millet , proso millet , dioscorea , rice , etc. Groups of families from 9 hamlets ( Jambhulwadi , Wadachiwadi , Shirse , Tamnath , Pulachiwadi , Potalpali , Khandpe , Beed Jamrukh and Nivali ) cultivated the crops.

In the beginning stages , this way of thinking may be cultivated in respect of an external object , and not with our own bodies. We need not attempt the same detached relationship to our bodies in the earlier stages of meditation. We will come to it a little later , because we are so much attached to our own bodies that we will refuse to analyse ourselves like this.

However , varying the depth of cultivation from year-to-year will often overcome such effects. Whether or not subsoiling will be beneficial depends on the extent to which a compacted plough pan has developed and subsequently inhibited crop growth , which , in turn , is dependent on individual paddock history.

European settlers and colonial regimes introduced ploughs , and they quickly came to dominate farming because they enabled farmers to open up more land quickly and cheaply. But just as in the United States , the plough has gradually eroded Africa 's soils. Fertility and yields have fallen , and many countries now face critical food shortages.

More recently , coca leaf prices in Peru have fallen by almost one third after the capture of many of the leading members of the Cali cartel [ 89 ] . However , aggregate changes in the level of coca bush cultivation show little variance in response to widely fluctuating prices [ 90 ] . Opium poppy cultivation has proved relatively unresponsive to declining prices once they have fallen below a given level [ 91 ] . This suggests that the lack of alternative sources of income and expectations of future price increases will induce many households to continue to cultivate opium poppy and coca bush , albeit to a lesser extent. Some households , however , have responded to falling coca leaf prices by undertaking basic processing , transcending existing cultural mores and participating in illegal activities [ 10 ] . 32 Law enforcement can succeed in reducing cultivation at the margins but if alternative livelihoods are not available , such success may be achieved at the cost of social and political unrest . </cultivate.v.1384><cultivate.v.1385>While the introduction of PN3 was highly successful , it resulted in widespread genetic erosion among the local landraces.

The aim is to characterise their variability and bring to light any relationships between these variables and other input data for the transfer equation. The crop considered in this pilot study is field-grown lettuce , the most widely consumed variety of salad in France. The study is based on the crop model STICS developed by INRA , the French National Institute for Agricultural Research. STICS makes it possible to propose a daily follow up of the production of fresh biomass ( yield ) and the rate of vegetative cover , which has been linked with the interception capacity via the leaf area index. In our assessment of these variables , we were also able to account for the technical practices used to cultivate lettuce as well as the regional variations in agricultural conditions. The results obtained enable quantifying the relationships between growth time and yield at maturity and between the interception capacity and the development of lettuce . </cultivate.v.1393><cultivate.v.1394>Potatoes are good crops to cultivate since they are not very fragile compared with other crops. But they still need some protection especially during cold weather. You can draw the soil around it for additional protection or use some straw to keep it warm. Do not forget to remove it later to make sure that they will not rot or grow any mold. Water the crops during summer especially when they are just beginning to grow. You can place soil around the base of tubers to strengthen them especially when they are about twenty-two centimeters tall. It is called " earthing " .

The holdings that made a peasant family rich in one part of Thailand might not make it rich elsewhere. A rich rural family was one with substantial landholdings , some of which it might rent out. Moreover , if a family had the capital to hire agricultural labor and the implements necessary to cultivate additional land , it might rent plots from others. In any case , such a family would rely almost exclusively on hired labor rather than on the system of labor exchange , and it was likely to invest in other local enterprises , such as rice mills , thereby acquiring additional sources of income. The category of rich peasants could be subdivided into those with very large quantities of land and those with smaller but still substantial amounts. Usually that distinction would correlate with the magnitude of their nonfarming enterprises and the extent to which they had money to lend to others. In any case , rich peasants tended to be creditors , while other peasants were often debtors . </cultivate.v.1409><cultivate.v.1410>Tsira Terterashvili , 41 , Gori district , Karaleti village : When the war began , we left for my brother ' s house in Tbilisi.

Under a thick cover of forest , bush , or even grass fallow , OM increases , the soil surface is protected , and soil temperature is moderated , the CEC is maintained , soil organisms such as earthworms are active ( Lal 1983 , p. 20 ) , and within the limits of the soil 's inherent fertility , productivity is high. Once the vegetation is burned , or the soil is cultivated , soil OM breaks down rapidly , depending on the moisture content. The rate of breakdown is proportional to the temperature ( Birch and Friend 1956 ) . Lal ( 1983 , p. 14 ) and others ( for example , Sanchez 1976 , p. 105 ) have emphasized the critical role of mulching in tropical crop production. Mulches decrease the energy of raindrops and therefore protect the soil from capping and erosion , they limit evaporation and therefore retain soil moisture , reduce the rate of OM decomposition , prevent excessively high soil temperatures , which can impede or prevent seedling emergence , increase soil water storage , and decrease weed infestation. As they decompose , mulches make OM and nutrients available for crop growth . </cultivate.v.1432><cultivate.v.1433>Vazha Chopliani feels sad that there is much uncultivated land around his house and he can not take advantage of that.

Todd is considering hand-weeding the soybeans if it is economically viable ( they are testing hand-weeded soybean yields this year ) . He has experimented with no-tilling soybeans into a rolled down rye cover crop. It worked fairly well the first year or two , but has not been greatly successful. Part of the problem is that there is not enough N in the soil to get a good , thick stand of rye , since no fertility sources are applied to the rye cover crop.

The announcement of the new law is already accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric , and even by threats of expulsion. Naturally , the argument rests on ethnic demagogy.

Therefore , it is required to prepare the program to secure food grains stably in preparation for the worldwide scarcity of food grains. Especially , it is highly demanded to improve the self-sufficiency rate of food grains by increasing the production of upland products in the rice fields in order to tackle the problems of the unstable agricultural product supply affected by recent sharp rise of the international grain prices. In other words , we have to make efforts to cultivate the wheat , corn , bean , potato and sweet potato.

He could not obtain a quarter on this basis if he already had a homestead and a preemption , but he could convert his pre-emption to a tree planting claim. Patent was to issue after six years on proof to the satisfaction of the local Agent that one fifth of the land had been planted with timber , and that the latter had been regularly and well cultivated and protected from the time of planting .

Being bewildered by the misconception that the Supersoul is something different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead , he remains in the conditioned state of lamentation. Ones so-called eternal conditioned state of existence , which is full of the duality of flickering happiness and increasing lamentation , can give way to his natural liberated state of boundless and eternal happiness when he cultivates spiritual knowledge and devotional service in full awareness of their meaning. As instructed throughout the Vedas , spiritual knowledge means understanding the self and the Superself and pure devotional service always begins in obedience to the dictation of the same Superself.

In many cases , the original land owner , from whom the land was taken under the ceiling legislation , continues to cultivate the land.

Human being is a repository of Triguna s , namely , sattva ( calm serenity ) , rajas ( passionate activity ) , thamo guna ( sloth and slumber ) . Unfortunately , today , we find the rajo and thamo guna s more active in human beings. We do not find even a trace of sattvic guna anywhere.

While land provides us with these most basic and fundamental of necessities , land ownership is , in fact , a much more complicated business. There are countless pitfalls and a myriad of considerations when undertaking the task of buying or selling land. Buying or selling land is certainly not a task to be undertaken lightly.

No designation of garlic varieties was made in the early writings discovered to date , be it hardneck or softneck , red or white , early or late , local or exotic. Throughout its earlier history some have speculated that softneck garlic was the predominant type cultivated although evidence of what would be interpreted as a hardneck type was found interred in Egyptian tombs. It was not until garlic was cultivated in southern Europe within the last 1000 years that the distinction between hardneck and softneck was routinely noted.

Now , because of the increase in the size of the population , a small plot of land is measured with rope and distributed to each household , and that piece of land is constantly cultivated. The soil is washed away by the rain and the land loses its fertility. There is very little yield and the crop residue after harvest is too scanty to feed the livestock well as in the old days.

This is not to deny the role of theory in establishing partnerships between teachers and parents. Beginning teachers , as an outcome of their graduate training are expected to " have an understanding of models of partnership with parents in the context of their understandings of teacher professionalism , ( and ) to know the structures of parent participation in the settings for which they are being prepared " ( ACDE , 1998 : 17 ) . Clearly these are understandings ' and knowledges ' that can be accommodated within the framework of teacher education theory because they are essentially understandings and knowledges that are not dependant on context. Models that have been proposed for teacher education programs generally aim to cultivate a sharing of theories and research findings to give preservice teachers a broader base of knowledge on which to build parent involvement strategies ( Tichenor , 1997 ) . </cultivate.v.1501><cultivate.v.1502>Objective of this event is to cultivate the habit of reading among school children.

By then most of the dust and bacteria have been filtered out by the mucous membranes , or the moist lining of the nose. Mucous , by the way , in addition to acting as a filter substances , also has certain germicidal properties-another reason why it is so important to cultivate the habit of breathing though the nose.

Crops were diversified , irrigation extended , reforestation initiated , and tree nurseries started. Piggeries were cosntructed , rural technical schools built , and demonstration farms set up , selective cattle breeding was developed , and auxiliary agricultural industries put into operation. Socialized agriculture showed itself superior on the one hand to large-scale absentee ownership , which left part of the land fallow; and on the other to small farms cultivated by primitive techniques , with poor seed and no fertilizers.

This system of land distribution was apparently in widespread use during the Chou Dynasty period from 1111-255 BC , and was advocated by the humanistic Confucian scholar Mencius as an ideal form of land distribution since it benefited both the peasant farmer and government.

This sensitivity is best gained by first hand experience with other 's points of view; no description in the literature can fully convey the character and constitution of a learners ' prior knowledge. Fortunately , becoming sensitive to prior knowledge is not hard to do. One must simply look and listen closely as learners use your materials.

Their germination requires a lot of moisture ( 60-100 water of grain mass ); therefore , oats should be sown first. Delaying soil tillage and sowing , oats more suffer from diseases ( crown rust ) and their yield diminishes. Every delayed day in oats sowing , in comparison with early sowing , reduces grain yield by 36 kg/ha. It is enough to cultivate light soils with harrow only once in spring. As soon as the soil becomes dry enough , it should be harrowed and sown with oats. Deep ( to 12 cm ) loosening of not weedy soils of good structure does not affect oat productivity more than loosening to a depth of 5 cm. In heavier soils oat seeds are sown at 3-4 cm and in lighter soils a little bit deeper at 4-5 cm . </cultivate.v.1519><cultivate.v.1520>A : I do n't think any plant can work as a suitable alternative to poppy.

Irrigation thereby increases livelihood security , as is supported by the observation that in years where rain-fed crop production is meager due to low or irregular rainfall , the surface cultivated with irrigated crops increases ( Brouwer and Mulli 1994 ) . Smaller wetlands probably have a higher nutrient loading due to a greater circumference to area ratio and proportionally higher nutrient instream.

In-situ conservation of so-called " farm " varieties of crop plants , following the example of maize , could therefore be perceived in terms not of isolation , but of dynamic means of genetic material flow between the different populations of the same region in which the farmers play a predominant role. They thus appear to cultivate maize population diversity. These populations appear as open genetic systems , maintaining the centres of diversity of this major food cereal. The research conducted in this context on the inter-population gene flow should lead to better assessment of the risks from a spread of genetically modified transgenic-corn varieties that might possibly be introduced into Mexico among traditional local landraces.

He estimated that by 1982 wheat acreage had fallen by two-thirds nationally. This directly contrasts with the government 's claims. He noted that provinces with large farms , such as Farah , Qandahar , and Nimruz , had proportionally larger decreases in wheat acreage than provinces containing smaller farms. In addition to wheat , Azam Gul found that corn acreage dropped by two-thirds , barley by half , rice by 80 percent , and cotton by 85 percent. Government statistics agreed that cotton and rice acreage declined , but the official statistics admitted to only a fraction of the decreases estimated by Azam Gul. Acreage declines were also attributed to large price increases and lack of availability of equipment , seed , and gasoline. Wheat seed , for example , rose from Af62.6 per seer in 1978 to Af154 in 1982. ( In Afghanistan a seer is equivalent to about 7.08 kilograms. ) Generally , the price hikes reflected increasing scarcity.

The fourth year required the planting of trees on the second five acres , making a total of ten acres in trees. Not less than 2 , 700 trees were to be planted on each of the ten acres , or a total of 27 , 000 trees ! If less than 160 acres were claimed , the acreage of trees was reduced proportionately.

So this Hadith prefers leaving the land fallow rather than giving it on rent in kind or cash to others.

Although chickweed grows in profusion on waste and cultivated ground and is easily collected , it is labourious to prepare. The stalks are too stringy to make pleasant eating and separating the small leaves from them is a timeconsuming business. However , since chickweed is common and grows almost the whole year round , it is a vegetable source which can always be relied on.

That regime had instituted a policy of colonisation in Gambella , bringing in thousands of people from outside of the region to settle there and cultivate the land. It implemented a state farm model as a way to cultivate cash crops.

These governmental academies aimed to cultivate government officials and teachers. The governmental academies managed Confucian Temples. They also directed and supervised students who had passed the first level of the imperial examinations. These students were known as Sioucai. Classes for the Sioucai were given on a monthly basis. Sioucai had to go to the academies for the monthly lessons or examinations and whenever the supervising directors of education visited. For Sioucai , the way to government positions was by taking the next two levels in the imperial examination system , first to become a Jyuren by passing the provincial examination ( held in Fuchien ) and then to become a prestigious Jinshih by passing the palace examination ( held in Beijing ) .

Even the soil needs to be loosened and it should be ensured that the tree does not receive excessive heat or congestion from grasses. Notwithstanding the fact that the trees are capable of enduring considerable parched situations , the best conditions to grow black cherry include luxuriant and damp soil that contains intense mulch to keep the root area calm and unruffled. It is also important to remember that once the plants are placed in one place , they should not be disturbed as black cherry has a low root system that is vulnerable to harm from anything that could be heaped , accumulated or placed within the range of its watering system or even somewhat away from it. As mentioned earlier , black cherry seeds are normally spread by birds and other wildlife restricting their propagation to a limited area. It may be noted here that black cherry is vulnerable to several insects , including the eastern tent caterpillar , fall webworm and other chewing pests , and it is essential that the trees are protected from these . </cultivate.v.1658><cultivate.v.1659>As the story went , if the Xhosa people demonstrated their belief in the spirits of their ancestors by slaughtering their cattle and refusing to cultivate their fields , the ancestors would reward them by returning from the dead , doubling the number of their cattle , multiplying their stores of grain and rendering old people young again. For many people , this was a way to salvation. Over 100 , 000 believers slaughtered their cattle and abandoned their fields. A significant number of nonbelievers , however , refused to. The ancestors never showed up , and a large percentage of the believers slowly starved to death. Many were sold into slavery by the British governor of the province.

In 1982 , ten per cent of land was redistributed in the names of married women and women who were widows , destitutes and even unmarried daughters. In spite of these important gains , however , women found it difficult to cultivate their land.

Looking into the history of this town , in the early days it was inhabited mainly by the Kavalan Pingpu Tribes. In the early Jiaqing Emperor reign of the Qing Dynasty , Wu Sha 's son Wu Guang Yi followed in his fathers footsteps and led a group of people to open and clear the now Zhuangwei area. When the land was cleared , it was divided into small lots and given to those who helped clear the land as a reward. That was how Zhuangwei got its name. In the early 19th century , Lin Ming Jhan who came with Wu Sha from Mainland China choose this area as a base to expand and cultivate the land. The soil here is fertile , however there were no natural defensive barriers of which the people could use to protect themselves with. To strengthen their defensive power , strong young people were selected for guard duty. In the process of clearing the land , routes were named as Zhuangyi ( strong No. 1 ) , Zhuanger ( strong No.2 ) and Zhuangwu ( strong No. 5 ) showing proof of this unique self-defense system . </cultivate.v.1665><cultivate.v.1666>We may say with , certainty that the more one reads , the better one understands; and that the better one understands , the more one is inclined to read.

As Alfred Whitehead has said in another connection , It is a profoundly erroneous truism , repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches , that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. This is of profound significance in the social field. We make constant use of formulas , symbols , and rules whose meaning we do not understand and through the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledge which individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices and institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of the civilization we have built up . </cultivate.v.1675><cultivate.v.1676>The habit of saving is itself an education.

These trees can not be grown from cuttings. It 's also a waste of effort to grow them from seed , since the offspring of even an outstanding individual tree of those species are highly variable and yield mostly worthless fruit. Instead those trees must be grown by the difficult technique of grafting , developed in China long after the beginnings of agriculture. Not only is grafting hard work once you know the principle , but arriving at the principle itself must have required deliberate experimentation. The invention of grafting was hardly a matter of some nomad just relieving himself at a latrine and returning later to be pleasantly surprised by the resulting crop. Such problems delayed the domestication of these fruit trees until around classical times. From the outset , their cultivation was a highly conscious enterprise , carried out according to explicit rules that the Romans described in encyclopedic treatises . </cultivate.v.1677><cultivate.v.1678>The village of Houi Dok Kham , located in the heavily contaminated Xieng Khouang province , is a good example.

If the principle of ' land to the tiller ' is to be enforced , conditions should be created where it may not be possible to own acreage of land beyond what can be operated intensively. Therefore , elimination of absentee land ownership would be desirable and for that the definition of ' personal cultivation ' should be revised and made stricter in relation to residence , income and participation of the landowners. The definition of ' personal cultivation ' should lay stress on these ingredients as ( a ) the person claiming to be cultivator of the land must bear the entire cost of cultivation; ( b ) he must cultivate his own land by his own labour , or by the labour of any member of his family; ( c ) he or a member of his family should reside for the greater part of the year in the locality , where the land is located; ( d ) cultivation should be the main source of his income . </cultivate.v.1682><cultivate.v.1683>6.

For example , the wild Vanda coerulea has a paler shade , the tesselation is not as clear and as vivid , and the petals are significantly more twisted ( although retaining their natural beauty ) than the Vanda coerulea sold in the market. Breeders have improved and altered those features by bringing some specimens from the wild to cultivate , then using the process of either self-pollination or cross-pollination to develop hybrids. The seeds from the pods of these new " breeds " are then brought to the laboratory for further embryo culture , cultivation and selection to obtain the features desired. Generally the features sought by these processes are brighter colours , more obvious tesselation , and less twisted petals so that a circular form is achieved. Other than self-pollinating and cross-pollinating , the orchids are sometimes pollinated from orchids of different species and families in order to obtain other special features such as , in the case of Vanda sp. for example , being able to produce flowers more than once a year . </cultivate.v.1684><cultivate.v.1685>Besides , many erroneous interpretations of Islamic texts make people believe that Islam has no consideration for women.

With regard to the right to use land , women are definitely better off. They can exploit land in decline in the same capacity as men who are given priority. The idea underlying this bias in favour of men is that as head of the household , man should have means of production. However , many women are also heads of households especially in this area marked by male emigration.

Selection is made in the field between the time of maturity and harvest. Seeds are selected from fields with good levelling , which have received sufficient water and have a mature homogeneous plant population. The actual cutting of plants for seed is done by hand with a small knife. While each household commonly selects sufficient seeds to meet the requirements of the following season , some degree of specialisation does exist.

By political means , they claimed legal property in the lands already occupied and worked by the peasantry , and compelled them to pay rent on their own land. By political means , likewise , they claimed ownership of vacant lands , and controlled access to it without themselves ever directly occupying or working it. As Adam Smith wrote , " A great part of them was uncultivated; but no part of them , whether cultivated or uncultivated , was left without a proprietor. All of them were engrossed , and the greater part by a few great proprietors. " 6 </cultivate.v.1700><cultivate.v.1701>It is none too clear precisely what each of the above districts includes. The " Hills of Judea and Samaria " probably includes Jerusalem and the approaches to it , and is not restricted to the area known today as the " West Bank. " Gaza was eventually separated from the Beersheba subdistrict. Other estimates found about 7 million or as high as 12 million metric dunams of " cultivable " land , depending apparently on how " cultivable " was defined ( Stein , Land Question , pp. 106-107 ) . For example , if one excludes swamps and marshland , because these areas could not be cultivated without development , there was considerably less land than if one includes the swampland . </cultivate.v.1701><cultivate.v.1702>Regrettably , too few students experience science education in classrooms and schools that cultivate the habits of mind necessary for scientific literacy ( Perkins , 1992 ) . In Smart Schools , David Perkins ( 1992 ) explains that schools largely ignore thinking skills because the system is steeped in a culture of trivia -- or , what Schwab ( 1965 ) had called " a rhetoric of conclusions. " Others ( e.g. , Kagan , 1992; Weinstein , 1989; Book , Byers , &amp;Freeman , 1983 ) argue that socialization processes perpetuate such cultures. For example , a number of studies ( see Goodlad , 1990; Sarason , 1981; and Lortie , 1975 ) describe how views regarding the roles of the teacher and the learners are forged by years of observation and experience. As a result , many people construct implicit sets of beliefs about how schools and classrooms should operate -- operations that are often antithetical to a culture of thinking , inquiry , and scientific literacy.

Its importance increases every day to the extent that it is adopted as a national strategic industry by major advanced tourism countries. The convention industry primarily refers to the service-related industries such as the operation of convention centers and exhibition-related industries. Its economic spin-off effect is very big as it is linked with a variety of other industries. Accordingly , we cultivate students ' abilities to attract and operate conventions centering on systematic field practices and train certified international convention planners and experts in the areas of convention centers , international organizations , public organizations , foreign businesses , exhibition and trading companies and domestic/foreign food service companies , etc . </cultivate.v.1708><cultivate.v.1709>Thirty years ago ? Let me see ... At that time , I just felt cultivation in the city was bad. I can not really tell you why I felt that way but it may be because of my experiences when I was a young lady. I grew up at Koforidua , and my mother had a nice vegetable garden in front of our house right at the center of the town. [ 40 ] One morning , Town Council officials came to slash down every crop saying it was forbidden to cultivate crops in the town. In our neighbor 's front-yard was growing flowers. These were not slashed down. Thinking of it today , we were allowed to grow flowers but not vegetables. I grew up believing cultivation of crops in urban areas was bad. Today , I think otherwise. What use is it growing flowers instead of vegetables ? We need food not flowers. [ 41 ] </cultivate.v.1709><cultivate.v.1710>Agricultural and conservation policies also influence land-use decisions. Land retirement programs directly affect land use , while other agricultural policies may change the economic incentives to cultivate crops. Two very different types of policies the Conservation Reserve Program ( CRP ) and the Federal Crop Insurance Program illustrate how policies can affect land use on lower quality and environmentally sensitive cropland. These government programs that affect land use may have as significant an effect on the environment as on production , and the specific environmental impacts will vary with the features of each program . </cultivate.v.1710><cultivate.v.1711>2d.

Cones of coniferous trees are oven-dried and tumbled to free the seed. A temperature of about 49 C ( 120 F ) is best for some pines , whereas 32 C ( 90 F ) is better for fir. Seed is dewinged by brushing or friction , and the residues are blown away. It is typically stored at subfreezing temperatures. At these low temperatures viability is retained for 5 to 10 years. Most tree seeds must be cold-stratified for good germination. Seed planted into the nursery in autumn is cold-stratified naturally by winter weather. Seed for spring planting is typically soaked in water for most of a day and then held at temperatures slightly above freezing for a number of weeks. It will then germinate in 7 to 10 days. Nursery seedlings are tended in much the same way as orchard trees; they are watered , fertilized , weeded , and usually cultivated for 1 to 4 years ( Fig. 16 ) . In the southern United States seedlings are sufficiently mature for field planting in 1 year . </cultivate.v.1712><cultivate.v.1713>Scientifically literate ways of thinking and acting , however , require the development of higher order cognitive skills. Such skills enable one to identify ill-defined problems , to generate a variety of solutions to any particular problem , to act upon informed decisions , and to evaluate actions and their consequences ( Hurd , 1993; Resnick , 1992 ) . Resnick argues that successful schools not only cultivate these skills -- they cultivate the habit to use them. Such schools place value on activities such as questioning , thinking , communicating , and judging -- all within the boundaries of a safe learning environment . </cultivate.v.1713><cultivate.v.1714>Additional Director of DAE for Rajshahi Abdul Matin said the crop was cultivated on 5 percent more land than targeted.

When they arrived in the village , they did not find any place to cultivate because the whole land was occupied by the other group. When asked to give away some portion of the land to those who had returned , those who stayed refused. This brought a very big issue of dispute between the two groups.

This characteristic , combined with the existence of wild P. lunatus seed banks in the soil , can favor or limit genetic contact between wild and domesticated populations. Mayan farmers on the Peninsula cultivate their plots for 1 to 3 yr and then leave them fallow for 5 to 15 yr ( Lazos-Chavero , 1995; Ku-Naal , 1995; Remmers and Ucan , 1996 ) . If wild P. lunatus seeds are in the soil , they will germinate when farmers cut and burn the vegetation for a new agricultural cycle , leading to sympatric growth with domesticated populations and thus increasing the possibility of introgression between the two gene pools . </cultivate.v.1721><cultivate.v.1722>Palette PR , a rising star on the Toronto PR agency scene , continues to cultivate new growth with the addition of two clients : Canada Blooms and Canadian Management Centre.

However , the " discreet " action of K , i.e. the absence of spectacular effects on yield when omitted earmarks the nutrient as the one to be sacrificed first at economic shortcomings like currently in FSU and CEE. Lack of price incentives for higher crop quality as often observed , support this unacceptable attitude. Soils , especially those with a good texture may buffer insufficient K fertilization for a while by replenishing solution K with K from the non-exchangeable or slowly available reserves. But , with continuous soil K mining as observed in FSU and CEE , the soils exhaust on K reserves. Unbalanced nutrition as widely practiced mines the soil , it deprives the soil 's capacity to buffer adverse conditions and ultimately , it is a threat to the environment. The declining replenishment from K reserves of course restricts yield formation as explained earlier . </cultivate.v.1730><cultivate.v.1731>Wild rice is cultivated on approximately 25 , 000 acres in Minnesota.

Before the 1960 's , a farmer was limited by the amount of land that he could cultivate with a mule and plow. New technologies such as tractors , wide-row equipment , and herbicide resistant genetically-modified crops have greatly reduced the labor time per acre required to farm Delta fields. Most farmers do not own enough land to take advantage of the economy-of-scale of modern row crop machinery. The solution has been to rent or lease farm land from land landowners. Often this land is own by a widow of a farmer or children living in distance cities with busy jobs of their own. Competition for prime farm land in the region to rent remains high despite a shrinking number of farmers.

The aim is to kill the vegetative organs of the weeds by mechanical damage and desiccation. For a full or bare fallow , heavy land is ploughed in April to give the weeds time to start into growth. It is cultivated or cross-ploughed 10-14 days later to produce a cloddy tilth. The soil is cultivated or ploughed at frequent intervals to move the clods around and dry them out. By August the clods should have broken down and the soil is left to allow the weed seeds to germinate. In September/October the weeds are ploughed in and the land prepared for autumn cropping. If a cereal is to follow the fallow , wheat bulb fly may be a problem because it lays eggs on bare ground in July.

During the colonial period Western legal systems were imposed upon the existing customary and religious land tenure without eliminating traditional rules and institutions. Table 1 provides a summary of some features of customary land tenure systems in West Africa , as well as the most important characteristics of modern law as designed by the French and English colonial powers ( Lavigne Delville 1999 ) . There are nearly as many customary land tenure regimes as there are ethno-linguistic groups ( in Nigeria alone there are 394 linguistic units ) . Probably these regimes have a lot in common , but no exhaustive surveys have been done4 ( Mortimore 1997 ) . Customary land tenure is even more complicated to describe because rules regularly are being adapted to changing circumstances ( Breusers 2001; Lavigne Delville 1999 ) .

Essential Reading For Anybody Practicing Jnana-Yoga Self-Knowledge is a translation by Swami Nikhilananda of the sacred text , Atmabodha , composed by the 8th century philosopher and mystic of India , Sankara. Self-Knowledge sets forth the principles of Non-dualistic Vedanta : the divinity of the soul , the unity of existence , the oneness of the Godhead , and the harmony of religions. As Swami Nikhilananda writes in the preface , The very name of the book - Self-Knowledge - suggests its perennial interest and universal value. Self-Knowledge is vital. All other forms of knowledge are of secondary importance; for a mans action , feeling , reasoning , and thinking are dependent upon his idea of the Self. His view of life will be either materialistic or spiritual according to his conception of himself. Therefore it behooves everyone to cultivate Self- Knowledge at all times. Self-Knowledge serves the practical purpose of destroying pain and suffering ( which are always caused by ignorance of the Self ) and also the positive end of helping everyone enjoy supreme peace and blessedness here and always.

When the South lost the war , bringing slavery to an end , Arkansas landowners and freed slaves then began negotiating new labor relationships to cultivate land up and down the Arkansas Delta. While some planters preferred day labor , using workers hired by the hour , week , or month , other landowners opted for tenant farmers. In some instances , a hybrid of the two existed. For example , after a farmer got his crop harvested , his family members might work as day laborers for other tenants to supplement their income or provide Christmas money. Hired labor directly supervised by the landowner or his manager provided the greatest level of labor control , but it required periodic cash outlays on payday , and the planter took all of the crop risk. Tenants allowed the landowner to conserve cash for other crop expenses , and the tenant shared crop risk on leased land. In some instances , such as on the Twist Plantation during the 1930s , some land was leased and other acreage farmed by hired help . </cultivate.v.1764><cultivate.v.1765>And then in November 2008 a Norwegian company ScanFuel Ltd. , was reported to start operations outside Kumasi in the Ashanti region to produce biofuel.

But of what values ? Of the values produced by human industry; that is , of the changes made in matter by man , that he may appropriate it to his own use , and not at all of Nature 's spontaneous productions. Man 's labor consists in a simple laying on of hands. When he has taken that trouble , he has produced a value. Until then , the salt of the sea , the water of the springs , the grass of the fields , and the trees of the forests are to him as if they were not. The sea , without the fisherman and his line , supplies no fish. The forest , without the wood-cutter and his axe , furnishes neither fuel nor timber. The meadow , without the mower , yields neither hay nor aftermath. Nature is a vast mass of material to be cultivated and converted into products; but Nature produces nothing for herself : in the economical sense , her products , in their relation to man , are not yet products . </cultivate.v.1766><cultivate.v.1767>The Murray Islands are tiny.

When plant nutrients in the soil were depleted , and crop yields had fallen , farmers would move to a new plot , leaving the old one to regenerate under natural vegetation. It could be 20 or more years before the original plot was cultivated again.

Trees were to be utilized , of course , for timber , fuel , furniture , and so on. But the forest seemed limitless , and the main task at hand was to cut down the trees and grub out the stumps , so that land could be cultivated and cropped. In North America even the Indians had made a few clearings in the forest , where they planted corn and other crops. Gradually the hand felling of trees and manual hoeing of soil , which were characteristic of the early Virginia colonies , changed to soil cultivation with moldboard plows drawn by oxen or horses , and then to today 's use of elaborate farm machinery.

It frequently takes from the tenant so great a part of his capital , and thereby diminishes so much his ability to cultivate the land , that he finds it more difficult to pay a small rent than it would otherwise have been to pay a great one. Whatever diminishes his ability to cultivate , necessarily keeps down , below what it would otherwise have been , the most important part of the revenue of the community.

Did the local government obtain any agreements from the village committee or village representatives when they rented Yao-Ulaan Village 's 3 , 000 mu ( approximately 200 hectares ) land to outsiders ?

Rather , they see a curriculum as a means " to cultivate a habit of suspended judgment , of skepticism , of desire for evidence , of appeal to observation rather than sentiment , discussion rather than bias , inquiry rather than conventional idealizations " . The authors share a commitment that schools should cultivate this habit of mind and that education means the development of what Dewey called " a discriminating mind " ( " disciplined intelligence " ) and by implication to teach the involved knowledge and strategies to all children . </cultivate.v.1883><cultivate.v.1884>If you are interested in producing cultivated or managed huckleberries or bilberries , start small.

The report says that this has been going for years , although we come across this news for the first time. Clearly , the poor farmers can not manage enough money for taking lease of the land. So they try to cultivate the land with the aim of taking the harvest home. But the jotedars who have the economic power and other means to take lease of the land wait until the poor farmers have put their labour and input into the cultivation of the land. Their aim is to reap other ' s harvest at a minimum cost. What a mockery , the men from the Land and Revenue Department simply become an accomplice to the jotedars in this most monstrous complicity ! </cultivate.v.1885><cultivate.v.1886>In spate-irrigated areas , the cultivation of subsistence and low-value cash crops prevails , whereby drought-resistant crops , such as sorghum , millet , wheat , pulses , oilseeds , cotton and melon , dominate the cropping patterns. Archaeological research has revealed that wheat , barley , sorghum , millet sesame , teff , grape and dates were cultivated in the spate-irrigated areas of Yemen between the third and first millennium BC. ( Wilkinson 200 ? ) The production of fodder is a priority in most spate-irrigated areas in order to support the livestock sector , which is not only an important source of income for many farming households but livestock is also a form of saving that can be sold in bad years and certain animals are used for traction and transport . </cultivate.v.1886><cultivate.v.1887>Every year , it 's the same resolution : get healthy , stay healthy.

Most of the Jewish people who lived in the land of Israel in the 19th century lived in one of four holy cities : Jerusalem , Hebron , Zephath , and Tiberias. Most of them were financially supported by the Jewish communities in the Diaspora. In 1868 , a group of young Jewish people turned to Alliance Israelite Universelle (  :  ) and asked to be given the tools to learn how to cultivate the land so they can support themselves. The Alliance Society sent their secretary , Carl Netter , to check the feasibility of the request. Upon his positive recommendation and the Turkish government support , the Alliance Society was given 750 acres next the Jaffa Jerusalem road for the purpose of an agricultural school. Netter , who became the founder of the school , envisioned making the place an educational center that would develop the country ' s natural resources and renew the glory of Israeli agriculture . </cultivate.v.1888><cultivate.v.1889>A clear relationship exists between research funding , researcher population and article outputs at a national level , and Turkey is no exception.

Although the Absentees Law did not care to verify the legal ownership of the seized land and immovable property on it , it covered this eventuality by creating new laws to make sure any land on which Palestinians lived , used or controlled in Palestine , such as communal lands , hills , seasonally cultivated land or grazing land shall be seized by Israel. What was important was the seizure of the property , not the identity of its owner , who is banished away from his property . </cultivate.v.1890><cultivate.v.1891>It ' s just part of a day ' s work at Whitaker Gardens , a family-owned operation that supplies organically grown produce to discriminating 30-A chefs. The Whitakers cultivate around one hundred varieties of vegetables , fruits , and other plant foods from edible nasturtiums and juicy , indigenous watermelons to ' Menina Rajada Seca ' , a giant Brazilian squash with light green skin. Peak planting season starts in September , and the gardens yield some sort of crops year-round. In particular demand are nearly thirty types of lettuces , salad mixes , and micro-greens ranging from tango , with its crinkled , endive-like leaves , to crunchy Chinese bok choy and mizuna , a delightfully mild Japanese mustard-spinach hybrid. Each week the Whitakers harvest up to eighty pounds of arugula , a spicy staple in Southern coastal salads. We ' re just a backyard garden that does a lot of business , says James , who in 1994 moved with his children and wife , Brenda , from Baton Rouge to this fourteen-acre tract on the eastern edge of DeFuniak Springs. ( Brenda passed away in 1996 . ) </cultivate.v.1891><cultivate.v.1892>The collapse of prices produced hard times , but steadily declining productivity among Arkansas farmers worsened the situation. The size of farms decreased throughout this period , which created less efficient operations. From 1879 to 1899 , the average size of a farm in the state fell from 128 acres to ninety-three acres. At the same time , many of these farms developed on marginal lands. Farmers who worked these small units seldom had the resources to cultivate the land efficiently. Mule-drawn plows that could not cut deeply into the earth , a lack of money to buy fertilizers , and the inability to improve land through crop rotation all of this led to diminishing crops. As a result , the output per acre diminished each year. Between 1879 and 1899 , the state ' s cotton crop output again led the way , dropping from 0.6 to 0.4 bales per acre . </cultivate.v.1892><cultivate.v.1893>Recently , a team of international scientists found fields of wild einkorn wheat in the Near East that provides the closest genetic match to domestic einkorn. By obtaining DNA samples of 68 separate lines of cultivated einkorn , all samples were found to be closely related. DNA profiles were also taken from 261 separate populations of wild einkorn in the same area. Of the 261 wild samples , 19 from the volcanic region of the Karacadag Mountains in Turkey were distinct from the other wild einkorn lines. Further analysis showed that 11 of the 19 samples had a close phylogenetic similarity to the cultivated einkorn. As a result , these 11 wild samples could be identified as modern descendants of the wild progenitor for einkorn wheat.13 </cultivate.v.1893><cultivate.v.1894>A sharefarming agreement is an arrangement whereby a landowner or person in possession of land grants a farmer possession of the land to cultivate the land. The profits and/or produce derived from the farmers cultivation are shared between them in proportions agreed between the parties. A share farmer is neither an employee nor a tenant of the landowner , so the legal relationship between the share farmer and the landowner will be quite different from that between a tenant ( or lessee ) and the owner : see also 'Tenants and leases ' under Chapter 2 Land and its uses.This is primarily because a sharefarming agreement does not normally grant the farmer exclusive possession and is therefore not a lease. For further detailed discussion on farming leasing and share farming , and the pro 's and con 's of each , view the RIRDC Report written by Rod Ashby in 2003 ' Successful land leasing in Australia - A guide for farmers and their advisors ' . </cultivate.v.1894><cultivate.v.1895>Remember that this is a guideline.

While international rice prices are rocketing , many of Asia 's rice farmers have yet to reap any significant benefits. With just small patches of land to cultivate , they have only limited surpluses to sell , after setting aside rice for their own use. Lacking storage facilities - and with debts to repay from planting costs - whatever surplus they had from their last harvest was sold months ago , well before the recent price surge . </cultivate.v.1896><cultivate.v.1897>Distribution of Manihot species was studied by Nassar ( 1978a ) . Table I lists the wild species of Manihot collected from different localities in northeastern Brasil. It is apparent that western Pernambuco and central Bahia present the greatest variability in Manihot. It may be worth mentioning that certain species reported to occur in some localities could not be colleted from these places. To exemplify : specimens of M. glaziovii collected from about 12 km west of Ibimirim , PE , could not be found because vegetation in that location unfortunately had been cleared and the land cultivated with the castor bean plant ( Recinus comunis ) , mamona. Unlike most Manihot species , M. glaziovii grows in large numbers and not as a sporadic plant. Extinction of some wild Manihot species from their rural habitats may be due to another factor , namely that the majority of theses species are poisonous to grazing animals because of the presence of HCN. They are known among people of the Brazilian Northeast as " mani oba " , i.e. , the poisonous cassava. Many plants are exterminated by farmers for this reason . </cultivate.v.1897><cultivate.v.1898>1.Buy a once a day vitamin supplement and begin taking it.

The Graduation Act , in contrast to the settler bias of land policies of the previous five decades , was a boon to speculators. Despite sections limiting maximum purchases to 320 acres and requiring the buyers to swear an intent to settle and cultivate the land , speculators took advantage of the vague wording of the legislation and bought large tracts at the low prices. [ 7 ] </cultivate.v.1910><cultivate.v.1911>Wild rice has been difficult to cultivate , in large part because of the ease with which ripe grains fall from their stalks or " shatter. " For centuries Native Americans harvested it in canoes , bending the long stalks over the canoe and shaking off the grain. By 1985 a shatter resistant cultivar had been developed and the amount of wild rice in cultivation now greatly exceeds that harvested from plants growing naturally. California and Minnesota are the two major sources of cultivated wild rice. The new cultivar produces shorter grains that swell less when cooked than do the natural strain , so wild rice from the Connecticut River will not look exactly like what you might purchase in the store . </cultivate.v.1911><cultivate.v.1912>In our interview , Al emphasized that they got into direct seeding because he was convinced they did n't need to cultivate the ground to produce a crop.

At the time , they were using a disc press drill and it turned out quite successful. They have been gradually cutting out tillage for a number of years. A neighbour , with quite a bit of direct seeding experience , was very helpful in assisting in their transition into direct seeding.

They woefully lack a sense of discrimination to judge whether such writing is conducive to their moral , spiritual and character development. They will , however , realize the consequences of their action after their minds are totally polluted. Then it will be too late for them to retrace their steps. It is only through good books that good thoughts and good behaviour can be cultivated. Dear students ! </cultivate.v.1915><cultivate.v.1916>In addition to economic motivations , environmental factors also encourage farmers to cultivate a diversity of crops. Like most centers of agricultural biodiversity , the landscape of the Guatemalan highlands is dramatic. With 12 , 000 foot mountains plummeting down into wide river valleys , there are a variety of growing environments. Accounting for differences in altitude , rainfall , and soil quality , farmers match seeds to the different environmental niches. Peasant farmers demonstrate impressive agro-ecological knowledge. This is particularly evident in the predominant agricultural system known as milpa , where maize is intercropped with beans , squash , and other useful plants. When grown together , the three principal milpa crops are agronomic complements. The maize grows tall and upright; its stalks providing support for the beans to climb and eliminating the need for poles. Symbiotically , the beans fix nitrogen in the soil , providing important nutrients for the maize and squash. For its part , the squash , with its large leaves , provides a ground cover that discourages weeds and maintains moisture in the soil . </cultivate.v.1916><cultivate.v.1917>Windsor Forest , the district with which we shall be dealing , has a total population of approximately 2 , 350 persons , predominantly of East Indian descent , and members of this population cultivated about 1 , 470 acres for the autumn crop of 1956.

They tried planting corn using different methods of watering , and different ways and locations to grow acacia trees - each careful attempt in accordance with their observations of the nature of the land. Until one day when one farmer walking in the field noticed a chilli plant growing well near a coconut tree. This discovery prompted other farmers to start planting and tending chilli , building up their experience as they went. Eventually they built up an in-depth knowledge of how to cultivate the land , without the need of any teachers the impetus came from their initiative to organise the farmers ' groups. Nowadays the number of farmer 's groups has expanded greatly , currently there are several dozen . </cultivate.v.1920><cultivate.v.1921>Farmers on Usangu Plains have cultivated a high number of rice varieties over the past three decades and once dominant rice varieties have frequently been replaced after farmers adoption of new varieties.

The most important of these is the tree fern , Dicksonia antarctica. [ 27 ] Tree ferns are removed under licence from forests which are being harvested in Tasmania , Victoria and New South Wales. In Tasmania , about 80 , 000 plants are sold to Victoria at an approximate value of $ 800 , 000. A Commonwealth management plan for the species has not been accepted and so export of tree ferns is prohibited. Should approval be given , it is estimated that the volume exported from Tasmania would instead be worth $ 30 million. In the long-term it is hoped that export approval may be granted for nursery-grown sporlings. [ 28 ] </cultivate.v.1927><cultivate.v.1928>This curriculum aims to cultivate civic knowledge and virtue.

Others indulge themselves in impulsive shopping , buying anything that appeals to them , thus winning themselves the notoriety of being a " shopping tourist. " The purpose of travel should not be materialism but should instead be intellectual and moral cultivation. For example , when parents travel with their children , the purpose of travel should not be done for the sake of showing off , but on learning at the same time the family is having fun. Families should take the opportunity to expand their views and knowledge , meet people from diverse cultures , visit historical sites and famous places , and make new friends.

According to the village elders , here were their grassy grazing lands all over the plains and mountains where grasses were as high as these grasses in front of me now. Unfortunately , now grasslands like this almost have disappeared everywhere and the cultivated land behind me is no longer the collective 's grazing land. It has already become a type of state owned land. Neighboring Zuun Uul is also another village of the five in Bayan-Ulaan Gachaa. Within the border of Zuun Uul Village only , Zalaid Banner State Taxation Bureau has cultivated 7 , 000 mu ( approximately 470 hectares ) ! in 1996 and an investor named Liu Wen-fu contracted 1 , 000 mu. The same land dispute occurred in Zuun-Uul Village in 2003 as well. Recently , another conflict between villagers and contractors broke out in this village. The main reason for these conflicts is that the contractors ' cultivated lands or so-called state owned lands have aggressively expanded while the villagers ' grasslands have rapidly shrunk . </cultivate.v.1938><cultivate.v.1939>By Sallieu SesayIn today ' s edition of this column , I will be looking at one of the key factors hindering the educational standard of this country. And what is that ? The refusal of students to cultivate the art of reading. It is no secret that majority of students generally and those who have particularly completed their studies hardly find time to read outside their area of study. This is so because they have not been able to cultivate the art of reading . </cultivate.v.1939><cultivate.v.1940>The above eighteen points combined , via a gradual process , help in the formation of true knowledge.

You may want to experiment with water plants and a sealed pot. Perhaps your landscape is designed to thrive without supplemental water but you are willing to pamper a few pots of fern , horsetail , or columbine. Your region may have unique soils offering some unique species that may be easier to cultivate in a container with these types of soils. This provides opportunities to grow plants that may be native to your general area and climate , but that may prefer different soils than what you have in your yard . </cultivate.v.1941><cultivate.v.1942>Loosening up is actually a habit. We ought to nurture this habit and take delight in relaxation whenever we can so that we do not accumulate too much pressure.

Do not enter in a next farmer 's line that is marked earlier. By tradition this marking of an area of operation was done annually in late December or early January. The other rule worth mentioning is , if a farmer has farmed virgin land ( forest ) , he will be expected to work on this land for seven or more years; after this is completed the farmer now may leave the area free to be cultivated by other farmers in the future . </cultivate.v.1948><cultivate.v.1949>2.

This technique is more useful in plough-dominated systems rather than grassland management. One aim is to cultivate the soil progressively deeper over time , exposing underground plant parts to desiccation at the soil surface but in this case dry weather conditions are essential. Ploughing begins in June/July allowing time for an early crop to precede it. A bastard fallow is often used after a ley to reduce perennial weeds before sowing a winter cereal. There is also an opportunity for birds to feed on wireworms exposed during soil disturbance . </cultivate.v.1969><cultivate.v.1970>The specific attitudes , skills and knowledge schools aim to cultivate should be responsive to changes in society. What was important before may be irrelevant today , and what is considered essential in one society may have little value in another. Historically , we have seen subjects that once dominated the student timetable , such as Latin , Greek and grammar , being replaced by advanced math and modern sciences. Internationally , other countries have decided what is most important for their society. For China , it is math , English and Chinese. Today , we are in the midst of a significant transformation. Globalization , the multitude of forces that have made our world smaller and more integrated , is likely to turn the world into a global village where geographical distance matters little , and our lives are affected by and impact distant people and places across the world as much as , if not more than , our next-door neighbors.

Those who have little need to use land are commonly told that they have no right to charge rent; holding of land will be for those who use it only. The first point of Bakunin 's " National Catechism " ( 1866 ) states : " The land is the common property of society. But its fruits and use shall be open only to those who cultivate it by their labor; accordingly , ground rents must be abolished. " ( 1972 : 99 ) .

Hence , you must cultivate and put into practice the sattvic guna in the youthful age itself.

The reason why commercialization of these fruits has not happened on a large scale yet is simply because not many people are aware of the health benefits and business potential of these fruits. Entrepreneurs also shy away because the market for such fruits is unorganized and needs to be established properly. A triangular system should be in place , where farmers , researchers and entrepreneurs can work together to cultivate the fruits , develop the production technology , process and package the fruits , and monitor the supply chain. The market for fruits like apples and bananas is already saturated. In case of these underutilized fruits there are no existing players to compete with , so there are chances of monopoly that so ever enter the market at this stage. In the case of fruits like apples and bananas , simply exporting them gets you a profit margin of up to 40 .

Deuteronomy 23 : 26 does not state that the person entered his neighbor ' s field. However , when the Bible records the prohibition not to covet , it specifically refers to the field as belonging to the neighbor ( Deut. 5 : 18 ) , and with regard to the law that a person must leave food for the poor , the text explicitly states that the person who harvests the field harvests his own field ( Deut. 24 : 19 ) .13 Accordingly , the understanding of Deuteronomy 23 : 26 could be that the standing grain is considered the neighbor ' s because he cultivated the field , but he is not the owner of the field. With this reading , the phrase your neighbor ' s vineyard in Deuteronomy 23 : 25 would be understood in a similar fashion the vineyard is considered the viticulturist ' s because he tended the vineyard , but he does not own the land . </cultivate.v.1988><cultivate.v.1989>Landowners may decide to engage tenants or sharecroppers to cultivate their lands for various reasons. For instance , they are unable to operate their lands themselves as they are too old , ill or they are not resident in the village. Larger landlords have to hire the services of tenants or sharecroppers , because they do not have sufficient labour force to cultivate all the fields themselves and/or they may be engaged in other off-farm activities , such as trade , business or transport. For female landowners , such as divorcees and widows , it is often very difficult if not impossible to cultivate their fields themselves due to lack of resources ( i.e. labour and/or draft animals ) as well as cultural and/or religious constraints. Landholders may also be to poor to farm as they lack the necessary resources ( i.e. draft animals or tractor ) to prepare and repair the bunds as well as the inputs ( i.e. seeds ) to grow crops themselves.

How can we plant seeds or cultivate the land ? There was no time for anything. They banned us from using tractors and machinery they said everything must be done with animals. Everybody worked solidly for the four days. We tried , but in the end we had to leave most of the land uncultivated. They are forcing us and our animals out.

Land has always been a lifeline of the Chinese. Land is the legacy that is passed from one generation to the next. Unfortunately , some children do not appreciate the intentions of their forefathers. They often fail to cultivate the land well , or allow the fields to lie wasted. Worse yet , they sell off pieces of the land here and there at low prices. This behavior is truly regrettable. We need to fully utilize and cultivate these fields . </cultivate.v.2011><cultivate.v.2012>To achieve an ideal tilth in a home garden the best tools for the job are a spading fork , hoe and rake. When the soil has reached a state where it is appropriate to cultivate , a spading fork can be used to loosen the top 8-12 inches of soil. Next , the hoe is used to chop up dirt clods into a fine consistency. Lastly , the rake is used to provide a desired bed shape.

Next , most weeds like to grow tall , so we started mowing the lot as often as we mowed our own lawn. Our mower is a mulching mower , and the theory is that the mower will destroy weed seeds and chop the grass and weeds so finely they would decompose and quickly act as fertilizer.

It is said : " If one does his best as a person , he has already accomplished the path to Buddhahood. " That 's why , to cultivate the path to Buddhahood , one must first have a wholesome characteristic. This is in fact the highest priority of education in the 21st century. In the City ( City of Ten Thousand Buddha ) , we do not require the students to be fluent in all sort of dogmas , nor do we require them to memorize and recite the sutras. We only require them to be respectful to all elders and teachers , to repay the kindness of their parents. This kind of filial piety virtue is the foundation of great wisdom and great compassion. I once taught the Grade 3 students of Instilling Goodness Elementary School; considering it , I could say that it was the most difficult assignment in my cultivation.

In Sudan-Sahelian West Africa , where women usually have very limited rights to cultivate on their own-account , growing land scarcity and concentration are shrinking their allotments. In East Africa , where the house-property complex gave women certain kinds of well-defined rights , in terms of their role in transmitting property from fathers to sons , land registration and titling have gone exclusively to men. In Southern Africa , by contrast , the presence of very large numbers of female-headed households has put pressures of government to protect the rights of women. These 'systems ' are by no means hard and fast , and plenty of social groups in the geographic and cultural areas identified have quite different patterns of rights for women . </cultivate.v.2034><cultivate.v.2035>Trees have to be planted , and cultivated accordingly ( with good weather and sunshine ! ) ... so are some sound good moral and religious principles where a person may choose to live by..According to the apostle Paul those fruits ( of the spirit ) such as those nine aspects of love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith , meekness and temperance are to be cultivated by following Jesus ' teaching and also being a follower in Him as Lord of Life.

There is another advantage in this latter plan. The teacher can in this way teach the students , in a practical way , better methods of farming. Short talks on the principles of agriculture are worth much more to them than time spent in committing to memory the names of mountain peaks in Central Africa.

They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths " ( II Tim. 4 : 3-4 ) . The failure to listen expositionally has disastrous effects. False teachers enter the church and hinder the gospel , and ultimately , the truth is displaced by myths and falsehoods.

The lawn mower is used to chop down any existing organic material ( either a cover crop/green manure or grass/weeds ) . After the land is mowed down to a stubble , a roto-tiller can break up the soil to a desired depth for planting. In between a mowing and tilling , I have found it very helpful to use a spading fork to work the soil.

Thus , the CRP directly influences cropland conversion. As long as the program does not affect commodity prices , the land-use effects of the CRP can be largely restricted to those lands participating in the program. An ERS study of land parcels enrolled in the CRP found them to be less productive and more environmentally sensitive in terms of erosion , but not in terms of potential nutrient runoff and leaching , than average cultivated cropland and than other lands shifting out of cultivation.

This has two parts : </cultivate.v.2068><cultivate.v.2069>The provision of land to poor , vulnerable people does not provide a solution to all their problems. Families often lack the time and money to invest in their land because they need to work on a daily basis. This is particularly the case in families who have less people able to labour. The land management conditions of the resettlement sites in Banteay Meanchey require people to build a house or to cultivate the land after they receive a plot. But many poorer people found it difficult to find the resources either to build a proper house or cultivate the land . </cultivate.v.2069><cultivate.v.2070>Cosmopolitanism was an idea en route to the idea of Christendom. The main reason that Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire is not that eager Christians managed to convert everybody ( even admitting the importance of Constantine 's conversion in particular ) . Christianity assumed the place of Stoicism because , as a philosophical ethic , it was an able usurper of the older philosophy 's authority. By the late 2nd century CE , Stoic influence was crumbling in a decadent imperial administration. Christian religion gave an energetic new rationale as to why people ought to cultivate the virtues that the Stoics so cherished. Augustine would develop a theological story as to why Christianity was a natural and worthy successor to the old imperial religion in City of God. The idea of citizenship in a single world-city undergirds the medieval idea of Europe as the realm of Christendom , ruled by a single spiritual ruler ( the Pope ) . The ghettoization of Jews in Medieval Europe is a consequence of this idea. The Crusades against a threatening Islamic other ' also demonstrate the force of the cosmopolitan ideal in the imagination of Medieval Christians . </cultivate.v.2070><cultivate.v.2071>As their popularity soars , these delectable fruits can cost as high as $ 6 to $ 10 per pound in grocery stores.

Although almost every household was found to grow a minimum amount , those with the least land were found to cultivate the largest proportion of their land with coca bush [ 21 ] . The smallest landholdings , of 2-3 hectares of tillable land , were in the " Zona Roja " , where coca bush predominates [ 53 ] . Households with access to over 5 hectares of perennial crops , such as citrus , coffee , bananas or cocoa , rarely grew coca bush [ 54 ] . </cultivate.v.2073><cultivate.v.2074>The Cinque Terre are one of the most unspoilt areas of the Mediterranean and one of the most extended areas in Liguria. They are a kingdom of nature and wild scents maintained as in the past. To visit the Cinque Terre means to visit five fishermen 's villages literaly o the cliffs and surrounded by green hills; it means to know the history of whom , for centuries , has fought against a difficult landscape. The results of this millenarian struggle are the famous terraced lots of land on the coast; they are the result of the locals work in order to be able to cultivate a land which otherwise would be to steep on the coast. The fruits of this hard work are the worldwide appriciated wine and oil . </cultivate.v.2074><cultivate.v.2075>A second answer might be given : Be concentrated in all that you do all day every day.

True meditation is after all an attitude of mind and will grow out of an attitude of concentration . </cultivate.v.2075><cultivate.v.2076>The Incas of Peru were able to survive in the mountains because they learned to build terraces in the mountains in order to cultivate crop and feed themselves. It is a simple but very effective idea of soil conservation. The Incas used stones to retain and support their terraces on which they grew their crop. Well , let us spread the word; let us encourage our Haitian peasants to not only build terraces to preserve the soil and grow crop but also to plant fruit or vegetable trees to help retain the terraces instead of stones whenever possible. The terraces being flat surfaces will be less susceptible to being washed away by rain drops to the ocean. But what is more important in my opinion is the fact that the total cultivable land area in Haiti will dramatically increase. More cultivable land should mean more crop yield.

The landowner , then , will be in a position to set the terms of exchange. What limits the value of a service is never the will of the one who renders it. It is limited when the one to whom it is offered can forgo it or do it for himself or deal with others. The proletarian no longer has any of these alternatives. Formerly he could say to the landowner : If you ask of me more than the remuneration for your labor , I will cultivate the land myself , and the landowner was forced to submit. Today the landowner has this retort : There is no more open land in the country. Thus , whether value is ascribed to things or to services , the cultivator of the soil will profit from the absence of all competition; and as the landowners will be in a position to impose their terms on the tenant farmers and the farm laborers , they will , in effect , impose them on everyone . </cultivate.v.2084><cultivate.v.2085>In 1695 , Jeanne Le Ber , Jacques daughter , pronounced her vows and gave to the Notre-Dame Congregation of Montreal her share of the land that she had inherited on ile Saint-Paul.

This is a place of huge contrasts : futuristic modern cities jostling traditional seaweed-thatched villages , ancient tea terraces and wild wetlands where rare animals still survive. Each year , endangered red-crowned cranes make an epic journey along the coast between their northern breeding grounds and their winter refuge close to Shanghai. Along their route they skirt the shallow Bohai Gulf , where traditional seaside communities collect shellfish from the fertile mud and cultivate vast seaweed farms which they share with wild swans , known as 'winter angels'. Out in the gulf , rocky Shedao Island is infested with venomous snakes lying ambush for the twice-yearly influx of migrating birds , which use the island as a resting point. The gulf waters are enriched by fertile sediment from the Yellow River , boosted by agricultural fertilizers which stimulate the growth of plankton , in turn providing food for plagues of jellyfish. Each summer , armadas of fishing boats set nets to trap the jellyfish , which in China are eaten as a delicacy . </cultivate.v.2134><cultivate.v.2135>Vetches are another very valuable forage crop. Being indigenous to Britain , and not fastidious in regard to soil , they can be cultivated successfully under a great diversity of circumstances , and are well adapted for poor soils. By combining the winter and spring varieties , and making several sowings of each in its season at intervals of two or three weeks , it is practicable to have them fit for use form May till October , and thus to carry out a system of soiling by means of vetches alone. But it is usually more expedient to use them in combination with grass and clover , beginning with the first cutting of the latter in May , taking the winter vetches in June , recurring to the Italian ryegrass or clover as the second cutting is ready , and afterwards bringing the spring vetches into use. Each crop can thus be used when in its best state for cattle food , and so as gratefully to vary their dietary . </cultivate.v.2135><cultivate.v.2136>As we progress in our practice of jnana yoga , we take a step back and observe ourselves on the stage of life , playing our role , like watching a movie on a screen.

One way is to talk with students about prominent examples from history or current events that illustrate these minds. For instance , history or science teachers might discuss with students how a scientist worked diligently and thought creatively to come up with and test an important discovery. Similarly , classes might discuss examples of individuals or groups that fell short of exemplifying these minds , and the consequences of that behavior , such as cases in which violation of ethical codes lead to human harm. Such discussions will inevitably raise questions about what to do when two minds are in conflict. For example , how should we respond if a teacher or supervisor that we respect engages in conduct that is compromised in some ethical way ?

This helped reduce food costs and lessened the need to cultivate additional land to feed work animals.

The kernels are covered so tightly by the husks that they ca n't be scattered over the ground to seed. Even if an opened ear fell to the ground , the sprouts would be too close together to survive. Corn must be planted with space around each seed. It is totally dependent on man to reproduce. This constituted a puzzle to scientists searching for the origin of corn. They could not find any wild grass from which corn was developed. In the 1960 's , they discovered an earlier form of cultivated corn which had been stored in caves in Tehuacan , Mexico. They now theorize that the original wild corn plant was a smaller stalk with one ear at the top. The tassel grew directly out of this ear. There were fewer kernels on the ear , and each was covered by its own husk. These kernels were attached loosely and could easily fall off the cob and reproduce themselves. This grain probably cross pollinated with other wild grasses to produce more and larger ears on bigger plants . </cultivate.v.2189><cultivate.v.2190>The legislation in New Zealand makes it an offence to import , export , possess , supply or prescribe without authority or cultivate without a licence any part of the cannabis plant.

The rules of customary tenure do not guarantee an individual the use of a specific plot of land. Farmers are , therefore , reluctant to make investments in the land. Since the land is not " owned " by an individual , it has no mortgage value and can not be used as security against a long-term loan. One may wonder , therefore , whether this is a suitable system for a developing country like Malawi. Malawi 's economic development depends upon agriculture. With the introduction of cash crops like tobacco and cotton , this must mean changes in tenure systems so that farmers can cultivate their land continuously for many years , as opposed to the customary land tenure system. The changes must allow for investment in land and facilitate transfer of land use between individuals. This may be achieved by tenurial changes and agrarian reforms. One way of achieving this objective is by the introduction of individualized tenure . </cultivate.v.2192><cultivate.v.2193>Rotate modes of action.

Some will produce acids as by-products. That helps to lower the pH to the point that they can no longer grow , until the environment is just right for wild yeast to activate. The length of time it takes for this to happen varies . </cultivate.v.2197><cultivate.v.2198>Narrated Rafi ' ibn Khadij : The Apostle of Allah ( peace_be_upon_him ) forbade muhaqalah and muzabanah. Those who cultivate land are three : a man who has ( his own ) land and he tills it : a man who has been lent land and he tills the one lent to him; a man who employs another man to till land against gold ( dinars ) or silver ( dirhams ) . </cultivate.v.2198><cultivate.v.2199>Mawat - ( or Mewat ) So-called " dead " , unreclaimed land. It constituted about 50 to 60 of the land in Palestine. It belonged to the government. Private individuals could purchase and register this land as their own for its unreclaimed value , but it was just as easy to simply cultivate it. ( Stein , Land Question , p. 13 ) . If the land had been cultivated with permission , it would be registered , at least under the Mandate , free of charge. Communities and individuals often expanded their land land holdings " informally " by cultivating or using such land. According to the Hope-Simpson Report Mewat land was probably of considerable extent. It was defined as any land that was more than a mile and a half from a village , and was not owned by anyone. However , no systematic survey was ever done , so it was impossible to determine the precise extent of Mewat land . </cultivate.v.2199><cultivate.v.2200>Some of these expectations were fulfilled as villagers found that they could obtain additional income by finding laborers to clear and cultivate the land of the new landowners. Or they might themselves clear the trees from the plot to make charcoal for sale. In some villages like Chanika , the presence of wealthier people from the city brought services to the village ( Ngaiza 1989 : 28-42 ) . Cell leaders benefited from the land transactions because a fee was paid to them as witnesses of the transaction. Village committees gained from new village membership fees , which amounted to 600 Tsh per member ( Maulidi , interviews in Mvuti and Chanika 1989 &amp;1990 ) . It should be quickly pointed out , however , that these minimal benefits were hardly sufficient to compensate for the frustrations the villagers felt as the new landowners grew in number . </cultivate.v.2200><cultivate.v.2201>" Become a farmer.

There was no compulsion to register land for the documentation of land right. The government of Nepal did not provide any appropriate facility to make available support of land right documentation to those indigenous nationalities who were first settle in Terai and cultivate fertile land for farming. Due to the lack of Nepali Citizenship and complicated process of land registration in Nepali format in the beginning of land reform of the Nepal government has made them difficult to follow properly. The government of Nepal also ignored the difficulties of non-Nepali speaking peoples what they were facing the difficulties to register the land right document . </cultivate.v.2202><cultivate.v.2203>All species of the genus Manihot are native to the New World; in Brazil and Mexico they form distinct centers of diversity ( Nassar , 1978b ) . In their habitats their growth is normally sporadic , rarely becoming dominant in the vegetation. Due to the monoeceous or dioecious structure of the inflorescence , wild Manihot species are typically alogamous plants. However , in cultivated cassava a shift towards autogamous plants has occurred. Nassar and O'Hair ( 1985 ) explained this as consequent to monoclonal system of cultivation and the domestication history. Observations of frequent hybridization between wild species and the cultigen and between the wild species themselves suggest weak barriers in the genus ( Nassar , 1980a ) . This is probably due to the polyploid origin at the genus level . </cultivate.v.2203><cultivate.v.2204>13.

For the present at least , we dissociate our chosen object from relationships to other objects and think of it as something independent of the sensations we have of it. Minus the fivefold sensations , what could the physical object be ? is to be our first question in the meditation on the object. In one Sutra in Patanjali ' s text all this is described , and I hope we understand what it actually implies. A tremendous detachment cultivated toward the object is required not merely emotionally , but also perceptionally. I mentioned the detached observation of an object. We might have understood it to mean merely emotional detachment , but I ' m going to say now that it is not merely that. It also involves general perception itself . </cultivate.v.2205><cultivate.v.2206>Wildcrafting does not have to wait for something useful to grow in an area. We can add elements that will become productive over time. Herbs can be introduced to grow in right-of-ways; fruit or nut trees may be planted in wild areas. Any area of derelict or marginal land has the potential to grow things that are suitable for wildcrafting. While we do not necessarily wish to cultivate and farm these areas , scattering seeds of things we might wish to harvest to see if they will take advantage of a location is certainly permissible . </cultivate.v.2206><cultivate.v.2207>To prepare a seed bed first remove weeds using repeated cultivation or a herbicide.

This voluntary program relieves the pressure on farmers to sell their farms to developers by allowing them to sell their right to develop the land to the state instead. The farmers accept a deed restriction on their property permanently limiting non-agricultural uses. In return , the state pays the farmers an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the land for development purposes and the value of the deed-restricted land. Through this arrangement , the land is preserved for agricultural uses , farmers can continue to cultivate their land , and Connecticut ' s citizens derive the aesthetic and tangible benefits of a working landscape . </cultivate.v.2210><cultivate.v.2211>Domesticated animals are an important part of everyday life at Ross Farm Museum.

Unfortunately , now grasslands like this almost have disappeared everywhere and the cultivated land behind me is no longer the collective ' s grazing land. It has already become a type of state owned land. Neighboring Zuun Uul is also another village of the five in Bayan-Ulaan Gachaa. Within the border of Zuun Uul Village only , Zalaid Banner State Taxation Bureau has cultivated 7 , 000 mu ( approximately 470 hectares ) ! in 1996 and an investor named Liu Wen-fu contracted 1 , 000 mu. The same land dispute occurred in Zuun-Uul Village in 2003 as well. Recently , another conflict between villagers and contractors broke out in this village. The main reason for these conflicts is that the contractors ' cultivated lands or so-called state owned lands have aggressively expanded while the villagers ' grasslands have rapidly shrunk . </cultivate.v.2212><cultivate.v.2213>Since we arrived at this camp we have not seen another vehicle , no tourists , nor any other development of any kind.

He may not cultivate the total acreage due to idleness , want of sufficient labourers or financial constraints. He may think that limited cultivation will provide enough food to meet the demands of his family for a whole year , so he does not bother cultivating the remainder of the land.

We can cultivate a corn field as long as the cultivator can pass over the corn without damage , but we must stop as soon as use of the cultivator would break off the stalks. After the cessation of cultivation , there is a period of several weeks during which any weeds that have been missed in the cultivation can mature. All such weeds bear seeds. In addition , there are apt to be seeds -- brought by that final cultivation into a position suitable for germination -- that will germinate , and produce more seeds in the half-light of the shaded cornfield.

Though some of these sciences may rise into a deductive stage , yet the entire spirit of these branches is inductive. Induction is the genius which presides over their origin and development.

Gardening shifted its virtues from overt control , to a new sort of cultivated wilderness the park replaced the commons. The rise of nature as a moral teacher was coincident with the fall of nature under the hand of man , and thus was born the desire for cultivated wildness. It was against this backdrop that modern book illustration developed , and the romantic impulse resurfaced after the waves of mid-eighteenth century moral abstraction from an imperfect source a view of nature which few men had access to , let alone appreciation of.

M. Graham who insisted that land evaluation , surrenders and surveying be completed at once so that the non-Aboriginal soldier settlers could break land that same year. The DIA files do not fully reveal his means and methods. In an article on the surrender of land on the Bobtail Reserve in Alberta , David Lupul suggested that the threat of expropriation was used. [ 50 ] Such threats were without doubt used a year earlier when Indians unable or unwilling to cultivate who were also unwilling to surrender for such a purpose were informed that the department could appropriate and cause to be utilized for productive purposes any portions of any reserve.

Their workforce largely consists of members of their own families , which means that labour costs are lower than on large farms ( they do n't have to spend money recruiting or supervising workers ) , while the quality of the work is higher. With more labour , farmers can cultivate their land more intensively : they spend more time terracing and building irrigation systems; they sow again immediately after the harvest; they might grow several different crops in the same field . </cultivate.v.2277><cultivate.v.2278> Emmons said anyone can cultivate a more grateful approach to life , but he warns that the effort is not for the intellectually lethargic. </cultivate.v.2278><cultivate.v.2279>Padmini Karunaratne and her husband cultivate cauliflower and broccoli along with the more common vegetables in their half acre home garden.

Squanto taught the pilgrims to bury three fish and then plant the corn on top of the fish. This served as fertilizer. They would also plant beans around the corn to allow the bean plants to climb up the corn stalks for better growing.

The extent to which Lao farmers can increase agricultural production through an increase of labor-saving technology in expanding cultivated areas actually depends not critically on the availability of uncultivated land , for good surplus land is generally still available in most of the southern and central regions. In the north , land is becoming increasingly scarce as reflected in a reduction in the fallow periods. Decision about the application of technology is much more dependent on a ) the availability of labor-saving technology , and b ) whether the savings in labor costs outweigh the cost of technology in rural areas ( World Bank 1995a : 18 f ) .

However , export demand for " perfect " produce may have adverse impacts if farmers resort to using excessive quantities of pesticides.

The loss of low-cost rural labor to industrialization can sharply reduce multiple cropping and therefore the harvested area. In Japan , for example , the grain harvested area peaked at nearly 5 million hectares in 1960 largely because the country ' s industrious farmers were harvesting two crops per year. As of 2005 , Japan ' s harvested area had dropped to 2 million hectares in part because of cropland conversion to nonfarm uses , but mostly because of a steady decline in double cropping over the decades as rising wages in industry pulled workers away from agriculture. The cheap labor needed to cultivate small plots intensively has disappeared. Even a rice support price four times the world market level could not keep enough workers in agriculture to support extensive multicropping. 9 </cultivate.v.2291><cultivate.v.2292>Gardening the Community Inc. is a youth-centered , community based , urban agriculture program in Springfield , MA.

At genome scale , genetic markers have shown strong homogeneity between the maize populations within the same village and , more surprisingly , between distant villages. This means that the local varieties possess a common genetic base. The diversity observed in characters of direct pertinence to farmers would consequently be the result of the latter 's personal decisions on seed selection , which they make before each crop cycle . </cultivate.v.2293><cultivate.v.2294>Thus , land taken away from landlords was re-distributed among erstwhile tenants who were not even required to cultivate the land given to them leave alone till it themselves.

In that case , the wild plants are not cultivated nor domesticated but made available by the maintenance of a particular succession stage of the surrounding ecosystem.

Therefore a farmer has to cultivate 14 acres of land to obtain the minimum wage without benefits. There are not many farmers who cultivate this amount of land , and although the farmers with these small acreages have a lot of time on their hands , often they can not get other forms of employment to augment their income. We all know that $ 35 , 000 per month is insufficient for one to subsist on and sustain a family; maybe $ 75 , 000 per month would be , since this is $ 900 , 000 per year.

The available evidence indicates that more and more farmers are relying on hired wage labour to perform essential farm tasks. On the other hand , many more farmers are unable to afford high cash wages , and therefore spend longer hours in cultivating their food crops. Less time is thus available for planting and tending forest tree crops from which they receive no direct income. Increased capital resources of farmers would enable them to recruit the hired wage labour needed to effectively cultivate an optimum farm size under the taungya system.

Pre-Columbian figures estimate a density of 4.0 - 5.5 individuals/square mile ( i.e. , 640 acres ) in eastern Massachusetts , including Cape Cod. A relatively large population , a lack of soil improvement efforts , and a relative dependence on agriculture , probably led to the creation of a substantial amount of open land and early-successional habitat. Cleared land estimates range from 2-5 - approximately 25 , 000 - 62 , 500 acres - in eastern Massachusetts.

But he will not cultivate this land , and we want to cultivate it; that is all. [ 18 ] Here was an opportunity to bring under cultivation land that was hindering the development of the country , said Member of Parliament T. M. Tweedie , who spoke in support of the measure. He contended that there were hundreds of thousands of acres of the best agricultural lands in the Dominion in the Indian reserves in Manitoba , Saskatchewan , and Alberta , withheld from agricultural development. Even if every Indian on every reserve worked night and day , according to Tweedie , it would be impossible for him to cultivate more than a small fraction of these lands.

From New Year 's resolutions to Millennium revolutions , the topic of procrastination is an apt platform for exploring -- whether the changing of a negative habit or the building of a new paradigm. Not only is procrastination a barrier to taking action but parallels abound between repetitive , non-conscious habitual processing and avoidance or putting things off as a defensive maneuver. Procrastination is a method for shutting down awareness of anxious or aggressive thoughts or of scared and shameful feelings.

Still others resulted from some people reneging on previous agreements on the rights allowed while others resulted from instances where parents died without clarifying to their children the kind of rights they had had , especially given that the indigenous tenure allowed coexistence of tree and land rights in the same holding. Disputes were common in instances where pioneer occupants acquired land to cultivate or to grow tree crops but lent out some sections or fragments to other families or even allowed borrowers to cultivate food crops under their trees on the understanding that the borrowers acknowledged having nothing more than user rights .

Documenting such a process , to include the reasons why a significant proportion of households continue not to grow drug crops in areas where they are cultivated intensively by the majority of farmers , could provide the framework in which to further our understanding of the role of social costs and economic profitability in household decision-making in source areas . </cultivate.v.2324><cultivate.v.2325>The Defendant has pleaded that he jointly leased the land with his brother , Defendant No.2 ( who has been put out of cause ) .

But it is usually more expedient to use them in combination with grass and clover , beginning with the first cutting of the latter in May , taking the winter vetches in June , recurring to the Italian ryegrass or clover as the second cutting is ready , and afterwards bringing the spring vetches into use.

In addition , planting these monoculture crops depletes nutrients in the soil , as does the local practice of burning crop residues , which also contributes to soil erosion.

( This process was also occurring in the animal kingdom. Most of the animals that surround human lifestyles are domesticated from their wild cousins : cows , dogs , chickens , cats , turkeys , etc. ) Desirable traits in plants often include greater and more consistent size , sweeter , more pronounced taste , smaller or no seeds , brighter colors.

In a report presented by the government of The Gambia , Vision 2020 ( The Gambia 1996b ) , reforming the tenure system is at focus , but no concrete efforts were presented. The question can be raised whether such reforms would help removing the fixed land scarcity. Lawry ( 1994 ) , claims that there is a need for tenure reforms in general , but such reforms can not alone result in a sustainable resource management. The capital and labour investments of clearing new land is high. Most of the farmers are not economically viable to make such investments.

Some members of these households migrate to towns or cities on either a rotational or a long-term basis.

Wheat is the main crop of Rabi season , while rice , maize , sugarcane and cotton are considered the major crops of Kharif. Mono cropping , sequence cropping , mixed cropping , inter-cropping and relay cropping systems are practiced by growers ( farmers ) , especially those with small holdings , to maximise crop production per unit area. The cropping pattern is largely determined by water availability and the climatic conditions as adaptation of crops. However , present situation of irrigation water is widely being reported daily through TV , Radio as well as Print media.

However , it occurs that landowners , who faced a series of failed crop years , are forced to raise money by selling their land.

It is important to note that farms in general did not specialize either in lowland or in upland production but undertook both to intensify production in the traditional wet-rice area and take up commercial dry-land cultivation. Consequently , the acreage per farm increased considerably , resulting in pronounced labour peaks which could hardly be managed by the family labour force alone and by traditional farming techniques. For example , a typical family of the area , having cultivated 1.5 ha of wet rice formerly , will now cultivate an additional irrigated second crop ( tobacco , vegetables , groundnuts , or mung bean ) in the dry season and , in the scarp area , grow about 8 ha of maize normally followed by about 2 ha of mung beans as a catch crop . </cultivate.v.2440><cultivate.v.2441>Cultivators , who form the bulk of the rural poor in developing countries , are directly engaged in producing and managing crops and livestock. Since these households can not sustain themselves on the small parcels of land they own or cultivate , they provide labor to others for both farm and nonfarm activities inside and outside their villages. Some members of these households migrate to towns or cities on either a rotational or a long-term basis. In many countries , both small landowners and tenants are under increasing pressure to get out of the agriculture sector altogether. Underlying this process of " depeasantization " are market forces and policies affecting landholdings , rents , prices , credit , inputs , and public investment in social and physical infrastructure . </cultivate.v.2441><cultivate.v.2442>About 1.49 million internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) remain in camps or are in transit back to their homes in northern Uganda. Humanitarian conditions in the region remain deplorable , as the IDPs lack adequate access to health , shelter , water and sanitation facilities , and many continue to suffer widespread high levels of food insecurity as they are unable to meet a major proportion of their food needs due to inadequate access to land and inputs to cultivate enough food over numerous recurrent seasons. The IDPs depend on food aid provided by the World Food Programme ( WFP ) for as much as fifty percent of their needs. Although the IDPs were able to increase their access to agricultural land to cultivate crops in the first season this year ( April to June ) , a delayed onset of the rains in April and May and sporadic rains throughout the season caused harvests to falter in July , hampering initial improvement in their food production and food security . </cultivate.v.2442><cultivate.v.2443>Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce.

Weedy P. lunatus individuals have also been documented in the region and may be the product of gene flow between wild and domesticated types ( Ballesteros , 1999; Debouck , 1979; Mart nez-Castillo et al. , 2004 ) . For the purposes of the present study weedy individuals are defined as wild plants growing within cultivated P. lunatus areasthese are not sown or harvested because their seeds are inedibleand have an intermediate seed size between ones from wild plants and landraces.

It is a sustainable fruitful tree. They are glowing and we also replant the mango tree all year round since main purpose of mango tree is plant for fruit. They glow and cultivate very easy in a humid and moisture temperature in Thailand. Mango tree can give fruits when their age is around 5 -20 years. However , when mango tree get older , they are no longer give fruits or give less fruits , we therefore we take them down to make use of their trunks. Then we replant to cultivate their fruits again.

Savvy business instincts have encouraged them to take risks in farming , becoming pioneers in the planting of new crops. The first of the Young family to emigrate from upstate New York to California came for the Gold Rush. Peter Young , grandfather of Robert Young , settled on a 206-acre ranch southeast of Geyserville , California in 1858.

Because of fragmentation resulting from inheritance , the farms became smaller and smaller. The fact that land could be used as collateral made it possible to borrow money to pay taxes in the case of crop failures. But , in that way , more and more farms passed into the hbands of moneylenders , often better off cultivatorsin the village. In the course of time , these ceased to cultivate their land themselves and sub leased it instead. Finally , the ryotwari region was no longer a self cultivator region.

By petit bourgeoisie I mean those who derive unearned income by giving their land to others for cultivation because they are in economic difficulty. If landless peasants acquired a plot of one acre , they would certainly get some psychic satisfaction , but when they failed to earn anything after cultivating the land , they would definitely become disheartened. It would require all their time , energy and money to cultivate one acre of land productively because the land would be too small to utilize modern agricultural techniques. The amount of produce they would get in return would not be enough to maintain their families. They would have to lease a portion of the land and try to earn their income through other methods.

The existing law banning tenancy is fuelled by the dogma that all tenancy is exploitation. It prevents the needed re-allocation of resources and hastens the alienation of agricultural land.

In fact , by statute , road lines may become conclusively fixed in ten years; and there is no particular time that shall be required to conclude private owners , where it appears that they have accepted a particular line as their boundary , and all concerned have cultivated and claimed up to it. Public policy requires that such lines be not lightly disturbed , or disturbed at all after the lapse of considerable time.

The soil of the fields was exhausted; monocultures destroyed the countryside; ammonia clouds from liquid manure poured over the fields were transformed into acid rain.

First , the majority of young potential farmers in rural areas find rural life dull and uninteresting. They are migrating to urban centres , where life is less arduous and monotonous , in search of jobs. Rural-urban migration on a large scale has been encouraged by the worsening rural-urban terms of trade ( FAO 1980 ) . Thus , the majority of farmers participating in taungya in the tropics are people aged 40 years and over ( Kio and Bada 1981 ) . A high proportion of such farmers tend to be under-nourished and in a poor state of health , so their productivity is low ( Enabor 1978 ) . Some unemployed farmers are willing but unable to participate in taungya because they lack the necessary inputs to cultivate the land allocated to them in forest reserves. The youth must be retained in the rural areas by the creation of more attractive living conditions. To some extent , the establishment of departmental taungya schemes based on integrated forest villages provided with all the basic social amenities has enhanced participation of younger farmers in taungya systems ( Enabor and Adeyoju 1975 ) , </cultivate.v.2503><cultivate.v.2504>( a ) Information received is that in Minhla Township , Pegu Division , about 20000 acres of paddy fields and fisheries from seventeen villages of the eastern zone cultivated and operated by cultivators from generation to generation was taken over and given to the private enterprise known as Thein Shwe Company.

In some cases , farming subsidies contributed to the destruction of this sensitive habitat. In the United States , over 80 percent of natural wetlands were converted to agricultural use ( USEPA 1988 : 6 ) . Since the Canadian Wheat Board Act used to determine grain delivery quotas based on the total area seeded or left fallow , farmers were encouraged to cultivate marginal land rather than leave it in its natural state ( Environment Canada 1991c : [ 26 ] 6 ) . In addition , the Maritime Marshland Rehabilitation Act ( 1943 ) was designed to discourage reversion of arable land to original wetland coverage ( Environment Canada 1991c : [ 20 ] 6 ) . This trend now seems to be reversing , however , as recent studies show that wetland loss from agricultural conversion has dropped sharply ( Tolman 1994 ) . </cultivate.v.2506><cultivate.v.2507>If perfect disciples those with pure mind and intention having taken refuge then follow their guru correctly , he will lead them to enlightenment.

The Lake was fed by local mountain runoff but eventually dried up as the climate began to change into hotter , drier weather. Because the lake had no outlet , minerals and salts accumulated and remained when the lake dried up. The surrounding desert land was irrigated with water from the Colorado River by early pioneers. In 1902 , a canal was opened on the California side of the Colorado River , which ran through Mexico , before turning north and bringing water to the Imperial Valley.

The peoples of these largely developing countries rely on the land for their food and livelihood. However , the presence of mines in agricultural fields renders large tracts of fertile soil unusable. Farmers and peasants are unable to safely cultivate their land and livestock feeding off the land are frequently killed by mines , constituting grave economic losses for their owners. These cattle , goats , and other farm animals are often villagers ' only possessions. Mine contamination causes local and national economies to suffer and entire populations to become dependent on external food aid and other forms of international assistance. Mines destroy national infrastructures and impede economic development and reconstruction efforts. Transportation networks , power lines , and water resources are damaged and inaccessible. The production and distribution of fundamental goods and services is disrupted. Tourism markets , an important source of income in many countries , suffer greatly.

After divorce , a woman could claim up to half of the land they cultivated together. In practice , this is not always the case , but he contends that overall the practice of granting land to divorcees is widespread. An auxiliary effect of this is that women are much more secure in marriage. Before the revolution , rates of divorce were very high; after divorce women could only take their movable property and land that they brought with them to the marriage. Now most peasant 's perceive that divorce is much less common as " divorce could entail a disastrous division of land resources that would impoverish both resultant households " ( ibid , 23 ) .

For dozens of years they had desired the land and in 1917 they took it , long before the Soviet power was established. If Bolshevism marched with the peasants in their seizure of the pomeshchiks ' lands , it was only in order to defeat the agrarian bourgeoisie. But this in no way indicated that the future Communist power had the intention of furnishing the peasants land. On the contrary. The ideal of this power is the organization of a single agricultural economy belonging altogether to the same lord , the State.

The growing population and new markets created in the towns have caused an increase in land being farmed and so there is less grazing land.

Farmers have increased the number of animals they own as an insurance against drought , as a form of investment for their money from selling cash crops , and because some bought animals cheaply during the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s.

Because the new rulers did not have the agricultural knowledge necessary to cultivate the land they had seized , they took formal possession of the land and categorised it as miri , allowing the original owners to retain tasarruf possession. As time passed , tasarruf holders benefited from reduced restrictions on their ability to sell or otherwise profit from the land they possessed. In practice , the government ' s control over miri land became limited to a right to tax or conscript labour.5 Should the possessor decide to convert the land to fee simple or sells the property , however , then modest payments to the government may be required. Another way to conceptualise these rights is to make an analogy with the Western legal concept of usufruct , which presents a similar form and privileges . </cultivate.v.2610><cultivate.v.2611>Leguminous. Soil for peas , vetch and beans that was well ploughed in autumn may be prepared only by a heavy harrow in spring. If the soil is badly ploughed , it should be cultivated by the cultivator combined with medium heavy harrow. More humid soils are first cultivated to a depth of 6-10 cm and after that to 10-12 cm. To break up soil too much is not useful especially in heavier soils , because the germinating crop receives less air then. Medium heavy and heavy soils have to be harrowed 2-3 times. In medium heavy soil the optimal depth for sowing of pea seeds is 4-6 , in heavy 4-5 , in lighter 9-10 cm. In heavier loam soils vetch is sown at 3-4 , in lighter loam at 4-5 and in sandy loam at 5-6 cm. Beans sowing depth is 5-8 in heavier soils and 6-8 cm in lighter soils.

But when one considers that 44 percent of the households embrace 6-9 people , the beginnings of land pressure can not be denied if these households only cultivate 1.4 hectares of dry land on average ( Lao PDR 199_b : 1 ) . </cultivate.v.2630><cultivate.v.2631>Our country ( China ) ' s grassland law has provisions to prohibit grassland from being cultivated.

Although to some extent black cherries taste bitter , they are edible and find widespread use in jelly and wine production and also to add essence to brandy. When rum or brandy is flavored with black cherry it is known as ' cherry bounce ' . While all species of the wildlife consume cherries , the songbirds in particular savor them. In fact , herbivores like rabbits and deer like to thrive on black cherry saplings and plantlets. Hence , where ever there the population of rabbits and deer are in large numbers , it often becomes difficult to cultivate black cherries as they often prove to be detrimental for the growth of the plant. The wood of black cherries is reddish brown in color and closely crumbed , but solid beyond doubt. Black cherry wood is especially used to manufacture furniture , thin coverings , handles of tools and is among the best timber available for cabinets . </cultivate.v.2632><cultivate.v.2633>The cattail s every part has uses.

The arable land was scattered throughout the country , primarily in valleys along rivers and other water sources. The total irrigable area was about 5.3 million hectares , of which half was irrigated annually while the other half remained fallow. Only 1.4 million hectares of the land irrigated in sequence had sufficient water throughout the year to allow double cropping. Before 1978 the irrigated land area provided Afghanistan with 85 percent of all food and industrial crops produced. Another 1.4 million hectares of cultivated rain-fed land supplemented the irrigated areas. Thus , about 4 million hectares of land were cultivated annually before 1978 by 1.2 million farm families . </cultivate.v.2636><cultivate.v.2637>Cultivation Ranchers who are managing their native grasslands for livestock grazing have a tough choices to make.

To improve farming , he chose the best farmer from each village and handed those farmers the land. In return he asked the chosen farmers to improve the farming , provide security for that village and make the village prosperous and pay the kingdom on fixed cash base ( BANDHI AVAK ) . This way the tradition of giving part of the crop to the kingdom was abolished and a permanent propriety of the land was granted. Whoever had the propriety of the land were called PATEDAR which changed to KANBI PATIDAR and then became PATEL PATIDAR. This way once again the PATEL PATIDAR became the owners of each village. From then on the Patel Patidar have maintained themselves as Patidar and have cultivated land by hiring farm labour.

For instance , wild ginseng roots are 5-10 times more valuable than roots produced by artificial propagation. The reason is primarily cultural , as the Chinese community , which is the largest consumer group of wild ginseng , believes that the similarity in appearance of gnarled wild roots to the human body symbolizes the vitality and potency of the root. Cultivated roots lack the characteristic shape of wild roots and are therefore not as highly coveted by consumers ( Robbins 1998 ) .

We observed primarily hardneck garlic in the wild , but some softneck plants also occurred.

Nevertheless , the term wild-food ' is used in this article to describe all plant resources , which are harvested or collected for the purpose of human consumption outside agricultural areas in forests , savannah and other bush land areas. Wild-foods are incorporated into the normal livelihood strategies of many rural people , be they pastoralists , shifting cultivators , continuous croppers or hunter-gatherers ( Bell , 1995 ) . Wild-food is usually considered as an additional diet to farmers ' daily food consumption pattern , generally based on their crop harvest , domestic livestock products and food purchases on local markets.

In part , the motivations are economic. Historically isolated from commodity markets , peasants had to cultivate a range of crops in order to fulfill their various subsistence needs. While some varieties of maize are better suited for tortillas , others make better quality tamales , still others are used to make various specialty dishes. Some varieties have short growing times , while others have a later harvest. Growing various types of maize also enables farmers to hedge against the risk that a particular variety will perform poorly in a given year . </cultivate.v.2771><cultivate.v.2772>The most important limitation of the taungya system is the lack of adequate inputs of land , labour , and capital.

In practice , only parts of the forest estate will be effectively available for taungya. With time the problem of land hunger is bound to surface as the population of taungya-dependent communities expands. Where the physical availability of land for taungya is not limiting , the difficulty of transportation would still proscribe the area that farmers can effectively cultivate . </cultivate.v.2772><cultivate.v.2773>We encourage users at all levels to cultivate their knowledge , skill and take advantage of the tools necessary to grasp the full range of our software capabilities.

Sugar mill representatives will visit the plots regularly to advise farmers on appropriate sequencing of these events and appropriate cultivation practices. The sugar mill will be responsible for harvesting the canes to suit their specifications , and transporting it to the mills to maintain the necessary regular volume of cane flow to the factory.

They lived in groups of 20 -30 , and spent most of their time hunting and gathering. In these groups , work was divided between men and women , with the men hunting game animals , and women gathering fruits , berries , and other edibles. These early peoples developed simple tools such as , spears and axes made from bone , wood , and stone. Human beings lived in this manner from earliest times until about 10 , 000 BCE , when they started to cultivate crops and domesticate animals.

When the last glaciers retreated from Ireland the first trees to rise again were those tolerant of cold conditions - birch , willow and juniper. They were followed by species less tolerant of cold. Broadleaved forests of oak , elm , alder and ash covered the lowlands. Native pines ( such as Scots pine ) rose in the highlands and in the poorer soil of the west.

Another influx of city dwellers came with the Nguvu Kazi campaign in the early 1980s to repatriate people without work permits into the countryside where they were to engage in " productive work. " The two Bunju villages , Bunju A and Bunju B , were one of the locations chosen to accommodate about 300 of these so-called " loiterers. " They were given plots of land which had been uncultivated and were promised support to build houses. The newcomers had no previous acquaintance with the area , nor had they themselves chosen to come there. At the time of this study only one of those had established a household and was said to have remained in the village , while the rest of the individuals returned to the city. With similar results in other relocation efforts , the City Council soon gave up its resettlement campaign to turn urbanites into land tillers although more resources were invested in some villages rather than others . </cultivate.v.2795><cultivate.v.2796>Furthermore , they demand bundles of attributes and since different varieties provide these attributes in different amounts farmers are obliged to grow combinations of varieties simultaneously. That is to say , maintaining genetic diversity in cultivated crops is critical for stabilized production and for further minimizing risks arising due to unpredictable environmental conditions. Maintaining on-farm genetic diversity ensures food supply throughout the year since different species mature at different times and provide a greater variety of foodstuffs. Farmers in the enset-coffee culture depend on the diversity of the varieties and crops they grow for their own consumption. Yields from the traditional crops are not very high , but they are relatively stable compared to modern varieties. So , traditional crop varieties have been able to support a high density of population without suffering food crisis or famine in the enset-coffee ecology compared to the highland cereal farming system in northern Ethiopia which does not produce any coffee . </cultivate.v.2796><cultivate.v.2797>Fulani and other pastoralists have been settling and starting to cultivate over long periods in Burkina Faso , including the relative favoured areas of the south and centre which they formally visited as dry season refuges.

Agricultural production has hovered steadily around 24 million tons since 1992. [ 42 ] While production dipped in 1996 , this slump is likely to be temporary. In addition , only about two-thirds of Michigan ' s farmland is harvested. The rest is laid fallow or left as open land. Thus , more land could be brought " on-line " to boost production , if needed. Even if agricultural production could not keep pace , Michigan could still trade products from its other major industries such as automobiles for food from other states who specialize in agricultural production ( see box on page 21 ) . </cultivate.v.2801><cultivate.v.2802>Others have different opinions on indica and japonica origins of cultivated rice; e.g.s , ( a ) both are monogenetic ( monophyletic ); i.e. , common wild rice and human habitation differ due to diverse climate and environment at different latitudes and elevations. Common wild rice does not differentiate into indica and japonica ( Gang Yanyi , 1988 ) ( 4 ); ( 2 ) both are genetically independent , indica from India ( Second , G. 1982 ) ( 5 ) , japonica from China. But , isoenzyme and molecular genetics of Chinese perennial rice shows common wild rice has indica and japonica differentiation , but it is tiny and elementary compared to cultivated rice ( Wang Xiangkun et al. , 1994 ) ( 6 ) .

This can be attributed to the mode of evolution of the species and modifications of the allogamy system of the plant ( Nassar and O'Hair , 1985 ) . Lost genes can be restored to the gene pool of the cultigen by interspecific hybridization with wild relatives which possess these genes ( Nassar et al. , 1986 ) . Wild species of cultivated crops have been frequently used as an important source of genetic diversity and have been employed effectively in a variety of breeding programs. Controlled introgression of genes could alleviate stress problems in cassava in view of the availability of wild relatives which exhibit diversity in adaptation and attributes ( Nassar , 1985 ) . There are interspecific barriers to hybridization ( Nassar et al. , 1986 ) , but these can be broken by the use of a diversity of pollinator gametes . </cultivate.v.2807><cultivate.v.2808>Second , the government helped the farmers to grow more food and increase further their income. Irrigation systems were built so that they would have continuous flow of water especially for their rice farms.

Production loans , fertilizers and pesticides were made available to increase yield. Farm machineries were invented to make it easier to cultivate the land , weed , and harvest the produce. Warehouses and farm to market roads were built to facilitate stocking and marketing of produce.

First , if surplus land were distributed among landless people , no one would get more than an acre of land at the most.

A sizeable portion of the land would be wasted in demarcating boundary lines , so it would be impossible to increase productivity. Increased productivity is the most important agricultural requirement in India today. Besides this , if land were distributed in this way , land would be further subdivided with the increase in the population , further aggravating the problem . </cultivate.v.2823><cultivate.v.2824>There are a number of ways for extending the school term.

Frequently parents who can not pay in cash can let the teacher have eggs , chick-ens , butter , sweet potatoes , corn or some other kind of produce which will help to supply the teacher with food. Another plan is for each farmer to set aside a portion of land and give all that is raised upon it to the school. Still another plane and one that is being successfully carried out in at least one place; and one that I think much of , is for the teacher to secure , either by renting or purchase , a small tract of land -say from two to five acres-and let the children cultivate this land while they are attending school.

Therefore , relatively small numbers of garlic clones , perhaps numbering only a few thousand , have been in the hands of growers around the world through most of history. We conjecture that these clones represent the cumulative array of garlic diversity resulting from sexual reproduction in the wild which has been disseminated from its center of origin throughout history and then been able to successfully produce a crop in the hands of garlic growers around the world today. Superimposed upon the variation resulting from sexual reproduction of garlic in the wild , we can also expect to find variation due to mutations that accumulated throughout the history of cultivation of the crop . </cultivate.v.2856><cultivate.v.2857>The responsibility of the government does not end with such a comprehensive compensation package.

The railroad companies , seeking to increase the amount of traffic they carried , actively promoted economic diversification in agriculture themselves. Companies encouraged people to come to Arkansas from the Midwest to develop lands in the Grand Prairie to be used for forage crops , such as hay , rather than for cotton. Many of the new farmers were from Europe and included Bohemians , Germans , Russians , Poles , and Slovaks. The communities that they settled , such as Stuttgart ( Arkansas County ) and Slovaktown ( Prairie County ) , reflected their national origins. The railroad companies also promoted fruit growing and even established experimental farms where local farmers could learn how to cultivate new crops.

Through a process that economists call " externalization , " society as a whole foots a good part of the bill. " Externalization " will continue in the future , because one day the bill for environmental damage will have to be paid. It is already present in the form of taxes which citizens pay to subsidize farmers. Most of this aid is allocated depending on production volumes and cultivated surface areas , and benefits farms that are the best suited to agro-industry; the rest are gradually sidelined. The major social cost results from the ongoing concentration of land , which , according to Rolf K nnemann of the NGO Foodfirst Information and Action Network , bears all the hallmarks of a " new feudalism.

Increased production takes the pressure off small-scale farmers to use their land ever more intensively. This reduces the chance of the land being misused or the need to cultivate marginal land.

Before cultivation , the land was terraced sand dunes which looked like a desert strewn with bushes and thickets , always moving around whenever the waves hit. But this natural condition can be managed by the farmers co-operating , flattening the land and removing the undergrowth , making sure to leave one row of sand dunes between the ocean and the cultivated land . </cultivate.v.2882><cultivate.v.2883>Smaller-scale peasant farmers have more problems to achieve timely cultivation. These farmers understand that the more land they cultivate , the greater the area they have to weed. Weeding can be very arduous and needs to be done with speed. Such farm families normally possess a Sine Hoe plow and tine cultivator , a Super Eco seeder and a pair of work oxen. Some have groundnut lifters. Groundnuts are normally harvested , processed , bagged and sold by male members of farm families.

For a few years after Athabasca Landing became a village ( 1905 ) , it was easy to find an empty and potentially farmable quarter section in the surrounding area. By the beginning of World War I , almost all of the good farmland was taken and much of the inferior land within a 15-mile radius of the Landing had been filed upon. The crucial years for the homesteading boom were 1909-14. Between these years , at least 1500 settlers and their families , a population of perhaps 5000 , moved into the Athabasca area. Very few settlers proved their land to be cultivated in the required three years. Most took at least four years. Some took up to six years if they had to clear woodland. Approximately 56 per cent of those who filed for a homestead gave up due to the difficulty of clearing the land . </cultivate.v.2886><cultivate.v.2887>Help three frontier towns build and cultivate their Wild West influence.

Especially troublesome competitive consumers are arthropods ( primarily insects ) and pathogenic microorganisms , but even vertebrate animals often feast on cultivated fields. Weeds , too , are a major problem , competing with crop plants for space and nutrients. Crop predation is especially acute under tropical conditions , and many agriculturists believe that it is more the cause for the deterioration of productivity often seen on farmland in the tropics than is soil depletion. The principal tactics for controlling pests have been the selection of resistant cultivars , the utilization of cultural controls ( such as rotational cropping , cultivation , timing of planting , and fallowing ) , and the institution of biological controls ( introducing predators or competitors of the pests ) . Only recently has the application of pesticides become commonplace , and only in advanced agricultural economies . </cultivate.v.2888><cultivate.v.2889>6.

Many people have land of their own in the rural areas , either where their families are , or where they inherited land.

Once they have the knowledge of how to cultivate their land , they can move back home. Unfortunately , some of them have no houses back on their land either , and can not afford to build , so they still wait in the towns. It is a slow process , but those who are able to move back are encouraged to go. It is better for them to live as agriculturalists on their own land than to live in slums , sometimes even eking out a living in prostitution.

" From then on the small farmers would not be able to acquire any land of their own and thus the monopoly began.

Apples are likely from Asia , where various species are native. We do not know how much of a connection the wild-growing apples have with previous cycles of cultivation , but they are , without question , examples of cultivated apples that have run wild. The same is likely true for many " wild " relatives of cereal grains. At my home in Vermont , we have three apple trees and two pear trees on our land.

The settlement of Ofra was built on the private land of residents of Silwad and today there is a ring road around the settlement , partly fenced , with assault dogs , surrounding Palestinian land and preventing its owners from accessing it.

Their average maize area is quite large , 3.8 ha in both seasons , but the area they crop in beans is the same as that of farmers in other groups. Rice is a difficult crop for hillside environments , requiring relatively good land and careful weeding , but it is grown by almost 90 of ranchers; other annual crops ( mainly chilies ) and tree crops are also much more common among ranchers than among other farmers. This crop-production profile reflects the capacity of ranchers to muster the land , labour , and financial resources needed to cultivate a wide range of crops. It also underlines the mixed-farm nature of livelihood strategies among households of this group; these ranchers never abandon agriculture altogether but continue to rely on a range of activities and land uses for their livelihood. This finding does not conform to the narrowly defined logic of enterprise development that implies that larger farms specialize and smaller farms maintain diversified production strategies. One possible explanation for this is that the management and supervision costs of diversified strategies remain small for even larger farms in northern Honduras . </cultivate.v.2978><cultivate.v.2979>48. An interesting development took place when new immigrants , mostly Oriental , traditionally engaged in monetary transactions and trade , did not take up agricultural pursuits willingly. They were not willing to be farmers returning to the land as Zionist ideology would have them do. They turned to their traditional occupations and leased the land allotted to them to Arab farmers to cultivate it for share of the crop or rent. The Arab farmers , who were expelled from their land but remained in Israel , were very willing to cultivate this land , which frequently was their own , by renting it or sharing its crops. Thus the Agricultural Settlement ( Restriction on the use of Agricultural Land and Water ) Law of 1967 was passed to prevent this practice.

The JNF erected guard stations in the middle of its own parcels of land that were scattered among Arab private land. The JNF cultivated its land and physically demonstrated no intention to relinquish these small islands of parcels wedged inbetween Arab owned property. In this way the JNF was able to 'persuade ' the Arabs that they would never be able to possess these lands and for 'their own sake , ' it was worthwile to exchange land . </cultivate.v.2980><cultivate.v.2981>Recruit the Best : The gains to be achieved through the leveraging of professional intellect are so great , that even a few top-flight professionals can deliver momentous success.

The previous owner could reclaim the land by payment of the unimproved value , or if the owner failed to do so , others could buy the lease to this land. Miri land and Mahlul land were never bought outright , but were rather leased to tenants who " owned " only the rights to cultivate the land and sell the crops , paying a " tithe " that consisted of 10 of the gross crop plus an additional 2.63 In 1921 , there were about 87 , 233 dunams of Mahlul lands in Palestine out of over 26 million. However , since the ordinance that should have required continuous cultivation of the land was not enforced , this number did not represent the true amount of uncultivated land that should have reverted to the state.

This was achieved by giving the peasants security in the tenure of his land and allowing freedom in the disposing of his surpluses. The power of the profit incentive was brought back in that the harder the peasant worked , the more grain he could produce to exchange for consumer products. War Communism destroyed any sense of incentive by fixing the tenure and grain requisition. In the mean time , it also promoted insecurity , since collectivilization of farm land was a goal of communism. The NEP reversed the policies of War Communism. It gave the peasants two things which they value the most : the security of their land by temporarily delay the collectivilization of farms , and the right to cultivate the land and dispose their surpluses in any form they see fit by implementing the tax in kind and legalizing private market. The implementing of the NEP therefore released the tension between the peasantry and the government , as well as drastically increased the production of food stuffs . </cultivate.v.2985><cultivate.v.2986>Jane leased a lot of land and started her business of growing plants and vegetables.

Most evidence of genetic erosion of plant genetic resources is from developed countries and from the relatively high-productivity areas of developing countries where the " green revolution " modern varieties were most successfully introduced. In more marginal areas , there is less clarity although the extent of genetic erosion is almost certainly less , in part because of the limited diffusion of modern agriculture in these areas.

With the rapid rise of mechanization in the late 19th and 20th centuries , particularly in the form of the tractor , farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible. These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States , Argentina , Israel , Germany , and a few other nations to output volumes of high-quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit. The Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints. In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity , the substitution of labor for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides , water pollution , and farm subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture , resulting in the organic movement . </cultivate.v.3002><cultivate.v.3003>As in all societies , the history of rural America is the history of agriculture. From 1785 through 1935 , when all federal lands were withdrawn from settlement , the states or the federal government offered land from $ 1 to $ 2 per acre. Indeed , the Homestead Act of 1862 offered 160 acres of federal land in the American Midwest for only a $ 10 filing fee and an agreement to cultivate the land for five years. Although crop production increased dramatically as the Great Plains were settled , the abundance of cheap land offered little incentive to cultivate the land intensively. Consequently , apart from fluctuations related to weather , crop yields not surprisingly remained remarkably stable. National average yields for corn were roughly twenty-five bushels per acre from the Civil War to around 1940. Wheat yields during the same three-quarters of a century seldom exceeded fifteen bushels per acre . </cultivate.v.3003><cultivate.v.3004>Mount Kenya is pockmarked with marijuana plantations.

Summer internships are an excellent avenue for students wanting to expand their knowledge in a field and the industry that surrounds it. Internships through the OSU Agronomy Club are helping students cultivate their knowledge and gain valuable experience prior to entering a specific field of employment. Because the OSU Agronomy Club is composed of students from fifteen to twenty different majors and from four to six departments with the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources , the foci of our internships vary greatly. This diversity in our internships helps our students cultivate knowledge through sharing summer experiences with one another. Traditional internships with crop consulting , pesticide development , and plant genetic companies are still available to our students , however , recent internship opportunities include pecan orchard management and land renovation/brush management. The OSU Agronomy Club internship program is valuable to our students ' education by helping them cultivate their knowledge of the agricultural industry while helping to solve real-life problems . </cultivate.v.3023><cultivate.v.3024>Gardening is a living poem , a collaboration between the spirit of a place and the intervening human , who must respect the spirit of the place.

But all is not well on the pesticide front these days. In addition to newly found hazards to health , the tremendous amounts of pesticides that have been used in some areas have tended to alter ecosystems. Especially with insects , but also to some extent with pathogens and weeds , resistance quickly builds up in the pest so that heavier doses of more toxic chemicals are called for. Eventually the cropping system becomes overly dependent upon pesticides , which become less and less functional and more and more harmful to the environment. Cotton growing is a notorious case; the crop as generally cultivated in the United States requires innumerable treatments. With public sentiment turning against the extravagant use of pesticides , integrated pest management ( IPM ) is gaining favor. The idea , sensible in principle , is to utilize cultural and natural controls to the greatest extent practicable , reserving pesticides only for emergencies and especially devastating invasions . </cultivate.v.3035><cultivate.v.3036>The government has made empty promises to the people that it will provide them with social services and food and cultivate for them land.

Those families are living in difficult conditions for the sake of guarding their land from being confiscated or seized by the Israeli army. The Israeli government benefits from an old law issued in 1884 during the Ottoman period , which the government utilizes as a tool for land grab , and a right to declare the land as a state land in case the land is not used by the owner.

Well , whenever your at school , if you see someone needing help , take the time and help them out , or maybe you could share your lunch with someone. If you just do the little things by being kind , people will begin to take notice. They 'll begin to recognize your selflessness ( not selfishness ) , and maybe want to know why you 're always so kind. Who knows , maybe by just being kind God might use you to get someone saved.

If a woman does not work without substantial reason such as pregnancy , she will be severely criticized by the community . </cultivate.v.3080><cultivate.v.3081>Another negative effect results from climate change , especially the distribution and amount of precipitation. Subsistence oriented small scale farmers cultivate their land solely by hand labour , whereas semi-intensive farms resort to a certain mechanisation. This gives them a comparative advantage because they are able to prepare their fields to plant the seeds in the desired acrage with a higher power of impact if the rainfall comes very late. Farmers that solely rely on hand labour are unable to cultivate all their fields in the short period of remaining time. This could be improved by offering an affordable type of bio-fuel . </cultivate.v.3081><cultivate.v.3082>Vavilov ( 1951 ) showed that variation in cultivated plants is confined to relatively few restricted areas or centers. He set up six main geographic centers for cultivated plants , a number later ( 1935 ) increased to about ten , and assumed that cassava has a Brazilian-Bolivian center of diversity. He further proposed that centers of diversity are places of origin of cultivated plants. After this exposition of centers of diversity in the 1920 's , much more information has been gathered , and it has become clear that not all centers of diversity represent centers of origin . </cultivate.v.3082><cultivate.v.3083>Pushed by the increasing pressure on natural resources , farmers have started to cultivate on marginal soils as well , augmenting the risk of soil degradation. This especially is the case because the quality of land reserved for women 's ownership often is rather bad. It has been observed , however , that women invest in their fields ( labor , fertilization ) in order to obtain a reasonable production . </cultivate.v.3083><cultivate.v.3084>Table 2 shows that maize is the dominant crop , occupying about two thirds of the cultivated area for all three wealth categories.

Because teachers rarely require the use of a homework diary. They may encourage it , they may nag or remind , but few require it , and even when they do , most of their colleagues don ' t. So , at best , students will be required to use their diaries in one or two of their five or six classes each day.

The saer fuidhirs might , however , if they had the means , bargain with the flaith for good land and hold it for the term of one year , and during that term they could not be disturbed. For this land they paid him high rent , because he could charge them as much as he pleased , a thing he could not do with the clansmen. The daer fuidhirs , so long as they remained such , could hold no land whatever for any term , and no contract made with them had any binding effect. They worked for the flaith , and by means of their cheap labour he was able to cultivate his land , and some of the common land of the clan if it suited him. Both classes of fuidhirs helped the flaith to encroach on the property of the clan. Hence he had an interest in increasing the numbers of fuidhirs , and with their increase his dependence on the clan in some respects diminished . </cultivate.v.3089><cultivate.v.3090>From time immemorial , Native Hawaiians have had a special genealogical relationship to the Hawaiian islands. . . .

Plants are deep and thick rooted and can compete against quack grass. Our seed is collected from the most vigorous and long lived plants growing wild on our farm in an area that was previously a cow pasture. Most of these plants have been here for over 30 years and are still productive. Plants are grown in plug pots for 1 year. Plant the pot and all so the top is 2 inches below the soil. Each pot is multiple seeded to insure a good genetic mix. Spacing can be 1-2 ft. apart in the row.

The appraisal of the Smallholder Cattle Development Project , Indonesia , established that due to limited land , smallholders rarely planted forage crops and relied on crop residues and grass collected from roadsides to feed their cattle. The increase in population and demand for food has resulted in the conversion of grazing land into cultivated fields and its use for other economic activities.

This situation , in combination with erratic enforcement , has created uncertainty over rights and arbitration , which has , in turn , an impact on land use. Farmers , or example , cultivate more land than they really need in order to secure their rights to the land. Rural people often find themselves in a position of permanent illegality and insecurity , especially in forest areas , where the gap between formal law and local practice is greatest ( Lavigne Delville 1999 ) . Since the mid-1980s and early 1990s , the French-speaking countries in West Africa have engaged in a debate about the land-tenure issue in view of harmonizing customary and official land-tenure regimes ( Lavigne Delville 1999 ) . This process , giving more importance to local customary land tenure systems , fits into the framework of decentralization.

[ 29 ] The activity is perceived as ignoring city-planning codes. In Accra , agriculture has not been considered a normal part of city life and town planners do not take it into consideration. Consequently , land may not be legally purchased for the purpose of farming. When some Accra city officials were asked whether a plot of land could be purchased for cultivation they answered no. An Extension Services official insisted that title would not be granted if a prospective buyer indicated that the land would be used for agricultural purposes. [ 30 ] Agriculture is not included in formal planning. As a result , unlike the construction of houses that must follow certain building codes , urban agriculture does not have any codes.

Yields in many areas are actually falling. A major cause of this is declining soil fertility , often caused by the way of farming. The rising population has forced farmers to abandon traditional practices that left the land fallow for several years , and to cultivate ever-smaller plots. Intensive tilling and hoeing year after year can produce a hardpan in the soil. That restricts root growth and stunts plants.

Without effective control methods , the disease can wipe out an entire field of rice , resulting in the complete loss of a harvest and yield after the field has been planted , fertilized and cultivated. Brown Spot strikes by forming brown lesions on the leaves and stems , interrupting photosynthesis , and preventing seeds from forming. While this can happen throughout the growing season , our research has shown that it usually starts to occur when the plant begins to go from a vegetative to reproductive stage , generally between the second and fourth weeks of July. The only current control is application of a fungicide at an annual cost of $ 25-40/acre. Our research objective is to determine where and how B. oryzae ( fungus that causes Brown Spot ) survives from growing season to growing season in order to control this organism where it may be most susceptible . </cultivate.v.3142><cultivate.v.3143>Montanans support our roadless wildlands for the most basic reasons : They help cultivate new industries capable of generating new jobs and higher incomes.

The Heartland ( Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Missouri , and Ohio ) has extensive cropland and a fair amount of land shifting in and out of cultivated crops. This region , however , has relatively few CRP acres ( except for a cluster in Iowa and northern Missouri ) , and the ERS study showed virtually no increase in cultivated area in the region due to higher crop insurance subsidies.

Wilderness is an indispensable part of American history , however , people have held various perspectives of wilderness throughout time. Historical events and articles , pamphlets , stories and books authored about wilderness and the environment tell us a story of shifting perceptions. During European settlement of America , wilderness was something to be feared. One settler in the early 1600s stated , " Wilderness is a dark and dismal place where all manner of wild beasts dash about uncooked. " Indeed , early settlers struggled to clear and cultivate natural lands as a way of civilizing wild America [ 1 ] .

In many crop species , the geographic area occupied by cultivated populations has expanded dramatically in recent times relative to the areas occupied by their wild progenitors. This expansion is evidenced by the contemporary distributions of many of the world 's most economically important crops ( e.g. , chilis , cucumbers , oranges , peanuts , pineapples , potatoes , rice , soybeans , tomatoes , wheat ) , with the bulk of their production on continents other than those where the crop originated ( Simpson and Ogorzaly , 1995 ) . Although the expanded geographic distribution of cultivated populations relative to their wild progenitors is well known , specific differences in the environmental characteristics of regions occupied by cultivated vs. wild populations have not been documented. Have humans simply transported cultivated individuals into regions that resemble the habitat of their wild progenitors ? Or under human influence , have cultivated populations been able to expand into regions that differ significantly from regions occupied by their wild progenitors ? </cultivate.v.3185><cultivate.v.3186>We prefer to cultivate shallowly after each rain when the ground has dried sufficiently.

Increased scarcity of season might explain the paradox of increasing agricultural workforce and labour shortage. In addition , the inability of the tenure system to adapt to the rapid population growth has been an obstacle for utilisation of the increasing agricultural workforce and technical improvements and investments. Even if there exist reserves of arable land at a national level in The Gambia ( FAO 1995 , DoP 1996 ) , is the tenure system an obstacle for utilising it. Due to the constraints of the tenure system , there are fixed land scarcity at a village level. Population growth and urban growth have made the access to land for households with less secure ownership rights more uncertain. ( Land borrowed by these households , might anytime be reclaimed by landowners for other land use such as urban growth. ) Ambiguous young farmers are lacking the ability to clear and cultivate new land because land can not be sold . </cultivate.v.3189><cultivate.v.3190>( iii ) Market demand has increasingly become the most important variety selection criteria. In the 1970 's , the Mbeya Primary Co-operative Union ( the state-controlled monopoly marketing organisation ) encouraged the purchase of modern varieties. This policy , which was based on a crude modernisation ideology , resulted in the loss of several local landraces. During the 1980 's the blanket price policy of the Mbeya Primary Co-operative Union resulted in the increased use of high-yielding but relatively poor-tasting varieties. Trade liberalisation which occurred in 1988 had a dramatic impact on farmers ' selection and cultivation of rice varieties. Dar es Salaam consumer preferences now determined the market demand and price for rice varieties. Today , given that there is no longer any demand for previously cultivated rice varieties , there is either absolute or relative lack of seed for most of such varieties. Three rice varieties dominate on Usangu Plains : Kilombero ( medium maturing , medium-yield potential , high price , good taste ) , Fiya ( late maturing , high-yield potential , low price , poor taste ) and Supa Mati ( early maturing , medium-yield potential , medium price , poor taste ) .

To encourage poor livestock owners to cultivate improved varieties of feed , IFAD has used credit as an incentive , providing both credit in kind ( e.g. improved seed varieties , grasses , seedlings , fertilizers , and land for the setup of demonstration plots ) and in cash ( e.g. loans ) . In the Smallholder Cattle Development Project , Indonesia , thanks to the provision of credit , a mixed farming system was developed , which made the dominant cropping component more sustainable while securing forage for livestock. In collaboration with non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and other local organizations , IFAD has supported feed production , but with varying results. For example , in the Smallholder Livestock Development Project , Bangladesh , in partnership with local NGOs , IFAD trained feed mixers ' whose role is to prepare feed from locally available feed resources supplemented by purchased nutrients. This not only guaranteed the supply of improved feed but also created a new income-generating activity for the rural poor.

Industrial pollution , especially on the west coast , means that farmers can not easily convert , and land with ground-water pollution means that farmers will possibly never be able to convert , " said Liao Chi-i from the Hualien County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center. " It 's not that people do n't want to cultivate organic produce , it 's simply that in many cases they are unable to because the soil is so polluted.

The Pani Panchayat , or water council , was established with 21 farmers , and a small irrigation project was completed from which 50 Acres of cultivable land is irrigated. Out of the total 50 acres of land 20 Acre is Bahal ( Low land ) , 15 Acre is Berna ( Medium ) and the rest 15 Acre is Ant ( high land ) category of land. Before it was possible to cultivate once in a year in 20 Acre ( Low land ) but now with lift irrigation facility it is possible to cultivate two crops in a year in all the 50 acres of land. The irrigation facility is functional in the year 2002 and till date the farmers have got two good harvests using this infrastructure . </cultivate.v.3202><cultivate.v.3203>Permaculture and Co-Op Farming. This idea of multi-use , layered farming is carried over into all aspects of Wild Thyme Farm. In the gardens and the fields , Henrikson has employed permaculture , which is a bit like a smaller scale version of agroforestry. The idea , again , is for everything to serve a purpose and for each garden or orchard or herb bed to serve many purposes which may be to grow food , cultivate medicinal herbs , or benefit the wildlife , he said . </cultivate.v.3203><cultivate.v.3204>Historically , price and income supports have provided an economic incentive for the cultivation of greater acreage than the market would have demanded in the absence of the programs. By reducing income variability and risk while increasing expected returns , farm subsidies prompted agricultural producers to convert wetlands to cropland and to cultivate marginal land that would otherwise be retired and perhaps revert to wetlands. These programs were noted in at least eight of the study areas , the areas reporting wetland losses associated with agriculture . </cultivate.v.3204><cultivate.v.3205>Things can not always go your way.

Heavier and compacted soils need deeper cultivation ( to 8-10 cm ) . Winter wheat seeds are best incorporated in 3-5 cm depth. The optimal sowing depth for winter rye seeds is 3-4 cm in heavier soils and 4-5 cm in lighter soils; triticale seeds are sown into a depth of 3-4 cm in heavier soils and into 5 cm in light soils. If seeders are properly adjusted , seed is sown only 0.4-0.5 cm deeper into the soil that was deeper cultivated before sowing than into the soil that was prepared only by a harrow. After sowing the surface of soil has to be even assuring equal conditions for the germination of all seeds . </cultivate.v.3206><cultivate.v.3207>However , domestication of the resource through farming is not always technically possible. Many species are difficult to cultivate because of certain biological features or ecological requirements ( slow growth rate , special soil requirements , low germination rates , susceptibility to pests , etc. ) . </cultivate.v.3207><cultivate.v.3208>An enterprising young Elizabeth developed an interest in cultivating the land between the cranberry bogs where wild blueberries were growing. Blueberries ripen earlier than do cranberries. Their harvesting in July would complement the cranberry harvest in September. Many New Jersey farmers tried to cultivate the plants in their gardens but without success. At the time , it was generally accepted that blueberries could not be cultivated. Elizabeth did not have the scientific background or education necessary to cultivate the fruit herself. However , in 1911 she read about Dr. Frederick V. Coville 's work in blueberry cultivation. Realizing the potential value of this work , Elizabeth convinced her father to support Dr. Coville 's research. Elizabeth knew that the size of the cranberry farming operation at Whitesbog could provide the financing and infrastructure necessary to carry out experiments on a large scale. Dr. Coville agreed to do his research at Whitesbog . </cultivate.v.3208><cultivate.v.3209>The central zone , the sahelian region , comprises the area with average annual rainfall of between 350 and 800 millimeters. The minimum rainfall needed for the hardiest of Chad 's varieties of millet , called berebere , is 350 millimeters. The western area of the zone is dominated by the Chari and Logone rivers , which flow north from their sources in southern Chad and neighboring countries ( see fig. 3 ) . The courses of these rivers , joining at N'Djamena to flow on to Lake Chad , create an ecological subregion. Fishing is important for the peoples along the rivers and along the shores of Lake Chad. Flood recession cropping is practiced along the edges of the riverbeds and lakeshore , areas that have held the most promise for irrigation in the zone. International donor attention focused on this potential beginning in the mid-1960s. Particular attention has been paid to the traditional construction of polders ( see Glossary ) along the shores of Lake Chad. Land reclaimed by the use of such methods is extremely fertile. Chad 's only wheat crop is cultivated in these polders . </cultivate.v.3209><cultivate.v.3210>From these and other similar social experiments , we have obviously failed to draw any lessons. Out of sight does not mean out of mind - man is endowed with a vivid imagination. Moreover , virtue is perfected or matured by habit. For instance , without the opportunity to face danger we can not cultivate the habit of acting bravely , similarly with just and temperate acts. Without acting first to get what we need , wish or desire , we can not cultivate the habit of avoiding excess or defect in the performance of those acts. In the formation of habits , including what we are habituated to love and hate , the most critical factor is the family ' s capacity for discipline and moral training . </cultivate.v.3210><cultivate.v.3211>Answer : " It may be asked how I could improve or cultivate the Land when they had taken possession of it &amp;violently detained it from me ? . . .

Terracing is planned for 85 , 000 ha and will be carried out on slope lands of less than degrees. Terraces reduce runoff by 90 and the higher moisture retention results in much higher crop yields. During severe drought , the terraces can still be productive whereas crops on slope land will fail completely. Terraces also allow the production of a wider range of crops , including high value cash crops that can not be cultivated on slope lands. In addition , terraces significantly reduce sediment runoff. The labor required for the construction of terraces is generally available in the project areas or can be augmented by the use of small bulldozers at competitive cost . </cultivate.v.3216><cultivate.v.3217>Power is the faculty or capacity to act , the strength and potency to accomplish something.

There are an estimated 54 million hectares of pasture in the Legal Amazon region ( IBGE 1995/96 ) , supporting 52 million head of beef cattle. The cattle population represents 30 percent of the Brazilian herd , which is the largest in the world. The actual pasture acreage in Amazonia is likely to be higher than indicated , as known deforestation and clearing of Cerrado lands for pasture in key states like Para and Mato Grosso has exceeded official government pasture estimates. There were also over 9 million hectares of cultivated crops in the Legal Amazon in 2002/03 , including 4.9 million of soybeans. The total cropped area in Amazonia represented 21 percent of total national agricultural area last year , while the soybean area represented nearly 30 percent of the national total . </cultivate.v.3224><cultivate.v.3225>The term open-space cultivation is used for any cultivation away from the individual 's residence. Cultivated land is not enclosed by any wall or fence. Open-space cultivators are usually of lower socio-economic status , i.e. , unskilled workers and/or formally unemployed. Most open-space cultivators do not know the owners of the land they cultivate because they cultivate any land that is currently unused. Open-space cultivation occurs mostly around the center of Accra. Enclosed and open-space farmers have different reasons for farming. Most enclosed cultivators get involved in urban agriculture to cultivate vegetables for home consumption , but for open-space cultivators , urban cultivation is a source of. While the enclosed cultivators largely consume their harvest , open-space cultivators sell most of theirs.
