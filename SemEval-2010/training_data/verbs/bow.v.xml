It is made of colophony-the residue from the distillation of turpentine. It comes in various grades depending on the type of distillation. Pure colophony is far too brittle to use on it 's own for violin rosin and makes an unpleasant scratchy sound. Therefore it is generally mixed with other substances to modify it 's consistency. Most rosin will contain small amounts of oil to plasticize or soften it and sometimes there are additions of alkaline solutions to neutralize the colophony which is quite acid. The acidity of colophony can be a hazard to the varnish if it is allowed to build up on the instrument . </bow.v.14><bow.v.15>A bow is the act of nodding , curtseying or bending at the waist towards someone as an act of respect and greeting.

One is a gesture of submission and one is a gesture of friendship and respect. I will let you figure out which one is which if you have the braincells left to accomplish that after all of your indoctrination into the new world order. Obama has made protocol gaffes all over the world already and he has only been in office a little over 2 months. Now this is not neccesarily saying that he is mentally challenged or anything but he really should surround himself with people that actually know the protocol and procedures that are supposed to be used when meeting other leaders do n't you think ? One other point is pretty important here , why lie about the bow , you can see the thing on video and the video does n't lie.

The next step is tillering it , which means working on the limbs until they bend evenly and are well balanced at full draw. There are two ways to do this. First , pull your bowstring five or six times a distance of twelve to fifteen inches. This settles the wood a bit. Now have a friend draw the bow about half the arrow length and get off and look at it. You can easily see if it is bending nicely. If it is n't , mark it with a pencil , and take off wood where needed. ( Whenever you scrape off a bit of wood , pull your bow a few times to settle the new bend. ) Continue this until the bow is at full draw. Lengths of arrows are given under " The Arrow " in the " Fundamentals of Archery " . When , at full draw , the bow bends evenly and the limbs have a graceful arch , you are ready for a final very light scraping , coarse and fine sandpapering and finishing . </bow.v.34><bow.v.35>Cherub Box Violin and Bow CH1 Pre-Twinkle Box Violin and bow with realistic looking corrugated cardboard 1/16th size violin with authentic looking ( hairless ) wood bow with frog.

They will then bow to the instructor. The instructor will make the presentation ( read the certificate , offer comments to the student , etc. ) and will present the promotion or award to the student. After the presentation , the head instructor may once again comment on the successful achievement and give encouragement or make a closing point . </bow.v.36><bow.v.37>The considerable strain placed upon the limbs of the bow when drawn requires durable materials with high tensile strength and extensibility on the back of the bow , and high compressive strength and compressibility on the belly. Wood is readily obtained , reasonably good for both back and belly , and easily shaped; self bows consisting of a single material are usually of wooden construction. Considerable compromise must be made in selecting a single material , and sophisticated techniques were employed to overcome this problem. The flatbow 's cross section is shaped to spread stress more evenly , and the yew for use in English longbows was oriented to take advantage of the ability of the heartwood to store energy in compression , and the outer sapwood 's strength in tension . </bow.v.37><bow.v.38>To put these timings into perspective , once Boulez 's performance is over , he has time to encore the first movement -- twice !

An " en vogue " high-performance compound often squeezes into the 315-325 fps range , and a few radical designs venture into the 330 's and 340's. So what 's the problem ? Why are n't bows getting faster and faster as technology continues to improve ? Will we ever see a 400 FPS IBO Speed compound bow , or is that goal simply unattainable from a hand-drawn weapon ? </bow.v.48><bow.v.49>When stepping onto the mat , the student should offer a standing bow in the direction of the Shomen to show respect.

( When accompanying a fixed-pitch instrument such as a piano or accordion , the violin tunes to it. ) The other strings are then tuned against each other in intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs. A minutely higher tuning is sometimes employed for solo playing to give the instrument a brighter sound; conversely , Baroque music is sometimes played using lower tunings to make the violin 's sound more gentle. After tuning , the instrument 's bridge may be examined to ensure that it is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the f holes; a crooked bridge may significantly affect the sound of an otherwise well-made violin . </bow.v.55><bow.v.56>Bush did NOT bow , he leaned forward as the king bestowed a medallion around his neck - To use that as a comparison as to the bow Obama did , is a diversion from the truth. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- " And while this White House is denying Obama bowed , there 's also video that appears to show Bush bowing to the king.

Give them a wiggle , and these are the rabbit ' s ears , the other fingers make up the shape of the teeth. This can be practiced substituting a pencil instead of the bow. It ' s easy to do , and even pupils who can ' t be bothered to open their violin case can do this while watching TV ! Next , try the same thing using the bow. It is a good idea to look in a mirror to see the rabbit ' s face. The object of this is that the fingers which make up the teeth are the ones that hold the bow the firmest. The ' ear ' fingers are used to balance the stick.

A traditional archery bow has a direct draw to release ratio which makes them very accurate but less powerful and generally better suited for the strongest archers. With a compound bow the weight of the draw is significantly lowered when the bow is drawn allowing the hunter to hold the bow drawn for longer periods of time which is often necessary when hunting . </bow.v.63><bow.v.64>More recently I had the opportunity to spend several months with the year 2001 production models of the Arcus Sinfonia viola bow ( $ 1 , 250 list price ) and new Concerto viola bow ( $ 1 , 750 list price ) - I suspect some price negotiation is possible. These are lighter in weight than the previous year 's models. I think they handle even better , and might have a slight improvement in sound quality - certainly they are every bit as good. I find the playing qualities of the two very similar in spite of the weight difference ( 54.3 gram Concerto model and 50.8 gram Sinfonia model ) . The design of the Arcus bows actually gives the player some control over a range of sound characteristics that can also help one adjust to different instruments. More on these later when I discuss the Arcus violin bows. Although these are good as violin bows , they are not as good for that purpose as the new Arcus violin bows - however , they are my choice for viola - especailly for their ability to give fine sound over the whole range of the instrument and avoid some treacherous areas of the C string . </bow.v.64><bow.v.65>We are the top seller of Oneida bowfishing bows in the world , we provide expert service , the best selection , and best price on this bow !

A bow shock only occurs when matter is traveling through a medium faster than that medium 's speed of wave propagation.1 One of the most familiar examples of bow shock is the way water in a stream moves around a boulder. The same predictable shape occurs in all states of matter. When an airplane moves through the sky , air forms a bow shock around the nose of the plane. And when the plane reaches supersonic speeds , the sound waves form a similarly bowed shape around the nose , as well . </bow.v.76><bow.v.77>As the Head of State of a major nation , I doubt that Obama had to bow so low for the Emperor of Japan.

I couldn ' t do it. I kept my head high commenting to the person sitting to my left that this wasn ' t the Jewish way. It was at that moment that I turned to my wife on my right and expressed my sorrow in ever having been critical or cynical of some of our cherished minhagim. I missed the separate seating , missed the monotonous and sometimes tedious reading of the ketubah and missed the groom shrouded in a kitel and many others of the particulars that embellish the richness , weightiness and holiness of one of our most sacred rituals . </bow.v.153><bow.v.154>Leviticus 26 : 1 " 'You shall make for yourselves no idols , neither shall you raise up an engraved image or a pillar , neither shall you place any figured stone in your land , to bow down to it : for I am Yahweh your God.

My mother thinks he did it to protect American interests and based on the fact that we are dependant on Saudis for a number of things. Now I like King Abdullah , but I wouldn ' t ever bow to him.

Did they hold hands and kiss like George W. Bush did ? All the world leaders are united in this race to bring in a global dictatorship , and who knows which one is pulling the main strings. They ' re all a bunch of thugs , it ' s one thug admiringly acknowledging the criminal activity of another thug . </bow.v.159><bow.v.160>Bows are made from the finest woods available including Osage Orange ( Bois d'Arc ) , Hickory , Pecan , and other acceptable bow woods depending on availability. I use Bamboo and Hickory for bow backing as well as Deer and Elk sinew when requested. In an effort to reduce costs , most bows are sold " unfinished " . This means that they have only two or three coats of wood oil on them to protect the wood from moisture , but no final finish. They also do not come with leather on the handle nor an arrow rest. Finished bows with leather arrows rests are available but at an additional charge . </bow.v.160><bow.v.161>These displays of respect all help develop a sense of discipline and camaraderie in the class. As illustrated below , there are two types of bowing in judo . </bow.v.161><bow.v.162>Bowing is an important part of the Japanese tea ceremony. There are three main types of bow performed in tea ceremony; they are classified as shin ( ) , gy ( ) , and s ( ) . All are usually performed from a kneeling position. Shin bows are the deepest; from a kneeling position , the bower bends forward from the waist , placing the hands palms down on the floor in front of the body , with the fingers facing. Shin bows are performed to teachers and superiors. Gy and s bows respectively are less deep and less long. From a kneeling position and bowing from the waist , the hands are slid over the knees until the tips of the fingers touch the floor in front of the body. They are performed among persons of similar rank . </bow.v.162><bow.v.163>for " with the wood " ) in the written music calls for striking the string ( s ) with the stick of the bow , rather than by drawing the hair of the bow across the strings.

After the students have lined up in grade order , the sensei will ensure that everyone is ready and standing in heiko dachi. Then the sempai will tell everyone to put their heels together and kneel ( seiza ) . The sempai will then say Mokuso ( eyes closed ) . This is a short period of meditation to ready yourself for the class - to think about what you want to get out of it and what you are going to put into it , to clear your mind of the hassles of the day. Mokuso Yame ( open eyes ) will be called and the sensei will turn his back to the class. The sempai will say " Shihan Sullivan , rei. " and the whole class will bow in respect to Shihan Sullivan , the founder of GKR. Sensei will turn back around , the sempai will turn to face the sensei and will say " Sensei , rei " . The class will bow in respect to the sensei this time. The sempai then turns to the front and says " Autagani , rei " and everyone bows in respect to their fellow students. The sensei will then begin the class . </bow.v.164><bow.v.165>It 's all play-acting. We are interested in royalty as an extension of the kings and princesses in fairy tales.

Sit formally and bow as before . </bow.v.169><bow.v.170>Every violinist has a different style and each and every bowing technique is different from player to player. A more aggressive violinist will typically play better on a lighter bow because he does n't need as much weight to play notes cleanly. On the opposite end , typically a more conservative player will sound a lot better if they use a heavier bow than if they used a light bow. Now comparing between 56 grams and 64 grams is a huge difference and these two particular weights are very much on the opposite side of the spectrum. It is rare for me to recommend either of these weights in particular. Typically a good weight will range between 58 and 62 grams where most violin bow makers try to aim their bows to be . </bow.v.170><bow.v.171>A kiss , not so sure if that 's a sign of subservience , except maybe on the hand , like one does with the Pope. I have n't seen Bush bow to the Saudi King , but If he did , hell yeah , I 'd be pissed about it. I 'm so tired of this juvenile , " oh yeah , well did you complain about Bush ? " That is a straw man argument , a logical fallacy , and it 's used daily on this site. This is not a left/right , Republican/Democrat issue , no things political are that way for me. I do n't live in a box. To me both parties are corrupt. I do n't subscribe to left/right paradigm propaganda. I 'm sure many who are criticizing Obama might be playing on political lines , but not me . </bow.v.171><bow.v.172>Note the rank hypocrisy of the Left. Somehow it was racist to use Obamov 's middle name. But now he gladly proclaims it in his Dhimmitude : bowing to an Islamofascist leader. Saudi Arabia exports the worst Islamofascist doctrine , and sentences the victims of gang rape to jail and flogging . </bow.v.172><bow.v.173>6 ) I was correct in my previous statements that it would serve bow purchasers well to test bows outside their price range ( both above and below ) . They should also test as many bows as they can on the instrument ( s ) they will be used with. They may be pleasantly surprised at what their " best " bow costs . </bow.v.173><bow.v.174>The expressions 'composite ' or 'extra III ' mean that the bow is made in the same way as they were made thousands of years ago that is of horn-wood-sinew. The primitive Eastern recurve bows like the Hungarian , Hunnish , Avar , Turkish etc were not made only of wood , but of much more flexible and durable materials than wood and these were horn and sinew. Only the cores of the bows were of wood. In ancient times these bows were simply called hornbows. I have been occupied in this technology the most. My first hornbow was ready 19 years ago. Since that time I have been experimenting these bows nearly every day , I 've spent a lot of time on them and they have gone through a lot of development. The composite bows produced during the last few years can compete with the modern material bows ( but they are not more sensitive than the Olympic bows ) . Though these bows are extremely sensitive to stringing. It is worth stringing them in a crouched position with the help of another person . </bow.v.174><bow.v.175>Arrow weight is very important in a hunting situation. International Bowhunting Organization , IBO , rates bow speeds at 5 grains per pound of draw weight. In my opinion , five grains per pound in not nearly enough for a good hunting arrow. Most experts agree that 400 to 425 grains is the minimum arrow weight for hunting . </bow.v.175><bow.v.176>We keep a selection of good quality Student Bows made of Brazil Wood with real horse hair and a few more expensive but much better Pernambuco bows as used by the leading players. Latterly we also stock a selection of excellent Carbon Fibre Bows . </bow.v.176><bow.v.177>Rosin breaks up into tiny particles with sharp edges. There 's an ionic interchange between the collagen in the horsehair and the rosin resulting in a mutual attraction between these two complex molecules somewhat like static electricity. During bowing the particles of rosin get trapped between the string and the bowhair . </bow.v.177><bow.v.178>Who cares if he bowed or did n't bow ? If it is proper etiquette to bow in their country and you are there , then do it if you choose to ( only if you want to be proper ) . They bow in many countries as a form of a handshake. What would the press say if a foreign leader refused to handshake our president ? </bow.v.178><bow.v.179>An aesthetic and environmental debate currently rages among professional violinists. Synthetic carbon-graphite bows have become sophisticated enough to rival the sound of all-natural bows; and because the best all-natural elements in an old-fashioned bow come from the delicate Amazon rain forest , synthetic-bow advocates insist man-made sticks represent the wisest artistic choice and the most responsible let's-go-green decision. As you take a stand in this debate , be careful not to think too much; focus , instead , on feeling. Searching and shopping for your ideal bow , make your bowing arm and fingers extra sensitive , because you will know your ideal choice the moment you feel it. Synthetic or natural , you simply will feel it , and it will feel perfect-like you and the bow were made for one another . </bow.v.179><bow.v.180>First Bush bows before the king and now Obama does it. Why do US presidents bow before the Saudis ? Well at least Obama did n't hold the king 's hands and go for a stroll like Bush did . </bow.v.180><bow.v.181>The second bow , performed in exactly the same manner , will be to the dojo 's sensei , for without the sensei there would be no one to pass on the art of karate to the students of today. The sensei in turn bows to the students and by returning the bow he or she acknowledges that without the students there would be no one for the sensei to teach , and thus the sensei would be unable to carry out their obligation to their teacher which is to pass on all of their knowledge to others . </bow.v.181><bow.v.182>" 4 ) The fourth kind of bowing is called 'wise and pure'. 'Wise ' refers to the functioning of wisdom , and 'pure ' refers to the development of purity. It describes one who uses true wisdom to purify his body and mind. People who are wise use this method to bow to the Buddha , and by doing so , they purify the Three Karmas of body , mouth , and mind . </bow.v.182><bow.v.183>' Reiho ' literally means ' the way to behave ' . Just as in the West we have certain customs of etiquette at work , home , and social events , so the East has similar customs that are distinct to their culture. For example , in the West , when you meet someone , you would normally shake their hand or perhaps give them a kiss , depending on the familiarity of the person and / or relationship. In the East , the custom upon meeting someone is to bow . </bow.v.183><bow.v.184>Isaiah 46 : 2 They bend , they are bowed down together; they could not deliver the burden , and themselves are gone into captivity. ( DBY ) </bow.v.184><bow.v.185>One should take solace in the fact that nowadays most young Japanese do not bow very often , nor do they bow correctly. Generally speaking , most Westerners who take Jujutsu , Karate or Kendo etc. know more about bowing than the average Japanese college student. In fact , many companies in Japan have classes on etiquette for their new employees so that these employees know when and how to bow. The art of bowing does not have the prominence in Japan that it once did. Nowadays there are many adapted methods that barely resemble the traditional methods. These appear to be blended versions of tea ceremonies , geisha and the military arts etc. However , those " in the know " will very quickly determine your level of knowledge in this regard . </bow.v.185><bow.v.186>Some years ago , the idea came up of using , instead of a sine wave , a signal emulating the string signal - namely , the force exerted on the bridge by the the bowed string. ( I shall use the term string signal hereafter to refer to a signal proportional to this force. ) Would one not then hear , listening through the bridge , the sound of the violin as though it were being normally played ? </bow.v.186><bow.v.187>My surreal encounters with this odd social ritual have n't been limited to shops either. I 've been bowed at by ticket inspectors on the train ( one of them even doffing his cap as well ) , by the little lightsabre men who control the traffic at roadworks , by post office clerks and waitresses , theatre ushers and even a policeman . </bow.v.187><bow.v.188>I think he was caught up in the moment. I know being Prez , he should have known better but since he 's only held office for 2 mths + , he might have become perplexed at 1st seeing the King. His instinct was to bow but before he realized his mistake , it was too late to hold back. The worst offender was the White House spokeman vehemently denying that he bowed. Politics as usual &amp;I thought the O'Bama Admin was beyond reproach ! </bow.v.188><bow.v.189>Courtesy is based on respect; for oneself , for others and for the Dojo ( Training Hall ) . The basic expression of respect and courtesy , which comes from Japanese culture , is the bow or Rei but can also mean courtesy. These are two positions from which to bow - standing and kneeling . </bow.v.189><bow.v.190>If it was not a bow , then King Abdullah was at fault for the situation because he failed to turn around as President Obama attempted to kiss his backside. Americans are not stupid , and we know the duck test; if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck and quacks like a duck , then it probably is a duck. He did bow; this shows the reality of Obama. Oh , and where is that Socialized medicine that was promised ? I guess Americans will never see it because that would bring an end to all the money that politicians get from the American Medical Association , American Hospital Association , and the insurance companies. Stop dreaming Americans , do you homework , and Get real . </bow.v.190><bow.v.191>Jamie Murray &amp;Belarusian Max Mirnyi have bowed out of the Gentlemen ' s Doubles at The Championships.

Most recently , micromachined accelerometers show promise as very inexpensive motion sensors. Dan Trueman has experimented with them in his R-Bow. Their main disadvantage is that they can not distinguish between acceleration and gravity. Dan says , " If you are bent way over and bowing real fast , who knows what those things are saying ... " . If you try to work around it and do the math , you 'll find that you need three separate triaxial accelerometers to track position accurately , which is actually more expensive than the SpacePad and much more work . </bow.v.192><bow.v.193>Stefan currently has three Berg bows which he plays with his 1738 Camillo Camilli violin. He considers his owning these three bows a " marriage " and finds it difficult to choose which bow to play " because they are all so wonderful " . He says that his Berg bows have never let him down and that people always come to him after a concert , complementing him on his sound and inquiring about what bow he is using. Stefan is proud to say that he is a Berg bow owner and hopes to grow old with them . </bow.v.193><bow.v.194>Metrolinx , the provincial agency set up by Dalton McGuinty ' s government to invest in public transportation in the Greater Toronto Area , has already made moves onto the TTC ' s jurisdiction , with the support of both the TTC and the City of Toronto. Several of the transit announcements that surrounded Metrolinx ' s foundation incorporated projects that had been proposed by the transit commission and Toronto ' s city council , including Transit City ' s network of six LRT lines stretching across the northern half of the City of Toronto. Funding for the Eglinton , Sheppard East and Finch West LRTs have been secured , and Metrolinx appears to have bowed to the TTC ' s recommendation that the Eglinton Crosstown line be built as an LRT ( with a lengthy underground section in the middle ) rather than a more expensive extension of the Scarborough RT ) . </bow.v.194><bow.v.195>It is common knowledge that bowing is customary in Japan. Japanese bowing at any place and any time is often a source of amusement for foreigners . </bow.v.195><bow.v.196>Respect is learned through action. Psychologist Paul Pearsall has observed that motivation follows behavior , it does not precede it. So even a beginning Taekwondo student bows to the flag and their seniors as they enter the do-chang. The student may be uncomfortable at first , feeling a bit awkward and unsure of the reason for such a tradition. But in time the action becomes natural so much so that the student would feel something was missing if the student did not bow. The motivation to show respect grows within the student. Through the bow the student communicates silently with their instructor and fellow students that the student is making the connection with the tradition , the art and the history of Taekwondo . </bow.v.196><bow.v.197>Over time some bows will develop a bend : to the right ( looking down the shaft from the frog end ) on the violin and viola and to the left on the cello and bass. This will result in bowing difficulties , unexpected noises and scratches while playing and difficulty in controlling the bow. A stick can be straightened -- definitely a job for a professional . </bow.v.197><bow.v.198>Just goes to show that he is bowing to the same Saudi kings as Bush did. These Saudis are in the same business bed as the illuminati. Obama is a traitor. A US president shouldn ' t be bowing to a foreign leader.

You will not be aked to adhere to any religious doctrine , but only to remain spiritually open. When we bow it is not a religious performance , but a sign of respect for the same spirit of universal creative intelligence within us all . </bow.v.199><bow.v.200>The muscle skills to do this are subtle and take some development. If you ' re relatively new to bowed instruments , they ' ll take some time.

Everyone remains seated until the instructor indicates they can leave.

This might take a few minutes to work out , but the right spine arrow ensures it will fly straighter and group tighter. Spine is the stiffness of the shaft. Heavier bows require a stiffer arrow , and lighter bows weaker arrows. The correct spine depends on two factors. The first is the length of the arrow ( which you should know by now ) and the second is the weight of the bow . </bow.v.208><bow.v.209>Lateness : First of all , try not to be late. But if you are late , bow in , then quietly kneel near the entrance. Wait until the instructor acknowledges you. Then bow while kneeling , get up , and quickly join the group. If you arrive just as everyone is kneeling during the opening sequence ( see below ) , do n't move or make any noise -- just wait until class begins warming up , and bow in as when the instructor acknowledges you , in the manner described above . </bow.v.209><bow.v.210>When you pull the string of a compound bow , the limbs of the bow are squeezed inward. The energy you supplied to draw the bow is stored in the limbs , as potential energy , until you release the string. Upon release , the potential energy is transferred into the arrow as kinetic energy , as the limbs " spring " back into place returning the string to it ' s original position. Seems simple enough ! But careful examination of this process of storing and releasing energy is what gives a compound bow its performance characteristics , and it is something you should consider when selecting your new bow. The Point : In essence , there are only two factors that determine how much " power " your bow will have : 1 ) The amount of energy that can be stored in the limbs during the drawstroke. 2 ) The amount of that potential energy that can be successfully transferred into the arrow upon release ( efficiency ) . </bow.v.210><bow.v.211>The Seated Bow ... The student knows that they should bow , but stays seated. Is it really too much effort to stand up , bow , and then sit back down again ? The seated bow says that either the student is lazy , or that the person does n't deserve all the effort it takes to bow properly. By standing up to bow , you not only make your legs stronger , you discipline yourself to do the proper thing , even when it might be inconvenient. This habit will come in handy when you face more important issues later in life . </bow.v.211><bow.v.212>Matthew 2 : 8 and having sent them to Beth-Lehem , he said , 'Having gone -- inquire ye exactly for the child , and whenever ye may have found , bring me back word , that I also having come may bow to him.

At the time , the Pope who was held in high esteem , extended his hand to priests , nuns &amp;lay people as he gave his blessings as they kissed his signet ring. This ritual was appropriated by the Catholic Friars and Priests , especially in the Philippines. As a result the Filipinos appropriated this tradition as a means to show respect to one 's elders by way of the Mano. The Mano is when one slightly bows to one 's elder as they take the elder 's opposing hand and respectfully place it to one 's own forehead . </bow.v.228><bow.v.229>In Japan , however , people usually greet each other differently.

Remember , you can take wood off quickly and easily if you like but it 's hard to put it back so take it easy. Note also wider and thinner belly to back white wood bows perform well. A 50 pound bow that is 1 3/4 or 2 inches wide will shoot just fine too. Wood is eight times stronger if it 's twice as thick as the next piece , it 's twice as strong if it 's twice as wide.

Obviously it was clear to Peter and the angel that the intent of the actions being done to them was not just respect and honor , but an act of worship. What " clues " to that effect were given we are not told , just that these people were bowing and prostrating themselves with the intent to worship Peter and the angel. It is significant here that the prostration had to be qualified that it was with this intent to worship.

What ? ! This is Japan we 're talking about ! Have any of you even been to the east ? Bowing is a sign of respect for others. Whether you 're bowing to a family member , your boss , teacher , etc. it 's respect. What Obama did was right and there should be no type of complaint about what he did. He even bowed properly , which shocked me. Firm hand shake , and bow lower than the emperor. If he had n't bowed , I can promise you , the Japanese people would be thinking of Americans as disrespectful , fools.

On recurve bows , the bow string is subjected to the entire load imposed by the bow. Compound bows employ tension cables and a mechanical cam construction to reduce the maximum draw force which allows the archer to hold full draw with less exertion. Whether employing a recurve bow or a compound bow , the release of the bow string while under tension causes the bow string to vibrate like a string on a musical instrument. The vibration in turn creates noise. If used while hunting , the noise may alert game birds and animals causing the bow to lose its effectiveness. The vibration generated when the bow string is released further produces a strange vibration to the holder of the bow after the arrow is launched which can cause fatigue in the user of the bow . </bow.v.273><bow.v.274>Choosing what style of bow you wish to shoot will be one of the most important decisions you make.

In Buddhism , the myriad practices relate back to a central theme , the mind and its nature. The mind and its nature are fundamentally Buddha. The " goal " or the end of the spiritual path then , is to gradually remove all aspects of the view of self , until one rediscovers his or her non-dual nature. Bowing , as a road to the non-dual helps empty out and purify false concepts within. The false , illusory self is being erased as one bows. When the illusion of self yields to a larger context of Dharma , one can bow in empty space. This " true emptiness , " as the texts describe , is genuine " wonderful existence. " Buddhist bowing then , aims to reveal the unsubstantial nature of both self and phenomena . </bow.v.292><bow.v.293>Bows function by converting elastic potential energy stored in the limbs into kinetic energy of the arrow. In this process , some energy is dissipated through elastic hysteresis , reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the energy remaining , some is damped both by the limbs of bow and the bowstring. Depending on the elasticity of the arrows , some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow , causing it to \ " bow out\ " to one side. This results in an in-flight oscillation of the arrow in which its center protrudes out to one side and then the other repeatedly , gradually damping down as the arrow\ 's flight proceeds; this can be clearly seen in high-speed photography of an arrow at discharge. Modern arrows are made to a specified \'spine\ ' ( stiffness ) rating </bow.v.293><bow.v.294>These four bows are done from a kneeling position at the beginning and ending of every class.

A vibrating string can produce a motion that is rich in harmonics ( different frequencies of vibration ) . Bowing the string not only allows a range of expressive techniques , but also supplies energy continuously and so maintains the harmonic richness. However , a string on its own makes little sound ( think of an electric guitar that 's not plugged into an amplifer ) . The bridge and body of the violin , and other related instruments , serve to transmit some of the vibrational energy of the string into the air as sound. The way in which they do so is important to the sound of the violin family of instruments . </bow.v.295><bow.v.296>We normally bow in a stationary position , standing or sitting on the floor.

To be fair , you should spend the necessary time to do this , and then decide if you want to continue to use a bow that way . </bow.v.298><bow.v.299>Parallel Limb Bonus Points NEW : As parallel limb bows have become more and more popular , we often hear the argument that parallel limb bows are somewhat more forgiving. First , because they tend to be heavier and more stable at full draw. But also because they tend to have much less forward limb thrust , noise , and recoil , so shooters tend to settle into a more relaxed shot sequence with less anticipation of a violent release. While most experts are n't convinced this is true ( at least not yet ) , we think there is some merit to the argument. As such , for 2007 we have amended our formula and have awarded true parallel limb bows with 3 forgiveness bonus points . </bow.v.299><bow.v.300>But the traditional Miss Manners book of etiquette advises : " One does not bow or curtsy to a foreign monarch because the gesture symbolizes recognition of her power over her subjects. " </bow.v.300><bow.v.301>There are several theories on setting the nocking point. Some say the arrow should be level and some say the nock should be slightly high. The particular rest , arrow , and bow , you are shooting will determine the best place to set the nocking point. Generally you will get better clearance of the rest if the nocking point is slightly high. That causes the arrow to rise up off the rest when you shoot rather than slam down into the rest. Most people today shoot some type of prong type rest. It is hard to tell where your nocking point should be because most bow squares are a different size than the arrow so it will set different in the rest and be either higher or lower than your arrow. A good starting point is to look at the arrow on the rest. The nock should be slightly high so the arrow angles down. The angle will look greater on short brace height bows because the string is so close to the rest. Then use your square to record where your nocking point is located on the string. That will be your starting point . </bow.v.301><bow.v.302>The fact is that the Bible is filled with people bowing and kissing one another and it was never declared to be idolatry. Neither is it today. The American Protestant has simply missed out in the last 500 years on a vital and real Christian practice of honoring the Saints that has existed since the early Apostles passed on and consequently the reality of the Saints in heaven has been dimmed and in some cases lost altogether. After all , we are instructed by Paul to " Set your mind on things above , not on things on the earth. " ( Col 3 : 2 NKJV ) The Saints are in heaven worshiping around the throne. We could do a lot worse than setting our minds on them . </bow.v.302><bow.v.303>Nonetheless , the most popular bowhunting bows are 31-34 " long. Much like the market trend with a 7 " brace height , bowhunters largely regard bows under 31 " as too short , and bows over 34 " as too long. There seems to be some magic in the 31-34 " bow. The most popular units of the last few years ( Mathews DXT , Bowtech Admiral , PSE X-Force , Hoyt Alphamax , Diamond Iceman , etc. ) all fall into this axle-to-axle length range. So it 's no surprise that nearly half the bows on the market have similar axle-to-axle lengths . </bow.v.303><bow.v.304>THE BOW. Nine-tenths of all moderately priced , good bows are made of Lemonwood. More expensive ones are made of Lemonwood Staves backed with hickory , rawhide , fibre , fibre glass and plastics.

For the novice , a moderately priced lemonwood bow is recommended. Whether you choose a Flat Bow or a Long Bow is immaterial; both are good. Later you may want a , fine Osage bow or a backed or laminated lemonwood. Men and grown boys take a 5'6 " to 5'8 " Flat Bow. ( 6'0 " Long Bow ) . Your bow should not be too strong. You should be able to pull and loose it without too much effort. Thirty-five to forty-five pounds pulling weight is sufficient. Grown girls and women take a 5'6 " Flat Bow. ( 5'6 " Long Bow ) . Weights ( pull in pounds ) of twenty to thirty-five pounds are enough. juveniles take bows the same height as themselves and with pulls of fifteen to twenty-five pounds . </bow.v.304><bow.v.305>I didn ' t see a bow.

One should always try to walk behind another person , if possible. If you have to go in front , you excuse yourself by bowing slightly and holding out your right hand with the edge downwards as if you are cutting your way and offering a silent apology. One puts out his or her hand when it appears that she or he is about to do something rather unpardonable. This action might be described as expressing gratitude to another for allowing you to do something that is not considered polite. In addition to people , it is impolite to handle a dojo mate 's equipment ( e.g. , sparring equipment , hanbo , shinai etc. ) . One should also avoid stepping on or over another 's equipment and should always seek permission to touch it or move it , if it is necessary . </bow.v.306><bow.v.307>An important role of the bow hand is to conduct the musical intentions of arm movements through the bow into the string with the right degree of intensity , accent or softness.

Handshakes have little variation , other than length of time and the strength employed. This may tell one very little , other than one or both persons have strong hands. On the other hand , the bow can convey a number of different things to its partakers and observers alike. Various bows have different meanings. As well , the type and level of emotions that may be involved and the nature of the relationship between the persons bowing can be observed. Correct bowing is complex. There are different nuances involved with the type of bow and situation in which it is used. The depth of the bow depends on the relationship between the two people meeting. Bows can range from shallow nods to kneeling bows where one 's head touches the floor. This latter bow , however , is seldom practiced or seen these days.

She says this is in the directive , yet I can not find such a stipulation anywhere.

The proud mountain folk of Uri had already joined with their Schwyzer and Nidwaldner neighbours at R tli in pledging to resist the Austrians ' cruel oppression , and when Gessler raised a pole in the central square of Altdorf and perched his hat on the top , commanding all who passed before it to bow in respect , it was the last straw. William Tell , a countryman from nearby B rglen , either had n't heard about Gessler 's command or chose to ignore it; whichever , he walked past the hat without bowing. Gessler seized Tell , who was well known as a marksman , and set him a challenge.

The smell of the hay effectively covered his odor , and he was able to call a doe within a few feet of an opening with a bleat call.

Most black and white Zebra strings are still made of our former Zebra material , 8125. The reason for this is that many people still like the bright lustre of the 8125 white. 8125 has high-speed qualities but offers more stretch than 1425x. 452x is available only on request. Made with Vectran , 452x offers very low stretch qualities but compromises speed by 3-5 fps. To determine what material you have on your bow , bows with nocks are fitted with shrink tubing over the nocks. The shrink tubing will say either Zebra or Tiger. If your bowstring is not fitted with nocks , then you will have to judge by the age of your bow. Again , standard material on all new bows is 1425x , starting with the 2004 models. LX has 8125 and Conquest bows typically have Tiger.

It is never used to refer specifically to prostration or bowing , though the elements of that are included in worship to God as indicated in the definition.

" Moses and his companions are expected to appear before the Lord and to prostrate themselves before Him in accordance with accepted rules of ceremony.

In fact , the 340+ fps super bows of today tend to be slow sellers that do n't attract much attention after the chronograph is switched-off. So while everyone appreciates good performance , it 's clear that shooters generally prefer more moderate designs with 7 " + brace heights and comfortable powerstrokes.

Our President seems to forget that he is not representing himself , but rather the people of the United States of America . </bow.v.364><bow.v.365>This is what Obama asks Americans to appreciate and respect. But there can be no shred of respect for a nation that endorses such violent crimes that so vehemently oppose our fundamental values. It is improper for Obama , the leader of the free world , to bow in deference to King Abdullah , who is the leader of a theocracy that openly permits its young girls to be enslaved by authoritarian patriarchs . </bow.v.365><bow.v.366>I also offer premium quality latex free bow and topknot bands , and sew-on crystal rhinestones for making your own dog bows.

At this point your friend will be bereft. ... </bow.v.367><bow.v.368>Obama was also seen bowing in front of the queen of England just a few days ago. Was he submitting in front of her also ? Yes , I know he did n't touch the queen - even though our First Lady did - but he did bow to her. Bush held hands with King Abdullah. Should we label him too as the " one who holds hands with men ? " He who supports a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages ? I understand the conservative viewpoint of some conservatives who bring out the " 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. " </bow.v.368><bow.v.369>When class is over , you should thank the instructor ( s ) for the class by either bowing or shaking their hand ( s ) . Then walk to the door and show respect for both the instructor and the kwoon by deeply bowing before departing. Please take any trash with you as you leave and throw it away in the nearest trash can. Do not leave it sitting in the kwoon for the instructor ( s ) to pick up. If you are asked to help clean the kwoon before class can begin , we are NOT punishing you. We all want to work out in a clean place and should all take part in maintaining that cleanliness. Consequently , if you make a mess you must clean it up immediately . </bow.v.369><bow.v.370>The wood used for good quality bows is usually pernambuco wood from Brazil. Some bows nowadays are made from fibreglass. They are often cheaper and still of very good quality. The bow has to be slightly curved so that it straightens out a bit as the hairs are tightened ( this is like the bow of ' bow and arrow ' where letting go of the tension of the bent bow makes the arrow fly off ) . </bow.v.370><bow.v.371>But it goes beyond the bowing. The structure of Martial arts is hierarchical in nature and at the top is the Sensei , Sufi , or Master. Now some people are very cool about that title and understand what it really means is coach. It means you are there for your players , that you are their servant. But many martial artist take that title to mean they are not just better at martial art X but are in fact a better person then their student. They demand their students stand at attention , call them by their title , and punish them for infractions of Dojo rules. I have been to many schools where students needed to bow , then ask permission to speak or ask a question. That is just sick. Just an obvious need on the part of small men who feel the need to elevate themselves over their paying customers. The path to greater abuses is laid. I have been to many schools where the teacher is having inappropriate relations with their students . </bow.v.371><bow.v.372>For example in Taekwondo , before a sparring match begins , each partner bows to each other. This would mean , " I respect you , however , I am going to do my best to score a point on you , and it 's being done to perfect my Taekwondo and myself , not to hurt you. The moment the match is over , it is forgotten and we are still friends , and I hope , better friends than before . </bow.v.372><bow.v.373>The bow , as taught by the Ogasawara school of etiquette , had derived from the traditions of the warrior class , which originally applied to the manner of bowing when properly seated on a tatami mat. There are numerous variations of the bow , each of which applies to a specific set of circumstances. For instance , the correct depth of the bow varies according to the level of respect and one 's sex of whom you 're greeting and this must also be taken into consideration. If from the proper sitting positions on tatami mats , you bend your upper body forward with back straight , your arms will naturally come forward and the tips of your fingers will meet on the floor. The space between your hands should be about the size of a fist , and the distance between your head and the floor should be about twenty centimeters. This is a general bow which is appropriate in most cases. The key point to remember is that the waist is a pivot from which the upper body should extend like a rigid beam . </bow.v.373><bow.v.374>Well , it was a mistake alright , but in addition to what has already been said , King Abdullah is indeed the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. I 've read from more than one source where he has instructed his subjects not to bow to him , " The faithful bow ONLY to Allah. " So , not only was President Obama wrong to bow to him , but even citizens of Saudi Arabia are not supposed to bow before their king , because he is the servant of Allah , and only Allah is worthy of worship . </bow.v.374><bow.v.375>The Washington Times called it the alleged bow a shocking display of fealty to a foreign potentate , and said it violated centuries of American tradition of not deferring to royalty. The Weekly Standard , meanwhile , noted , that American protocol apparently rules out bowing , or at least it reportedly did on the occasion of a Clinton near bow to the Emperor of Japan . </bow.v.375><bow.v.376>Damon Howatt/Martin Mamba ... I won shoots with it but IMO I could never get consistent with it..Traded it to my cousin and now hes trying to get rid of it. Very pretty bow , but just not for me . </bow.v.376><bow.v.377>Bows are typically reciprocated with the exceptions of bowing at the kamiza , dojo genkan , ( entrance ) , solo kata practice or , when outside of the dojo , to staff in department stores etc. who bow to welcome you. The bow shows respect for the person to whom you are bowing. The lower the bow , the more respect you are showing. Bows should always be returned and the person who is the lower status of the two should bow first and lowest , holding the bow until the other person has done theirs . </bow.v.377><bow.v.378>And nowhere is the nature of the mind - -the interpenetration of noumena and phenomena , the unity of Buddha and living beings - - more eloquently expressed than in the samadhi states of the Bodhisattva of Great Conduct , Samantabhadra. [ xlvi ] This undoubtedly was the source of Katagiri 's recitation , and gets to the heart of my thesis , that bowing in Buddhism , like Chan meditation , is a Dharma-door that opens to samadhi and liberation. Let 's look at the contemplation . </bow.v.378><bow.v.379>Once you have narrowed your choice down to the type of bow , it would then be smart to ask yourself , how much money do I have or want to spend ? A good compound bow generally ranges $ 300- $ 700. The price difference is usually broke down to the material make of the bow. Just like an engine and leather seats can be to a car. The price can also be broke down to the basic simplicity of the bow itself. For example a youth/women ? Ts bow tends to run a lot cheaper than say a bow made for power and speed . </bow.v.379><bow.v.380>When bowing , men should keep their hands at their sides. Women should cross their hands in front of their bodies unless you are offered the handshake at the same time . </bow.v.380><bow.v.381>The US Minister to Brazil back in the 1820s in a famous incident refused to bow to the Emperor Dom Pedro. This caused a stir back then in some Brazilian circles but the Minister correctly represented his Republic . </bow.v.381><bow.v.382>The King of Saudi Arabia is Protector of the muslim 's Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina. If Obama bowed down to him , it becomes clear that in spite of what he says , he quite obviously really is a muslim. thank you for posting and sharing it . </bow.v.382><bow.v.383>Solving this dilemma was the pivotal idea for the Arcus bows : To combine the lightness and agility of the 18. century bows with the power of the 19. century bows - and make them so strong and fast that the works of the 20th century can also be played safely and precisely . </bow.v.383><bow.v.384>Opening sequence : When you hear " Line up ! " or " One line ! " , stand shoulder to shoulder facing the front of the dojo , in rank order. Try to line up so that the instructor is right in the middle of the line. If class size is big , the senior student may ask you to form more than one line , in which case , you should try to line up so that the lines are approximately of the same length. Seiza ! " : sit down in seiza , so that knees are aligned with the person on your left. " Mokusoh ! " : quite meditation -- just lower your gaze , relax , and breathe. " Mokusoh yame ! " : stop. " Shomen ni rei ! " : Bow to the front of the room ( this signifies bowing to the institution of karate and to the line of instructors who brought it to your instructor ) . " Sensei ni rei ! " : Bow to the instructor. When you 're bowing , you can say " onegaishimas , " which , roughly translated , means " Please , " i.e. , please teach me , please help me , please hold class , etc. At the signal of the instructor , get up ( quickly , without waiting for the person on your left , necessarily ) . </bow.v.384><bow.v.385>You say all the Japanese would think Americans as fools , well so what. I grew out of that stage ( caring what others thought about me , and worried about my own actions. ) back in elementary school. Plus Obama is the first president to Bow to the Emperor , so I guess FDR , Eisenhower , JFK , Johnson , Ford , Carter , Reagan , Bush Sr. &amp;Jr. , and Clinton , just to name a few , were all disrespectful fools. Perhaps YOU do n't understand American culture , and that 's why you do n't understand why Americans would be upset to see our President bow to a Monarch ! </bow.v.385><bow.v.386>" I am a proud owner of one of the new Allegro bows. I always have had the problem of producing a continuous and homogeneous tone , but not any more. Despite its stiffness the Allegro does not feel inflexible at all and it looks like I will neglect my old fidgety wooden bow in the future. But , only recently , when I had to play with it again because a friend had borrowed the Allegro off me I realized that I was able to play with the wooden bow better than before. I was stunned , it really had not occurred to me that the Allegro might have teaching qualities. It is probably the relaxed bow hold that the Allegro helps to develop with its easy response and big sound that made me play with much less pressure and which in the end helped to improve my bowing technique. In any case , I am more than happy and consider these bows to be a must have . " </bow.v.386><bow.v.387>Pundits are going crazy over - get this - Obama bowing as he met the Emperor of Japan. Apparently , none of the pundits has ever stepped foot off American soil , nor have they read a book , nor do they have access to the interwebs - how else to explain such complete ignorance of the fact that different cultures have different customs. As in , different from ours ? </bow.v.387><bow.v.388>Pictures of the U.S. president bowing deeply to Japanese Emperor Akihito during a state visit to Japan have incensed some commentators , who say the U.S. head of state should not lower his head before foreign crowned heads . </bow.v.388><bow.v.389>Genesis 27 : 29 Let peoples serve you , and nations bow down to you.

But to bow to that Saudi sack of c*ap that turns my stomach . </bow.v.390><bow.v.391>And then Porter stopped , pivoted back to midcourt. Right inside the O , the senior took a bow. And kept turning and bowing in every direction . </bow.v.391><bow.v.392>Sil , your comment that began , " He may have bowed , but when he stood back up again he was a head taller than those men , and they know it ... . " </bow.v.392><bow.v.393>Where it exists in societies - such as the Orcish one Rindor came to us from - where force of might still determines leadership and social hierarchy , its use seems to confirm that such exposure is the basic reason for the bow. In such societies it is a sign of weakness and total submission , an acknowledgment of another 's superiority and of laying one 's life before that other as an object. It is no wonder that one coming freshly from such a culture would be hesitant to bow . </bow.v.393><bow.v.394>Clara Bow , the saucy " It " girl of the silent screen , made her film farewell in the ragged musical drama Hoopla. Based on the stage play The Barker ( previously filmed in 1927 ) , the story takes place during the Chicago World 's Fair of 1933. Bow plays Lou , a hootchy-kootchy dancer who is catapulted into stardom by fast-talking barker Nifty ( Preston S. Foster ) . Hoping to escape her tawdry existence , Lou makes a play for handsome young naif Chris ( Richard Cromwell ) , but by film 's end she has bowed to the inevitable and returns to the sort of work she knows best. Despite excellent production values and a big-time promotional campaign , Hoopla was a bomb , convincing the ever-insecure Clara Bow to retire to private life as the wife of cowboy star and future Nevada politician Rex Bell . </bow.v.394><bow.v.395>Many Westerners , especially American tourists , lavish praise upon the Japanese for this formal politeness. But more are basing their judgment of Japanese politeness on such things as the pretty elevator and escalator girls who work in department stores and deluxe hotels. These young women , chosen for their good looks , stand and bow and repeat the same lines all day long in self-effacing , heart-rending voices that remind one of the chirping of baby birds that have fallen out of their nest . </bow.v.395><bow.v.396>Jet - Also known as " ricochet " bowing , this consists of " throwing " the bow on the string in the upper third of the bow on a down bow , so that it bounces and produces a series of rapid notes. Usually from two to six notes are sounded this way , but up to ten or eleven can be played . </bow.v.396><bow.v.397>Really , President Obama wants to be bowed to , and you know this because ? I guess if President Obama wants to be bowed to must also mean that President Bush must be gay because he smooched up the Saudis. I can deal with that French kiss on the cheek stuff , but not the mouth ! ( And no , I do n't think that for a minute about President Bush , I am just disgusted that Fox makes an issue of one and ignores the other , more intimate gesture . ) </bow.v.397><bow.v.398>Martial arts practitioners bow before getting on or off the mat , bow to the teacher and to their partners before and after training together. In Zen Buddhism , a meditator bows to their cushion before sitting and again when leaving , and joins in bowing when another meditator prepares to sit next to them . </bow.v.398><bow.v.399>**The black wolf , new to these places but familiar and devoted to the goddess Shar , walks forth and bows his head in honor and respect** Shar ... .**he wonders whether he is allowed to directly speak to a god/goddess without permission** I have gone to your temple , and I am your servant. **he also then wonders whether she knew this or not , being a goddess** ( ( no one checked the temple , so I posted it here ) ) ( NT ) -- Arkkane Ambershadow , 21 : 37 : 45 10/24/02 Thu </bow.v.399><bow.v.400>You know why Obama bowed ?

The new Martin Mercury is no toy , but a serious shooting machine built specifically with the younger generation in mind. The Martin Mercury will give your kids the confidence they need to succeed in life and in the field . </bow.v.401><bow.v.402>The tatami surface is the training surface in the dojo and as such it is important to bow there as well. Upon stepping onto the tatami , kneel down in the position known as seiza ( sitting on the heels with the back straight ) and bow putting both hands in front of the knees keeping the back straight. That bow is also required upon leaving the tatami. Furthermore , if for any important reason it is necessary to leave the tatami during the class , first ask permission from the sensei , then leave the tatami after completing a standing bow , if it is a temporary absence , or a kneeling bow if it is the end of your practice . </bow.v.402><bow.v.403>Different strokes for different folks. The prettiest bow I ever owned was a blacktail. Sorry , but I could not shoot that thing worth a damn. I sold it and bought a much less pretty bow that shoots great for me. Never regretted it. These days I do n't care much what a bow looks like. I usually beat them up pretty badly while hunting anyway. Just give me something that shoots . </bow.v.403><bow.v.404>In an attempt to include all of our exercises , let ' s go over bowing because , of all of our practices , this seems to be the most misunderstood.

Only the bowing hand is required , the left hand is useful , as a safety net for the bow , should the going get too tough ! [ click here to go back ] </bow.v.406><bow.v.407>The only place for your violin , viola , cello or bow when you are not playing is in a closed case. Some of the most serious damage we have had to repair has happened because an instrument was left on a chair , in an open case ( with a shoulder rest on ) , or worst of all , hanging on a music stand. Always be aware of what is going on around you. Serious damage can happen because a music stand hits part of an instrument. Especially vulnerable is the soft spruce top. The edges can chip and break with more ease than the harder maple back . </bow.v.407><bow.v.408>Genesis 49 : 8 " Judah , your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.

It is n't always a good idea to use the lightest and fastest arrows available because they can actually cause damage to your bow. Light arrows and heavy arrows generally absorb the same amount of energy from the bow but li ... </bow.v.410><bow.v.411>I searched the scriptures on David and bow and found in 1 Kings a perfect example. We see Bathsheeba bowing and doing reverence to David. We see the Prophet Nathan bowing to David. We see David himself bowing on his death bed. We see Adonijah bowing to Solomon . </bow.v.411><bow.v.412>If you shoot with absolutely perfect form and technique , a short brace height bow will be just as accurate as it ' s longer brace height cousins. But if you have average skills and are prone to occasional goof-ups , a bow with a little longer brace height will yield better accuracy in most shooting situations. The average new compound bow has a brace height of approximately 7 " . Bows with shorter brace heights ( 5-6.5 " ) will be faster but less forgiving to shoot. Bows with longer brace heights ( 7.5-9 " ) will generally shoot slower but will be more forgiving to your errors. Consider this carefully when choosing your new target , hunting or 3D bow. Unless you have a specific need for a blazing fast bow , you may find that a more moderate brace height will increase your enjoyment of archery and your success in the field. SPECIAL NOTE : Tall guys with draw lengths 30 " and above should be especially conscious of brace height - as a long draw length and a short brace height are a particularly bad combination , especially for new shooters . </bow.v.412><bow.v.413>If that is there culture , than he should Bow out of respect for the country. If we as americans , Had some type of respect for ourslefs or our contry , we too would have people of power bow in our presents too.

The new Glasser Braided Carbon Fibre Bow is a superlative player 's tool : responsive , quick , elegant. A seemless woven carbon fibre stick is created with a unique solid core. The carbon fibre weave presents excellent acoustic properties resembling the finest pernambuco , and the solid core aids the spring and shape of the bow , so that it responds like the very densest woods. A wooden bow of equivalent tone and response would cost thousands , due to the rarity of brazilwood of such perfect qualities. But Glasser 's patent-pending technology makes an equivalent synthetic fine bow available at a price every bowed instrument player can afford . </bow.v.414><bow.v.415>What we know about how Buddhist monks bowed in India comes in large measure from Chinese Buddhist historians such as Ven. Daoxuan ( 596-667 CE ) . In his Shimen Guijingyi " Buddhist Rule and Breviary , " he gives definitions for twelve terms of respect for the Buddhist Sangha , or monastic community. Eight of the twelve entail some form of bowing.

It ' s the Word of God. Scripture has such attributes , has such a benefit , has such an infallibility , that anybody who understands it , who is familiar with it , ought to bow in respect to it and recognize that it ' s the very Word of God.

( abbreviation for pizzicato ) in the written music , it is played by plucking the string with a finger of the right hand rather than by bowing. When the bow hand is occupied ( or for virtuosic effect ) the left hand can be used; this is indicated by a " + " ( plus sign ) in the music. This allows players to simultaneously play bowed notes while plucking on a different string.

Players continue playing pizzicato until there is an indication to return to arco ( playing with the bow ) . </bow.v.461><bow.v.462>By all means introduce whatever you want with our local people. &gt; If thats the style by which all Malaysians should follow thats OK. &gt; But if you try to do so with foreign tourists or foreigners , forget it. &gt; We know the Japanese bow to each other among themselves but do they bow to &gt; us ... &gt; they still shake hands with us and so do the Maoris. &gt; Thats the crux of the whole business of trying to introduce &gt; something foreign to a foreigner.. it wont work. &gt; </bow.v.462><bow.v.463>Now you have a proper bow hold , it is time to start bowing the strings.

Does it imply any religious significance that would compromise mine or my child 's beliefs as a Christian ? Are n't the martial arts tied to religion ? " In the case of this Dojo , the answer is an emphatic " NO ! " It is said that Karate begins and ends with RESPECT. The bowing that is involved is merely an incorporation of a cultural norm from the Okinawan culture. The bow is a show of respect that carries no religious significance in this Dojo. However , parents and students must be careful to inquire from the Instructor if they were to move to another Karate school. If I encountered a Teacher who identified bowing as having some type of religious significance , I would consider that a violation of my beliefs and could not train with that teacher . </bow.v.470><bow.v.471>The nut is a wooden block at the screw end of the stick , the original purpose of which was to keep the hair at a proper distance from the stick and to provide a secure attachment for the hair. The whole nut slides up and down the stick in a groove in answer to the screw , thus tightening or relaxing the tension of the hair. In the nut is a little cavity or chamber , into which the knotted end of the hair is firmly fixed by means of a little wedge , the hair being then brought out and flattened over the front of the nut like a ribbon by the pressure of a flat ferrule. The mother-of-pearl slide which runs along a mortised groove further protects the hair on the outside of the nut.

This could be attributed to the parallel limb design as the limbs tend to flex up and down rather than forward and backwards. Many bows on the market these days offer this design advantage.

If you are a man , your hands are glued to the sides of your body; if you are a woman , your fingertips are slightly touching in front of your body. Your feet are in a V-shape position touching at the heels and pointing outward. Lower your chin and eyes as you make a bow , especially if you are bowing to an elder or very important person.The depth of the bow shows respect and indicates the status of the two people . </bow.v.492><bow.v.493>That was certainly a bow.

As a general rule , the longer a bow is the more accurate it will be..BUT ... Try shooting a 70 " bow out of a ground blind or tree stand and you will see that size does matter ! I always try to encourage folks to shoot as long a bow as you can , more accurate sure but more comfortable as well. Less pinch on the fingers due to the string angle. Anyone that claims they have a 58 " bow that has no finger pinch is blowing smoke or it 's a radical forward handle design that hurts performance ! A 70 " bow will pinch if you draw it back far enough. The more comfortable and fun the bow is to shoot , the more you will like practicing with it. If something starts to hurt after only a few shots , the fun is gone. Having a 30 " draw , I prefer a 64 " or 66 " bow for still hunting or targets but for tree stands or blinds I shoot a 62 " or 64 " . So , choose a length as long as possible for the kind of shooting you will use it for most . </bow.v.494><bow.v.495>Matthew 2 : 2 saying , 'Where is he who was born king of the Jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and we came to bow to him.

The tips of the limbs may consist of a single curve for the longbow , or be bent back upon themselves in the recurve bow. The recurve allows for greater draw weight with shorter limbs , but this places greater strain on the limb materials and may increase string noise when shot. Decurve bows , where the tips bend towards the archer , provide proportionally lower draw weights but may be made with relatively poor materials . </bow.v.496><bow.v.497>There are other companies which make great carbon bows ( easier to narrow down than wood bows , of which there are variations from one to the next in the same line ) but I have narrowed it down to these two.

Remember that all performance data comes from a bow with a draw of 30 inches. Archers with longer draw lengths will realize more speed from a similar bow , whereas those with shorter draw lengths will see less speed from the same model. How much performance is lost in shorter draw lengths depends on the design of the bow. It is always in your best interest to test shoot bows , ones that are correctly set up for you , to decide what bow best suits your needs . </bow.v.500><bow.v.501>The gesture Namaste represents the belief that there is a Divine spark within each of us that is located in the heart chakra.

I wonder if there are any scholar studies that attempt to quantify the strategic benefit of public acts of kindness ( read : weakness ) to despots and monarchs alike ? Cost-benefit wise , if something as trivial as a bow actually has a significant impact on building a rapport with a foreign leader , than so be it. If these actions shape the inter-personal dynamic between the leaders constructively , than these ( hopefully ) empty-gestures are somewhat ingenious. I would believe the bow was a naive attempt at good faith with zero baggage , but the fact that he keeps doing it is pretty inexcusable. As long as he does n't start bowing to the Mullahs , ill write this off as inconsequential , especially compared to the litany of objectively valid complaints I have with his policy . </bow.v.502><bow.v.503>Hoyt is one of the big players when it comes to bow hunting and archery.

Exodus 20 : 4 &amp;5 reads , " You shall not make for yourself a carved image ... .. you shall not bow down to them nor serve them ... .. " The word used for " serve " can also be translated " worship. " Bowing represents a cultural norm that is an expression of worship.

Dr. Theodore Fujita , a professor at the University of Chicago , coined the term " bow echo " in the late 1970s. The terminology was based on how bands of rain showers or thunderstorms " bow out " when strong damaging winds reach the surface and spread out like pancake batter. The bowed rain band is near the leading edge of the damaging winds. The storm system that Dr. Fujita based the " bow echo " terminology on was the one that resulted in a strong derecho affecting northern Wisconsin and adjacent states on July 4 , 1977 . </bow.v.520><bow.v.521>...

Is it possible to create a support fixture for printing that has relief that will allow the flex to bow downward instead of upward ? If the bow is on the top of the ridgid PCB , I would suggest doing what you had mentioned , recutting the stencil with relief around the bulge.

Amusing , too , how easily so many let their personal fears inform their complaint. There is a ton of literature on bowing protocol in Japan -- and Bill Bennett 's meaning for a bow ( I 'm subservient ! Less of a rule than you ! Hell , less of a man than you !

At that level in politics I believe all dignitaries are equal ... king , queen , president , prime minister , etc. There should still be a certain level of formality ( though happily not in politics I do n't know what that is or what it would look like ) . I think a good question would be , " should an American in a foreign country bow/prostrate/etc. ? " I think my take on it would be that if you are residing in another country you are abiding by the laws of that land. If they bow then I bow. Its like when you are in court and rise when the judge enters the courtroom , courtesy and respect are reflected in that gesture . </bow.v.532><bow.v.533>Increasing pressure on the strings is the primary way to produce louder notes on the violin. Pressure is added mainly by the index finger of the bowing hand. Another method sometimes used to increase volume is using greater bow speed; however , it is important to note that a violinist can increase bow speed and still play softly at the same time. The two methods are not equivalent , because they produce different timbres; pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher , more intense sound . </bow.v.533><bow.v.534>Watch karate fighters , they bow to each other before every fight.

Also , remember that class time is precious - if your question can wait until the end of class , save it until then. As a point of reference do not bow every time you see a senior rank , it can be very tiresome for the teacher as every time a student bows the teacher has to bow back ( remember there are lots of students which in turn means lots of bowing ) . </bow.v.535><bow.v.536>After a brief and almost unnoticed costume change , the band returned to the stage for one last song - the prophetic Bald - after which they threw stuff into the crowd , took a bow , then bowed out triumphantly. A very gracious band , The Darkness ' biggest asset is their personality , not only for how it shapes their music into such balls of fun , but also how it shines from the stage.

Eric Halfpenny , writing in the 1988 Encyclopaedia Britannica , says " bowing can be traced as far back as the Islamic civilization of the 10th century ... it seems likely that the principle of bowing originated among the nomadic horse riding cultures of Central Asia , whence it spread quickly through Islam and the East , so that by 1000 it had almost simultaneously reached China , Java , North Africa , the Near East and Balkans , and Europe. " Halfpenny notes that in many Eurasian languages the word for " bridge " etymologically means " horse , " and that the Chinese regarded their own bowed instruments ( huqin ) as having originated with the " barbarians " of Central Asia . </bow.v.537><bow.v.538>Martel , literally " hammered , " is a bowstroke , used when playing bowed string instruments.

After experimenting with several styles I finally found the winning combination. Instead of letting my wrist buckle when I drew the bow , I tried to keep it straight - in line with my forearm.

Unfortunately , in our attempts to emulate traditional Japanese etiquette we seem to overdo it , especially when one observes the amount of bowing that occurs in many traditional dojos in Japan. To illustrate , after class begins , you do not have to bow every time you approach the instructor. Bowing is not required every time the teacher tells you to move from here to there. As well , you do not have to bow every time you are corrected or given instruction. After the formal bows , which will be described below , try to take a minimalist approach to bowing. Central to budo is the quest for spiritual and personal development where one is truly humble. Over-engaging in bowing simply appears to be an expression of false modesty and humility. The bow should be reserved for sincere moments when giri ( sense of duty ) and reigi ( etiquette ) dictates that this courtesy be paid . </bow.v.556><bow.v.557>How low can you go ?

Although energy is being dissipated into sound and heat , somehow the bow is supplying additional energy at exactly the right rate to compensate. This is one identifying sign of a non-linear system , for which the idea of adding contributions from different vibration modes can not be applied in the simple way described above. The theory of such systems is always more intricate , and there is scope for very complicated outcomes and chaotic behaviour ( read more about chaos in Issue 26 ) . The range of good and bad noises which can be made on a violin string are examples of these complicated outcomes. The same general comments apply equally well to other musical instrument capable of a sustained tone such as the woodwind and brass instruments . </bow.v.561><bow.v.562>How do they do that ?

' In this article we hope to remove some of the supposed mysticism surrounding the experience within a dojo and explain the ' reiho ' or ' etiquette ' used as well as the reasons why . </bow.v.585><bow.v.586>Bowing originated as a gesture of subordination , as lowering the head leaves the bower vulnerable. This was particularly the case in Asian cultures such as the Samurai 's Tokugawa Shogun period in Japan. This was the period of which Samurais were at the height of a highly stratified society; as they increasingly became courtiers , bureaucrats , and administrators rather than warriors . </bow.v.586><bow.v.587>Generally when bowing in close proximity , as necessitated when combining bowing and shaking hands , people turn slightly to one side ( usually the left ) to avoid bumping heads. Also , bows that deep usually require the other to reciprocate , acknowledging the bow with another bow. The president , taller than his counterpart , more than likely assessed the logistics and reconnoitered with this rendition.The emperor , who is smiling broadly , is , too , in fact guilty of not maintaining Japanese style etiquette.

Plastic hair that works is available , but does n't bite and grip the string as horsehair does. The horsehair is carefully washed , then sorted to remove as much as possible of the wavy , curly , and uneven sized hairs , so the finished ribbon in the bow is perfectly smooth. The hair is held in place by the undercut mortises and wedge-blocks. No glue is used , and the blocks must fit perfectly , so pulling on the hair simply locks them tighter. You should be very cautious about getting your bow rehaired , and find someone with good references from symphony players and teachers that you can trust to not damage the bow. Many bows have the head split , or the hair glued in , or the mortises cut out by unqualified " handymen " . This is bad for an inexpensive beginners bow , but is a serious and expensive disaster for a premium bow worth thousands of dollars . </bow.v.590><bow.v.591>In modern times , however , bowing in Korea is a part of everyday life.

" </bow.v.592><bow.v.593>In the model the action of a bow and arrow combination is fixed by one point in a high dimensional parameter space. Representations of different types of bow used in the past and in our time form clusters in this parameter space. We study the performance of different types of bow and start with a straight-end bow described by Klopsteg.1 This bow is referred to as the KL-bow. The shape of the KL-bow for various draw lengths is shown in Figure 1a. The AN-bow represents another non-recurve bow , the Angular bow found in Egypt and Assyria. The shape of the unstrung bow , shown in Figure 1b , implies that in the braced situation the limbs and the string form the characteristic triangular shape. We consider two static-recurve bows , one from China , India and Persia , to be called the PE-bow , and one which resembles a Turkish flight bow , to be called the TU-bow. The shapes of these bows for various drawlengths are shown in Figure 2. One of the working-recurve bows , to be called the ER-bow , possesses an excessive recurve. It resembles a bow described and shot by Hickman.1 </bow.v.593><bow.v.594>Single Cam- they have an idler wheel at the top and a cam at the bottom. They tend to be slower than the Twin Cam and can have a harder draw curve. This means that a 60 bow feels like a 70 bow to draw. They tend to have one really long string 100+ " which can cause some problems. Single Cam bows tend to have a very solid draw wall. We have experienced problems with lower limb twist and string wear on these bows </bow.v.594><bow.v.595>When the brothers first meet Yosef without Yaakov , they encounter him as the mashbirthe one who sustains. They need food; Yosef has plenty. They bow to him in awareness of his unique ability to sustain them during a ravaging famine. This is why , in the dream , it was their sheaves bowing to his; their deference is not to him but to what he has , food. Who he is at this stage is inconsequential. Thus , in real-life , they bow to him anonymously . </bow.v.595><bow.v.596>its funny we will bow to a relative of osama bin laden ... ..we will spill american soldiers blood on foreign soil in iraq ... .but we wont drill for oil on the northern slope of alaska ... ..save the carabou ... .i hope to live and see the day when the saudis are bowing to us because we dont need thier oil anymore ... .i wonder with all the efforts to find alternative energy sources why the democrats havent suggested to lower the national speed limit to 55 ... ..that would lower our fuel consumption by 10 to 15 percent ... ..but wait we might lose some tax revenue by doing that even though it would decrease our carbon footprint ... .atypical politicians ... ..by the way if that wasnt a bow then im the queen of england and please bring me my new ipod </bow.v.596><bow.v.597>The formal bow requires that the body be bent to about thirty degrees , with the hands close together , palms down , on the knees. Ordinarily the person who is bowing holds this pose for only two or three seconds , then automatically returns to the upright positions. If the other party remains bowed for a longer period , it is polite for the recipient to bow again. The recipient is often the superior who will generally respond to a formal bow with a fifteen-degree bow. The other party may bow a second and a third time. Synchronizing the bows so that both parties rise at approximately the same time can be tricky and sometimes is unintentionally embarrassing . </bow.v.597><bow.v.598>Prior to entering the dojo , one bows at the genkan ( entrance way ) to the dojo. Dojo means " way place / location. " It is the place ( i.e. , the training area ) within the school where one strives to learn the " way. " This bow is not to given to provide consideration to the inanimate objects like the tatami or walls , rather it is a way of paying respect to what the dojo stands for. Moreover , you should bow with the purpose of being contemplative about the reasons you are training. It is a time to make a pledge to attempt to give as much of yourself as possible before starting to train . </bow.v.598><bow.v.599>Okay , the first thing you should do is lay your bow down with the back facing up ( See ?

In many situations , the standing bow has replaced the kowtow. However , in modern Chinese societies , bowing is not as formalized as in Japan and Korea. Bowing is normally reserved for occasions such as marriage ceremonies [ 1 ] and as a gesture of respect for the deceased [ 2 ] . In both the People 's Republic of China and the Republic of China , three bows are customarily executed at funerals including state funerals [ 3 ] , ancestral worship , and at special ceremonies in commemoration of pater patriae Sun Yat-sen [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . </bow.v.604><bow.v.605>I bow to various people touch and seeks the blessings of parents/elders and random aunts and uncle and so does my spouse and kids.

The origin of the recurve bow design traces back to Asia around 2 , 000 BC. This design allowed archers to achieve the arrow speeds of a much longer bow with a significantly smaller package. For mounted archers , this was the answer to many problems. Traditionally , recurve bows are a composite of materials. It is difficult to achieve the desired shape out of a single piece of material. Laminates and composite construction were often utilized. Modern recurves are universally of laminate construction. They feature limbs that are relatively wide and quite thin , with the limb tips jutting far forward of the grip when the bow is unstrung. One of the defining characteristics of the recurve bow , is the way the string and limbs interact. With the longbow there are only two points of contact between the end loops of the string and the limb. In a recurve design , the string will often contact the limb for a few inches at each end , with the end loops being pulled far ahead of the string. The force of the limbs is exerted more vertically in recurve designs , reducing hand shock and increasing arrow speeds . </bow.v.606><bow.v.607>How ridiculous to think that an American should bow to the queen ! It is not at all a sign of disrespect; we are simply not her subjects. Nor does she expect it.

Put the top loop over the top end of the bow and let it slide down a few inches. Put the knot on the bottom end of the bow and tighten it in the two slots , the nock.

All other things being equal , a 70 bow will store more energy and shoot faster than a 60 bow. However , this is a complicated issue you should consider carefully when selecting your new compound bow. The maximum draw weight of the bow is typically determined by the stiffness of the bow ' s limbs. Compound bows come in a variety of maximum draw weights , but the most common are the 50-60 and 60-70 versions. Although you may purchase a bow with 70 limbs , you can generally adjust the draw weight 1-10 down from the maximum weight. So a 70 bow could actually be adjusted for 61 , 64 , 67 , or any draw weight within the allowable range. However , it should be noted that a 70 bow , turned down to 60 , will not perform as well as the same bow in a 60 version operating at it ' s maximum draw weight. Bows are generally more efficient at or near their maximum draw weight . </bow.v.614><bow.v.615>When a technique is being taught , the students kneel quickly.

Today this custom of bowing based on rank is followed even in the smallest karate dojo . </bow.v.622><bow.v.623>Brace height is the distance between the string and the back of the riser. It can be affected by the shape of the riser , the length of the bow 's limbs , or a combination of both. Generally speaking , bows with a larger brace height are more forgiving , and therefore slightly more accurate and easier to shoot than bows with shorter brace heights. The reason for this is that the shorter the brace height , the longer your arrow stays on the string after you have released it , therefore amplifying any imperfections in form or bow tuning. Most archers today seem to be most comfortable with a brace height near 7 inches . </bow.v.623><bow.v.624>The position of the arm and bow holding wrist is critical. The bow holding arm should be straight out to the side , the elbow locked straight and the wrist locked straight in line. It is very important to keep your shoulders and bow arm aligned straight and hold that position while shooting and until you see or hear your arrow hit your target. Do not try to watch the arrow in flight , unless you are having accuracy problems and need to see if your arrow wobbles in flight. If you need to move your aim to the left or right , move your entire upper body in a single motion. Do not move your arm at the shoulder that will change the length of your draw and cause poor accuracy and maybe a nasty welt on your forearm . </bow.v.624><bow.v.625>Bowing in judo today has no religious significance. It is simply a mark of respect to your fellow judoka , coach and opponents.

Actually , the two types of bows are the same in their basic proportions. The differences are the result of the difference in the sizes of the used horn materials. Because of that , the structure of the bows had to be changed. In the Turkish and Scythian bows the horn material was all along the bows and the rigid tips were formed out og the bending limbs. ( 2/3 ) . In case of the Hunnish or Avar bows the horn is only on the limbs of the bow. The handle and the tips had to be strengthened with bone or hornplates. Because these bows are strengthened they had to be made larger to obtain the same drawlength. So the siyah of a Hungarian type bow is not much longer than that of a Turkish type bow , because to the siyah of the Turkish bow we have to add the part of the limb which bends in a negative way . </bow.v.628><bow.v.629>This seems the right time for me to bow out.

I also believe that it is good for students to raise such questions and would especially encourage doing so since another Instructor at another school may , in fact , consider bowing or other aspects of his particular system to have some religious significance to either an Eastern religion or New Age teaching.

It is a misconception , though , to think that the worshipper is bowing to a statue of the Buddha , to a wooden or stone or clay image.

Namas comes from the verbal root nam which means to bow and so namas is a bow or salutation. Te means , to you. And so namaste literally means , bowing to you. There is a variation of this in the form namaskara. The Sanskrit word kara means , doing. So namaskara literally means , doing salutations. Many Hindus say that when they do namaste they are bowing to the soul ( atma ) and God ( paramatma ) within and not to the body without. By contrast shaking hands is a gesture of respect to the body , whereas in Hinduism bowing to the soul within is considered more important. Hence , namaste is made with two hands held together at the heart where the soul is said to reside . </bow.v.661><bow.v.662>The first and most important part of archery shooting is to be in the proper stance.

A different case involved Peter , who recognized that it was not appropriate for Cornelius to bow down to ( proskuneo; worship ) him , even though Cornelius respected Peter. Peter felt he was not superior to Cornelius , and accepting the worship would have sent the wrong message to Cornelius , so he stopped him ( Acts 10 : 25 and 26 ) .

The uncurling or unbending of the curved tips of a recurved bow lends to a smooth drawing bow , white at the time of the string release these curved tips have another advantage. Immediately after the release the string comes into contact with the curved ends and the bow then has the thrust action of a short heavier bow and the string momentum increases; thus greater acceleration is transmitted to the arrow; hence greater speed and a flatter trajectory. With a straight limbed bow , the string leaves the hand at its maximum acceleration and never has an increase of speed . </bow.v.724><bow.v.725>The Extender sight allows the archer to move the rifle sight rearward as far as the bow cables allow plus move the front sight forward as far as the bow case allows giving you a greater distance between sights.

Every time you bow in the dojo , you should understand that you have identified this process and are earning your proficiency the old fashion way through hard work , discipline and respect . </bow.v.729><bow.v.730>The early bow ( sometimes referred to as the " baroque " bow ) is based on the oldest and most obvious of designs , and has a curve that bows away from the hair. This type of bow was in common use until some time in the early 19th century , when the modern bow came into use. Although their design made these bows agile and responsive , their delicacy was not suitable for the pressure needed for louder and more forceful playing. As the concert halls and orchestras became larger , the violin family instruments received subtle modifications to suit the demands of the great performers. No modification was possible for the early bow however , and it suffered a swift extinction at the hand of the modern bow. After the modern bow 's inception , the early bow became &amp;Amost unheard of until it was revived in the late 1960s by early music enthusiasts seeking to recreate the ambiance of that time period . </bow.v.730><bow.v.731>It is pretty obvious that he bowed , but at worst , it is just a gaffe on Obama 's part.

The rule of thumb is that the center of the motor section should be submerged 9 " . In general , shaft length selection is more critical with bow-mount motors versus transom-mount motors. Most boat transoms are similar in their distance to the water , and Minn Kota ' s standard transom shaft lengths should be adequate. With bow-mounted motors , there is much greater variation in shaft length requirements. Measure down from the mounting surface of the transom or bow to the water level. Add 5 " to waterline measurement for fishing in rough water. Add 12 " to waterline measurement for steering a hand control motor while standing. Use this measurement and the tables below to find the appropriate shaft length . </bow.v.732><bow.v.733>What a disgrace to the office of the Presidency !

Mr. Obama is a former law professor and a very good student of history. He should know better. I support his presidency , but this is clearly unacceptable. The President should apologize or explain his actions to the American People. To often today we tend to trivialize those time honored traditions we fought so hard to establish as being merely formalities devoid of any real substance. But we should all remember regardless of political affiliation that in our country countless have died for the principal that in America no man or woman is subject to any lord , noble , or king. As such , the President regardless who he is or how popular he may be , should honor those who have paid the ultimate price to establish freedom from tyranny by at a minimum respecting our time honored tradition of never bowing to any head of state . </bow.v.745><bow.v.746>2 ) Bow to the Worthy Ones.

However , the true function of a stabilizer is much more than that. According to Bill Leven , owner of Doinker Stabilizers , vibration dampening is only part of the equation. There is no question that a stabilizer helps reduce hand shock , bow noise and vibration , but one of the main reasons bowhunters should hunt with a stabilizer is because it helps keep a bow steady and stable when shooting. That ' s why it ' s called a stabilizer , Leven explained . </bow.v.752><bow.v.753>Your not president of the United States either .and only a fellow Muslim would bow to the King of Saudi You wouldn ' t see the Prime Minister of Isreal bowing to him ! ! ! </bow.v.753><bow.v.754>The real problem with this bowing stuff - especially in the public school system - is that it turns the society into little more than a self-fulfilling prophesy of social stagnation. Like Pavlov ' s dogs , people are turned into lemmings , blindly following the lemming in front of them without asking why. Students have absolutely no idea why they are bowing to their teacher except for the fact that for hundreds of years other people before them have been doing the same thing. Without a reason or purpose for asking why they are doing this , or perhaps there ' s a better or more socially realistic way of showing respect , they are like Little Eichmann ' s just following the orders of their superiors who themselves may not know why they do the things they do . </bow.v.754><bow.v.755>Once one understands the meaning and intention behind the bow , it ' s easy to refute the somewhat ridiculous ( in more ways than one ) argument that President Obama wants America to appear submissive in the eyes of Japan.

We have had good results bracing children as young as two years old. Usually by the age of three , treatment will require a tibial osteotomy ( surgery of the tibia ) to straighten the lower extremity. Many will wait and " see how it goes " , and let the most effective bracing period go right by. In a special parallax-free three exposure x-ray of the full leg from hip to ankle , with the knee carefully aimed straight ahead , a line through hip and ankle centers ought to pass through knee center. If that line passes outside the bone of the knee , then the angulation will worsen with time and not self-correct. We have seen no such reversals in that subset of children. We prefer to brace as bracing early not only works better but heads off the addition damage to the inner growth plate caused by the angular mechanical ( nut cracker ) compression caused by the bowed leg . </bow.v.759><bow.v.760>" 1 ) The first is 'arrogant bowing ' , and describes a person who , although he or she bows to the Buddha , still has a mark of a self. When someone like this bows to the Buddha , it is forced and is accompanied by thoughts like this : 'What am I doing bowing to the Buddha ? Why do I have to bow to him ? ' A person like this becomes annoyed at being forced to put his head down. He sees everyone else bowing and feels that if he does not bow along with them , he will stand out , and so out of embarrassment he bows to the Buddha. Although he bows , his mark of self is still not empty; on the contrary , he is filled with arrogance. . . . </bow.v.760><bow.v.761>Smaller scale bow echoes frequently can be detected from visual observations.

Bowing to the mat is standard in judo and I feel is rather offensive. I do n't think at this point anyone can deny the significance of bowing to the mat is beyond a handshake. It is most definitely an act fraught with religious connotations. The same is true about bowing to pictures and so on. Many Judeo-Christian religions would say this is idolatry. Then there is bowing to the flag of another nation. I was at a TKD school and they lined up all the kids and had them bow to a Korean flag. I look at the parents in the gallery; expecting some sharp objections. There were none. I remain to this day shocked and outraged. Do you think if you opened an American Martial Arts school in Korea they would bow to an American flag ? Of course not , nor should they. Likewise it is just sick and wrong to bow your head before the flag of another nation. It is damn near treason . </bow.v.768><bow.v.769>In a survival situation you may need meat immediately.

It goes back to what Jesus was saying in Matt 5 : 27-28. Even if the person does absolutely nothing , but were to turn the Icon into some sort of god and pledge his allegiance to it , he would be worshiping an idol even if he never fell down in prostration before it. This is exactly what has happened when " cults " have started. A man is turned into a god , is worshiped by the people , and instead of stopping them he enjoys it for it boost his ego. They may not bow to him , or kiss him , or prostrate themselves to him , but they worship him all the same and are condemned for it. It is from the heart that true worship takes place , either for the one true God or some other god . </bow.v.772><bow.v.773>If you have to leave early for any reason , please be polite and let us know the reason and when you will need to leave before class begins.

You should not see a white cloud of rosin come off the bow when you play. Once there is too much rosin in the hair , it is nearly impossible to get out. When you use too much rosin , it will build up on the strings and your sound can become very scratchy -- since you are essentially playing with rosin on rosin. Also , rosin can build up on your instrument and damage the varnish over time. To avoid this , it is important to wipe off your instrument , strings and bow shaft with a clean soft cloth each time you finish playing. Microfiber cloths work great for this . </bow.v.777><bow.v.778>A " squall line " refers to a linearly-oriented zone of convection ( i.e. , thunderstorms ) . Squall lines are common across the United States east of the Rockies , especially during the spring when the atmosphere is most " dynamic. " A " bow echo " or " bowing line segment " is an arched/bowed out line of thunderstorms , sometimes embedded within a squall line. Bow echoes , most common in the spring and summer , usually are associated with an axis of enhanced winds that create straight-line wind damage at the surface. In fact , bow echo-induced winds/downbursts account for a large majority of the structural damage resulting from convective non-tornadic winds. Transient tornadoes also can occur in squall lines , especially in association with bow echoes. These tornadoes , however , tend to be weaker and shorter-lived on average than those associated with supercell thunderstorms. Severe squall lines and bow echoes are quite common in the Ohio Valley , including Kentucky. A sequence of WSR-88D Doppler radar images and discussions from some squall line/bow echo events across Kentucky and south-central Indiana are available to complement this document. Detailed squall line and bow echo information is given below , including pre-storm environments , and WSR-88D radar reflectivity , velocity , and mesocyclone characteristics . </bow.v.778><bow.v.779>Confucianism has had a very strong influence on all aspects of Korean society. One ancient Confucian tradition that still remains today is the notion of bowing to elders as a sign of respect , known as Jeol. There are various types of Jeols , and which one you use depends on the formality of the situation and the people involved. For example , when two people meet for the first time , the usual greeting is for both people to do a small Jeol , nodding their head while leaning their upper body forward a bit. It is used in the same way as a handshake . </bow.v.779><bow.v.780>I saw the footage from another angle and it most definately is a bow to the Saudi king. I have heard some people say that it is a sign of respect to a king who deserves such because he is the king. My problem with that is that by bowing to a foreign king , he just disrespected every American. The very people he is supposed to be representing. I really don ' t care what his reason was for doing it , I personally believe that it was very wrong. Also , the media that deny he did it are obviously lying to us. Do they really think that we are so stupid that we wouldn ' t be able to tell that it was a bow and not picking up a quarter or bending to tie his shoes ?

Instead of the normal solid tone a wispy-sounding overtone note of a higher pitch is heard. Each node is at an integer division of the string , for example exactly half-way along the length of the string , or exactly one-third along the length of the string. The pitch produced in these two cases will be an octave higher in the case of halves , and an octave and a fifth higher in the case of the string vibrating in thirds. A responsive instrument will provide numerous possible harmonic nodes along the length of the string . </bow.v.781><bow.v.782>Great posts. We only bow down to God , never a human being.

To do that we are going to inject the box with expanding foam. To make certain the foam does not push the box or bow out of shape , tie the top of the box together with a section of aluminum sheet metal. It is important to keep the tang area open to allow for the routing operation. Once the sheet metal is in place , drill a few relief holes along the bottom of the box and inject the foam. Set the bow aside and allow the foam to cure overnight . </bow.v.784><bow.v.785>When the President steps outside of internationally known American protocol and tradition in a country that embodies the concept of protocol and tradition , that sets the head of state being bowed to on the alert ... what does the unprecedented bow signify ?

But Solomon sent word that if Adonijah would do what was right , then Adonijah ' s life would be spared. So Adonijah came and worshipped , bowed down to , Solomon the king as an act of honor and respect , implying that he would be obedient. Actually , Adonijah ' s gesture was insincere , and he ended up being put to death ( 1 Kings 2 : 25 ) . Bowing insincerely would be similar to calling Jesus Lord but then not doing what he said to do ( Matt. 7 : 21-23 ) .

In consequence of the flexure given to the stick , Tourte found it necessary to readjust the proportions and relative height of head and nut , in order to keep the hair at a satisfactory distance from the stick , and at the necessary angle in attacking the strings so as to avoid contact between stick and strings in bowing. In order to counterbalance the consequent increased weight of the head and to keep the centre of gravity nearer the hand , Tourte loaded the nut with metal inlays or ornamental designs . </bow.v.789><bow.v.790>It seems to me Obama 's bowing to the Saudi king was a violation of , if not the letter , certainly the spirit of the Constitutional prohibition against accepting emoluments from foreign powers.

This is especially true of any dotted , or even double dotted rhythmic scale that is played at the extreme tip or heel of the bow. The bow can even be held upside to make things more of a challenge , as this extra heaviness in the bow hold makes the fingers work harder to get a result. Over exaggeration is the key here to help the bowing fingers and wrist to loosen up. With dotted scales , each note can be repeated at least twice , i.e. each note is crochet consisting of the same two notes in a dotted pattern , to get enough time to practice the bowing technique. In order to get a fast and fluid scale going , the scale itself can be practiced with single notes as normal , but first dotted one way , and then dotted the other to even out any discrepancies over timing and to highlight any areas where the notes are not yet securely known . </bow.v.791><bow.v.792>Although we sell some lower cost fiberglass bows , if you are looking for something that will reward your good shots with repeatable accuracy the Polaris Wooden Take-down Bow is our recommended bow of choice.

Reflex limbs are also found on nearly every new bow in the marketplace. For these modern bows , a long stabilizer is overkill. Instead , a stabilizer in the 4-to-10 inch range will be effective , functional , and certainly practical for nearly any bowhunting scenario. Adding a well-built 6-inch stabilizer to a properly tuned bow will , in many cases , result in smaller arrow groups. Other benefits include reduced hand shock and bow vibration , minimized torque , and decreased noise. Scientists and experts who test bow noise and vibration know that bows will always produce noise , but agree that by adding a quality stabilizer , you can reap many benefits . </bow.v.793><bow.v.794>One performs this gesture of respect whenever his or her teacher permits it.

Peccatte ' s two most well known pupils were Joseph Henry and Pierre Simon. Henry produced a bow similar to a Peccatte but of a somewhat lower general quality. Henry bows sometimes play very well but with the occasional exception seem slightly coarse by comparison with a fine Peccatte.

The horse hair of the bow does n't go between the two strings , instead , the instrument and the way of playing is more similar to cello than to erhu. The instrument was originally made from a horse head for the body , horse skin for the resonator , and horse hair for the strings and bow. The music played upon this instrument is of great variety and virtuosity. Much of the music typically sounds like human voice , and can imitate a horse to such an extent as real such as galloping horse , the whinnying , etc. The modern Morin Khur has a wooden body and soundboard , 2 horse hair strings , and has a rich warm tone and very beautiful sound. The peghead is decorated with a detailed carving of a horse 's head . </bow.v.811><bow.v.812>Thus , bowing in Asian Buddhist practice is real and significant. Given the centrality of bowing in Buddhism , it is a curious anomaly that Westerners who seek the Buddha 's Way so seldom encounter bowing. Just as bowing has been largely ignored by academics , so too , has it been overlooked by Buddhist practitioners. What happened to bowing as it was imported to the West ? </bow.v.812><bow.v.813>Bowing in Korean culture has different aspects to it than in other East Asian cultures. It is an especially integral part during martials arts , religious services dedicated to the dead , and formalized holidays. Unlike in the Japanese tea ceremony , a central approach to tea in Korea is an easy and natural coherence , with fewer formal rituals , fewer absolutes , greater freedom for relaxation , and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas , services , and conversation. As a result , other than a bow of greeting and departure , bowing is not an integral aspect of the Korean tea ceremony . </bow.v.813><bow.v.814>Shuowen Jiezi was the earliest etymological dictionary of the Chinese language , written by Xushen ( 58-147 CE ) . The earliest definitions of words used for various forms of bowing appear in the Shuowen.

Duan Yuzai researched etymological sources and clarified the terms used to describe bowing. Duan identifies Nine Styles of Bows from the Zhouli into divides them into two categories. The first is three methods of bowing; the second is six situations where one applies the three methods singly or in combination . </bow.v.814><bow.v.815>At the Sortor Bushido Kai dojo , karate has nothing to do with an organized religion. You can maintain your faith in its entirety , whatever it may be , and participate in every aspect of karate without any threat to your conscience. When we bow or close our eyes in a manner that appears to be prayerful ( see section below ) , our actions have nothing to do with worship or any spiritual belief system. Our system of karate is not based on any Chinese religion , nor does it involve any sort of Sensei-worship or other religious elements . </bow.v.815><bow.v.816>The reason you subject yourself to hard training is because you care about yourself , and to care about yourself is to respect yourself.

This feeling of respect is " Osu " ! </bow.v.816><bow.v.817>I am born in Ohio , my father was a paratrooper in in WWII , I am a lifelong Republican.

In Japan a bow is a language in itself. My landlady in Tokyo spent a lot of time teaching me the different shades of meaning to bowing , and while I cant say I fully learned what they seemed to know instinctively , I can say that the potential for unwitting offense was more prominent at the back of my mind while bowing than respect , even though as a foreigner I was always given a pass . </bow.v.819><bow.v.820>Recently , I was travelling in an automobile that had a small toy dog mounted upon the dash.

Throughout the trip , the head kept bobbing up and down and I was reminded of classes at the dojo where students and instructors alike are forever bobbing their heads and/or torsos up and down performing this action we call " rei " , often appearing just like this bobble-head dog. It occurred to me that we bow far too much in the Western world in our attempts to emulate our art after our Asian teachers. This appears especially true when one sees the amount of bowing that actually occurs in many of the Japanese dojos . </bow.v.820><bow.v.821>Barack Obama does n't depend on a teleprompter 100 of the time just to make sense; He did n't claim that the US have 57 states; He did n't claim the US invented the automobile; He did n't hire a bountiful of lobbyists; He did n't joke about the disabled; He did n't sing a gazillion dollars in earmarks in the omnibus spending package while denouncing them; He did n't add signing statements into bills while denouncing signing statements; His budget does n't quadruple the deficit he criticized; He did n't consider having the VA charge veterans for service-related injuries; He did n't thank himself while reading his dear teleprompter during the visit of Ireland 's Prime Minister; He did n't claim that Tim Geithner is doing a " heckuva job; " He did n't know about the AIG bonuses which he signed into law; He did n't claim that Austrian is a language; He did n't bow to the Saudi King ... and the abject show goes on . </bow.v.821><bow.v.822>Two hours later at the end of her first class Cathy has a pretty good idea of when , where , and why we all bow so often.

With " aiki " , we learn to use the energy of our partner. In this light , we see our partner as a welcome guest instead of an opponent. We work together to learn something. Uke , traditionally the more senior student , gives tori , the junior student , an opportunity to learn a way of controlling a situation. Hence , the person with which we practice is considered someone we can trust. It is someone with whom we entrust our body and depend upon for our immediate well-being. All this is done so that he or she is able to learn. In over 30 years of martial arts study , I have met many Japanese masters , some for whom I had tremendous respect. My experience was that all of these senior Sensei never maintained eye contact with me during the execution of bowing , including both in the dojo and outside of it.

Some manufacturers like Bowtech , Browning , Martin , PSE and a few others tend to design their bows to use solid limbs. Other manufacturers like Alpine , High Country , Pearson , and Reflex , mainly utilize split limb designs on their bows. A few manufacturers even mix it up and offer both. Solid limb proponents claim that solid limbs are more durable , offer better torsional stiffness , and are more accurate than split limbs. Split limb proponents claim that split limb bows are lighter , faster , and produce less hand-shock than solid limbs. While there may be some marginal or theoretical evidence to support each of these positions , in the real world , solid and split limb bows perform similarly. Whatever your preference , limb type should be a minor consideration compared to the other bow design characteristics we 've discussed. Weigh this bow attribute lightly. Beyond the aesthetic appeal , it probably does n't matter , as one type is likely to perform about as well as the other under most circumstances . </bow.v.850><bow.v.851>To Barbara ...

So , for example , if you want to shoot with a Hunnish bow you do n't have to put a horse between your legs. Traditional horsebows were n't made in this way because of the horses. The sizes of the available materials ( horn -wood - sinew ) that were used for making bows defined the sizes of the bows. Some people think that if they use a recurve bow on horseback they need a weaker one than for field archery , but in my opinion it is not true. There is an optimal strength for everybody independent of all the circumstances . </bow.v.857><bow.v.858>Much importance should be attached to the salutation which is an integral part of training in Tang Soo Do. Each member should bow to his instructor , to senior members , and also to his opponents. He should not lose self-control , prudence , or composure. Before and after exercise or contest , the participants should turn around adjusting their uniform , return and then bow to the opponent or instructor and wait in Choon Bee Jaseh ( ready stance ) . While seated on the floor , members should keep a proper posture conducive to health. Hands should be placed on the knees , the back should be straight , and the legs should be crossed in front with the feet tucked beneath the thighs. During practice , members should observe proper protocol and orderliness . </bow.v.858><bow.v.859>Then King Solomon sent men , and they brought him down from the altar.

Most of the time I tell them to wait a few years because all polishes have some kind of oil or wax in them. This is good and helps the violin look better , but it does n't help it play any better. Therefore , it is best to keep your NEW violin dust-free with a soft , dry cloth. If you get oil or wax on the strings or bow hair the violin will not play correctly. If you must clean and polish the violin be very careful not to get any polish on the strings , or bow hair. I always clean the violin with Xylene. Most good paint stores have Xylene. TEST A SMALL AREA FIRST ( near the chin rest and end button ) . Certain varnishes can be damaged. Use a small amount with a tissue in a well-ventilated area , very briefly. Breathing it can be hazardous to your health . </bow.v.861><bow.v.862>I am a registered Republican , that said , I am sick to death of the Limbergers , Sean Insanity , and the like , nit picking this President.

The common theme for these various kanji is etiquette and/or display. Some examples include " konrei " - marriage ceremony or wedding , " gunrei " - military honours and " reihai " - worship , divine service , amongst many others. Finally , we have a more commonly known term , which is " Reigi " with " gi " being translated as deliberation , consultation and debate. For our purposes , gi is also defined as " consideration. " Thus , we translate reigi as " methods of showing respect " and again " etiquette. " Thus , the bow is basically a manifestation of one 's manners. Not to bow , when it 's appropriate to do so , or to bow improperly , is akin to having bad manners . </bow.v.863><bow.v.864>2 Samuel 16 : 4 And the king said to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth.

While greeting the Queen of England , our nation ' s biggest ally , Obama gives a slight head nod as a sign of respect. But , while greeting the King of Saudi Arabia , Obama bows low enough to kiss the King ' s feet. This is something U.S. Presidents just don ' t do. Maybe it ' s just Obama acknowledging that we are totally dependent on Saudi oil , or maybe it ' s just an indication of Obama ' s Muslim roots. Either way , it sickens me.

If people learned to treat each other with that kind of respect from the minute they can talk and walk , they would not get angry at each other so easily !

When people in the east greet with a bow , they both bow to show equal respect of the greeting. This DID NOT HAPPEN. The Emperor DID NOT BOW BACK , this shows that the Emperor sees himself as being above our President , which makes our President look subservient. If the Emperor bowed as well , with just as much of a bend and hanging down of the head to Obama , then I 'd say , yeah , it looks like a good ol ' eastern greeting , but as I 've said before that did not happen. Cultural ideas are a two way street , so I think YOU should understand that our American history , how our country began , was by rejecting the Monarch 's authority over us. We declared our independence , and told King George that would would no longer be subservient/ his subjects. And to see our Head of State bow to , not one , but two Monarchs is upsetting. Understanding culture is a two way street . </bow.v.870><bow.v.871>First allow me to aver that the methods of bowing from school to school and style to style are not identical or standardized. Thus , the caveat is to bow in the manner in which you were taught is proper at your school. Later in this article , we will examine some of the various idiosyncrasies of bowing in some of the Japanese ryuha. It can be stressed , nevertheless , that the pivot point for a bow is at the hips , the back stays straight and the head does not bob. Thus far , I know of no school that does not concur with these three points. With the aforementioned admonition in mind , let 's examine the remaining body mechanics of the bow . </bow.v.871><bow.v.872>Back in 1994 when President Bill Clinton appeared to maybe perhaps almost start to bow to Akihito at a White House encounter , U.S. officials rushed to deny it was any such a thing.

Arcus has this quality. In addition , Arcus bows offer a new dimension in sound , compared to most traditional wooden bows. Of course , the one ideal sound is a myth , just like different strings made from various materials may all sound beautiful but different. But the sound produced with an Arcus bow is quite like with an old Tourte . I wish that players will be able to happily appreciate the benefits of the Arcus bows at its reasonable price , and be no longer deluded by the famous names and high prices.

Of course , some measures of some eighth-note polska tunes don ' t fit this pattern maybe there are too few distinct notes for all those bow strokes so you won ' t use it 100 consistently.

The energy you supplied to draw the bow is stored in the limbs , as potential energy , until you release the string. Upon release , the potential energy is transferred into the arrow as kinetic energy , as the limbs " spring " back into place returning the string to it ' s original position. Seems simple enough ! But careful examination of this process of storing and releasing energy is what gives a compound bow its performance characteristics , and it is something you should consider when selecting your new bow. The Point : In essence , there are only two factors that determine how much " power " your bow will have : 1 ) The amount of energy that can be stored in the limbs during the draw stroke. 2 ) The amount of that potential energy that can be successfully transferred into the arrow upon release ( efficiency ) . </bow.v.920><bow.v.921>In Japan , people greet each other by bowing.

Below I will offer the Chinese bowing contemplation verse that is likely identical with Katagiri 's recitation. The earliest printed appearance of this verse seems to be in a text by Tiantai Master Zhanran , ( b. 711 ) disciple of the reknowned co-founder of the Tiantai School , Master Zhiyi , in a Lotus Sutra liturgical text called " Fahua sanmei xingshi yunxiang buzhuyi. " [ xliv ] Dogen Kigen remarked on the line in his Hokyogi. Dogen 's master Rujing remarks that the line was routinely recited by Chinese monks in daily servces during the Song Dynasty ( 960-1126 ) . [ xlv ] Inspiration for mental contemplations performed during bowing as well as while repenting comes from Samantabhadra Bodhisattva , who appears as one of the central exemplars of both the Avatamsaka and Lotus Teachings of Buddhism . </bow.v.930><bow.v.931>I do not consider bowing to be worship so much as acknowledgement. And since we are practicing the act of being present , it seems appropriate to acknowledge . </bow.v.931><bow.v.932>Let 's see ...

From the outside , it is the travel from afternoon to the dreaming night. But I think of it as much more. Perhaps you can interprete it as Kate &amp; x27; s expected journey from mid-age woman to old and at last , to the end -death. In some ways , Kate has always flirted with death on her albums , be it Houdini or drowning. Here , I think , we are dealing with the expected old-age lingering out. If so , what a journey ! The last track , " Aerial " is the absolutely best of the album , with a Kate laughing-singing so that the angles must bow in respect . </bow.v.935><bow.v.936>Usually , this references the bowing of the head , sometimes the bowing of the body. It is almost always done in the context of worshiping God ( Gen 24 : 26 , 48 , 52; Exo 4 : 31; 34 : 8; 1 Chr 29 : 20; 2 Chr 20 : 18; 29 : 30; Neh 8 : 6 ) and is frequently combined with the previous word translated as " worship " so that often you find the phrase " bowed their heads and worshiped. " There is only one time where it is questionable , in Num 22 : 31 it is used in reference to bowing to an angel of the Lord. The angel does not rebuke Balaam , who also fell flat on his face. Apparently , there was some aspect of " worship " in this , but is not stated as such , but probably more out of fear. Either that , or sometimes it is implied that the " angel of the Lord " may actually be the Christ , and thus such worship would not be out of place . </bow.v.936><bow.v.937>Just like there ' s a statute of limitations on every thing he says ( about three days ) , there is also a statute of limitations on every thing he does.

I did n't like seeing Bush holding hands and kissing one of 'em. And , I do n't like it now. I wish the practice would stop. I really do n't think any American should bow to a monarch , who be definition , no matter how " enlightened " they may or may not be , is a despot. This country was founded on the principle of abolishing that kind of class , at least here , and , at least in principle again , not recognizing their type of authority on the planet . </bow.v.938><bow.v.939>I ' m sorry , but every time I see that photo of him bending over I ' m struck by how shiny his suit is and how big his arse looks. A singularly awkward and unattractive pose another good reason not to bow at the waist to anyone. Perhaps a curtsy or genuflection would have been more graceful . </bow.v.939><bow.v.940>In the late 13th century , a new weapon came on the scene , the longbow. Originally from southern Wales , where records of elm bows record its use around 1150. The first battle where it was widely used was the battle of Falkirk in 1298. It was quickly adopted across England as the weapon of choice , and dominated the battlefield until the middle of the sixteenth century. The longbow was regarded as such an important weapon , that at some battles longbowmen formed as much as 85 percent of the fighting force . </bow.v.940><bow.v.941>One ca n't but respect the brave Israeli army , which puts its soldiers ' lives at risk in order to protect civilian life in Gaza or Southern Lebanon , the same civilians who , in both places , voted terrorist organizations in to power. The same " innocent civilians " who deny Israel 's right to exist , who never are held accountable for the democratic choices they have made. Yet still , the Israeli army , and in the most critical times of war , tries as much as possible to avoid harming them , even at the expense of losing lives on their side , as well as suffering tactical and strategic disadvantages because of their moral behavior. I salute the Israeli army; I ca n't but support these heroes , and bow in respect to the memory of their fallen ones.

This , the deepest bow possible , will first be made to the dojo shrine and the memory of the " Founder " , for without the Founder the dojo 's particular style of karate would not exist . </bow.v.945><bow.v.946>The Japanese word for bowing is called " rei " and is the method of greeting one another throughout Asia. Many westerners are confused about when , where and how to bow in and around the dojo , but seem to pick it up pretty quickly. I guess it 's like the military , when in doubt - bow . </bow.v.946><bow.v.947>One of the most unusual rules for western people is the bowing. Bowing is a way to show respect , and also has some symbolic meanings depending on when you bow . </bow.v.947><bow.v.948>Unlike beauty of sound , this issue of playability lends itself to scientific investigation using mathematical models of a bowed violin string. Over the last 30 years increasingly sophisticated models have been developed. These models are too complicated to solve by pencil and paper mathematical methods , but they can be used to produce computer simulations of how a string on a particular violin will respond to a certain bow gesture. The models can explain a lot of the complicated things which a violin string can do , and they are beginning to be good enough to use to explore design questions : how could the design of a string , or bow , or violin body , be modified to improve the playability ? </bow.v.948><bow.v.949>For the very best experiences when you bow hunt , you need to pay special attention to the weight of the arrows you wish to use as well as how stiff the shaft should be in order to work the best with the draw weight and the length of the arrows you are using. It is n't always a good idea to use the lightest and fastest arrows available because they can actually cause damage to your bow. Light arrows and heavy arrows generally absorb the same amount of energy from the bow but lighter arrows result in the bow vibrating much more , which can result in damage to it . </bow.v.949><bow.v.950>Even if tradition says that American leaders don ' t bow to other world leaders , it isn ' t actually a violation of protocol. Even protocol experts questioned by conservative FOX News said that there are no rules on presidential bowing. Lloyd Hand , chief of protocol for President Lyndon Johnson said that protocol is 95 percent common sense and that American protocol favors warm gracious hospitality with no specific rules on bowing . </bow.v.950><bow.v.951>Fiddles , classified as bowed stringed instruments , exist in a great many sizes and forms throughout the world. Known from at least the tenth century , in Asia , and descended from earlier plucked lutes with origins in prehistory , they essentially consist of one to four or more stings of gut , metal , hair or other fibres , etc. , stretched over a hollow body with a flat or curved front or belly and a round or flat back , and over a neck attached to the body. The neck is usually of wood , and the body of wood or a gourd or shell with skin stretched over it . </bow.v.951><bow.v.952>The bow is a stunning recurve with an unusual scalloped profile and decorations carved in high relief , which , for safety reasons mentioned above , I would 've thought impossible ! Like all the elves ' possessions and architecture , it is embellished with organic , graceful patterns reminiscent of roots and leaves. Rumor has it this bow was originally made in wood but cast in some sort of flexible resin , which would answer safety concerns. The color of the " wood " is almost etherial. The bowstring is also pale , as it should be : in Tolkien , Galadriel said it was strung with the hair of her own people. Is it any better than the Mirkwood bow ? Well , he certainly shoots faster with it ! </bow.v.952><bow.v.953>Line up in grade order as at the start of the class and all bow with sensei towards the kamiza. It is polite to say , " Domo arigato gozaimashita " ( pronounced go-zy-mash-eeta ) meaning , 'thank you very much'. Allow the instructor to leave the tatami first. After the sensei has left the mat , bow to your partners as a polite thank you . </bow.v.953><bow.v.954>Ok , finally an Independent here. First , it is clearly a bow. To say otherwise is to be dishonest. In this respect , to come out after and lie about it becomes a problem in and of itself. Second , depending on the culture and the relationship with that country bowing may not be that bad. Here , in the U.S. , a sign of repect is a handshake , elsewhere it may be different. With that being said , however , if both leaders want to put themselves on " equal " respectful footing , they should have bowed to each other. Because Obama is the only one to have bowed it puts the king in a superior position. This is a sign of weakness , at least in the observational standpoint. Perhaps from a dimplomatic standpoint what he did was wise. That I do not know. The danger is that people make judgements from little cues like this. If , and I say IF , he is percieved as being weak and inferior because of physical cues like this , than that could put the country on a weaker platform that it may have been on otherwise . </bow.v.954><bow.v.955>Double stopping is when two separate strings are stopped by the fingers , and bowed simultaneously , producing a part of a chord. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary for the left hand to be able to reach both notes at once. Sounding an open string alongside a fingered note is another way to get a partial chord. While sometimes also called a double stop , it is more properly called a drone , as the drone note may be sustained for a passage of different notes played on the adjacent string. Three or four notes can also be played at one time ( triple and quadruple stops , respectively ) , and , according to the style of music , the notes might all be played simultaneously or might be played as two successive double stops , favoring the higher notes . </bow.v.955><bow.v.956>Preview Bow and Seattle area real estate ... access homes and land for sale. nwRealty.Com is your best access to Bow real estate information and Bow real estate professionals who specialize in serving the Bow area.

" The left stroke is a long one often completely indistinguishable as to form from the letter " l , " though sometimes with a more pronounced hook to the right at the foot; this is followed by a minuscule " a " that sometimes , but rarely , has a left stroke that is bowed out to the right to represent the right bow of an independent " b " as well as the left bow of the independent " a. " When this compound bowing of the left stroke of the " a " is not present , confusion with " la " is very easy and often only disambiguated by alliteration or sense. This glyph derives from the " ba " juncture of textura rotunda . </bow.v.957><bow.v.958>Second : Some people have argued that the bow was simply President Obama 's attempt to show humility and respect instead of the air of superiority that America has taken on. OK , but true humility and respect comes through actions , rather than a symbolic bow. He need n't have bowed like that to be more humble and willing to compromise. The proof is in the pudding . </bow.v.958><bow.v.959>We need someone who can coach in the era which football is being played.

Start with the highest-ranking or oldest person. The most important person usually extends his hand first. In Asia , be cautious. You do not want to force a handshake on anyone. In Japan , take your cue about whether to shake hands , bow or do both , from your host. In South Korea , you will probably shake hands. In Arab countries , men may find themselves shaking hands several times a day , whenever you go apart and then meet again . </bow.v.960><bow.v.961>bowwow is on bullshit because he said he was retiring a few years ago well do your acting thang a its great you ve made 7 cd thats good but boo your not that raw look at nas anyways bow i love your music but fuck acting your not that good your ok in like mike roll bounce was ouuu .. well just go back to school like u said youve been in the ngame like 17 years so that mean u didnt get much schooling so go back and say no to drugs and grills peace chi town </bow.v.961><bow.v.962>bush holds hands , obama bows , and we drink up their oil. until the usa becomes energy self reliant all our presidents will continue to bow kiss and hug these maniacal monarchs ! </bow.v.962><bow.v.963>I guess bowing is a form of formal greeting for this head of state and just plain polite , like shaking hands is in political arenas or bowing in Japan.

When the president met with King Abdullah , there was something that took place which I believe the White House explained as just the president being taller than the king. We took a look at the video , and it does appear that the president actually bowed to King Abdullah. Did he bow or did n't he ? </bow.v.965><bow.v.966>I think of the reciprocal bow as a tool less for analyzing violins than for listening to them in an analytical way. Because the violinist is replaced by a pre-recorded or computer-generated string signal , the subjective response of the violinist to the instrument is avoided. The reciprocal bow has the advantage over mechanical bowing systems of being relatively simple to build , easy to control , and flexible enough to be used for many different experiments. I believe it is useful to the violinmaker both in learning to hear in more objective way , and as a practical aid in comparing and adjusting violins . </bow.v.966><bow.v.967>Wood-See that the back of your stave is absolutely flat. Sand it well with coarse sandpaper. See that your backinp , piece is absolutely flat also , and well sanded with coarse abrasive too. Apply glue ( Casein , Weldwood or any resin glue ) liberally to both backing and bow back. Cut a pressure board of pine or other wood 3/4 " thick and 1/4 " narrower than your wood back. Place this over the back and bind your pressure board , wood back and bowstave together with rubber strips cut from an inner tube. Cut the strips 1/2 " wide and use plenty. See that glue squeezes out all along the joint. Let it dry for at least a day before working on your backed stave . </bow.v.967><bow.v.968>BS Frost. While the details differ , the raison d'etre is the same : respect. In Japan it is the primary mutual gesture of respectful greeting , in degrees varying by one 's social/economic/political status. In England , the bow ( or curtsey ) is primarily reserved for formal occasions with the " lesser " bowing to the " greater " , but is not bowed to in return . </bow.v.968><bow.v.969>Closed Quivers The horse riding nomads of the Eurasian steppe lived in a harsh environment made more difficult by their sometimes hostile relationships with their more sophisticated neighbours to the South and West. Subject to the extremes of a severe climate and the limitations of their technology , they had to develop solutions to the special problems of maintaining and carrying their weapons. When the Scythians burst onto the world stage in the eighth century BC , they already had their characteristic quiver and bow case combination , the gorytus , developed to overcome the particular problem posed by archery equipment. This protected the arrows and the bow in a single case , with the arrows on one side of a partition and the bows on the other . </bow.v.969><bow.v.970>Materials : Traditional bows were originally made of wood , but horn , sinew , and even metal and fabrics were used in bow construction. Modern bows use fiberglass , metal , carbon , rubber and plastics . </bow.v.970><bow.v.971>It was also apparent that , although our various arts may differ , Aikido , Jujutsu , Karate , Kendo etc. , there is at least a single commonality - we all bow. Moreover , it seems that many of us do not bow properly , do not know when to bow , do not know which type of bow is appropriate ( there are different ones ) and do not even know why we bow. We tend to use the tactic of " when in doubt - bow and say hai. " This , however , is not proper. Hence , let 's look at bowing . </bow.v.971><bow.v.972>In the Hakko Denshin Ryu tradition , both open and closed hand bows are used. A particular uniqueness of this school is the use of the " loose fist " bow. The hands are placed knuckles down and the thumbs forward in the appearance of a loose fist. Again the explanation offered is that the sword is worn on one 's left side. Given that one is bowing to a person close to him/herself , the open hand would allow one to draw your sword. Therefore , when bowing to a person while in suwari , the use of the loose fist with the thumbs forward method shows no threat and therefore is proper etiquette . </bow.v.972><bow.v.973>Obviously , Kent , the president decides when to bow and when not to bow.

Another factor in the construction of the stick is balance. Some bows might have a very heavy tip , which might be useful for obtaining a strong sound , but makes the bow a bit clumsy. Other bows have a lighter tip , which will make them more agile , but will demand use of additional weight in the bowing arm. Bow sticks are also made in different shapes. Some models are curved inwards ( as in most modern bows ) , some ( usually the renaissance and baroque models ) outwards , some are almost straight . </bow.v.975><bow.v.976>First bow I ' ve owned and love it.

This allowed sufficient clearance for the 5-inch fletching on the test arrows , a necessary action considering the flipper-type arrow rest and the release system used on the shooting machine. Because I always hand-shoot the test bows with a finger release before trying a release aid , the forward position of the PlungerRest was also helpful in this effort. I set the cable guard upward toward the center of the bow to equalize the angles of the cables as much as possible. Static and dynamic tests were conducted at 50 , 55 , and 60 pounds peak draw force . </bow.v.977><bow.v.978>In the end such a simple algorithm was not capable of coping with the rigours of a real musical example and instead a small toy data set was used to test the algorithm.

Whereas an arrow is guided past the bow-hand , it is actually relatively easy to shoot yourself in the hand with a pellet-bow. Anyone who has ever owned a catapult will probably relate to this. The Orang Laut bows overcome this by attaching a wooden thumb-guard to the bow , shaped like a bird.

All the elements that were necessary for the invention of the bow were probably present among the Central Asian horse peoples at the same time : In a society of horse-mounted warriors ( the horse peoples included the Huns and the Mongols ) , horsehair obviously would have been available. To this day , horsehair for bows is taken from places with harsh cold climates , including Mongolia , as such hair offers a better grip on the strings. Rosin , crucial for creating sound even with coarse horsehair , is used by traditional archers to maintain the integrity of the string and ( mixed with beeswax ) to protect the finish of the bow; </bow.v.987><bow.v.988>The Vietnamese generally shake hands both when greeting and when saying good-bye.

This is a result of eccentric cams. The benefit is that the hunter can hold the bow at full draw for a longer period of time. This gives the compound bow a mechanical advantage over other bows . </bow.v.993><bow.v.994>A marking of col legno ( Italian for " with the wood " ) in the written music calls for striking the string ( s ) with the stick of the bow , rather than by drawing the hair of the bow across the strings. This bowing technique is somewhat rarely used , and results in a muted percussive sound. The eerie quality of a violin section playing col legno is exploited in some symphonic pieces , notably the " Witches ' Dance " of the last movement of Berlioz ' Symphonie Fantastique. Saint-Saens ' symphonic poem " Danse Macabre " includes the string section using the col legno technique to immitate the sound of dancing skeletons. Some violinists , however , object to this style of playing as it can damage the finish and impair the value of a fine bow . </bow.v.994><bow.v.995>Romans 11 : 4 But how does God answer him ?

It is important to understand the context of the music and the purpose for the articulation in order to properly interpret the markings and corresponding bow strokes. It should also be noted that bowing terminology and markings are not always precise. Different bow strokes are often used in combination with other bow strokes to achieve the desired musical effect. Musicians sometimes disagree about how to interpret bowing terminology and markings , so use your best judgment , and enjoy the music ! </bow.v.1003><bow.v.1004>We have had nothing but great comments on the new Z7.

As is Orthodox custom ( not universally observed ) , the Church is entered with bows ( cross yourself and bow - three times before entering ) . This same action is used as icons are greeted ( and this is indeed widely observed ) when entering the nave of the Church. Many visitors , unfamiliar with Orthodox customs and the veneration of icons , mistake this bowing as an act of worship. It is nothing of the sort , but rather an act of humility by which we give honor where honor is due. We honor those depicted in icons ( Christ , His mother , the saints , etc. ) because it is either an image of Christ , or an image of the saints those whom Christ God Himself has honored and shown forth as bearers of His holiness.

( see : ART IMAGES for details ) . At the risk of repeating this information it is very important to be clear that the image is a symbol not an idol. The image symbolises the realisation of the highest human potential , representing so much that is worthy of respect , worthy of bowing down to. The act of bowing not only acknowledges the value of this potential , these sublime human qualities , but it sets up a very tangible connection with those qualities in myself. We are all capable of wisdom , kindness , patience , etc. , to some degree , and in one way bowing points back to one 's own 'Buddha nature.

Medieval reproduction crossbows are also expensive and tricky to get shooting straight and true. Longbows can be found for a good price but are a little harder to master and more tiring on the arm muscles. In my opinion , the best bow for a beginner is just a simple recurve bow. They can be relatively inexpensive and are easy to shoot. The recurved limbs make drawing the string feel much smoother than that of a longbow and there is considerably less hand shock on release as well. Too much hand shock from a bow means less energy propelling the arrow and it can make using the bow very fatiguing.

It 's an old expression but it seems especially apropos when we talk about bowing in the Japanese martial arts. It seems that with every passing year there is more and more talk about discarding the anachronisms of the martial arts including bowing. Given what bowing represents , any traditional martial artist should vociferously oppose any such notion. Why not give up shaking hands and any other polite Western mannerism ? We would n't because we do not want to be perceived as boors. Traditional martial arts are not simply a menu or smorgasbord of techniques , principles and philosophies from which one can offhandedly pick and choose what to embrace and what to discard. This is not to say there is an expectation that one accept all things in the martial arts in their entirety. Rather , it is to place context around " everything for a reason. " Traditional Japanese martial arts are a " package deal " . And this includes bowing . </bow.v.1066><bow.v.1067>every for 1/2 " of draw length.

That at least would be a bow in the right direction , if he felt it necessary to bend over like that in public. England , though not without its problems in the past , has been America 's closet and best ally for the last hundred years. It has helped lead the democratic world and advance human rights. Michelle Obama shamelessly disregarded protocol in her encounter with the queen , placing her arm around the queen 's shoulder. And why not ? Mrs. Obama 's lack of respect for her native country might as well extend to its source. No , the president bowed before the king of Saudi Arabia , the cradle of the majority of men who high-jacked four commercial airliners loaded with civilian passengers on a cloudless September morning and launched the worst attack on the American mainland in history. He bowed before the king of a country that proudly rules according to the ancient rule of Islamic Shari'ah law.

Some of these assistance must get a sore neck and back after working their all day bowing to the thousands of customers , but it 's all in a days work . </bow.v.1071><bow.v.1072>But violinists do n't just want to play long , steady bow strokes. For musical purposes a wide variety of different bowing gestures are used , such as martel ( hammered bowing with a sudden release ) and spiccato ( rapid detached notes with the bow bouncing off the strings ) . A more advanced player will be interested in questions like " If I perform such-and-such a bow-stroke , will I get a Helmholtz motion ? How long will it take to become established ? " . The second question is particularly important , because there is usually a transient period of non-regular motion of the string which may make the start of the note sound scratchy. A good bow gesture will minimise the length of this transient period , and establish Helmholtz motion quickly to give a crisp-sounding note . </bow.v.1072><bow.v.1073>I second this comment. Bows do n't mean the exact same thing in all cultures anyway , and I was a bit unsettled by such a low bow to the Japanese Emperor.

When they shake hands they make eye contact with each other. A nod is not enough. Hand-kissing is rare. That 's how they do it in America. But can I tell you something that is n't like America. They bow for respect. That 's how they do it in Japan ! ! ! The children also have to shake hands.

And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name , that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , in heaven and on earth and under the earth , and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father ( Philippians 2 : 5-11 ) . </bow.v.1076><bow.v.1077>Making Berg composite bows for twenty years has been a challenge that has been very gratifying. To make them to comparable quality and aesthetic beauty as top quality French bows is a great achievement. To be the pioneer at that high standard and still maintain first place in overall quality is a major success story. It Francois Tourte 's bows represent a milestone in bow making because of their new shape , then Berg bows deserve similar status because of their new materials. My dear friend and colleague in France , Alain Herou , said to me during a shared International Workshop presentation in Biaritz , France , " Michael I see why you have been so successful. You have stayed so close to the tradition in both appearance and sound " . In closing I wish to express my gratitude to all string players who have made it possible . </bow.v.1077><bow.v.1078>The only story here is Obama 's complete inability to stand up for ANYTHING and say " yeah , I bowed , BIG FAT HAIRY DEAL.

That ' s a pretty good point , as are his others about the near-hysteria the President ' s bow raised among arch-conservatives and those wishing no well to Obama. The ' Secret Muslim ' trope is one that has sadly taken hold in a portion of American society , with close to 10 believing that Obama is a Muslim , according to Diyab. Diyab also notes that Europe seems to have taken Obama to their hearts , in the same way they accepted John F Kennedy and his wife. Perhaps he also recalls the way JFK was lambasted and is to this day for his remark in Berlin where he said , ' Ich bin ein Berliner ' . I fear that Obama ' s act is one of those ambiguities that will be politically expedient to toss around when needed.

A prime example of this discipline is the practice of Reigi , or Reishiki ( dojo etiquette ) that we observe with other students in our dojo or practice area. Many individuals confuse Reigi with worship. Aikido is not a religion. When we bow or observe special ceremonies , these are for the purpose of training our minds . </bow.v.1091><bow.v.1092>8-26.

Vetus offers both electrically and hydraulically driven bow thrusters , to suit a wide variety of boats. Working in close collaboration with the Maritime Institute Netherlands ( MARIN ) , the world-famous hydrodynamic laboratory , Vetus has optimized the performance of its thrusters. This has been achieved by utilizing a unique propeller blade profile , which creates little or no cavitation. As cavitation produces unwanted noise , this new blade design offers a major reduction in the operating sound levels for Vetus bow thrusters. Moreover , the application of this new propeller has reduced the current consumption by up to 10 . </bow.v.1094><bow.v.1095>Yes , even if it was merely a gaffe , it is far more serious than if the bow had been directed toward a Christian , secular or westernized leader. Why ? Because the cultural contextualization of a U.S. President bowing to an Islamic leader has far reaching consequences. I doubt the King of Saudi Arabia ( who is used to unbelievable deference from many western leaders , including our former President ) thought much of the bow , but it is not his opinion that concerns me. The way the bow , a weighty gesture within Islam , will be interpreted by the broader Muslim community is much more disconcerting. To radicals and true fundamentalists it most likely will be viewed very differently -- -- as another symbol of the soon-coming victory of sharia over democracy , Islam over Christianity and Allah over Christ. By not recognizing that much ( though not all ) of the Islamic world views themselves in an apocalyptic struggle with Christianity and the west is to be unnecessarily and dangerously ignorant of the culture , manners and worldview of an important segment of the world 's population . </bow.v.1095><bow.v.1096>OK , you ca n't mix apples with oranges. The Saudis did n't cause the 9-11 event , Al-Qaeda did. And if Obama bowed to the Saudi king , he was doing it out of respect , and not praising him. Also , if you 're looking for things that Obama is doing wrong , how about being on a positive note and look for the things he 's doing right instead ? The way I 'm seeing it , he 's pretty much cleaning up the mess Bush left for him . </bow.v.1096><bow.v.1097>I don ' t care about students bowing to me when I enter the room. That is learned behavior. And whatever is learned can be unlearned and replaced with something more practical , like coming to class prepared to learn English by bringing your pen and notebook; like paying attention while the teacher is speaking; by not throwing pieces of your eraser at another student across the room; by not punching your friend sitting beside you; and by not slapping a girl in the head because she won ' t lend you a pencil. Again , I don ' t want to change their way of life. Let them bow to the Korean teachers. But come to my class prepared. I think that ' s fair . </bow.v.1097><bow.v.1098>When coming onto or leaving the tatami , practice mats , we bow again to the front of the dojo.

Whatever your preference , limb type should be a minor consideration compared to the other bow design characteristics we 've discussed. Weigh this bow attribute lightly.

People worshipping Jesus does not make him God any more than Abraham bowing down before the Hittites makes them God. The Greek and Hebrew need to be translated consistently.

They were n't concert performers , they were dance musicians with a completely different set of standards. There are a few things that come through fairly clearly. The first is the driving rhythm. It comes from the bowing style which is usually direct , moving with the individual notes , and rarely employs slurs. The second major difference is that the tunes are treated quite simply. There 's little decoration , just a few turns and mordants , and the occasional trill. The old players did n't use vibrato , and many , just like the old singers , tended to use natural scales.

Children are taught to bow to elders from an early age. Bowing is a sign of submission and a way to show respect. In addition , the act suggests the hierarchical nature of Hindu society where juniors submit to seniors. But there is still more involved. Bowing is not just bowing one ' s head. To bow generally means touching the feet of seniors , and feet hold a powerful symbolism within Hindu culture. From a child ' s perspective , parents , teachers and elders are considered gods therefore bowing to the feet of seniors is the way showing the highest respect . </bow.v.1132><bow.v.1133>So while we understand that speed is a big selling point for compound bows and a major performance characteristic that merits concern , we strongly suggest you not get too caught-up in splitting hairs over IBO speed.

Neither you or the deer will likely ever know the difference . </bow.v.1133><bow.v.1134>In a long section of the Mishnah Torah , the Laws of Prayer , Chapter 5 , Moses Maimonides defends his practice of excessive bowing. Where a common person bows only at the opening and closing of the central prayer sequence , the High Priest bows at the beginning and the end of every blessing within the sequence. Maimonides says that all of these bows should be bowed so far that all the joints in the spine are loosened and one makes oneself like a rainbow..

If a bowing technique is difficult to master , such as ricochet or spiccato , then obviously they should be first practiced on an open string. Then progress to using it in a scale , until the pupil is ready to tackle a study. Simplicity is the key. Why struggle with difficult notes if the bowing technique itself is hard ? The notes are a distraction. For a younger child you could introduce ' Frog Scales ' for example , where a pupil practices spiccato in a scale , or perhaps ' Robot Scales ' for martele , and maybe even ' Sticky Toffee Scales ' for a smooth legato practice. Perhaps play them a scale using a bowing technique , and get them to choose a description , and then see if they can copy you . </bow.v.1137><bow.v.1138>I agree with the critics who say Obama couldn ' t salute the flag on Veteran ' s Day but he can bow down to royalty.

Such an act is a traditional obeisance befitting a king 's subjects , not his peer. There is no precedent for U.S. presidents bowing to Saudi or any other royals. Former President Franklin D. Roosevelt shook hands with Saudi King Abdulaziz in February 1945. Granted , Mr. Roosevelt was wheelchair-bound , but former President Dwight D. Eisenhower shook hands when he first met King Saud in January 1957. Mr. Obama 's bow to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques does not help his image with those who believe he is secretly a Muslim , and why he chose to bow only to the Saudi King and not to any other royals remains unexplained . </bow.v.1143><bow.v.1144>He said : " I wanted to bow out either at the very top - when I 've produced my ultimate performance and I know I 'm not going to do better - or at a home Olympics like London 2012 , where the setting is going to be fantastic and the environment amazing.

Bows with roughly 33-inch axle lengths seem most sought after , and the Firecat measures exactly that. Also , brace heights of around 7 inches are most favorable in terms of combining speed with shootability. Again , the lighter risers , so a fully outfitted bow with a bow quiver , a stabilizer , a sight , and other accessories , doesn ' t become a ton of weight to lug around in the woods. Complete setups weighing more than 8 pounds or so are no longer desirable to many. Again , at just over 3 1/2 pounds , the Firecat is on par with the lightest 33-inch bows we know of.

I will say however , with 50 pound spine cedars , I shot two pheasants with consecutive shots one day , several quail , a bunch of squirrels and rabbits , and seven quarter size washers out of ten tries at eight yards on the first and only day i used it for coin practice. I guess if I did not have the faster Hills to compare it to I would have only come up with an idea that Hills are slow but real accurate , but since I have models that are faster than my Bear takedowns at the same draw I have to conclude I just got stuck with one that was not thought out very well in the lamination layups , but it was way back in '81 . </bow.v.1174><bow.v.1175>" I bought the Parker Buck Shot Bow for my 12 year old son after thoroughly investigating all of the youth bows available.

In the braced situation the string rests on stringbridges. These string-bridges are fitted to prevent the string from slipping past the limbs. When such a bow is drawn , at some moment the string leaves the bridges and has contact with the limbs only at the tips.

The key phrase being : " an exchange of bows " . Protocol , however , is important and , if no bowing is the correct procedure the Prez. should follow it.

But if you have average skills and are prone to occasional goof-ups , a bow with a little longer brace height will yield better accuracy in most shooting situations. The average new compound bow has a brace height of approximately 7 " . Bows with shorter brace heights ( 5-6.5 " ) will be faster but less forgiving to shoot. Bows with longer brace heights ( 7.5-9 " ) will generally shoot slower but will be more forgiving to your errors. Consider this carefully when choosing your new hunting or 3D bow. Unless you have a specific need for a blazing fast bow , you may find that a more moderate brace height will increase your enjoyment of archery and your success in the field. SPECIAL NOTE : Tall guys with draw lengths 30 " and above should be especially conscious of brace height - as a long draw length and a short brace height are a particularly bad combination , especially for new shooters . </bow.v.1238><bow.v.1239>Bowing is also used as a training in mindfulness. It is customary that when one enters or leaves a shrine room one bows. This sets up a point of stopping , of recollection; 'I am in this room , relating in this way , at this time. ' It is also customary at various times of the day to bow to senior members of sangha. Again , this requires a sensitivity and presence of mind; 'am I junior , what is the situation now , what is the time ?

[ vii ] This view persists despite the reality that the most common Buddhist practice in Asia from the third century CE was , and still is , bowing to the Buddha. Scholarly literature in English on the subjects of Chinese Buddhism in particular , has tended to focus on meditation and philosophy , to the exclusion of devotional practice. Eric Reinders in his article " The Iconoclasm of Obeisance : Protestant Images of Chinese Religion and the Catholic Church , " substantiates the lack of materials by Western scholars about Buddhist bowing and obeisance. Reinders traces the European Protestant Iconoclasts ' aversion for physical gestures of deference and asks whether the quarrel in Europe arising from the Reformation has been projected onto Asian religions.

However , they were used extensively in worship , for the ultimate recognition of respect and authority is to be recognized in our worship of God.

Informal bows are made at about a fifteen degree angle and more formal bows at about thirty degrees. Very formal bows are deeper. In extreme cases a kneeling bow is performed , which may be so deep that the forehead touches the floor. There is an extremely complex etiquette surrounding bowing , including the length and depth of bow , and the appropriate response. For example , if the other person maintains his or her bow for longer than expected ( generally about two or three seconds ) , it is polite to bow again , upon which one may receive another bow in return , often leading to an exchange of progressively lighter bows . </bow.v.1295><bow.v.1296>Consider the Patriarch , Abraham , who was given a burial ground for his wife by the Hittites.

First , it allows the production of a sustained note , whose loudness can be held nearly constant or , at the performer 's choice , varied over time ( musicans say 'shaping the note ' ) . There is another important difference between plucking and bowing. A plucked string very quickly loses its high harmonics and , after a few seconds , nearly all of the remaining energy in the string is in its fundamental. Bowing inputs energy continuously to the string and thereby maintains the power in the high harmonics. See Bows and strings . </bow.v.1329><bow.v.1330>Wan na see margaret thatcher bowed ?

Bows all have unique characteristics , but certain things fit certain players. Do you like a light bow or a slightly heavier bow ? This has little to do with stiffness or balance and more to do with the weight your arm feels comfortable with. Too light and you need to press more to get a solid sound , too heavy and your arm gets tired too fast for a good practice session. Weights should fall into the following ranges : Violins 59-62.5 grams , Violas 70-73 grams , and Cellos 78.5-82.5 grams . </bow.v.1353><bow.v.1354>Finally ( and what I see as the major point of contention with President Obama ' s bow ) , the depth of the bow often determines the politeness level. When one bows to his boss , he generally bows a bit lower than the simple head nod you might see between friends or the 15 degree bow from the waist between polite acquaintances.

Fortunately that bow broke after a few months. when I began to play with a properly balanced bow the sound I first produced certainly was odd.

It basically conveys a respect and submission to another person. When done to God , it becomes an act of worship , our ultimate act of submission to the King of Kings. When done to God , it becomes an act of worship in that from our hearts we are devoted to serve Him and Him alone. No other gods before us. Therefore , we can not judge a person who bows to another as worshiping them , there simply is no Biblical support for such a conclusion . </bow.v.1375><bow.v.1376>This is a live concert recording; you can hear applause at the beginning and end.

We are all children of God and we all owe each other a certain amount of respect , and we should honor each others values. Are each of too good to bow to one another in a show of honoring the others worthiness of respect ? God is the only entity we should worship , but we all have the ability and the right to bow to one another. We all serve each other as brothers and sisters under God.

Scelsi explored the phenomena of wavering single-note surfaces , creating a palette that included acoustic beating , tremolos ( both slurred and reciprocating bowing ) , microtonal trills , different vibratos , and in certain cases , scordatura , using tunings that enabled him to combine all of the above on one instrument11. His ideas and works ought to affect every aspect of our thoughts on vibrato , as opposed to what today passes for 'slow , medium and fast ' vibratos. It should be pointed out that there is a large amount of string music written in this century that requires no vibrato12. Some of this is a reaction to the excesses of an older style. Some of it is due to compositional concerns which wish to emphasize steady-state pitch precision. For whatever reasons , the twentieth century explodes the concept of vibrato as we tend to think about it ( when and if we do think about it , as opposed to using it like ketchup ) 13 . </bow.v.1381><bow.v.1382>LATE UPDATE : Lest one think that no one cares about the president 's alleged or likely bow to King Abdullah , here comes the National Republican Senatorial Committee using the issue as a fundraising ploy.

Furthermore , he bowed to the King Abdullah ( though all of our presidents metaphorically bow to the Saudis ) . It is not a respect thing. It is un-American to show submission to a king of any sort. Should an American Sikh remove his turban when the national anthem plays because it ' s our custom ?

As you know , respect is a cornerstone of not only Ashihara Karate , but all other Martial Arts. Respect for the dojo , instructors , fellow students , and most important of all yourself. Bowing is a gesture which serves as an external manifestation of this respect. When we bow to the dojo , we need a symbolic centre to which we direct this gesture of respect and appreciation.. The Shin Zen serves this purpose by representing the symbolic centre of the dojo 's total essence. This is the Shin Zen 's sole significance . </bow.v.1429><bow.v.1430>Come on Rush stop this stupidity. Does it really matter that Obama bowed and shook hands ?

When class begins all students line up according to rank. This allows the instructors to survey who is there and to organize classes accordingly. The highest-ranking student starts the line up in the rightmost position in the front row. The next highest rank stands to the left of that person , and so on. There are usually 4 or 5 people per row. After lining up , the highest-ranking student " bows in " the class by calling everyone to attention. We then bow to the flags , then the instructors. The second highest rank then instructs the class to bow to the highest-ranking student.

Japanese KSR teachers note that this way of bowing is only performed when the dojo has a shinden; otherwise , one only bows once , facing a makimono or a picture . </bow.v.1442><bow.v.1443>Obama 's breach of protocol is of a piece with the substance of his foreign policy.

One the main reasons that a person may initially enter a dojo is self-defence. Surprisingly , several Japanese martial arts masters note that the purpose of etiquette , and its expression through the use of the bow , is self defence. This is not to suggest that one should bow to an incoming mae geri ( front kick ) . When one reflects more deeply on this supposition it becomes clear that reigi saho ( etiquette manners ) is self defence.

Good technique and a solid practice regimen are critical to success in the field , regardless of which bow you ultimately choose. But the less forgiving your bow is , the more exacting your technique will need to be. But do n't make more of this issue than need be. Within a typical 30 yard bowhunting range , virtually any properly-tuned compound bow can be shot with acceptable accuracy. And with a little practice , even a novice shooter can easily bring down big game within this range. So if you hunt in dense woods where 20 and 30 yards shots are common , your bow 's " forgiveness " just is n't such a critical consideration. But if you hunt in more open country , where you must be able to reach out to 50 , 60 , even 70+ yards , where the smallest glitch means a wound or a miss , you should be more selective with the bow design you choose. We hope our forgiveness ratings are helpful to you in selecting a new bow . </bow.v.1450><bow.v.1451>Secondly , always check youself before downing nosing another person.

On New Year 's Day , the family comes together and pays respect to their ancestors and those who have passed away. This is done by offering the ancestors wine , fruit , meat , soup , and other dishes. The oldest family member bows in respect and offers their ancestors a drink of wine or liquor. The ancestors ' names are often pinned on a traditional board at the beginning of the ceremony , and when the ceremony is finished , the names of the ancestors are burned to ash with fire. This is one of the oldest traditions in Korean culture , and it is called Jaesa , which means respect your ancestors. This tradition is usually done in the early morning.

Bow plays Lou , a hootchy-kootchy dancer who is catapulted into stardom by fast-talking barker Nifty ( Preston S. Foster ) . Hoping to escape her tawdry existence , Lou makes a play for handsome young naif Chris ( Richard Cromwell ) , but by film 's end she has bowed to the inevitable and returns to the sort of work she knows best.

He is truly a diligent cultivator. Upon hearing the praise of this cultivator , he also wishes to be recognized as a cultivator , and so he begins vigorously bowing to the Buddha. Although he finds pleasure in bowing , he does not truly bow to the Buddha; he is bowing for recognition.

Yosef correctly interprets this to mean that there will be seven years of plenty , followed by seven years of hunger. " And as for the repetition of the dream to Pharaoh , twice , it is because the matter is already prepared before G-d , and G-d is hastening to do it. " ( 41 : 32 ) Here too , we have essentially the same dream repeated , yet it took 13 years before Yosef would begin his rise to greatness in Egypt ! In fact , it would be another nine years before the dreams were fully realized , when his brothers and father came down to Egypt and bowed before him.

You bow your head a bit and bring your hand nearer to your face. This is a very intimate pose. At this moment , you have let the piece of art enter into a vulnerable personal area. You would never hold anything dangerous this close to your face. This is the way you would hold a butterfly or a small kitten; very gently and close.

The Arcus web page gave its weight as 57 grams , but mine weighed exactly 60 gram , typical of many violin bows. It is well-situated in a listing of composite violin bows that have the feel of wooden bows that handle on- and off-string bowing very well , plus it is very fine viola bow , which is easy to play and greatly enhances the tone of violas on all strings. The owner of the Arcus company has told me that the same mold is used to cast the sticks for their violin and viola bows , but more material is used to make the viola bow . </bow.v.1469><bow.v.1470>I never had the opportunity - and all the other niceties of society.

All other things being equal , a 70 bow will store more energy and shoot faster than a 60 bow. However , this is a complicated issue you should consider carefully when selecting your new compound bow. The maximum draw weight of the bow is typically determined by the stiffness of the bow ' s limbs. Compound bows come in a variety of maximum draw weights , but the most common are the 60 and 70 versions. Although you may purchase a bow with 70 limbs , you can generally adjust the draw weight as much as 10-15 down from the maximum weight. So a 70 bow could actually be adjusted for 61 , 64 , 67 , or any draw weight within the allowable range. However , it should be noted that a 70 bow , turned down to 60 , will not perform as well as the same bow in a 60 version operating at it ' s maximum draw weight. Bows are generally more efficient at or near their maximum draw weight . </bow.v.1471><bow.v.1472>While your typical street and office bows have more to do with relative depth , the four traditional bowing categories still come into play in very formalized situations , like a corporate press conference.

( Even the most contrite bows do n't last more than 10 seconds in less formal settings. ) More than a few of the disgraced , like late Agriculture Minister Matsuoka Toshikatsu , subsequently committed suicide , raising questions in Japan about the level of shame faced by failed leaders.

Bowing , on the other hand , seems inherently unequal , undemocratic , humiliating , and submissive. Because bowing takes one to the earth , it appears unsanitary and superstitious; it conjures up the taboos of idolatry and graven images. From a Gospel-based , logocentric perspective , bowing is mere ritual , i.e. , not textual. It masks the real thing doctrine. Moreover , given cultural values of individualism and the ethos of equality , bowing seems to replace self-determination with servility.

The most common material is rosined horsehair; some African bows used strips cut from rubber inner tubes , and the Korean ajaeng , a zither , is bowed with a rosined stick of wood. Early bows and those used in folk cultures were shaped like hunting bows. Later bows had a less pronounced curve , and the tension was controlled with the fingers of the right hand. Since the 16th century , European bow tension has been controlled by means of an adjustable nut or frog on the end , held by the player. By the late 17th century a screw mechanism was used.

It was based on the likely availability types of horn in the area. Also we discussed the logic of the design of Scythian and the Middle Eastern bows , which preceded them in the West. These were usually as wide as they were thick. In Egyptian bows , the horn was not always the full width of the belly of the bow because it was inset in a channel.

Still , in most daily interactions , the four categories and the precise pitch of the body matter far less than properly representing the hierarchical relationship between the two parties : The subordinate person student , son , employee , etc. must always must bow down lower , and stay there longer , than his superior.

" As in Asian cultures , the depth of the bow expresses degree of respect or gratitude. In European courtly circles , males were expected to " bow and scrape " ( hence the term " bowing and scraping " for what appears to be excessive ceremony ) . " Scraping " refers to the drawing back of the right leg as one bows , such that the right foot scrapes the floor or earth.

( The bow can be drawn only until the indicated maximum draw length ) . Usually we can set the strength of each bow between 25 and 120 pounds. Sometimes it can differ a few pounds compared to the ordered draw weight. Nowadays , people choose bows with about 40 pounds. The old Hungarian , Turkish etc. bows had the draw weight of 55-90 pounds.

Early music groups interested in authentic performance may use a lower standard A. When playing with a fixed-pitch instrument such as a piano or accordion , the violinist must tune to accommodate that instrument. The other strings are then tuned to the A in intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs. This puts the open strings in just intonation , which means the lower strings may sound flat compared to their nominal equal-tempered equivalents. In practice , this means some compromises must be made , and the strings not always tuned in perfect fifths , particularly on the viola and cello , where the lowest string is the C , three fifths away from the reference A , making the difference more apparent . </bow.v.1518><bow.v.1519>I 'm not saying they were the worst but I shot a couple Massey Longhorns and 21st Century long bows at a Trad. 3D shoot and they all had lots of hand shock.

( This illustration shows a later bridge ) There is a story that this bridge was commissioned to be built by Queen Matilda after she " had been well washed in the waters " when trying to cross by the ford when on her way to Barking. This bridge is thought to have been the first stone-arched Bridge in Britain and this was 60 years before the first such bridge was built across the Thames in London. During the 14th century there was a chapel on the bridge dedicated to St Katherine and in this there lived a hermit. Chaucer referred to Bow in his Canterbury Tales which takes the name back at least to the 14th century. In 1600 , it was over this bridge that Will Kempe , a leading Shakespearean actor , crossed the river Lea on his 9-day Morris Dance from Stepney to Norwich . </bow.v.1521><bow.v.1522>Defines the diameter of an aluminium arrow ( 17/64ths of an inch ) and the thickness of the aluminium tubing ( 16 thousandths of an inch ) . The higher the first part of the number , the fatter the arrow. The higher the second part of the number , the stiffer the spine of the arrow. A 1916 is wider than a 1716 but has the same wall thickness. The bigger diameter makes the 1916 slightly stiffer than the 1716. A 1918 is the same diameter as a 1916 but has thicker walls and is therefore stiffer. Arrow specification needs to be matched to the archers bow type , draw length and draw weight . </bow.v.1522><bow.v.1523>Select arrow within the correct weight range for your bow 's draw weight. For instance , manufactures measure arrow weight in " grains. " One grain equals approximately 64 milligrams. Manufacturers rate bow draw weight in pounds. Draw weight means how much force in pounds an archer must use to draw back the bow 's string. A 60-pound bow requires 60 pounds of force to draw the string. Sixty pounds of force equals the amount of force it would take for a person to lift 60 pounds. The draw weight must match the arrow 's grain. Too light or too heavy arrows for a bow 's draw will wobble as they fly through the air. The correct ratio for choosing arrows equals 6 grains for every pound of draw. A bow with 50 pounds of draw requires a 300-grain arrow . </bow.v.1523><bow.v.1524>However , if a carbon fiber bow seems like the best choice for you , remember that the carbon fiber bows come in different qualities.

Fill it up with water most of the way ( or at least far enough to cover the portion to be bent ) and place the roughed out bow or bow limb into it. Build a nice fire around the pipe and wait for the water to boil. Be careful , it boils quickly. Do not leave it for a second or you could end up with a scorched bow. After boiling it for a few minutes , take the stave out and bend it by wedging the end into something. Bend it just a little past the spot where you want it to end up. Hold it there or tie it off in some way for a few minutes until it cools. If it is bent just a little past the spot where you wanted the stave or limb to finish , then it should end up just about right. This method reduces the risk of scorching the wood and is fairly well controlled . </bow.v.1526><bow.v.1527>N rnberger , Franz Albert II Junior ( 1854 - 1931 ) Worked with his father , Franz Albert I , Senior ( son of Karl Gottlieb ) in Markneukirchen.

Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary for the left hand to be able to reach both notes at once. Sounding an open string alongside a fingered note is another way to get a partial chord. While sometimes also called a double stop , it is more properly called a drone , as the drone note may be sustained for a passage of different notes played on the adjacent string. Three or four notes can also be played at one time ( triple and quadruple stops , respectively ) , and , according to the style of music , the notes might all be played simultaneously or might be played as two successive double stops , favoring the higher notes. Playing the notes simultaneously is done by applying more pressure to the bow and/or bowing closer to the fingerboard . </bow.v.1601><bow.v.1602>The development of the violin bow to it 's modern form was perfected by Fran ois Tourte ( 1774-1835 ) .

As you would expect from BowTech , the speed of this bow is excellent. An added feature , which I really like , is that the new Center Pivot bows from BowTech allow you to adjust draw weight , work on strings , and add peep sights without the need for a bow press. Simply back out the limb bolts 5 turns at a time for each limb until the limb bolts are showing three threads visible in the viewing hole of the riser.

Most of our student outfits are supplied with a Glasser brand fiberglass bow with horsehair ( also available with synthetic hair ) . These strong sticks are machined to be very similar from bow-to-bow , with a good weight for the beginner. They are heavy enough to produce a good characteristic introductory tone , and durable enough to withstand most abuse. There is no reason for a beginning student not to start with this type of bow. Even though a student may outgrow it quickly , the price is very reasonable and the bow can be used as a spare bow , as well. As a player advances to new tonal possibilities , the requirements of the bow shift rapidly. As early as 6 months into studying , a student may benefit from the use of a better bow . </bow.v.1645><bow.v.1646>In April of 2006 the AFVBM helped present The American Violin : From Jefferson to Jazz , a celebration of historical and modern American violin and bow making; a joint venture between the American Federation of Violin and Bow Makers , Inc. and the Library of Congress , with generous support from the Violin Society of America and select contributors . </bow.v.1646><bow.v.1647>But more specific , as single Christians seek to form the character that results in a successful marriage , it 's important to ponder who we worship.

( When accompanying a fixed-pitch instrument such as a piano or accordion , the violin tunes to it. ) The other strings are then tuned against each other in intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs. A minutely higher tuning is sometimes employed for solo playing to give the instrument a brighter sound; conversely , Baroque music is sometimes played using lower tunings to make the violin 's sound more gentle. After tuning , the instrument 's bridge may be examined to ensure that it is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the f-holes; a crooked bridge may significantly affect the sound of an otherwise well-made violin . </bow.v.1648><bow.v.1649>Hi Kayes , Hmmm , personally , I do n't think they should just simply create a greeting like that.

The first is the desired lateral vibration of Figure 2. The second is the torsional or rotating mode. The torsional frequency is very low and not related to the musical frequency. Because of this , strings with insufficient torsional damping will cause problems because the string , at the sticking time in its lateral cycle may be at a point in its torsional cycle where it does not want to stick. The process must wait until the torsional cycle gets to the point where the hair can stick. The result is a variation in frequency and in amplitude. There is less of this problem close to the bridge where the string is harder to rotate. There is also less torsional vibration in small diameter strings than in large diameter strings. You can observe the torsional vibration of a string by lightly cementing a cat 's whisker to it close to the bowing point. Watch what happens when you reverse the direction of the bow. The most familiar example of torsional vibration is the whistle on the solid steel E string . </bow.v.1651><bow.v.1652>Of course , we should keep the " forgiveness " issue in some perspective. Good technique and a solid practice regimen are critical to success in the field , regardless of which bow you ultimately choose. But the less forgiving your bow is , the more exacting your technique will need to be. But do n't make more of this issue than need be. Within a typical 30 yard bowhunting range , virtually any properly-tuned compound bow can be shot with acceptable accuracy. And with a little practice , even a novice shooter can easily bring down big game within this range. So if you hunt in dense woods where 20 and 30 yards shots are common , your bow 's " forgiveness " just is n't such a critical consideration. But if you hunt in more open country , where you must be able to reach out to 50 , 60 , even 70+ yards , where the smallest glitch means a wound or a miss , you should be more selective with the bow design you choose . </bow.v.1652><bow.v.1653>Jay , a " waiters bow " while shaking hands would not be a show of repect to the Emperor.

The difference in sound definitely depends on the violin itself. On the better instrument the difference is more audible than on the cheaper violin. I bought a Stagg outfit in June for 80 $ and it came with cheap wooden bow without any value , as my luthier told me. I played it and eveyrything was fine. Then I bought a Carbondix Carbon Fiber bow for 100 $ , and I play my violin with it , and eveyrhing is fine as it was before this buy.

We rarely bow to anything , except in prayer to God. The bowing and kissing when greeting another has been replaced with the handshake , and if real familiar , a hug. Respect for another is demonstrated by being kind and using good manners. Even with the President of the United States , usually a standing ovation is how he is greeted with respect when he enters the chambers of a gathering. The only context that Protestants have for bowing is in prayer to God. So , when we bow to another person or an Icon representing another person , Protestants tend to lump the action together along with prostrations as an action of worship simply because they have no other cultural context for it. It is basically a result of " culture shock " . </bow.v.1658><bow.v.1659>However , this word is very context sensitive.

The blogosphere is bursting with debate over whether President Obama diminished his stature by appearing to bow to the King of Saudi Arabia at the G20 summit. As for the Saudis , the act was just another reflection of President Obama ' s well-earned respect . </bow.v.1697><bow.v.1698>Bow of Respect : Whenever a student enters or leaves the training area , he is required to bow. Bowing to the training area demonstrates respect for the Art as well as the area where others have trained before him. Bowing is done to inanimate objects only. A salute ( hand gesture ) is always done to show respect to an instructor or individual. A bow should stem from an attention stance. When you are bowing , bow your head for a period of two seconds before returning to an attention stance . </bow.v.1698><bow.v.1699>Lost amid this controversy over the angle of bowing were two Japanese cultural experiences that Mr. Obama recollected from a boyhood trip to Japan : eating " matcha " green tea ice cream and seeing the Great Buddha in Kamakura . </bow.v.1699><bow.v.1700>Once you have determined the correct module , you can fine tune the draw length to give your bow a precise feel. *To adjust to your exact draw length , enlist the aid of a friend to loosen the allen screw on the opposite side of the riser. *Draw the bow to your anchor point and have your friend rotate the PDC until the nylon screw is in contact with the cam.

Here at Pick a Spot Archery we want to help you narrow down that big decision on selecting the right compound bow. We know that that decision could very well be the difference between hitting the spot or a total miss ( between dead or alive ) . Like every other product on the market today , compound bows come in a vast variety of brands , shapes , colors , sizes , and levels of difficulty. If you are an archer of heart , or a new beginner , Pick a Spot Archery wants to help you through the process and steps on selecting your next bow and making that big decision . </bow.v.1701><bow.v.1702>Does this mean that I am really bowing to the person in front of me ? Personally I think not , because one naturally reverences a person turned toward oneself and practically never performs an act of respect toward a person who has his back turned away. Thus the natural direction of the act of reverence is toward the Eucharistic Christ . </bow.v.1702><bow.v.1703>A bow 's physical weight is simply the measured weight of the bow , without any accessories. The average compound bow weighs about 4.0 lbs. A bow that 's under 3.6 lbs. is considered very light , and bow over 4.4 lbs. is considered very heavy , although less than 1 pound separates the two. However , most bows fall into the 3.8-4.2 lb. range. Short axle , carbon riser , and youth model bows are a little lighter. Long axle , magnesium riser , and parallel limb ( long riser ) bows are a little heavier. While some would argue that lightweight bows are better for hunters who walk great distances , others would argue that heavier bows are more stable and accurate with less recoil. So there probably is n't a right or wrong. This is a matter of personal preference. However , please note that most manufacturers tend to under-rate their bows for physical weight , sometimes by a significant margin. Consider the manufacturer 's rating as a low-estimate . </bow.v.1703><bow.v.1704>Violin Lesson 14 -- D tach Bowing.

His interest in the French tradition and quest for knowledge has helped him to make bows that are aesthetically fine and enable the musician to produce everything the music asks. Mr. Rubino studied bowmaking with William Salchow and had been his teaching assistant at the UNH Violin Craftsmanship Institute for many years , and appointed as a bowmaking instructor for the Institute in 1988. He has given lectures and conducted workshops on bowmaking and bow playability in North America , Europe , and Australia.

As you cross the threshold you briefly bow and say " Oss. " The earlier class is still taking class , so you take a seat to watch or stretch to get ready for your class. When the earlier class lines up to finish class , you walk over to the edge of the mats. Stand still and respectful until they are finished and they bow to the Sensei. When they bow and say " Oss , " you do the same. Usually they will then turn as a class to face their families in the audience and the next class standing at the edge of the mats , and will bow and say " Oss " again. Again you do the same. Whenever you step onto the mats to take class , you pause just a moment to bow again. There does n't have to be anyone there watching , or there could be 1000 people. Either way , it 's always the same. Bow and respect the place you are in , those who teach there , those who learn there , and all those who have come before . </bow.v.1719><bow.v.1720>It is common knowledge that bowing is customary in Japan. Watching the Japanese bow at any place and any time can appear amusing to our foreign eyes. Conversely , do we find watching people shake hands amusing ? In the Western world , we typically offer our hands when we wish to be perceived as showing sincerity. The Japanese prefer to bow.

Our ... Julong Animal Byproduct.Co. , Ltd. [ China ] </bow.v.1721><bow.v.1722>Now consider what happens when the player rocks backwards and forwards the finger that is stopping the string. This produces a pitch vibrato : the pitch of note varies regularly up and down. As it does so , the harmonics of the note also vary up and down in frequency , and so they may move from a strong transmission ( due to a resonance ) to weak transmission , or vice versa. This means that the spectrum of the output note varies strongly during the vibrato. Perceptually , this makes the sound much more interesting. It is one of the two most important features that help us identify the sound of a violin. ( The other is the way in which a bowed note begins. ) The key paper on timbre vibrato is by J.

The many changes of curvature increase the risk of the laminations of the bow separating from each other. In modern Mongolia , some bows are bound from end to end with transparent thread like fishing line to prevent de-lamination. In was common in later periods to bind points of high stress with sinew in glue as with the section of the much later bow Stephen brought back from Xinjiang. Other resins aside from Chinese lacquer could have been used to waterproof and protect the sinew.

Saudi Arabia occupies a region of the world that produces Islamic terrorists like assemby-line parts and has contributed its fair share to conflict and wars.

I agree. I 'm sure the Japanese are as used to our being what they consider rude as they are willing to make the accommodation to an awkward bow , so in that sense I 'm sure it is n't a big deal at some level. But I think there is great symbolism here. Not the symbolism of concession but the symbolism of civility. Another thing our critical pundits do n't take into account is that other countries watch our news , even if we ( collectively ) could n't care less about theirs. They know full well of our internal squabbles. They know that Obama took heat for this. And they know the truth of the matter , that he 's just the kind of guy that does things differently.

The question should be asking is why did Obama bow to the Saudi King and not to The Queen of England ? If he were going to show respect then he should have bowed to The Queen as well.

The President of a tiny African country would not be expected to bow to President Obama , and President Obama should not bow to any other world leader. Note : King Abdullah did not bow , so bowing is not a customary procedure in Saudia Arabia that is would be disrespectful to ignore.

These wheels are connected with a set of cables. These cables can be made of plastic coated steel , fast flight or other synthetic materials. We have categorized cables as either steel or synthetic to simplify the types. In general steel cables are more durable but a bit more noisy , costly , and harder to replace. Steel cables quite possibly could last the lifetime of the bow. Synthetic cables are cheaper , quieter , more easily adjustable for length and easier to replace. Synthetic cables do however need to be waxed like a bowstring to keep fraying down. Synthetic cables should generally be replaced every two years . </bow.v.1783><bow.v.1784>" When receiving Holy Communion , the communicant bows his or her head before the Sacrament as a gesture of reverence and receives the Body of the Lord from the minister.

We do n't bow. There are no bowing occasions in the US. We tend to think of bowing as indicating subservience , heaven only knows why. Probably something to do with the fact that we emigrated from England , where bowing was a forced acknowledgement of the social position of those born ( and therefore would stay ) higher up than us. In general , we Americans associate bowing with servants - or , if you 're a Merchant Ivory fan , elegant bejeweled women accepting some old-fashioned gentlemanly homage. So it makes sense that we not only do n't bow , we do n't like the *idea* of bowing. On our turf , that makes sense . </bow.v.1787><bow.v.1788>In Eastern Orthodoxy , there are several degrees of bowing , each with a different meaning.

This short study should have made it clear that anyone deserving of honor and respect can be worshipped. In the biblical culture , the worship was evidenced by bowing. However , in our Western society today it is not our custom to bow down to authority figures. Nevertheless , we do honor them , respect them , and in some cases should obey them. If we today honor a notable person by addressing him as Sir , singing For He ' s a Jolly Good Fellow and giving him presents , we do not call that worship , but in fact those acts are one way we in Western society would worship someone . </bow.v.1793><bow.v.1794>Absurd.

[ xxxix ] Even so , not all teachers of Buddhism in America presented the practice of bowing in its traditional Asian format. The bias against bowing by Protestants and Iconoclasts clearly influenced Buddhist ritual practice as it developed in the West. Some have decided to restrict , interpret or Westernize bowing. Others , such as the late Shunryu Suzuki , Roshi ( 1904-1971 ) founder of the San Francisco Zen Center , adapted bowing for Americans who meditated at the Zen Center. Suzuki , according to a story , seeing the " stiff-necked " reticence of Americans , not only did not drop bowing to cater to American 's likes and dislikes , instead he increased the required bows before meditation to nine. When asked why , he said that in his view , Americans needed to bow more. Suzuki Roshi , in a Tricycle article from 1994 [ xl ] , asserts that before reaching liberation , bowing is serious business , an essential tool for the student of Zen . </bow.v.1804><bow.v.1805>The relevance of Milton Babbitt 's use of dynamics to our control of the bow with respect to speed , pressure and distribution combinations can not be overstated. Some of our problems arise from his use of a quantized , as opposed to analogue , representation of dynamics; i.e. Babbitt will use a different dynamic on each note rather than a global symbol such as a crescendo. Some of our problems arise from not grasping that the dynamics are indications that the metric stress ( relative to the bar ) has shifted , the general metric rule being to play what the durational patterns are , as opposed to emphasising where they are relative to pro forma barlines. The concepts we must employ when bowing Babbitt 's music completely contradict the stasis that is our norm , i.e. do the same thing for a very long time. Once , however , having opened the door , one suddenly finds oneself using portions of this approach very effectively in older virtuosic music . </bow.v.1805><bow.v.1806>Acts 7 : 43 and ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch , and the star of your god Remphan -- the figures that ye made to bow before them , and I will remove your dwelling beyond Babylon.

Obedience , then , is an integral part of the worship of God or a king. The outward show of bowing is not really true worship if there is no intent in the heart to obey. If a person comes before a king and bows before him but has no intention of obeying him , then the bow is hollow and deceitful. We see this in action with Adonijah.

Split limb proponents claim that split limbs are more durable and produce less hand-shock than solid limbs. While we do n't see much evidence to support these positions , it does seem clear that solid limbs are leading the way - at least by popular vote. BTW , this was n't always so. Just 7 years ago , the market was rather evenly divided. Today , only a handful of manufacturers use split limbs ( Hoyt , Fred Bear , Alpine , etc. ) . Surprisingly , some bow companies do both , and seem willing to switch back and forth as situations warrant. For example , Bowtech has always exclusively used solid limbs. However , for 2007 they introduced 2 new bows utilizing split limbs to accommodate a new riser design. So perhaps the choice of solid limbs vs. split limbs is n't really such a critical black or white choice for enthusiasts. In the field , solid and split limb bows perform similarly.

Sure ! It just ca n't be done safely or within accepted industry standards. If you shoot a light enough arrow , your high-performance compound bow can surely make 400 fps. It just wo n't do it for very long. Shooting underweight arrows puts enormous stress on a bow 's components - much like dry-firing the bow. If you shoot dramatically underweight arrows , you may eventually warp the cam tracks , bend the cam axles , damage the string and/or buss cable , or get catastrophic limb failures ( just to name a few potential hazards ) . So it would be particularly unwise to " cheat " your way to faster arrow speeds by ignoring industry standards. While every expert does n't agree on this issue , the most commonly accepted arrow mass standard is the IBO ( International Bowhunting Organization ) Standard which states that minimum arrow mass must be at least 5 grains per each pound of draw weight. So to meet the safety standard , a 70 bow must shoot an arrow that weighs at least 350 grains ( 70x5 ) . </bow.v.1833><bow.v.1834>Bowing is the most obvious way to show respect.

If it is only Sensei facing the students , the command is then Sensei ni rei ( bow to teacher/s ) , followed by the bow and then the other seniors will turn to face the students. If there are 1st and 2nd Dan Sempai at the front then after the Sensei ni rei , after the other seniors have turned to face the students , there will be a second bow - Sempai ni rei ( bow to seniors ) .

But what is the etiquette per se on bowing ? This blurb is from the Washington Times on the etiquette of bowing : No Americans of any station are required to bow to royalty. It is one of the pillars of American exceptionalism that our country rejected traditional caste divisions. Article I Section 9 of the Constitution forbids titles of nobility and stipulates that no officeholder or government employee may accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state without the consent of Congress. Judith Martin wrote in her Miss Manners column in 2001 that bowing is not an ordinary bit of foreign etiquette one might adopt out of courtesy when traveling. Americans do not properly bow to any royalty. We show respect for other countries ' leaders the same way we do to our own. </bow.v.1859><bow.v.1860>When you are happy with the basic control of the bow this web tutorial includes a series of bowing exercises on the open strings.

The humility that is asked of us is an action that sets aside the demands of equality and allows us to bow before God and before all whom He has asked us to serve ( which includes all of humanity ) .

As one blogger has pointed out , Obama bowed even lower than the Japanese prime minister does when meeting the emperor.

In consequence of the flexure given to the stick , Tourte found it necessary to readjust the proportions and relative height of head and nut , in order to keep the hair at a satisfactory distance from the stick , and at the necessary angle in attacking the strings so as to avoid contact between stick and strings in bowing. In order to counterbalance the consequent increased weight of the head and to keep the centre of gravity nearer the hand , Tourte loaded the nut with metal inlays or ornamental designs . </bow.v.1882><bow.v.1883>They also " fall down " in reference to people ( Est 3 : 2 , 5; Psalm 72 : 9 ( to the king ) ) .

When used with God , it definitely indicates an attitude of worship , usually of prostration before Him . </bow.v.1883><bow.v.1884>Bows can be generally divided into three main types : informal , formal , and very formal. Informal bows are made at about a fifteen degree angle and more formal bows at about thirty degrees. Very formal bows are deeper. There is an extremely complex etiquette surrounding bowing , including the length and depth of bow , and the appropriate response. For example , if the other person maintains his or her bow for longer than expected ( generally about two or three seconds ) , it is polite to bow again , upon which one may receive another bow in return. This often leads to a long exchange of progressively lighter bows . </bow.v.1884><bow.v.1885>Posted on January 3 , 2005 at 04 : 40 PM When I went shopping for a viola bow several years ago I tried several wood and several carbon fiber bows.

All other things being equal , a 70 bow will store more energy and shoot faster than a 60 bow. However , this is a complicated issue you should consider carefully when selecting your new compound bow. The maximum draw weight of the bow is typically determined by the stiffness of the bow ' s limbs. Compound bows come in a variety of maximum draw weights , but the most common are the 50-60 and 60-70 versions. Although you may purchase a bow with 70 limbs , you can generally adjust the draw weight 1-10 down from the maximum weight. So a 70 bow could actually be adjusted for 61 , 64 , 67 , or any draw weight within the allowable range. However , it should be noted that a 70 bow , turned down to 60 , will not perform as well as the same bow in a 60 version operating at it ' s maximum draw weight. Bows are generally more efficient at or near their maximum draw weight . </bow.v.1887><bow.v.1888>Well , I was one of them ... now there are 2.

And for some reason , the 300 fps mark seems to be the proverbial line in the sand. Bows that shoot 300 fps or more are generally considered fast. Bows that shoot 299 fps or less are considered slow. And since IBO Speeds surely have a direct effect on a manufacturer 's total bow sales , we are especially suspicious of published IBO speeds of exactly 300 fps. If you study the chart above , you 'll find a disproportionately large group of the bows in our listing with published IBO Speeds of exactly 300 fps. Could this just be a coincidence ?

( Note when you bow you do it from the attention position. bend at the waist , keep your arms at your sides , do not put your head down you would n't take your eyes off your opponent so do n't lower your eyes when you bow . </bow.v.1903><bow.v.1904>Figure 2 is a partial view of a stringed instrument practice bow guide showing a bow track of the bow guide in an open position. Figure 3 is a side plan view of a frame and bow track of the Figure 1 stringed instrument practice bow guide . </bow.v.1904><bow.v.1905>Upon entering the dojo , if you see the instructor , greet him by bowing and offer a greeting of " Hello Sensei " or Good evening Sensei " in a clear tone. In a Zen temple a monk has a daily interview with the Roshi ( headmaster ) . At that time he strikes a kansho ( bell ) to announce his presence. The Roshi hearing the tone of the kansho immediately knows the state of mental/physical integration of the monk. In the same spirit the Aikido deshi ( student ) announces his presence when first entering the Dojo. The instructor should instantly gauge his understanding by the sound of his voice. When Sensei replies " welcome " , the simultaneously existing relationships of fellow Aikidoka and teacher/student are re-affirmed in a traditional manner . </bow.v.1905><bow.v.1906>Today it is not necessary to be so polite. Still , it is not possible to convey the respect and appreciation in one 's heart unless you express it in an acceptable way. The neglect of the bow marks a general decline in the etiquette of today 's Japanese. Imagine if a person said , " I share your grief , " while standing with his hands in his pockets. Certainly , his sentiments would not be judged sincere. In order to truly make your heart known , you should bow with the back kept straight. True respect begins with this gesture . </bow.v.1906><bow.v.1907>When entering or leaving the dojo , stand at the doorway , heels together hands by your side in musubi dachi ( informal attention stance ) and bow , saying Oss . This shows respect for the dojo , Sensei and everyone training at the dojo. Students must bow in this same manner to their partner at the beginning and at the end of training with that person. This too is a sign of courtesy and respect , it shows good manners . </bow.v.1907><bow.v.1908>( Well-mannered behavior toward others ) . This is a guild line , not a requirement however and bowing of knee and showing deference ( obedience , compliance ) to another is absolutely against all we as a nation stand for. We constantly hear those saying how proud we are of our service men and women , who have given all , then we see our President humble himself to a monarch. We as a people lost 27 , 500 souls during our revolution to obtain our freedom from a monarch to insure that our children never every had to bend a knee to another person ever again. We now have a President who does not respect those loses. I am angered by this false excuse for a man . </bow.v.1908><bow.v.1909>However , while we may have become informal that does n't mean the rest of the world has. Diplomatically there are still protocols and procedures. It may not matter to you that Obama bowed before a monarch , but I guarantee that it does to others who watch our every move and carefully listen to our every diplomatic word and phrase . </bow.v.1909><bow.v.1910>In short , when you are training in the dojo and not sure how to reply to someone , simply bow and give a strong ' OSU ! ' </bow.v.1910><bow.v.1911>1440 AD - The bow shown at left is a 'Centre Shot Stone Bow ' from an painting dated about 1440 AD. It is interesting to note the split bowstring shown , as this type of bowstring/cable set-up has recently been used on the modern Compound Bows to do away with using the usual cable guard set-up . </bow.v.1911><bow.v.1912>He Bowed , bigger than you please. It shows total disgrace for America , as well as to himself. To then lie about it , marks the worse evil America has witnessed so far , along with all his other disgraces . </bow.v.1912><bow.v.1913>Sandra , that 's a really good point. Can regular Americans bow to regular Japanese people while in Japan , or does that , too , violate some sort of American superiority complex ? Is Obama prohibited from bowing to any regular Japanese people ? </bow.v.1913><bow.v.1914>Aikido requires our respect and appreciation , it teaches much more than just how to defend yourself. We should respect the Dojo , O-Sensei ( Morihei Ueshiba ) , the instructor as well as our training partners. This respect is shown in Aikido by bowing , in western cultures this would be shown by shaking hands . </bow.v.1914><bow.v.1915>1.

In our aikido training , we can not practise without thanking him for the gift of his art. We do a kneeling bow to the Kamiza at the beginning and the end of the class. If one arrives late for the class , one kneels and bows to the Kamiza upon stepping onto the mat . </bow.v.1916><bow.v.1917>" ... .Mr. Runyon , I just wanted to say thanks for making the ordering of my first bow a really pleasant , positive experience , at no time did I feel overwhelmed or not taken seriously. Thanks also for including the rest I wanted as an even trade. As I mentioned during our conversation , I think your website is incredibly informative , easy to navigate and very beneficial to the new archer. I 've read through all of it and learned a lot and am now able to talk about bows and bow hunting with some confidence that I know what I 'm talking about ... lol. I know I 'll be back , and now that I 'm getting a new bow , I 'm sure my boyfriend Jason will succumb to new bow fever pretty soon and you 'll be getting an order from him too. Keep up the good work ! ... ... " -Dawn Crumbaker , Abingdon , MD </bow.v.1917><bow.v.1918>We bow when we enter the dojo and when we leave the dojo. You bow into the dojo to show respect for the place that exists for your improvement. We also bow when stepping on to the actual dojo floor , and when stepping off. It is important to understand the dojo is not a place to play around or train lightly. Training should be taken very seriously , and between your arriving bow and your departing bow , we all try to focus our actions on positive growth through martial arts training . </bow.v.1918><bow.v.1919>Listed above are the mean ages for these changes to occur so half of the children will correct their bowing earlier and half will correct it later. Occasionally , the bowing never fully corrects. That is why some adults have bowed legs. So you can see , there is a wide range of normal when looking at bowed legs. Physiologic bowing does not require any treatment other than observation for correction as the child grows . </bow.v.1919><bow.v.1920>Like many products , compound bows come in a variety of shapes , sizes , colors , and levels of sophistication. If you ' re new to the sport of archery , we ' ll guide you through all the jargon and technical hoopla and help you to make a better-informed choice on your new bow . </bow.v.1920><bow.v.1921>Of course , we should keep the " forgiveness " issue in some perspective. Good technique and a solid practice regimen are critical to success in the field , regardless of which bow you ultimately choose. But the less forgiving your bow is , the more exacting your technique will need to be. But do n't make more of this issue than need be. Within a typical 30 yard bowhunting range , virtually any properly-tuned compound bow can be shot with pin point accuracy. And with a little practice , even a novice shooter can easily bring down big game within this range. So if you hunt in dense woods where 20 and 30 yards shots are common , your bow 's " forgiveness " just is n't such a critical consideration. But if you hunt in more open country , where you must be able to reach out to 50 , 60 , even 70+ yards , where the smallest glitch means a wound or a miss , you should be more selective with the bow design you choose . </bow.v.1921><bow.v.1922>its called showing respect , and it 's clearly not Obama 's leg " stepping backward because he bowed so low " .. its the man standing in the background . </bow.v.1922><bow.v.1923>" Nama " means bow , " as " means I , and " te " means you.

In tea ceremony , whenever someone bows that means they are showing you respect. So you bow back. Respect is always mutual in order to have harmony. " I tried to mimic the student 's bow as best as I could. Her clear , white face did n't draw any response , but she stood up and walked back through the open door to the other room. She reappeared a moment later , carrying a ceramic tea bowl and some utensils . </bow.v.1924><bow.v.1925>In some mysterious way , the bow contains our whole life. One should be prepared to bow always , even in one 's most ordinary moments , and one 's last moments.

We bow to our partner , ( or opponent ) , to indicate to each other that we are alert and ready. The bow after the sparring shows our gratitude to the other person.At the beginning of each session we bow to indicate that we are clearing our minds of daily problems and events.

Newcomers to Japan think that you have to bow low to all and sundry. This is not the case. Any Japan Hand could tell you that there are gradations in the depth of the bow depending on the status of the participants. For instance , the kimono'ed Mama-san of a traditional establishment will bow extremely low to her valued customers , but the customers are certainly not obliged to return the compliment -- a shallow bow will do . </bow.v.1935><bow.v.1936>In the severe weather warning process for squall lines and bow echoes , knowledge of the environment and accurate and timely assessment of WSR-88D reflectivity and velocity structure is crucial ! Reflectivity is used to delineate those locations for greatest potential for damaging straight-line winds and tornadoes. Certain reflectivity structures typically are associated with very strong surface winds and tornadoes. Velocity ( base and storm-relative ) data also is used to evaluate straight-line wind potential and mesocyclone evolution . </bow.v.1936><bow.v.1937>4. Slide your right foot back into a cat stance facing 12 o'clock while covering your left hand ( on hip , palm up ) with a right vertical fist. Step out into a right forward bow facing 3 o'clock while simultaneously executing a right outward block and a left reverse punch . </bow.v.1937><bow.v.1938>Arrowheads were first made of burnt wood , then stone or bone , and then metals. Various woods and bones were used for the bow itself. However , it was not a powerful weapon until the invention of the compound , or composite , bow around 1500 B.C. on the steppes of Central Asia. A composite bow is made of various materials ( wood , horn , sinew ) glued together so as to increase their natural strength and elasticity. Bows and arrows were among the dominant weapons used by Assyrian chariots , Parthian cavalry , Mongol horsemen , and English longbowmen. At other times they have been used more as auxiliary weapons for massed infantry or cavalry . </bow.v.1938><bow.v.1939>That said , the president of the United States does not bow to kings. He is not only the chief of government , he ' s our head of state the equal of any monarch. The White House says Obama didn ' t bow , that he grasped ( Abdullah ' s ) hand with two hands and he ' s taller than King Abdullah. </bow.v.1939><bow.v.1940>When bowing from this position the head should never touch the ground. You should look about 6 to 8 feet in front of you and bow from the hips. Your hands should be placed palm down. First left then the right. The hands should form a triangle using the thumbs and fore fingers. Once again this comes from the days of the Samurai. By placing the left hand down first it showed that you meant no harm , because you could not draw your sword from this position. The bow is complete when you return to the upright position . </bow.v.1940><bow.v.1941>As for saluting , I suppose that it and bowing are different forms of the same thing. Is it more accurate to say that our presidents who salute are returning salutes , rather than rendering them ? Anyway , it started with the " Great Communicator " , who must have really enjoyed returning salutes during the tough Hollywood and Santa Monica campaigns of WWII , and began the practice of presidential salute-returning. A humorous note. Years ago my father in law , a Canadian businessman , drove on post to visit us in a big cadillac and sporting a crew cut. He could n't drive around the streets of Ft. Knox without getting saluted by all and sundry . </bow.v.1941><bow.v.1942>Or , you can send us the order by old fashioned US Mail , sending us a check , bank draft or money order.

Bowing has been part of Buddhist practice since the Buddha 's time in India and continues to this day. Within the Buddhist Sangha , or monastic community , the daily liturgical schedule began and ended with dozens if not hundreds of ritual prostrations. On ceremony days , clergy and laity alike might engage in the practice of liturgical repentance and bow up to ten thousand times. [ xxxiii ] Monks and nuns bow to the images of Sages , Awakened Beings , and the Buddhas , to their superiors , and to each other . </bow.v.1943><bow.v.1944>Ordinarily ancestor memorial services were held for ancestors up to four generations back; for ancestors further back than the fourth generation , ancestor memorial services were held only once a year at their graves. Songmyo is a visit to the ancestral graves to bow and inform them of the new year. Songmyo was a custom that was equal to doing sebae for living people; it was an absolutely necessary act of etiquette for descendants. Upon finishing songmyo , sebae ( a formal bow of respect to one 's elders ) was performed. Sebae is a younger person 's bowing to an older person as the first greeting at the new year. Sebae is done by kneeling down and bowing politely . </bow.v.1944><bow.v.1945>In addition to bowing at the beginning or end of class , students should bow when entering and exiting the dojang , or training hall. Traditionally , the dojang has been used to signify any place where students train , whether this is outside in a field , in a gymnasium , or in a school. Bowing , in this case , signifies respect for the sanctity of the training area , as a special place outside of the everyday world . </bow.v.1945><bow.v.1946>Otherwise it will be about your voting record and you do not want to live through that punishment , especially if you are innocent.

Be a man and take vice , bow to the woman who is the last vestige of the New Deal which represents universal health care. You ca n't win without the votes of the people who support Clinton. You do not have the working class vote; you do not have the majority on your side even with independents. The states you win are not swing states or even Democratic states. You are a spoiler and your campaign is alienating the Clinton vote.

First thing to remember is that no bad feelings enter the dojo. Ever. It does n't matter if you happen to partner up with your worst enemy - in the dojo you behave as though you have never sparred your partner before. Before beginning , you bow to your opponent , then step backwards into Han Zen Kutsu Dachi. Stepping forwards implies an arrogance which is not acceptable in the dojo. If your opponent gets past your defences , you should acknowledge a good technique with a quick " Hai ! " , preferably stopping , bowing and showing where the hit was. The most important rule of kumite in the dojo is NO CONTACT . </bow.v.1948><bow.v.1949>You should bow to your sensei as a sign of respect and of thanks.

You should also bow to your fellow students , whether they are a higher or lower rank . </bow.v.1949><bow.v.1950>Rei - ( bow ) everyone places their hands in front of them on the floor , creating a triangle with the tips of their thumbs and fingers. They will then bow , bringing their upper body to a vertical position , </bow.v.1950><bow.v.1951>Lets start with bowing. For many martial arts schools bowing is an key part of the package. Bowing is generally dressed up as a way to show respect. For me personally I have no problem of bowing to others on the mat when local custom demands it. I have heard it said that bowing is just an Asian handshake; but this is in no way true. To say that bowing is like a handshake is to ignore the cultural significance of the bow. Bowing is demonstration of hierarchy , of obedience and submission. Many people 's religious beliefs demand they bow before no one but God. Can you say to these folks a bow is nothing more then a handshake ? </bow.v.1951><bow.v.1952>" Bow Triplets " or bowed triplets is the expression for one of the most frequent ornamentations used by Irish fiddlers to add that special and traditional groove and excitement that we know and love with Celtic music.

Other members of the family consider this refusal to follow a tradition to be a serious form of rejection of the family . </bow.v.1954><bow.v.1955>The examples of worship in the Bible confirms that in the biblical culture , people bowed down before those to whom they wanted to show respect or honor. Lot worshipped ( shachah ) the strangers who came to Sodom even though he had never seen them before. He prostrated himself before them to show them respect ( Gen. 19 : 1 ) . Moses worshipped ( shachah ) his father in law , whom he respected and honored ( Ex. 18 : 7 ) . Abigail worshipped ( shachah ) David. She honored him by prostrating herself before him. These three examples can be multiplied many times over , but they show that when someone wanted to honor another , he would fall down before him. The act of falling down is called worship , and reveals the heart of the worshipper respect and honor towards the one being worshipped . </bow.v.1955><bow.v.1956>Last week I was re-reading the book of Daniel.

The instrument was invented toward the end of Qing Dynasty ( 1644 to 1912 ) based on the pluck string Sanxian and bowed string erhu. The striking difference from Erhu is that Zhuihu has a fretless fingerboard similar to Sanxian. The use of the bow is similar to that of erhu. Basically the instrument is derived from a smaller version of Sanxian performed with a bow , producing beautiful sounds with a strong local flavour , capable of imitating a lot of natural sounds such as birds and horse etc. The playing methods adapt the left hand techniques for the Sanxian and the bow techniques of erhu. The Zhuihu is one of the most beautiful instruments of the huqin family , which has become very popular soon after its invention in Henan and Shandong . </bow.v.1959><bow.v.1960>Inside the church , the corner posts are essential. They are often accentuated , and are heavier and more richly decorated than the other structural elements. " They represent the four gospels whose teachings are the supporting foundation of all Christianity " is the description given in a sermon in the thirteenth century. This sermon was held during a church consecration , in which each section of the stave church 's structure was related to spiritual values. The beams upon which the columns rest " signify God 's apostles , the foundation of all Christianity.

This consisted on catching the eye of anyone in the office who glanced up at me and bowing very rapidly before he or she could turn away. The most effective bow to use in this situation , it seems , is a short , jerky one. This action triggers a reflex in the Japanese , and the party bows back , thus acknowledging your presence.

I also hear some Jews voted for Obama because he appointed Jews to certain positions. I so far have not seen him do anything to help anyone over all ! He just spins the nation into greater debt and mingles more openly with dictatorships than Bush did. Personally I feel a little scared. Obama is charasmatic and bold and Americans wanted someone like that so " save them " . Now he 's taking over and its at our expense , no one seems saved.

Because I ' m going to walk towards you , either I sit down where I am , or you go away from the place and then that ' s the time I can have the free way for crossing. It is very interesting if you see this area of our culture. " </bow.v.1973><bow.v.1974>Context is all important. The word could mean worship , or it could mean a simple sign of respect , or even affection in friendship as when David bowed before Jonathan. It is in this context that the word finds it 's broadest meaning. However , when we apply the action to a god , it becomes an act of worship. In that act of bowing to a god , it is an indication of submission to it and that you will serve it. It is the person 's heart which is critical; who are they serving ? In the Bible , whenever bowing to God or an idol is mentioned , the context of serving that god is usually included , the implication being that it is to the exclusion of other gods. It is this attitude of being in submission to God that the word " worship " holds for the Jew. It is not just offering up words and bowing , but an attitude of the heart to serve God and Him alone . </bow.v.1974><bow.v.1975>During training you push yourself as hard as possible because you respect yourself. When you finish you bow to your insructor and fellow students and say " Osu " once more. You do this out of appreciation. This feeling of appreciation is " Osu " . </bow.v.1975><bow.v.1976>3rd step : Prostrating , for a male this is done by bowing and letting the hands and arms touch the floor. When the hands are laid bare on the floor , the thumbs should be about one khuep ( measurement from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when the hand is fully spread out ) apart , leaving some space for the forehead to touch the floor. Both elbows should be placed next to the knees. A female should do the same except that the elbows can be placed on the knees , not next to them. This gesture is called krap . </bow.v.1976><bow.v.1977>Balance : This bow sits extremely well balanced in the hand. We suspect the non-reflexed riser caused by the extended limb pockets gives this bow it ' s balanced feel , but then again , we ' re not bow designers ! When watching someone draw this bow , you can see the symmetry on the top and bottom. It only makes sense that this type of symmetry leads to improved balance throughout the shot . </bow.v.1977><bow.v.1978>The majority of new shooters set their bows for too much draw length , which can result in poor shooting form , inaccuracy , and painful string slap on the forearm. You will better enjoy , and be more successful with your new bow when it is fitted properly to your body. Fortunately , recurve bows can be drawn to any draw length within a reasonable range. However , draw length must be established so that arrows can be trimmed to the correct length for your shooting system. Unlike compound bows , with traditional equipment , if in doubt , go a little long. Arrows that are an inch longer than absolutely necessary wo n't hurt your shooting. Arrows that are an inch too short will force you to use shooting form which is less than ideal , resulting in inconsistency . </bow.v.1978><bow.v.1979>Bow Weight - The trend is very light weight bows. A light bow is nice if you are packing it all day on long hunts. Light bows tend to not be as accurate as a heavier bow. Most target shooters use heavier bows and add stabilizers. More mass is more stable. Check out target rifles. They all have heavy barrels. More mass also absorbs vibrations better , although there are a number of products on the market now that do a good job of absorbing vibrations . </bow.v.1979><bow.v.1980>Science News , June 12th , 1993.

But , for what purpose ? We have already seen that bowing was context sensitive , and we know that the Israelites had many images in their temple. It specifically says that you shall not bow down in order to serve them , that is , over and above God. It is because this would take the place of God that God indicates that He is a jealous God who will not have other gods before Him , as He clearly states in the first commandment . </bow.v.1983><bow.v.1984>What 's worse than this ...

It must be remembered that when violinist plays scales , they instinctively play each note as loudly as the others , compensating for unevenness in the instrument with adjustments in bow-speed and pressure. The reciprocal bow makes no such allowances; one hears how the violin would sound if bowed in a truly even manner . </bow.v.1987><bow.v.1988>The real question should not be , " Is venerating Icons worshiping an idol , " but , " What am I worshiping ? " In reality , if we are honest with ourselves , we tend to not want to venerate the Saints because we really worship our own egos and intellects. Venerating another person is humbling to ourselves , and our nature goes against that. Yet , veneration of others is what Paul was talking about in Phil 2 : 3 , that we esteem each other as more important than ourselves. There is nothing like bowing and kissing another that illustrates this attitude better. Then we should ask ourselves , " Can I properly set my mind on the Saints above through honoring them through their Icons and make a heavenly reality more real to me ? " If so , then you are within the teachings of the Church and are free , even encouraged to show the proper honor and respect to the Saints , the Theotokos , and to worship Christ as God . </bow.v.1988><bow.v.1989>Commissioner Christopher O.

[ 6 ] They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow. These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. In the 1980s , the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts , and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the Traditional Bowyer\ 's Bibles ( see Additional reading ) .Fred Bear , The sport of modern game archery owes much of its succes to Fred Bear , an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer. He was born March 5 , 1902 , in the town of Waynesboro , Pennsylvania. Although he did not start bow hunting until he was 29 and did not master the skill for many years , he is widely regarded as what some people like to call \ " A by god legend\ " and pioneer in the bow-hunting community.

The sleeve includes co axial " O-rings " that secure the sleeve to the string. The tube does not secure the shaft within a stroke axis of a string however , and , as with Becker and Hanly , a student would have to use an artificial bow to use Plummer 's device , and movement of the shaft is not constrained within a string contact plan of any specific string.

Schools of violin playing differ over where the bow should be drawn. The Galamian method emphasizes set " sounding points " for the optimum in rich tonal sonority. These sounding points differ on which bow stroke is used ... and is slightly different for each violin , but generally , *all* detache strokes ( short and long ) should be drawn *very close* to the bridge. It does n't matter whether one is playing piano or forte ... it should be drawn close to the bridge. The " sounding point " for spicatto/sautille type bowing is more towards the middle area between the bridge and fingerboard. The Auer pupils ( i.e. Heifetz et al ) also played in this manner. The idea behind the sounding point is that the string gives back the most tone for bow drawn. The detache s.p. is near the bridge because the string provides the most " springy " resistance there. However , just drawing the bow stroke in these sounding points is n't enough ... the proper bow arm form/technique must accompany it to make it work. ~Sheila </bow.v.2043><bow.v.2044>So why not resist just as strenuously the imposition of such an offensive and ugly concept as monarchy ? Why ca n't we just explain to Japan ( and England and Saudi Arabia ) that , while we respect their citizenry and decorum , we politely decline to show deference to their royalty. We come from a country that believes all men and women are equal and we do not bow to kings. That is OUR custom . </bow.v.2044><bow.v.2045>It is one thing to grasp hands and nod the head downward as a sign of respect but its another thing to bow that low and forward and that ' s exactly what Obama did. It was a grovel bow . </bow.v.2045><bow.v.2046>Deuteronomy 29 : 26 and they went and served other gods , and bowed down to them , gods whom they knew not , and whom he had not assigned to them. ( Root in DBY YLT NIV ) </bow.v.2046><bow.v.2047>Yeah this was stupid at the time , and I thought it was long-since forgotten about. It 's a show of respect , not an act of submission. To not bow would be the equivalent of someone refusing to shake an extended hand . </bow.v.2047><bow.v.2048>The Desert Fathers of Egypt practiced bowing as mortification and as punishment , as well as to praise the Lord. St. Francis of Assisi 's humility brought him close to the ground. At his deathbed he instructed the monks to remove his clothes and lay his dying body on the bare ground inside the Portiuncula , the tiny chapel beloved of Francis. He wished to be close to the earth as his spirit returned to the creator . </bow.v.2048><bow.v.2049>Hey , if people are lining the streets wearing Burger King crowns to welcome the Queen , I think Thomas Paine would approve. The American experience treats monarchy as novelty. In old colonial days around the world , people bowed and they seethed against their colonial masters. Today , in America , I think people bow not because they think the Queen is a greater person than they are , but maybe because despite all the crowns , history and hoopla , she is one of us , and she has earned her bow . </bow.v.2049><bow.v.2050>I would like to think BO was just being respectful , unlike when he bowed to the Saudi King.

Modern bows use fiberglass , metal , rubber and plastics . </bow.v.2052><bow.v.2053>So , joining our hands palm to palm , we simultaneously create and express the absolute , the oneness which goes beyond all dichotomies. It is from this perspective that we make the gassho , and that we bow . </bow.v.2053><bow.v.2054>To make a polite bow , simply lower your upper body by about 15 degrees as a sign of courtesy. You do not have to bow to your close friends , but it is never a bad idea to bow as you say hello to an elderly person . </bow.v.2054><bow.v.2055>As for previous incidents , I do know Nancy Reagan caused a minor scandal by curtsying to the Queen of England. Also , Bill Clinton bowed his head slightly to the emperor of Japan who was raising a wine glass to toast him - something emperors rarely do . </bow.v.2055><bow.v.2056>Katagiri Roshi 's bowing verse , as witnessed by Norman Fischer , testifies to the continuity of tradition from China of the Song Dynasty through Japan , to meet again in the West. Bowing in Chan and Zen , is more than a surrogate for sitting. It has meaning that engages physical , mental and spiritual aspects of cultivation. Bowing has a psychological function of replacing self-centric delusion. As the view of self drops away , karma has no point on which to gather; the deeper connections of our spiritual nature 's interdependence gradually emerge to consciousness . </bow.v.2056><bow.v.2057>Stabilisation and Damping Modern target bows benefit from stabilisation and damping. Firstly , the long-rod. Like most things in archery , you need one that suits your bow , this is important , try it out first at a shop , try lots out , try lots of combinations of V-bars , doinkers , the lot , so you know what feels right for you. The main point of note is that a long-rod 's primary purpose is to put some weight outside the bow to help in the balance of it , not , as many think , as stabilisation , although it does that too. Most people start with a long-rod , but this often causes the bow to fall forward alarmingly , so one can also put on some V-bars to bring some weight back towards the archer. This is often used by a lot of people as it provides a good firm bow in the hand that 's well balanced. Again , make sure you try before you buy , and if they 're adjustable , then play about with what they do , but most importantly , ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND NOTE WHAT YOU DID ! ! ! , otherwise you wo n't be able to recreate that 'magic ' shot when everything felt right with the bow . </bow.v.2057><bow.v.2058>Another fundamental precept of the ordinary bow : it must be reciprocated. To do otherwise is a grave insult. Yet , we see in this short video clip that the Emperor did not even nod his head. To be honest , I am not sure the Emperor is ever supposed to bow back to anyone. He is , after all , according to Shinto , a god . </bow.v.2058><bow.v.2059>There are some left-handed violinists who string and bow exactly in the mirror image of the right-handed ones. No one knows why , but these southpaws have not produced the real greats. Among the more famous of the left-handers was a certain Charlie Chaplin who , as everyone knows , made his mark in another performing area . </bow.v.2059><bow.v.2060>But bowing has a long , complex , and utterly democratic tradition in Japan. Everyone bows to everyone , all the time. To show thanks , to show understanding , to show good will - it is a culture that highly prizes civility and courtesy. Go to Japan and shout at a sales clerk , the clerk will bow as s/he apologizes. Not because you are right , or superior , but because they pretty much respond to every public situation with politeness , even when they are n't getting any in return . </bow.v.2060><bow.v.2061>The handshake probably was n't necessary to do at the same time as the bow. What Obama should have done was shake hands , then bow , since Akihito already had his hand extended. So it was a little awkward. But he did not demean himself in front of a foreign leader , he did not embarrass the United States , and he probably helped to improve our foreign relations some small amount. You see , even if he made a mistake , he was still willing to go to the effort of trying , and that , unlike what most Americans think , speaks volumes to people of other countries . </bow.v.2061><bow.v.2062>A study of the Hebrew word shachah and the Greek word proskuneo reveals that both these words mean to bow down. The Hebrew word shachah ( Strong ' s number 7812 ) is used of bowing or prostrating oneself , often before a superior or before God. [ 1 ] In the King James Version , it is translated by a number of different English words , including : worship ( 99 times ) , bow ( 31 times ) , bow down ( 18 times ) , obeisance ( 9 times ) , and reverence ( 5 times ) . </bow.v.2062><bow.v.2063>I think that the bowing or not bowing to symbols is best left to the individual.If you feel as though that this is idol worshipping than i think it best not to do it but maybe a slight bow of the head as to not offend others or you do not have to do this but just enter and sit on a cushion.If you feel as though that prostrating before a image is not idol worshipping than by all means do it.The issue should not be legalism or not but liberation and using any means for this goal is what we should be be focused on not worrying about the acts themselves.We should use our common sense.Even the Buddha said that the dharma is a raft to get to the other side of the river and once we get there we should disregard the raft . </bow.v.2063><bow.v.2064>He is a performer , a plastic actor who can be shaped by any whim that strikes him.

The senior will begin the class with the words " Face Master Ang/instructor , bow " , where the class will bow to Master Ang or the instructor. At the end of the class the sentence and bow is repeated , followed by the second most senior saying " Face senior , bow " where all will bow to the most senior of the class . </bow.v.2066><bow.v.2067>I am not an Obama supporter but for heaven sakes , the man is so tall he has to bow to shake hands with the tiny king. And his wife made a simple and warm spontaneous gesture to Queen Elizabeth II. In fact , maybe Micehle thought the Queen was grasping her to steady herself. I think they are doing just fine . </bow.v.2067><bow.v.2068>Self bows , be they long or short , wide or narrow , flat-bellied or radiused , can never approach the efficiency of reflexed laminates or composites , especially those with bamboo , horn , baleen or even fiberglass bellies , because wood under compression can not handle the work load of these other materials. Self bows therefore almost always require an even distribution of stress throughout their length of limb , sometimes even into their handles , to keep from failing. Not coincidentally , self wood bowyers speak of tillering a bow so that it " comes round to arc " because they are everywhere along the limb flirting with the elastic limits of belly wood . </bow.v.2068><bow.v.2069>The Ventura was first offered by Howatt ( now Martin ) over 30 years ago as an affordable target bow for the average archer. Top-of-the-line target recurves with their custom fit handles and exotic woods were three times as expensive. According to a 1964 news release by Howatt , " At $ 44.50 , the Ventura was added to fill the need for a quality bow at a modest price. This was accomplished by eliminating many of the custom options available on most Howatt bows. Length , handle style and bow glass color were also standardized on the Ventura. " </bow.v.2069><bow.v.2070>From the beginning its lightness and agility was absolutely tempting.

By tradition , in the Temple in Jerusalem , kneeling was part of the regular service , but this is not part of a modern Jewish service . </bow.v.2072><bow.v.2073>The bow , seeded in Japanese tradition , is a symbol of respect and trust. As a contact and impact activity in which partners need each other to learn and progress , partners are responsible for each other 's safety and well being. Therefore , when we bow on the judo mat before the exercise , we entrust our partner. After the exercise we bow in thanks for not violating that trust . </bow.v.2073><bow.v.2074>We bring the hands together at the heart chakra to increase the flow of Divine love. Bowing the head and closing the eyes helps the mind surrender to the Divine in the heart. One can do Namaste to oneself as a meditation technique to go deeper inside the heart chakra; when done with someone else , it is also a beautiful , albeit quick , meditation . </bow.v.2074><bow.v.2075>The bottom line ? Venerating Icons is only worship if the person doing it does it for that purpose. When we understand the cultural context of veneration of Icons and the traditional way that it has been taught and practiced through out the Church 's history , it becomes clear that not only is this something that is permissible and good , but necessary to safeguard the faith that Christ really did come in the flesh. Not to mention the richness and depth they add to worship , connecting us with the broader worshiping community of the faithful down through the ages. You 've heard the slogan " Have you hugged your kid today ? " Well , for the Orthodox it would be " Have you bowed to and kissed a Saint today ?

Many of these democratic obama worshipers like to point out the fact that past leaders did bow however they never bowed as deeply ( which is a very big element in their culture ) and all received a reciprocating bow.

During the concluding Aleinu section of the services , congregants usually bow when they say " V'anachnu korim umishtachavim u'modim , " meaning " we bend our knees , prostrate , and acknowledge our thanks. " Another moment in the service which triggers the bow is during the " Bar'chu. " Many bow at the mention of " Adonai " ( the Jewish addressing of the Lord ) at this and various other parts in the service ( most likely if they are to remain standing during that prayer ) . </bow.v.2079><bow.v.2080>Lot 's of interesting comments. But you 're all focusing on irrelevant information. It does n't matter if Obama is black. It does n't matter if the king of Saudi Arabia is Muslim. The US President should not bow to anyone ... . EVER. That alone was his mistake , and shows how dangerously naive Obama is . </bow.v.2080><bow.v.2081>Yay , Raw Fisher. My feelings exactly. Bad move on Tim Kaine 's part. Private people can bow all they want , but no state representatives should have. The queen insists on rigid protocol in her home , and we should insist on our own rigid protocol. Americans do n't bow to monarchs . </bow.v.2081><bow.v.2082>Although some older regional styles survive to a degree in the more westerly counties , most players now develop their own personal styles in a eclectic fashion or imitate the styles of virtuoso players. The Northern style , as now chiefly exemplified in that of Donegal , is hurried in pace , has a plain melodic line with little ornamentation except for some characteristic droning , double-stopping and bowed triplets , and features much single bowing which results in staccato notes and short phrases. In contrast , the styles of Sligo , Galway , Clare , Kerry and Cork are , to different degrees , more relaxed in pace , feature longer bowing , and have more embellished melodic lines , with frequent slurring and long phrasing common . </bow.v.2082><bow.v.2083>The first night I took the lost Creek to the range I quickly found some good flying arrows and after about 20 shots headed for the 3D course. The bow was as easy to shoot as any bow I have shot , and that evening I shot 2 rounds with it and produced some very respectable scores. The following morning , in fact all weekend this is the only bow I shot. It is unusual for me to shoot the same bow for more than 1 round unless I am in a competition . </bow.v.2083><bow.v.2084>Again the exact mechanics used for the seated bow depend on the situation and/or the status of the person receiving the courtesy. While seated the hands lay flat on the upper thighs while at attention and either on the upper thighs or cupping hara when relaxed. The angle of bowing will differ according to whether the person receiving the bow is junior , equal , or senior to you as will the spacing between the hands. With seated bows , the hands should slide directly forward to the front of the knees. Women sometimes bring their hands closer together , as with the formal standing bow. You will notice that many of the previously described bows are the same as those explained below. The most common types of bow include </bow.v.2084><bow.v.2085>Being a good woodworker does n't mean you can build a good bow. So many different disciplines come into play and a strong understanding of them all is necessary.

When the hair is tightened by the screw mechanism at the end of the stick , the stick is partially straightened. The bow is thus spring-loaded and ready for the range of strokes required in music of the 18th to the 20th centuries : long , sustained tones; crisply detached notes; passages of individual , bounced strokes; and rapid-fire chains of staccato tones carried out in a single , up- or downward sweep of the bow . </bow.v.2088><bow.v.2089>I CARE BEN ! ! !

It is used to say hi and goodbye , and serves the same purpose as a handshake. A bow is meant to acknowledge the dignity of the person you bow to , regardless of their rank in karate or position in life. It is a sign of mutual respect , human being to human being.

Martin use the twin cam on their elite models and the hybrid and single cam on lower models. Martin are affordable bows. A Martin bow was used to set the current FITA record , however Martin has really struggled to be a major force in the archery game. I feel part of the reason for this may be the apparent confusion on what is the best riser , limbs and cams , while Martin offer bows with various options it is hard to know what to choose , given the massive range of options. I have been a major champion for Martin over the years however in 2007 it is hard to find a Martin bow which is superiour to other brands . </bow.v.2093><bow.v.2094>Which bow you choose will largely depend on your shooting preference and body size.

Apprenticed in Mirecourt , and under Francois Tourte. He moved to Paris in 1783. His bows resemble those of the early Adam school , and are considered rare. His bows are noted for their elasticity and lightness. Occasionally Maire and Pajeot fils used his brand name. His son , pupil , and successor was Joseph Rene Lafleur who initially started out as a violinist. His bows can be observed in the Museum of the Paris Conservatoire. He also made a bow with a flat stick. back to top </bow.v.2101><bow.v.2102>I wanted to check out the video specifically to verify that he did n't bow , or at least bow correctly. I 've been living in a bowing culture for some time now , and I have to say that Americans are absolutely awful at bowing. Genuflecting in the formal term takes some practice to get right. It is not natural for Americans. What I have found is that the purpose of the bow is to show deference and respect , and the person bowing should be focused on the downward motion. Most Americans are really only concerned with the getting back up and getting it over with part. Obama executed a very deliberate and purposeful bow , lowering his head below that of the King and pausing respectfully at the bottom. That was a bow if I have ever seen one , and a darn good one at that . </bow.v.2102><bow.v.2103>Bowing seems simple , but there are some different ways of bowing. It depends on the social status or age of the person you bow to.

In the Middle Eastern and Hellenistic traditions , beginning with the Ugaritic and Accadian religions of ancient Babylon , we discover a kinshipin language , liturgy and doctrine between Babylonian and Semitic bowing practices. Babylonian texts , Hebrew scriptures , and the Kur'an , explain bowing in similar fashion . </bow.v.2104><bow.v.2105>Last I heard we still had military bases in Japan.

By setting up the Bow Rest &amp;Holder on a tree or pole at ground level , the beginner can concentrate on form rather than having to worry about holding the bow steady. He can know that his sights are on target , so if his arrow misses the mark it must be due to bow setup or improper form . </bow.v.2106><bow.v.2107>Several points follow from the definition of a above about the bow rotation axis. Firstly the 'natural ' bow rotation axis can never be at the bow center of gravity as this would contravene the Conservation of Momentum Principle. Secondly the closer the applied force is to bow center of gravity the further away from C is the 'natural ' rotation axis. Thirdly the higher the value of Kg the further away from C is the 'natural ' rotation axis . </bow.v.2107><bow.v.2108>One should breath in while bending forward. Next , one should exhale when she or he stops at the lowest part of the bow. Finally , one inhales once more as he or she returns to his or her initial posture. This method of breathing allows the back to stretch naturally. As well , the motion of the head will draw a smooth arc. These are two fundamental pieces of a visually pleasing and sincere bow. It is important to have the bow " look " correct so that it conveys the correct message. An example once given to me was to consider a person at a funeral saying , " I feel great sympathy for your tragic loss , " while standing with his or her hands in his or her pockets jingling loose change. These sentiments would not be judged sincere. To sincerely convey a message , bow correctly by keeping the back straight. True respect is seen to start with this gesture . </bow.v.2108><bow.v.2109>I returned to California and began formal study and practice of Mahayana Buddhism with Venerable Chan Master Hsuan Hua at Gold Mountain Monastery in 1974. Gold Mountain 's schedule included many prostrations during a daily minimum of two and a half hours of liturgical ceremonies. Novice monks and nuns performed an hour each morning of " universal bowing. " Optional personal practices included bowing repentances , bowing to each word in a sutra ( scripture ) , or the distinctive " three steps , one bow " practice which requires the practitioner to take three steps and make a full prostration . </bow.v.2109><bow.v.2110>I did a test drive on a Robertson Stykbow it was a masterpeice a true work of art.

Japan is parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch its emperor. The emperor is the chief of state as are our presidents. Two individuals of equal rank greet each other in the same way. Did you see the Emperor bowing from his waist down and stretching to reach Obama ' s hand ? No.The keywords are appropriate and subtle. The bow must demonstrate a delicate balance between respect , proper protocol , and appreciation for the Japanese tradition concerning age and rank . </bow.v.2114><bow.v.2115>We made a very special purchase of these good quality Pernambuco bows at the winter trade show.

That we could have no other God before us results in not bowing to another god. As Jesus says , we can not serve two masters equally. Bowing in submission to an idol ( the Hebrew word for " idol " means " empty and vain " ) suggested that they had taken their submission away from God. The emphasis of the bowing was to show whom one served when done to one perceived as a god . </bow.v.2116><bow.v.2117>You think it 's worse for the U.S. to deal respectfully with a trade partner than for its President to bow deeply before their king. And you think that bending the neck to receive a medal is equivalent to bowing deeply in obeisance to the Saudi king . </bow.v.2117><bow.v.2118>In Japan the bow is practiced by everyone , and it has many meanings. Japanese greet each other by bowing - shaking hands is reserved for westerners , though many Japanese are cleary uncomfortable with the physical contact. In addition to greeting , bowing can express respect , thanks , and apology . </bow.v.2118><bow.v.2119>Many people wear neck ties to conform to an organization 's color or pattern requirements such as schools or sports teams. However , there are many people who wear neck ties or bow ties to express their mood , hobby , or interests. Good examples of these are : </bow.v.2119><bow.v.2120>Most catalog companies offer a variety of compound bows to the consumer. The problem with ordering from a catalog has always been selecting a draw length. Often catalogue companies simply do not offer the bow in your draw length , nor will they set up your bow . </bow.v.2120><bow.v.2121>[ 0007 ] The present invention is intended to provide a flexible holster or holder for archery bows , where the bow is carried in the upright shooting position and capable of being operated simultaneously by either hand. The bow can be free standing in the upright position without the aid of the user 's hands allowing the user to rest both arms or perform some other task with the user 's hands. In further description , the particular apparatus may be described as a flexible support member for encircling the waist of a user with an adjustable holster or cradle extending therefrom to the front of the user. The support member may be symmetric around the centerline of the human body , or may be offset to the right or the left of the centerline , and the adjustable holster is disposed on the support member , aligned symmetrically with the centerline of the support member. The holster is adjustable to receive differently configured bows having sufficient clearance for compound bows as well as long and other types of bows . </bow.v.2121><bow.v.2122>I do n't know what the big deal is ? Saudi Arabia is a country that still has a large slave population. The Arabs have historically been prolific slave traders. For an inferior , slave race to greet the king upright would have been arrogant. Obama actually did the right thing. Had Obama not bowed to the Saudi king it would have been a great insult. God knows the last thing we want to do is make the peace loving muslims mad . </bow.v.2122><bow.v.2123>The defeat was bitter in many ways , but at the end of the day only one team progresses. This simply wasn ' t the year for the Old Lady of Turin. Juventus still managed a feat that many of their counterparts failed to bow out gracefully . </bow.v.2123><bow.v.2124>Brace Height - This probably influences accuracy and speed more than any other feature. Brace height is the distance from the string to the grip of the bow. A lower brace height gives a longer power stroke so the arrow absorbs more energy and is faster. A low brace height also keeps the arrow on the string longer so any irregularity in your form has more of an effect on the arrow. Bows with a brace height below 7 " tend to be a little tricky to shoot for hunting . </bow.v.2124><bow.v.2125>Exploitation of the pernambuco tree dates back centuries , to the days when it was highly sought after by Europeans for its dyewood. That exploitation continued apace once pernambuco became the preferred material for musical bows. It ' s a difficult wood , says Rymer. The old formula for pernambuco bows was eight to ten tons of raw wood for a single seventy-gram bow. An entire tree could be cut down without yielding any bow-quality wood. Thanks to a more scientific approach to bow making , that old formula no longer applies , but wood waste is inevitable : Only the heartwood is suitable for a performance-quality bow . </bow.v.2125><bow.v.2126>Revelation 15 : 4 who may not fear Thee , O Lord , and glorify Thy name ? because Thou alone 'art ' kind , because all the nations shall come and bow before Thee , because Thy righteous acts were manifested.

If that 's the case , he was sending a message that " americans do n't hate or denigrate you muslims " and that is true , we do n't . </bow.v.2127><bow.v.2128>1 Samuel 1 : 3 And that man hath gone up out of his city from time to time , to bow himself , and to sacrifice , before Jehovah of Hosts , in Shiloh , and there 'are ' two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , priests to Jehovah.

See that your backinp , piece is absolutely flat also , and well sanded with coarse abrasive too. Apply glue ( Casein , Weldwood or any resin glue ) liberally to both backing and bow back. Cut a pressure board of pine or other wood Y4 " thick and Y4 " narrower than your wood back. Place this over the back and bind your pressure board , wood back and bowstave together with rubber strips cut from an inner tube. Cut the strips Y2 " wide and use plenty. See that glue squeezes out all along the joint. Let it dry for at least a day before working on your backed stave . </bow.v.2129><bow.v.2130>The application of the bow at the perimeter of the string results in a more complex vibration , however. Referring to Figure 5 , since the mass of the string is effectively at the center , there will be some rotation of the string during bowing . </bow.v.2130><bow.v.2131>Bowing , as mentioned above is external manifestation of respect. It connotes appreciation and courtesy and in no way is associated with an attitude of subservience. Instructors bow to Juniors as well as Students to Instructors , and Seniors bow to Juniors as well as Juniors to Seniors. Respect and appreciation flows both ways . </bow.v.2131><bow.v.2132>Yeah , yeah. Here 's a youtube video of your President Obama.

" : Bow to the front of the room ( which shows respect for your training space , to the institution of karate , and to the line of instructors who brought it to your instructor ) . " Sensei ni rei ! " : Bow to the instructor. When you 're bowing , you can say " onegaishimas , " which , roughly translated , means " Please , " i.e. , please teach me , please help me , please hold class , etc. ( You may also say " oss , " the ubiquitous sign of respect in karate. ) At the signal of the instructor , get up quickly , wait for the person on your left to rise . </bow.v.2133><bow.v.2134>VILE ! Obama is the first US president to bow to a king. Is Obama subservient as a dhimmi , or is he acknowledging Abdullah 's staus as possessor of Mecca ? That latter has all sorts of implications . </bow.v.2134><bow.v.2135>Another thing about Japanese culture is that one who 's willing to humble himself in front of an equal ( or even someone who 's lower in rank ) shows that they are worthy of great respect , as they are so confident in their position and strength that they are willing to publicly lower themselves before another. I suspect the real reason Akihito 's response was so muted ( he did bow , but it was very small and was probably reflexive ) is because he was n't expecting a Western leader to do that , not that he was upset or embarrassed or whatever else people are saying . </bow.v.2135><bow.v.2136>At the end of class , resume a formal sitting position. Wait for the instructor to bow to O'Sensei 's picture and bow with him/her. Then bow to the instructor and remain in the sitting position until he/she leaves the mat. Then bow to your fellow students . </bow.v.2136><bow.v.2137>In fact , it is likely that bowed instruments are not much more than a thousand years old. Eric Halfpenny , writing in the 1988 Encyclopaedia Britannica , says " bowing can be traced as far back as the Islamic civilization of the 10th century ... it seems likely that the principle of bowing originated among the nomadic horse riding cultures of Central Asia , whence it spread quickly through Islam and the East , so that by 1000 it had almost simultaneously reached China , Java , North Africa , the Near East and Balkans , and Europe. " Halfpenny notes that in many Eurasian languages the word for " bridge " etymologically means " horse , " and that the Chinese regarded their own bowed instruments ( huqin </bow.v.2137><bow.v.2138>Genesis 33 : 6 Then the handmaids came near with their children , and they bowed themselves.

If he bowed to the prime minster of Japan because their culture called for it I would not have a problem either. I have a problem with Ben Smith stirring up these GOP trolls with this " secret White House aide " nonsense. GOP trolls do not understand that these type of things are not good sources because their minds are extremely small . </bow.v.2139><bow.v.2140>Like many products , compound bows come in a variety of shapes , sizes , colors , and levels of sophistication.

No advertising hype or sales pitches here . </bow.v.2140><bow.v.2141>This is the question I have not been able to answer from my measurements or from my playing. I must resort to reason and an " Achim 's razor " approach. All the words bow makers use about the " sound of a bow " or " conducting the sound " have to be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless , if the words are interpreted imprecisely they may not be far off the mark. A great bow sounds great ! It can do all the strokes , and handle wonderfully; but as we have seen in this review , so can many inexpensive bows. It is the sound ( s ) one can make with a great bow that sets it apart . </bow.v.2141><bow.v.2142>Spiccato - Technique that uses a semi-off-the-string bowing style to produce a light " bouncing " sound. Despite major misconceptions , violinists play this technique with a horizontal stroke; the " bouncing " motion is only due to the natural resistance of the violin string and light weight of the blow. Spiccato becomes easier in faster tempos , due to the smaller magnitude of the " bounce " . Spiccato is usually performed at the balance portion of the bow. The balance portion of the bow refers to the area of the bow where weight is distributed evenly on both sides , allowing for maximum control. Spiccato articulation is indicated by a small dot placed directly under the note . </bow.v.2142><bow.v.2143>I agree with Scott Johnson , Steve Gilbert , Andrew Malcom , and many others that the President of the United States should not be bowing before any head of state. But unlike these astute observers , I actually know a little something about the art of the bow in Japan , having lived in Japan four different times on a resident visa , taught East Asian Studies at Harvard , and counseled many hundreds of American , European , Middle Eastern , and Australian executives on how to work and negotiate with the Japanese including teaching them the right way to bow . </bow.v.2143><bow.v.2144>Rush is such a hypocrite. Republicans bow to Rush all of the time. The only difference is that they are usually grabbing their ankles . </bow.v.2144><bow.v.2145>Item One : This week , the president made the traditional bow of respect to the Emperor of Japan. That was not unusual. Among other American presidents , Eisenhower and Nixon had done so. Still , Obama 's bow caused former Vice- President Dick Cheney to growl , " There is no reason for an American president to bow to anyone. Our friends and allies don ' t expect it and our enemies see it as a sign of weakness. " </bow.v.2145><bow.v.2146>One reason that I wrote Hunting the Osage Bow : A Chronicle of Craft , was to offer a classic short flatbow with a radiused belly as a hunting weapon. I hoped to provide a self bow alternative to a popular style of flatbow currently championed for a design calculated to fend off string follow and thereby store more energy. Of a wide , rectangular cross section and flat across the belly , these self bows directly descended from bows made according to the theories of Dr. Hickman , et. al. , bows designed for target archery to provide optimal efficiency . </bow.v.2146><bow.v.2147>You know why the Japanese have this big cultural thing about bowing ? It 's because when a samurai bowed , with their hands flat against their sides , they could n't draw their sword and kill the other samurai who was also bowing the same way. That 's also why they bow simultaneously. It has nothing to do with the Western tradition of bowing , which was done in front of a superior . </bow.v.2147><bow.v.2148>Insufficient machine preventive maintenance with respect to bearing wear , vibrations , etc. may contribute greatly to bow failure . </bow.v.2148><bow.v.2149>but there is a difference to bow in respect you don ' t take your eyes off the person to whom you are bowing.

There are even other common ways to play the example phrases.

Besides , the violin is one of the most difficult instruments to master. It requires time to learn the intricate fingering and bowing techniques. Incessant practice is necessary to play " in tune " the rapid scales and learn how to command the bow , essential for traditional dance music. On the other hand , the fiddle possesses a beauty and emotional appeal that comes closest to the tone of the human voice. At the same time is capable of agility and brilliant figuration. Its capacity for sustained tone is remarkable , and no other instrument can produce so many nuances of expression and intensity. To learn how it works , we will take a look at first at the structure of the violin , which , as already said above , is called a fiddle when played as a folk instrument , so that some focus will also be laid on the specifics when used as a fiddle. Then we will learn something about playing techniques . </bow.v.2154><bow.v.2155>The proper order of motion would be , starting at the tip , deltoid muscle used to raise the elbow while dragging the wrist , fingers and bow , as you go up bow.

So , we have progressed in this little discussion . </bow.v.2156><bow.v.2157>The bow should stem from an attention stance.

Bear in mind that the figures were taken from finished bows , but that is no guarantee that if you follow them your bow will weigh the same. If you wish a 45 pound bow follow the measurements for the next higher weight given , and then you may scrape your bow down a bit if it results in too strong a bow. You can always take off wood , but you ca n't put it back on . </bow.v.2159><bow.v.2160>LONDON News outlets are in an uproar today that President Obama bowed to Saudi King Abdullah.

" Because they are almost always heard while being bowed , the bow is considered an integral part of their tone production , contributing its own individual character and timbre. The use of different bows on the same instrument will produce correspondingly different tonality as a result. Most instrumentalists believe the bow 's quality to be as important as the instrument 's , and fine bows are therefore manufactured and selected with the utmost care . </bow.v.2162><bow.v.2163>Usage : Around the world , people bow a. to greet , b. to defer , c. to show courtesy , and d. to pray. In some cultures the bow is a formal gesture , as in Japan , e.g. , where people are judged by their bows. A casual hello to Japanese colleagues is a quick bend to a 15-degree angle; a respectful greeting to customers or superiors is a 30-degree bow; a formal apology involves a quick bend to a 45-degree angle , held to a count of three , with a slow return to upright posture . </bow.v.2163><bow.v.2164>As early as in ancient Egypt , bowing was a symbol of respect and an important religious gesture.

Paying respect with what I honor to the lowest part of the other shows the highest reverence. In China according to the norms of respect , the farther away one bows , the more respect it shows. In India , to show the highest expression of respect one approaches close to the body of the venerated person and touches his or her feet with one 's hands.

God gave them this icon of himself and the Incarnation. Worship was for God alone , but the physical gesture of humility toward that which represented and contained His presence was commanded for a reason . </bow.v.2168><bow.v.2169>Glasser , the company that patented the world 's first fiberglass bow , offers standard fiberglass bows that feature a half-lined bow frog with metal under-slide and an imitation three-part button.

Since we do n't know what they mean by it , Protestants tend to assume that it is also a form of worship as well. However , unlike bowing , we really do n't have a set idea that kissing is only done in worship to God. So , there is more room to define it in the right context , as showing brotherly affection and respect to another. Since that concept is still in our culture , though not used quite as frequently , it can be more readily understood . </bow.v.2170><bow.v.2171>arquearse; Sin nimos : arch , become convex , bend back , curve , curve in , warp; Bend one 's knee or body , or lower one 's head.; Bend one 's back forward from the waist on down.

In fact , when placing the bow on the string very near to the frog , the string can almost hold up the entire weight of the arm. So the main question at this point is what is the most efficient way to transfer weight into the string while bowing at the lower half ? I believe the answer is found in three concepts; </bow.v.2172><bow.v.2173>Your partner is the mirror and polisher of yourself. Ignoring your partner 's personality and self-respect is contrary to the spirit of Aikido. Your partner is not somebody you compete against , but a person to train with and learn from. Show your respect and consideration in every aspect of the practice. Bragging , showing off your power , looking down on a slow learning partner , are among the cheapest things you can do while practicing Aikido. Again , do not forget that your partner is a mirror of yourself , and helping your partner is helping yourself. At the beginning and end of each movement practice , practitioners bow to each other in za rei . </bow.v.2173><bow.v.2174>A bow ( rhymes with " now " ) is a lowering of the upper body whilst holding the lower body in its original position.

So called " nickel silver " actually has no silver content , and is used only on inexpensive bows. Sterling silver , or other silver alloys are the standard , and are used on bows ranging from higher grade student bows to very fine bows. The use of gold on frogs is , for the most part , cosmetic. Bow makers save their best sticks , and strive to do their best work on gold mounted bows. The shell used for the slide and eyes in the frog and button wo n't have an affect on the playing qualities of a bow , but some types wear better than others. The salt and acids in perspiration can deteriorate shell. White mother-of-pearl from oysters wears very little over time compared to more colorful abalone.

But I think this country was founded on the notion that one man or woman has not the legitimacy to reign over another.

They don ' t bow and scrape and grovel at each other ' s feet the way Obama is doing. The thing is , he KNOWS that his behavior caused an outcry the last time he did this. Yet he does it again ? Clearly , Obama doesn ' t care about protocol or respecting the customs of America. Once again , presidents do not bow to foreign leaders. He didn ' t bow to the queen of England when he visited England earlier this year and he didn ' t salute the flag on Veteran ' s Day . </bow.v.2186><bow.v.2187>" Fiddle " is a generic term for any chordophone played with a bow. In the Hornbostel-Sachs-system the violin/fiddle is classified as a bowed lute.

The U.S. president does seem to have overdone it a little bit by , in the words of one Japan scholar , trying to impress with Karate Kid-level knowledge of Japanese customs.

Interestingly President Obama did n't show the same respect to the Queen when he met her and did n't bow to her. People are asking the question , why did Mr.Obama bow to the Saudi monarch when he did n't bow to the Queen. What is so special with the Saudi King that Obama felt the need to bow to him , his peer and not his superior ? </bow.v.2191><bow.v.2192>If the bow were just a simple expression of respect , then why did n't the king bow back ? Bows go one way to express fealty. We stopped bowing in the US while they continued to in europe because its a disgusting expression of obeisance. No man should be required to act to another like that. Obama can prostrate himself to anyone he likes on his own time , but he 's the president now . </bow.v.2192><bow.v.2193>Bowhunting Magazine and Archery Tips edersbow.com is a free online bowhunting magazine filled with Archery Tips bowhunting tips and links to bow hunting equipment and archery and bowhunting product reviews . </bow.v.2193><bow.v.2194>The first actual bow fragments are the Stellmoor bows from northern Germany.

A prime example of this discipline is the etiquette we observe with our instructor and fellow students , and in the dojo or practice area. Unfortunately , the etiquette we observe is often confused with worship. Aikido is not a religious practice. When we bow or observe special ceremonies , we do so for the purpose of training our minds , not worship or submission . </bow.v.2201><bow.v.2202>As you recall , Obama did the same thing to the king of Saudi Arabia back in April at the G-20 summit. He was the only head of state to bow to another head of state at the conference. Moreover , he only did so to the king of Saudi Arabia. The night before , when he met Queen Elizabeth , he performed no such bow even though England has been our strongest ally for more than a century. Michele Obama even violated protocol by putting her arm around the Queen . </bow.v.2202><bow.v.2203>The Saudi king is an absolute monarch. Saudi Arabia has no constitution but the Shariah. Saudis are not citizens. They are subjects. The king 's subjects bow to him in his presence in much the same way that President Obama did. Arabs are particularly sensitive to social symbolism. When the Saudi ambassador , Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz was photographed sitting on the arm of a chair looking down on George W. Bush , the whisper went around the Arab World that Bush , in allowing this to happen , was acknowledging his true relationship to the Saudis . </bow.v.2203><bow.v.2204>Everything you ever wanted to know about the Bowtech Tribute compound bow can be found right here !

" </bow.v.2207><bow.v.2208>Another physical form of greeting is the bow. While most Americans associate taking a bow with receiving applause , to bow as part of a greeting is an act of humbling oneself before another , of showing respect. Bowing is just a gracious way to say hello , to acknowledge a person. There are three etiquette guidelines for bowing : </bow.v.2208><bow.v.2209>Every degree of respect may be indicated by the courtesy and bow in their several forms , from the supercilious nod , which says , " How are you , Billy , " with an upper inflection of voice and sneering expression , to the movement which plainly means , " I present myself before you with profound respect.

Form your bow grip nicely as your teacher says , start at the frog on E or A , draw a slow smooth stroke keeping the bow perpendicular to the string and roughly midway between bridge and end of fingerboard. Do n't move your vln. to the left to " help. " When your arm , wrist and fingers are all fully extended , see where your bowtip is. That is where you would stop for a " full " bow stroke. You do n't want to pull back at the shoulder or elbow to reach that last little bit of hair before the tip , as that throws the bow out of alignment. Sue </bow.v.2213><bow.v.2214>This is also why I believe the dojo is no place to learn self defense. How , in this environment of arrogance and acquiescence , are women meant to learn to stand up for themselves ? How through their submission to their master do they learn to not bow to others. Is the notion here that if you elevate me I will elevate you ? This is no place to learn self defense or self respect. Keep your back straight and your head up.
