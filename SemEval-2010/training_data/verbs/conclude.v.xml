" While Harris certainly complained to his fellow employee about terms and conditions of employment -- in particular , the newly-issued memo concerning phone switch-over procedures and Harris ' perception of Employer racism -- Harris did no more than just complain to his fellow employee about them. There is no indication in his e-mail or in the surrounding circumstances that he intended that any action be taken by any employee or himself regarding his complaints. Indeed , his comments seem to expressly reject taking any action. [ 6 ] Rather , his e-mail seems only intended to be a quintessentially personal expression of displeasure and merely a way to blow off steam to a fellow employee , i.e. , " mere griping. " Therefore , we conclude that Harris ' e-mail did not constitute protected concerted activity , and that the Employer ' s discharge of Harris was not unlawful . </conclude.v.2><conclude.v.3>Even though Damasio does n't go this far , one might conclude that reason and emotion are really both parts of the same phenomena ( deliberate human decision making ) looked at on different scales. In any case , it is pretty clear that emotions have a straight-forward physiological explanation while reason does not. This could mean that emotions are " real " in a sense that reason isn't. It could also just hightlight that these two concepts do n't make any sort of useful contrast. One captures a set of states that we all pass through and the other a standard of excellence to which we might aspire , and there 's at least some evidence that those states make that standard achievable . </conclude.v.3><conclude.v.4>The presentations will begin at 8 am on June 24th and end at 5 pm on June 26th , followed by a buffet meal at 7 pm to conclude the meeting.

This suggests that stocks are expected to grow earnings by at least 30 over the next year. Investors can not rationally be investing in stocks for the dividend yield , so I conclude the reason relates to capital gains. My calculation is that PE ratios are likely to rise before they fall. This will be the result of earnings disappointments and complacency. Where will prices be when PE ratios are back to the historical norm ? </conclude.v.6><conclude.v.7>FOOD ALLERGY Survey of Physicians ' Approach to Food Allergy : Part II. Allergens , Diagnosis , Treatment and Prevention. ( Abstract 11 : Nov. 12 at 1 : 30 p.m. ) Sami Bahna , M.D. , Shreveport , La. , et al A 2-page questionnaire was mailed to 3 , 000 ACAAI members and 4 , 000 non-allergists comprised of 1000 each of internists , family practitioners , pediatricians and otolaryngologists to determine differences in their approach to food allergy. Authors conclude that there are marked variations between allergists and non-allergists in the reported causes , methods of diagnosis , treatment and prevention of food allergy. More non-allergists than allergists utilize unproved methods of diagnosis and treatment. This study was supported by the ACAAI and submitted on behalf of the Adverse Reactions to Food Committee . </conclude.v.7><conclude.v.8>They conclude that it 's better to stick with what they 've got even though they may be unhappy at least for the time being.

I do not think that it will be a mortal blow to the government because ultimately Futenma is a low-stakes issue domestically. It does reinforce the image that the DPJ is inexperienced on foreign policy , but then the Japanese public already believed that last summer before the general election and still voted the DPJ into power. More significantly , it calls into question Hatoyama ' s ability to lead his cabinet . </conclude.v.11><conclude.v.12>One of the interesting phenomena in this literature is the " grumpy liberals. " Quite frequently , authors who clearly do n't like incarceration have to admit that it does reduce crime. A 1994 Rand Corporation study , for example , deals with a " three strikes and you 're out " law in California. [ xxv ] The authors conclude that each five million dollars spent on prisons will prevent one murder , 20 rapes , 55 robberies , 120 aggravated assaults , 110 burglaries of a serious nature , and five arsons. [ xxvi ] Note that while this certainly seems cost effective , sending felons away for life on the third conviction is probably not the optimal policy. Criminals tend to " age out " of crime , and so a long ( but not lifetime ) sentence would give most of the benefits of a life sentence , but at less cost . </conclude.v.12><conclude.v.13>Reason alone , for Wesley , is further incapable of inculcating within those who exercise it the love of God , for such love is dependent upon both faith and hope which reason can not produce. Wesley draws upon his own experiences for support : I collected the finest hymns , prayers , and mediations , which I could find in any language; and I said , sung , or read them over and over , with all possible seriousness and attention. But still I was like the bones in Ezekiel ' s vision : ' the skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them ' ( qtd. in Wesley 129-30 ) . He therefore asks , what can cold reason do in this matter [ of God ' s love for sinners ] ? It may present us with fair ideas; it can draw a fine picture of love; but this is only a painted fire. And farther than this , reason can not go ( 131 ) . Since reason can not produce the love of God , it can not empower people to love their neighbors , which , as such love forms the foundation of virtue for Wesley , prevents reason by extension from producing virtue. Wesley concludes this discussion by stating that reason can not produce happiness , for happiness is dependent upon faith , hope , love , and virtue ( 132 ) . </conclude.v.13><conclude.v.14>Welcome to the User Agreement of FirstDialog.

The Principal clearly relies on Carr 's recommendations and evaluations of the Dorm Managers ' performance when requesting that the School Board renew the Dorm Managers ' contracts. While Carr 's evaluations and recommendations are not the only factor relied on in the decision to renew the contracts , they are clearly one of the most significant factors. It is not necessary , however , that Carr 's evaluations and recommendations constitute management 's final decision to renew the contracts; only that management rely on them in making the contract renewal decision without seeking independent information. See , for example , Wedgewood Health Care , 267 NLRB at 526. We conclude , therefore , based on the record in this case , that Carr , through his evaluations of the Dorm Managers ' performance , effectively recommends their continued employment by the School Board . </conclude.v.17><conclude.v.18>To conclude Jones say ' s This book is for anyone looking around for another point of view in this consumer-led society. </conclude.v.18><conclude.v.19>Second , science for all its great accomplishments is still in the infant stage , there is much about nature it simply does not know , even on this planet.

In the area of rehiring or retaining employees , the ARD found that although Carr makes a recommendation to the School Principal on an annual basis as to whether to renew Dorm Managers ' contracts , he has never recommended that a contract of a Dorm Manager not be renewed.

Physicists have suggested that the laws and constants of physics are too good as if the universe were set up to favour our eventual evolution. It is as though there were , say , half a dozen dials representing the major constants of physics. Each of the dials could in principle be tuned to any of a wide range of values. Almost all of these knob-twiddlings would yield a universe in which life would be impossible. Some universes would fizzle out within the first picosecond. Others would contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. In yet others , the matter would never condense into stars ( and you need stars in order to forge the elements of chemistry and hence life ) . You can estimate the very low odds against the six knobs all just happening to be correctly tuned , and conclude that a divine knob-twiddler must have been at work. But , as we have already seen , that explanation is vacuous because it begs the biggest question of all. The divine knob twiddler would himself have to have been at least as improbable as the settings of his knobs . </conclude.v.27><conclude.v.28>As the quote from Pigou suggests , the rationale behind the classical view is that wages and prices are sufficiently flexible that markets will " clear , " or return to equilibrium very quickly.

As border tensions eased at the beginning of the 1990s , the scale of illegal immigration increasedrising threefold between 1992 and 1993. This prompted Russia to conclude an agreement with Bei jing in 1994 to establish formal border-crossing posts and tighten visa restrictions.

Does this historical conclusion truly represent all of our options ? To answer this question we must first recognize what assumption is necessary for such a drastic conclusion , viz. , that the only way I can use a statement to talk about objects is if the statement is about objects. What this assumption does , however , is conflate the linguistic claim that meaningful statements talk about objects , with the ontological claim that meaningful statements are about objects.

The other principal issues raised -- relating to the Access Agreement; shippers at Geismar , LA; the Detroit River Tunnel; North Dakota grain movements; the concerns of DOT; the concerns of The Fertilizer Institute ( TFI ); and the need for Board oversight -- are treated in detail below. After carefully examining the record , including the oral argument , we have concluded that the transaction , as conditioned , will result in no competitive harm. It will not diminish competition among rail carriers either in the affected region or in the national rail system. Indeed , the transaction should enhance competition , especially for north-south traffic . </conclude.v.62><conclude.v.63>This paper reviews how U.S.-Russian relations went off course.

Background : Previous research has found that motion sickness decreases performance , but it is not known how short-term memory in particular is affected. Method : Thirty-eight healthy participants performed a listening span test while seated in a rotating optokinetic drum. Measurements of motion sickness , performance , heart rate , skin conductance , blood volume pulse , and pupil size were performed simultaneously throughout the experiment. Results : A total of 16 participants terminated the trial because of severe nausea , and the other 22 endured the full 25 min. Perceived motion sickness increased over time in both groups but less among those who endured the trial. Short-term memory performance decreased toward the end for those who terminated but increased in the other group. Results from the measured autonomic responses were ambiguous. Conclusion : We conclude that performance , measured as short-term memory , declines as perceived motion sickness progresses. Application : This research has potential implications for command and control personnel at risk of developing motion sickness . </conclude.v.64><conclude.v.65>Thanks Simon.

Faith , a divine evidence , bringing a full conviction , of an invisible world can only be acquired by the grace of God. In support of this conclusion , he explains how he once reviewed the strongest arguments for the existence of God , but concluded after intense study that neither they , nor his own logical analyses , could give him substantial knowledge of God and the invisible world ( 129-30 ) . Continuing , he claims that reason alone can not produce hope in any child of man [ that ] scriptural hope whereby we ' rejoice in hope of the glory of God : ' that hope which St. Paul in one place terms , ' tasting the powers of the world to come ' ( qtd. in Wesley 130 ) . This hope for Wesley can spring only from a deep abiding faith; thus , as reason can not produce faith , it can not produce this hope ( 130 ) . He also confirms this conclusion in his sermon with reference to his own experience : How often have I laboured , and that with my might , to beget this hope in myself ! ... I could no more acquire this hope of heaven , than I could touch heaven with my hand ( 130 ) . </conclude.v.69><conclude.v.70>The most fundamental concern is that after concluding an ECFA , whether or not Taipei will be subject to Beijing 's control.

Even using the most conservative approach in defining what people can afford based on their monthly income and essential expenses , almost half of all people in the 100-300 range and about 30 of the 300-500 cohort can not afford the amount expected of them to purchase of health insurance. With this level of financial challenge for such a large portion of the population , the plans can not yet be deemed affordable for people at between 100-500 FPL.

Proceeding from the postulation that the individualizing of the human species has reached the point where the inhabitants of a neighbourhood are no longer able to relate to each other as a community , we might conclude that there is no reason for the neighbourhood itself to continue exhibiting a visual unity either. This individualizing process means that mutual understanding has vanished along with reciprocal communication , thereby sowing the seeds of anxiety and insecurity and generating an ecology of fear. The central issue of my proposal is consequently how to return the mutual commitment of inhabitants to their immediate residential setting and to public space.

The Court of Appeals concluded that the arbitrator had exceeded his scope of authority by requiring the defendant to pay the full amount of damages and modified the judgment. After reviewing the record and applicable authority , we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority and that the defendant was not entitled to a credit based on the amount of damages received by the plaintiff in a settlement.

Sectoral initiatives have been proposed in 14 areas , including auto parts , bicycles , chemicals , electronics , fish and forestry products , gems , and toys. World Trade Organization ( WTO ) talks collapsed in July 2008 over a so-called special safeguards mechanism ( SSM ) that sought to provide a safety net to developing countries to raise tariffs in excess of current ceilings if imports of some agricultural products increased beyond a certain limit.

We conclude that the proposed " Shia family law " which would have legalised rape within marriage and legitimised the subjugation of Shia women in Afghanistan , represented an affront to decent human values. We further conclude that it is a matter for alarm that these proposals were considered to be acceptable by President Karzai , by a majority in the Afghan parliament , and by significant elements of Afghan public opinion. This episode highlights the challenges that Afghan women continue to face in realising their basic human rights nearly eight years after the fall of the Taliban government. We conclude that this proposed law has had a detrimental affect on international perceptions of Afghanistan. We welcome the British Government 's announcement that it considers those aspects of the law which undermine human rights to be wholly unacceptable. We recommend that the Government keeps us fully informed if the Shia Family Law takes legal effect and , if it does , provides us with an analysis as to whether it has been brought in line with the Afghan Constitution , which guarantees equal rights for women , and with the international treaties to which Afghanistan is a party.

Inspection of Table 2 reveals that the Stroop performance measures are characterized by high MZ correlations , which implies high reliabilities.

Actual agricultural production is at significantly lower levels than its maximum capacity , for farmland under agricultural production is estimated at 14 percent of its potential. Therefore , to describe the economic and social significance of a shift in emphasis of public policies toward the development of a greater participation of agriculture , additional analysis must be made.

Next it discusses incompatibilities and incongruities in the relationship that would seem to override commonalities of viewpoints.

We conclude that in accepting the role of Afghanistan 's 'lead ' international partner in respect of counter-narcotics , the UK has taken on a poisoned chalice. There is little evidence to suggest that recent reductions in poppy cultivation are the result of the policies adopted by the UK , other international partners or the Afghan government. While the British Government is to be commended for its broad-ranging , holistic approach to tackling narcotics in Afghanistan , it is clear that success depends on a range of factors which lie far beyond the control and resource of the UK alone. The scale of the problem , the drugs trade 's importance to Afghanistan 's economy and its connection to corruption makes any early achievement of the aspirations set out in the Bonn Agreement highly unlikely. We further conclude that the lead international role on counter-narcotics should be transferred away from the UK , and that the Afghan Government should instead be partnered at an international level by the United Nations and ISAF which are better equipped to co-ordinate international efforts.

However , we also conclude that the contact between North and South Koreans , and exposure of North Koreans to South Korean business practices , which take place at the KIC are to be welcomed; and that the KIC offers much better pay and working conditions than are available elsewhere in North Korea. We recommend that the Government should seek to use the leverage which is afforded by South Korea 's wish to see the KIC included in the South Korea-EU Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) to encourage improvements in the position of workers at the KIC , within a context of what is realistically achievable , and without jeopardising either the FTA or the continued operation and expansion of the Complex.

( Frege , [ 1978 ] , p.x. ) Given these proscriptions , arithmetic could proceed , as philosophy , through the analysis of the content and structure of its concepts , modulo the additional demand that , when writ in the language of the Begriffsschrift , such an analysis need only consider what can be said of the relation between concepts and objects. Regrettably , while Frege 's context principle solved Bolzano 's semantic problem at the level of concepts , what Russell 's paradox shows is that it does not solve the problem at the level of objects. Basic Law V has an existential content which is conceivably false , i.e. , which can not be justified from within Frege 's language , and therefore he could not conclude that arithmetic was analytic . </conclude.v.301><conclude.v.302>Precedential decisions and orders provide guidance for later decisions and orders.

The one partial exception has been National Review , especially in the area of drug policy , where pro-liberalization articles outnumbered those favoring current policy or calling for greater government intervention by a ratio of more than 2 to 1 from 1955 through 2007.

In addition , the day before the search warrant was executed , officers observed individuals exiting room 16 and making hand-to-hand exchanges with other individuals outside the Relax Motel.

We can not even begin to verify the claims from numbers 1 , 2 , 3 and 4. Numbers 5 and 6 are jumps , but assuming the previous 1-4 are correct , are not without merit. Only after continuing to point 6 , can we possibly conclude with 7 and 8. However , we can not validate factually this line of reasoning , so we must say , to maintain any degree of honesty , that if you make these claims you are doing so on faith. There is nothing I find faulty with having faith . </conclude.v.318><conclude.v.319>What must we conclude then ? If all who were born of Adam are born into death , death reigning over them , regardless of whether they themselves have committed any sin , the antithesis must likewise be true. All who are born in Christ are born into life and death has no authority over them. This is in spite of any works or sin which they themselves have done. As the innocent child is born guilty because of Adam 's sin , the newborn infant created in Christ is innocent and righteous because he is born of Christ. The works of his flesh do not add or take away anything from this new nature . </conclude.v.319><conclude.v.320>Second , the administrators made the remarkable and awkward statement , as part of the disclaimer , that " there will be no other discussion of the issue and your teachers will not answer questions on the issue.

Dr. Alters explained that a reasonable student observer would conclude that ID is a kind of " secret science that students apparently ca n't discuss with their science teacher " which he indicated is pedagogically " about as bad as I could possibly think of. " ( 14 : 125-27 ( Alters ) ) .

The demand that the coin have a figure upon it was concluded by the Amora Abaye from the language of the mishnah , in which it was written " a sela on the tzinit " and not " ceramic " or " metal , " showing that the coin must be of metal and bearing a figure.

If two supervisors evaluated an employee 's performance , one might conclude that performance warrants a " 4 , " while the other concludes it is only a " 3. " The fact that they disagree is evidence that the rating scale is not valid. The disagreement also confirms that rewards linked to ratings -- based on a five-level rating scale -- can be inequitable.

The originators , leaders and intellectual spokesmen of all such movements are necessarily evaders on a major scale; they are not merely mistaken , but are crusading irrationalists. The mass base of such movements are not evaders of the same kind; but most of the followers are dishonest in their own passive way. They are unthinking , intellectually irresponsible ballast , unconcerned with logic or truth. " From the above , one would conclude that an inherently dishonest idea is an idea that can not be held as a result of honest error. In other words , an academic Marxist must be holding his Marxism as a result of evasion.

There were incidents in autumn 2003. On 25 December 2003 , the Russian and Ukrainian heads of state signed an agreement under which the Azov Sea would be considered as an internal sea common to both countries. The practical modalities for delimiting the borders remain to be defined , however.

If this can be followed up with a brief written memo and distributed to those in the meeting as well as to others who may be interested , decisions and deadlines are less likely to be missed.

More than 33 , 000 adult salmon , including federally protected coho , died before they could spawn because of federal water diversions to upstream farmers. The lack of water in the river caused river temperatures to rise and dissolved oxygen levels to drop , creating lethal conditions for salmon. The returning fish crowded together in a few spots where cooler tributaries brought colder water into the river. Infectious bacteria and parasites swept through the schooled up fish like wildfire , killing nearly all and seriously weakening the rest. The California report states , " DFG [ Department of Fish and Game ] concludes that low flows and other flow related factors ( e.g. fish passage and fish density ) caused the 2002 fish kill on the lower Klamath River. Furthermore , of the conditions that can cause or exacerbate a fish kill , flow is the only factor that can be controlled to any degree.

To explain , he begins by apprehending the idea of faith as one essential to Christianity and therefore identifies it as the most appropriate concept from which to begin an analysis of reason ' s efficacy. From there , he judges the relationship between reason and faith , relying on the empirical evidence of historical example , personal experience , and relevant verses from Scripture. In the end , he judges that reason can not produce faith and proceeds then to judge the causal relations between reason and the other theological virtues , relying on the same empirical sources throughout this process. During this time he continues from one relationship to the next in a sort of discourse that allows him in the end to conclude that reason ' s inability to produce faith renders it incapable , in turn , of producing hope , love , virtue , and happiness. The very structure of Wesley ' s sermon illustrates the necessity of reason in learning and explicating Scripturally-derived theological truths , just as he uses these truths to illumine the limitations of the reason he employs . </conclude.v.352><conclude.v.353>If Taipei can some day become part of " ASEA+4 , " it might be able to use its membership to protect its political interests.

Their rapprochement in the late 1980s had enabled the former deadly rivals to demarcate most of their common border -- an enormous achievement not only for them but also for regional and even global security. But both recognized that the border conflict could be revived if the overall relationship were to deteriorate. Moreover , each could cause the other enormous misery if it were to encourage or support separatist movements among volatile minority populations. Left unbound , each would be free to enter into coalitions that might threaten the other , such as a Russian alliance with India , a Chinese alliance with Pakistan or Iran , or a combination of either one with the United States. Given their history , their proximity , and the range of potential issues between them , perhaps Russia and China concluded that forming a partnership removed the deadliest possible threat . </conclude.v.358><conclude.v.359>Fuller maintains that Reformed theology has always had difficulty with its antithesis between law and gospel. He approvingly cites John Murray in his similar objection to this dualistic interpretation of the Mosaic Covenant. Both Fuller and Murray argue that the Mosaic Covenant is no less gracious than the Abrahamic. If Paul was not using nomos in the revelatory sense in Galatians 3 : 12 , then some substantial changes would have to be made in the theology which stresses sola scriptura along with sola fide ( Paul and ' The Works of the Law ' , p. 42 ) . Charles H.

All of this is designed to give us the interface and the interaction to give a new direction to our officials to conclude the differences , to the point at which the decisions have to come back again to Ministers , and the availability of us as Ministers to be constantly available , participating and supporting and being reported back to . </conclude.v.380><conclude.v.381>Numerous epidemiological ( population ) studies and comprehensive reviews have evaluated magnetic field exposure and risk of cancer in children ( 1 , 2 ) . Since the two most common cancers in children are leukemia and brain tumors , most of the research has focused on these two types. A study in 1979 pointed to a possible association between living near electric power lines and childhood leukemia ( 3 ) . Among more recent studies , findings have been mixed. Some have found an association; others have not. These studies are discussed in the following paragraphs. Currently , researchers conclude that there is limited evidence that magnetic fields from power lines cause childhood leukemia , and that there is inadequate evidence that these magnetic fields cause other cancers in children ( 2 ) . Researchers have not found a consistent relationship between magnetic fields from power lines or appliances and childhood brain tumors . </conclude.v.381><conclude.v.382>Geologists Dr. George Chilingar , and L.F. Khilyuk of the University of Southern California authored a December 2006 study in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Geology which found warming temperatures were due to natural factors , not mankind. " Recalculating this amount into the total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission in grams of CO2 , one obtains the estimate 1.003  1018 g , which constitutes less than 0.00022 of the total CO2 amount naturally degassed from the mantle during geologic history. Comparing these figures , one can conclude that anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission is negligible ( indistinguishable ) in any energy matter transformation processes changing the Earth 's climate , " Chilingar and Khilyuk added . </conclude.v.382><conclude.v.383>Your Office has asked us to advise whether the Department of Justice ( " Department " ) , in entering into so-called Intergovernmental Agreements , or IGAs , under which state or local governments provide for the detention of federal detainees , may agree to a fixed price for detention services. For the reasons set forth below , we conclude that the Department may do so . </conclude.v.383><conclude.v.384>Consider a hypothetical case of two consultants designing research on the performance effects of a strong corporate culture. One selects 10 beverage firms for in-depth case analysis because the consultant worked in the industry and has good personal contacts there. The other consultant selects 10 apparel firms. According to Burt , there is no need to do the research. The first consultant has selected a market where competition is low. A strong corporate culture offers no competitive advantage. The consultant will find no evidence of higher performance in strong-culture firms and thus conclude that there is no culture effect. His advice to client firms will be to avoid wasting resources on institutionalizing a strong corporate culture . </conclude.v.384><conclude.v.385>Because Dennett refers in one place to non-religious values of importance to atheists like democracy , life , love , justice , etc. , Wieseltier feels it reasonable to conclude that If you refuse his ' impeccably hardheaded and rational ontology , ' then your sacred values must be tyranny , injustice , death , hatred and falsehood.

You ca n't help but think of little James Bulgers darkest hour as he was battered to death by two evil 10 year old boys. Although Mark Thomas in extracts from physcologist reports trys to find a reason behind this tragady you ca n't help but conclude no reason on earth could comprehend what happened that tragic day. Robert Thompson and Jon Venebels may now have been releases and James 's mum Denise Bulger ( fergus ) remarried. But little James will never be forgotten . </conclude.v.388><conclude.v.389>Section 9.2. of the Medium-Term Strategy for Developing Relations of the Russian Federation with the European Union for 2000-2010 , which was presented by the Russian government at a Russia-EU summit in Helsinki in October 1999 , said that Russia would pursue a line toward a new agreement with the EU. This implied a mutual obligation to jointly work out and conclude a new framework agreement on strategic partnership and cooperation in the 21st century , which would replace the PCA. Of course , politics is the art of the possible , therefore it is important to find out how realistic this goal is in the light of present Russia-EU relations , putting special emphasis on the economic aspect of this issue. And which is more realistic a Strategic Partnership Treaty or Partnership and Cooperation Agreement-2 ? </conclude.v.389><conclude.v.390>The bilateral meetings are part of an effort by both countries to include Costa Rica in CAFTA.

We conclude that the growing outflow of North Koreans from North Korea is creating an emigrant population in several parts of Asia whose human rights are systematically vulnerable.

If Congress somehow intended such meaning ( and we see no reason to think that it did ) , it was obligated to say so. ( 2 ) We instead conclude that the phrase " on any reasonable basis " has its ordinary meaning and that section 119 therefore authorizes the Attorney General to enter into fixed-price detention IGAs . </conclude.v.397><conclude.v.398>Speakers at the meeting include : South Central District Engineer Tom Stehn; Transportation Project Designer Pete Berry; Operations Engineer Ed Hess; Area Engineer Randy Mayo and Community Relations Manager Ann Marie Newberry.

Two principal paths of inquiry have been followed in this literature : ( 1 ) the capitalization of the value of local public goods and services , as well as taxes , as in Oates ( 1969 ); and ( 2 ) the migration impact of local public goods and services , as well as taxes , as in Cebula ( 1978 ) and more recently Cebula and Alexander ( 2006 ); Sieg , Smith , Banzhaf , and Walsh ( 2004 ); and Banzhaf and Walsh ( 2008 ) , among others. The most recent ( and arguably the most sophisticated ) of these studies , that by Banzhaf and Walsh ( 2008 , p. 862 ) , concluded : " Our results are consistent witha simple Tiebout model and affirmthat households do vote with their feet ' in response to local public goods.

Unless otherwise noted , the following activities are completed from within a meeting room . </conclude.v.404><conclude.v.405>12. We conclude that the Government is correct to regard the North Korean case as having wider implications for nuclear proliferation and for international non-proliferation efforts. We conclude that it is important from this perspective that North Korea should be returned credibly to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) regime as a non-nuclear weapons state. We further conclude that the North Korean case highlights important weaknesses in the current NPT regime , and we recommend that policymakers should draw systematically on the North Korean case , alongside others , in considering the future of that regime. We further recommend that North Korea 's ongoing demand for civil nuclear power should be considered in the context of both the international effort to end the country 's nuclear weapons programme , and current international discussions about mechanisms for the future safe provision of such power to further states.

After several exchanges of information via e mail , Nancy set up a web site especially for us. It considered all of the properties within the parameters of our price range and within the ZIP codes we had specified. On a daily basis for well over a month we were able to get a clear picture of what was available for our money. When I made a one week trip to California , I was able within two days to focus on the property that fitted our criteria , and within three more days to conclude all of the arrangements. Thanks to the Moellers , I left after a week with all of these issues resolved . </conclude.v.406><conclude.v.407>Among the big losers in the cuts were those involved in the International Linear Collider , which was suspended in December. The panel added that the need for the ILC is not yet proven and so construction should not be guaranteed.

Nevertheless , the panel concluded that the ILC will win back funding in all but the worst-case scenario . </conclude.v.407><conclude.v.408>We reaffirm our commitment to the achievement of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We will build on the recent successes in the Peace Process , including the bold steps taken by Jordan and Israel , through concerted efforts to support agreements already concluded and to expand the circle of peace. Noting the important milestone reached with the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement , we will play an active role at the Conference for Economic Assistance to the Palestinians , will support the Palestinian elections and will work ambitiously to improve the access we both give to products from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. We will encourage and support the regional parties in implementing the conclusions of the Amman Summit. We will also continue our efforts to promote peace between Israel , Lebanon and Syria. We will actively seek the dismantling of the Arab boycott of Israel . </conclude.v.408><conclude.v.409>Moyer appealed the revocation to the district court , which reversed the revocation and ordered the DMV to reinstate Moyer ' s license. The district court reasoned that the sworn report was never sworn because the notary public did not put the arresting officer under oath. As such , the district court concluded that the sworn report did not confer jurisdiction on the DMV to revoke Moyer ' s license. The DMV appealed and the Nebraska Supreme Court wrote the opinion . </conclude.v.409><conclude.v.410>Whatever the weapons inspections reveal , a solid majority of Americans ( 62 ) think the administration has already decided to go to war with Iraq; just a third say the administration is waiting for the inspections to conclude before determining a course of action. The idea that the administration has already made up its mind is especially prevalent among those who oppose military action in Iraq. Among this group , fully 86 believe the administration has already made up its mind to go to war , compared with 52 of supporters of military action . </conclude.v.410><conclude.v.411>THE FREE TRADE AGEEEMENT ( FTA ) which the United States wants to impose on Bolivia is nothing more than the continuation of the annexation project which is called the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) . Because Latin American people were opposed to the FTAA , the country from the north has attempted to divide us by trying to sign FTAs with each of the neo-liberal governments in power in Latin America. But the consciousness of the people is advancing and beginning to understand the perverse commercial plans which the United States has for our region. A detailed study of the FTA should lead us to conclude that it must not be permitted. Here are five reasons why : </conclude.v.411><conclude.v.412>3. We conclude that the conditions under which prisoners and detainees are treated once in the hands of the Afghan authorities are a matter of considerable concern.

In this type of narrative review , it is difficult to know exactly how the authors have selected the studies that they discuss , and whether they have assessed all of the relevant evidence. The authors ' previous systematic review concluded that it is not clear whether screening does more good than harm . </conclude.v.413><conclude.v.414>The motive to hold inventories purely in the hope of profiting from a price increase is called the speculative motive. This motive has received considerable attention in the literature. However , existing studies do not have a clear implication for how large it is quantitatively. This paper incorporates the speculative motive for holding inventories into an otherwise standard real business cycle model and finds that empirically plausible parameterizations of the model result in an average inventory stock to output ratio that is virtually zero. For this reason , we conclude that the quantitative magnitude of the speculative role for holding inventories in this model is quite small. This suggests the possibility that the study of aggregate economic phenomena can safely abstract from inventory speculation . </conclude.v.414><conclude.v.415>But the point is that developed countries like Australia and the US already enjoy relatively low tariffs in their bilateral trade relations. So what exactly will Australian companies gain from an agreement the United States ? More export opportunities for our manufactures ? With one or two exceptions , tariffs are already extremely low in manufactures between Australia and the United States; and unless the US repeals the legislation which excludes our fast ferries from plying its waterways , one must conclude that an FTA will not change much in this regard. This much is admitted by former US trade advisors like Paula Stern . </conclude.v.415><conclude.v.416>So we do have the opportunity not just to meet , but I think to develop a framework going forward , if we can reinforce the political will to conclude this round. My very firm belief is that the round can be concluded , and it must be concluded. It 's important to give stimulus as part of the solution to the Global Financial Crisis , it 's important to ensure that we conclude to stop any of the trends to protectionism from taking stronger hold . </conclude.v.416><conclude.v.417>A report released earlier Thursday concluded that Pentagon officials concealed from U.S. intelligence agencies potentially useful tips from Iranian agents in 2001 and 2002 , including one that Tehran allegedly sent hit teams to Afghanistan to kill Americans . </conclude.v.417><conclude.v.418>If China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations successfully conclude their proposed free-trade agreement , then Australian exports to the region will really begin to suffer , he warns.

Negotiations had been begun directly after their capture , but the Athenians in their hour of triumph would not consent to any reasonable terms; though after their defeat at Delium , Lacedaemon , knowing that they would be now more inclined to listen , at once concluded the armistice for a year , during which they were to confer together and see if a longer period could not be agreed upon . </conclude.v.420><conclude.v.421>By looking at the statistics of the Soundex and Soundex2 programs , we conclude that Soundex might not be the most suitable way to implement a search engine. Given that an overwhelming majority of place names have unique codes , searching with Soundex will not generate very many hits. It may at first that becuase the mean number of place names each code has is two , that Soundex or Soundex 2 may have been appropriate for a search tool however this figure is resultant from a mass of unique codes , only slightly off balanced by a few high valued outliers on teh other extreme , ie. one or two codes having over 40 place names each . </conclude.v.421><conclude.v.422>It should be emphasized that , after determining that Michael was n't retarded , the Kearneys have n't pushed Michael and Maeghan , but instead , have had to run to stay ahead of them. Both children are highly energetic , require relatively little sleep , and are " black holes " for knowledge. One of the Kearneys ' concerns is that it would be very easy to misdiagnose hyper-energetic children like Michael and Maeghan and conclude that they are suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . </conclude.v.422><conclude.v.423>The results were predictable. In the end , the grateful groups felt better about their lives and more optimistic about their prospects. The thankful college students exercised more , and the chronically ill adults who focused on blessings reported sleeping longer and waking up refreshed. The members of the grateful groups were also nicer to neighbors and more willing to help people with personal problems , leading the researchers to conclude that gratitude can serve as a moral motivator. </conclude.v.423><conclude.v.424>And I would add , and this is where I conclude that this treatment of concrete-abstract representation is common to all men : not only to the thinker ,  but the child at least so far as a Nobel Prize.

As conditioned , I expect the merger to result in no significant competitive , operational , or environmental problems. I expect any negative impact on rail employees to be ameliorated. I expect the transaction to improve significantly single-line service for many shippers , and result in substantial merger benefits that should allow the carriers to provide service at lower cost. A significant portion of these savings should be passed along to shippers in terms of reduced rates or improved service. I approve of the merger , as conditioned , including the necessary Board oversight. The parties must now work to ensure effective and positive integration of all the elements to truly realize all of the benefits , public and private . </conclude.v.426><conclude.v.427>Members of the Diocese of San Joaquin will meet with council members in the later part of the day and evening on January 30.

Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets Saturday to separate violent demonstrators from a protest of a meeting of top world trade officials , but the hooded " black bloc " activists were able to cause damage before 14 were arrested , spokesmen said. The protesters set fire to at least four cars , broke shop windows and committed other acts of violence Saturday. The clashes occurred during a march by demonstrators protesting a meeting of the World Trade Organization scheduled to start Monday , in which the United States , China and other commercial powers will spearhead a new attempt to find ways to revive world trade and drag the global economy out of recession. Much more serious clashes have occurred at previous meetings of trade chiefs , but the coming session lacks the specific goals of previous meetings , when the World Trade Organization tried to conclude a new trade deal. The last so-called ministerial was held in Hong Kong four years ago. Others were in Cancun , Mexico , and Seattle. WTO opponents claim the agreements produced by the body foster the growth of wealth among corporations at the expense of farmers , workers and others at the low end of the economy . </conclude.v.428><conclude.v.429>In light of serious deficiencies in public consultation and Government preparedness around the region , PANG is calling for a moratorium on Service sector negotiations as part of the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement ( PICTA ) .

Nevertheless , negotiations continue with a view towards Pacific Island Countries listing four service sectors for liberalisation under PICTA by October 2008.PANG is calling for an immediate moratorium on the PICTA services negotiations until appropriate social impact assessments , and regulatory reviews , have been completed.

We ' ve already discussed this philosophical examination HERE. But natural revelation and human reasoning will only bring us so far , and these must always eventually default to SPECIAL revelation in order to understand the precise nature of the world in which we live. While we are encouraged as Christians that there is never a conflict between natural revelation and special ( Biblical ) revelation , we do understand the priority here.

In Part IT , we examine federal criminal law. We explain that several canons of construction apply here. Those canons of construction indicate that federal criminal laws of general applicability do not apply to properly~authorized interrogations of enemy combatants , undertaken by military personnel in the course of an armed conflict.

It 's a shame her scenes are n't given more weight to parallel the main focuses. Yes , another thread to conclude may not always be a good thing , but somewhere halfway through Do n't Say A Word , things get a little obvious. The intelligent layers peel down to other stereotypical themes. It turns out Elisabeth is n't all that troubled after all , everyone has their rah rah moment and then it 's time to move onto Thanksgiving Dinner. For all the fine performances and mature set up in Do n't Say A Word , the end wraps up almost too nicely. I liked Do n't Say A Word and am still recommending it to intelligent audiences , but intrigued viewers must look to the DVD features for more in depth scenes and analysis.

This article is the second in a two-part series presenting the methodological issues confronting researchers who seek to identify a causal relationship between pathological gambling ( PG ) and suicide. As in the first part of this series , we hope to convey to readers the importance of reading research studies with a clear understanding and healthy skepticism of study methodology in order to better evaluate scientific evidence. The previous issue of the WAGER discussed how methodological problems such as bias ( i.e. , systematic error ) or chance ( i.e. , random error ) can lead to spurious findings or prevent detection of true associations; this week we conclude the series with a discussion of methodological issues such as confounding that can complicate , mislead or obscure the accurate interpretation of non-spurious associations in observational studies . </conclude.v.502><conclude.v.503>In Medivac International Management Pte Ltd v John Walter Moore [ 1988 ] 1 MLJ 5; [ 1987 ] SLR 415 , trade secrets featured again.

Dennett ' s misrepresentation of Hume ( and , allegedly , of William James and Thomas Nagel ) illustrates his complacent refusal to acknowledge the dense and vital relations between religion and reason , not only historically but also philosophically. Here is real obscurantism ! The actual relation between religion and reason is , of course , a generally hostile one. As human society and philosophy developed , reason came into ever-greater conflict with religion. During and after the Enlightenment , a secure place for religion within philosophy was sought , but only by isolating it increasingly from the scrutiny of reason. To believe Wieseltier , however , one would have to conclude that reason depended for its very existence on religion ! </conclude.v.697><conclude.v.698>This points to the reason that the historic model of correlating technology with cultural groups is no longer a solid working archaeological model. Clovis points do not correlate necessarily with hypothetical Clovis people , nor do Folsom points designate a Folsom people , and so on. By finding several lithic tool types at the same site and part of the same archaeological context , it is hard to argue that Folsom people were sharing a campsite with Clovis people. Rather , it is more parsimonious to conclude that tool types do not directly correlate with a specific group , and that the first Native Americans used both types of lithic technologies. Furthermore , the reason we have been so unsuccessful in finding archaeological sites dating to the first peopling of North America is that the only nonperishable material we might expect people practicing a similar lifeway to leave are the smallest flakes and tool fragments.

Efforts to find exceptions to this conclusion have , to date , turned up none. Even when done correctly , significance tests are dangerous. I show that summaries of scientific research do not require tests of statistical significance. I illustrate the dangers of significance tests by examining an application to the M3-Competition. Although the authors of that reanalysis conducted a proper series of statistical tests , they suggest that the original M3 was not justified in concluding that combined forecasts reduce errors and that the selection of the best method is dependent upon the selection of a proper error measure. I show that the original conclusions were justified and that they are correct. Authors should try to avoid tests of statistical significance , journals should discourage them , and readers should ignore them. Instead , to analyze and communicate findings from empirical studies , one should use effect sizes , confidence intervals , replications/extensions , and meta-analyses . </conclude.v.763><conclude.v.764>The results of a survey by Bruce MacEwen at Adam Smith , Esq. leads him to conclude that based on responses by 63 of respondents ( there were only 87 ) the billable hour will remain intact for all practical purposes.

Snow once remarked that not knowing the second law of thermodynamics is like never having read Shakespeare. Yet , while many people grasp the first law of energy , " Energy can neither be created nor destroyed , " few recognize the second , " Entropy can only increase. " What is entropy anyway , and why must it increase ? Whether we want to know how a device as simple as a refrigerator works or understand the fate of the universe , we must start with the concepts of energy and entropy. In The Refrigerator and the Universe , Martin and Inge Goldstein explain the laws of thermodynamics for science buffs and neophytes alike. They begin with a lively presentation of the historical development of thermodynamics. The authors then show how the laws follow from the atomic theory of matter and give examples of their applicability to such diverse phenomena as the radiation of light from hot bodies , the formation of diamonds from graphite , how the blood carries oxygen , and the history of the earth. The laws of energy , the Goldsteins conclude , have something to say about everything , even if they do not tell us everything about anything . </conclude.v.769><conclude.v.770>[ Note to Dear Reader : Kevin has stereotyped the sections he wants you to read to conclude with him that this is somehow a religious statement , and not a compact for government.

How we use and combine the three ways of knowing are the process we use to arrive at meaning which is what leads us to conclude something is " good.

By preventing Damis from lapsing into violent immorality , he allows all of Orgon ' s family to remain clearly in the good. This enables the King to recognize that the morality of Orgon and his kin has not been stained that they committed no fault that might have strengthened Tartuffe ' s case against them. Because of Cl ante ' s stabilizing influence , the family remains unambiguously good , and Tartuffe ' s evil is recognized unambiguously by contrast. Indirectly , Cl ante allows the King to perceive this stark contradiction; once clearly seen , it is easy to resolve. Through this resolution , Moli re vindicates Cl ante ' s rational morality. By having the King interfere , Moli re demonstrates the truth of Cl ante ' s premise that anyone can easily recognize and follow the principles of rational morality. The King is an outsider to the situation , but he cleanly and justly resolves the situation using a non-contradictory understanding of the facts.

When we conclude that the best way to articulate our wants is to adopt new desires we are partially reinventing ourselves , on the basis of a discovery about our wants. Similarly , when we invent new forms of political and social life we are doing so on the basis of what we have discovered about human nature. There are not two processes at work here. It is not that first we make a discovery and then we make an invention to suit the discovery. Rather the process by which we reflect on and transform our individual lives and our form of political and social life involves discovery and invention at the very same time. Our sense of what we have discovered and what we have invented can even change over time , as our views about human nature and our own articulations of it develop . </conclude.v.799><conclude.v.800>The earlier covenant of 1629 ( The Salem Covenant [ 5 ] ) was apparently found to be inadequate. This enlarged version addresses the specific points of dissension that needed to be settled and thus provides a window into the colonists ' life as a people. Because Salem in 1636 was a theocracy , what appears here to be essentially religious in nature is also political. It would be a mistake to conclude that these theocracies lacked liberty. For one thing , virtually everyone in Salem was there by choice , and the grounding of that choice was the hope to live as a good Christian. Also , this document reflects the determined attempt to use nongovernmental means of social control. Put another way , to the extent such recovenantings as this one were successful in reining in antisocial behavior , the government did not need to intervene and thus did not intrude on personal liberty. One needs to remember , however , that in colonial America liberty was not grounded in individualism but on a community able to live according to laws based on the consent of its members . </conclude.v.800><conclude.v.801>Under Secretary Grossman : We think that NATO needs new capabilities to meet the new threats that are threatening NATO countries today.

From such a conception of the Mosaic Covenant , Dabney rightly detects a serious misunderstanding of redemptive revelation. According to Dabney , this is the similar opinion of Cameron and Amyraut back in the seventeenth century. This conviction led the Amyraldians to conclude that the Mosaic Covenant as a covenant of works had to apply , therefore , to the temporal , earthly sphere exclusively. In this manner , they avoided the erroneous conception of a hypothetical covenant of works-salvation.

It is easy to imagine activities sponsored by a religious organization that for purposes of the Establishment Clause could be deemed religious or secular , depending on their specific factual context.

( Bowman 1989 ) Also , the song begins with these lines , even though a chorus usually does not appear until after the first verse. We see as well that the words to the chorus are not repeated exactly , with the exception of the final line , which is also the title of the song : King Harvest has surely come. Neither do these lines summarize or conclude the action of the verses , as is the norm for a chorus. Finally , we note that these lines have no fixed rhyming structure , which is very unusual for a popular song.

The religions that evolved in feudal times have rarely had this fluidity of attitude and the resulting intolerance has tarnished the modern conception of spirituality; I am suggesting PCM as a world-view that has no incompatibilities with any other world-view. One might argue that a system that proposes no God , or gods as incompatible with a theistic system , but this is to miss the point. We can examine Krishna as a mortal man and draw certain conclusions; there is nothing to stop us also worshipping him if that is our impulse.

The Government is seeking to conclude a back-up treaty which would open access to fourteen Indian nuclear stations to IAEA inspectors. In exchange , India would obtain a guarantee of delivery of fuel for the duration of the back-up treaty. Nonetheless , military nuclear sites would not be open to IAEA inspectors. It should be noted that the CPI-M gave its agreement last month to the dispatch of this delegation. However , it seems that these concessions resulted in a weakening of the CPI-M in November following the political violence in Western Bengal. The opposition of the Communists to the nuclear accord was too strong for them to agree to follow a path of conciliation.

Because our current statutory scheme requires that each element of the charged offense be proved beyond a reasonable doubt , we hold that the second degree murder presumption is now obsolete. Additionally , we have addressed the sufficiency of the evidence without engaging the presumption , and we conclude that the evidence presented is insufficient to convict the defendant of first degree murder ( premeditated ) beyond a reasonable doubt.

But let us not forget that Goebbels ( a doctor of philology and a man of letters himself ) championed a similar philosophy in his own time , with consequences that we know all too well. anonymous 21 July 1999 </conclude.v.942><conclude.v.943>Summary : On to the Live Test ! .

Christ Himself told us that " God is Spirit , and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness " ( John 4 : 24 ) . Worshipping God is altogether a matter of contacting God in fellowship. Furthermore , Ephesians 6 : 18 mentions " praying at every time in spirit , " another form of fellowship with God. Based on these verses we can conclude that fellowship is a component of the human spirit . </conclude.v.944><conclude.v.945>To conclude : the Scriptures make it clear that Christ is the covenant Mediator and as such , he is the head of his elect church. We can more readily come to this conclusion when we consider the historical development of revelation and adopt the infra-lapsarian position. Then , by good and logical consequence , based on various Scriptural givens , we conclude that the Covenant of Redemption was made in eternity between the divine Persons of the Trinity , the Covenant of Grace in time , with believers and all their seed . </conclude.v.945><conclude.v.946>Firstly , that initiative out of this meeting last year got us a significant way down the track. Some 80 of the negotiations necessary to conclude modalities were achieved at the Geneva meetings last July , which this counterpart meeting called for. The second thing that 's changed of course is that following the breakdown of those talks there was a global financial crisis and this resulted in the new power structure the G20 looking to initiatives which were necessary to expedite recovery to come up with responses as to how we get back into economic recovery. The important conclusion that that G20 meeting came to , was the significance of trade in the equation. Trade is an economic stimulus so if we are to call for stimulus measures to return the world to growth , not only ca n't one avoid trade , one has to actively embrace it and urge stronger trade liberalisation as part of the solution . </conclude.v.946><conclude.v.947>In the strictest sense consciousness is dependent upon the material universe because our bodies are an integral part of it. But reason forces us to conclude there is more. How can lifeless atoms give rise to an idea or concept ? Morality , justice , and freedom , for example , exist solely in our conscious minds. Information also exists outside the material universe. Consider someone handing you a pile of wood and a set of instructions. No matter how long we wait , the universe could never read or understand the simple directions provided by the manual and construct a shelf. By contrast , human beings are capable of understanding the universe at the quantum and galactic scales. We are slowly deciphering human DNA and will soon be able to radically alter our species perhaps exponentially accelerating evolution. Some may even consider us as co-creators with God. From our consciousness flows our ability to imagine a better future and our power to produce it. We are the masters of our fate . </conclude.v.947><conclude.v.948>The FDA argues that it is confusing to consumers when a gluten-free label appears on something that is naturally gluten-free.

Or they will be quick to point out that , under conditions of freedom , there is no reason to expect that a consensus about the human good can be created in any polity and society. The critics might then conclude that the kind of political philosophy I call for is faced with a dilemma : consensus about the good is possible only if civil liberties are violated. And without consensus about the good , we can not come to fixed conclusions about the goals of political and social life or the nature of our rights . </conclude.v.950><conclude.v.951>Some have the philosophy that if the Bible does not make specific references to some questionable act then it can not be called a sin. The Bible does not specifically mention many individual sins , but condemns all immoral acts in principle. The Word of God does not say that smoking cocaine is sin , but would any sane person conclude that it is not sin ? The Bible is a book of principles. We are to examine all things by biblical principles to determine if it is right or wrong. Does smoking crack harm the body ? The answer is clearly , yes ! Then if it harms the body it is wrong and sin. God says he lives in our bodies ( indwells ) and He commands that we live pure lives and keep our physical bodies pure . </conclude.v.951><conclude.v.952>Gee , now that 's a convincing set of arguments to conclude on.

Indeed , anti-drug operations on the Mexican side are already largely in the hands of the military. And this , in turn , may provide further political ammunition and legitimacy for those who advocate a greater military role on the U.S. side. So far , administration officials and key congressional voices have been able to fend off calls to send in the troops '  partly by promising and promoting more law enforcement . </conclude.v.956><conclude.v.957>New Zealand does not have special foreign policy interests in the region. The motive for all this activity lies in Washington , not the Middle East. New Zealand is worried about the possible costs of its uneasy relationship with the United States , and more particularly about being left behind if Australia and the United States conclude a Free Trade Agreement. The benefits of any such agreement have yet to be seen , but the risk for New Zealand is that exclusion for any length of time might see investment and enterprises shift across the Tasman. The US Administration has been distinctly cool about including New Zealand-hence the helpfulness about American concerns in the Middle East . </conclude.v.957><conclude.v.958>" Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities , for there is no authority except that which God has established.

See Ind. Evid. Rule 704 ( b ); Taylor v. State , 689 N.E.2d 699 , 706 ( Ind. 1997 ) . This was not the only instance the rule was violated.

Ashworth , however , did not object to either violation at trial and does not argue on appeal that these violations require reversal , and this court can not reverse on grounds not argued by the appellant unless the violations constitute fundamental error.

It criticized the Japanese government for failing to keep pace with the global trend of trade liberalization due to its tariffs on agriculture and fisheries products. The Kyodo news agency said South Korea concluded the FTA with the U.S. based on President Roh Moo-hyun 's determination to get there before Japan and China.

The first explosions , on three different subway cars , were only 26 minutes apart. The initial investigation by British police suggested that a surprisingly small amount of explosives was used in each attack -- only about 10 pounds , which could fit unobtrusively in a small backpack -- but the tunnel walls served to magnify the underground blasts. The tunnel was so badly damaged at one site , near the Russell Square station , that it took rescuers days to recover bodies from the crippled subway car. Pieces of timing devices were also recovered , according to U.S. officials , leading police to conclude that the bombs had been placed on the floors of the subway cars by attackers who probably escaped . </conclude.v.976><conclude.v.977>Insofar as practical consequences are concerned , thoughtful proponents of the death penalty do not justify their belief on any notions of general deterrence. This is an unproven assertion and is basically irrelevant to the central rationale. It may be concluded , however , that the individual executed will be prevented ( i.e. deterred ) from committing any further homicidal acts or other antisocial acts for that matter. It can be argued , of course , that life imprisonment would accomplish the same thing. This argument , however , not only ignores the fundamental assertion that the individual deserves to die , but also brushes aside the distinct possibility that while in prison further homicidal or other criminal acts by this individual may occur. The absence of a death penalty does indeed free these persons incarcerated " for life " from any meaningful behavior restraints thereby further endangering the lives of other prisoners and guards . </conclude.v.977><conclude.v.978>When talks started on a bilateral trade agreement between India and the ten ASEAN countries began way back in 2002 , the two sides initially began work on a comprehensive economic partnership agreement ( CEPA ) , including goods and services and investment-all to be negotiated under a single undertaking ( meaning if you ca n't agree on any one of the three , you do n't have a deal ) .

' Drawing from the facts the trial court judge used to award exemplary ( double ) damages , the appeals court ruled that Keymon ' s actions warranted such damages : the day after her last work day she contacted the client ' s owner and solicited business; she then immediately emailed herself H-R ' s trade secrets; while drawing unemployment compensation and accepting severance payments , Keymon was surreptitiously utilizing [ H-R ] ' s trade secret information to purloin [ its client ' s ] business , even utilizing [ H-R ] employees to do so.

Several facts were identified by the trial court as justifying a reasonable suspicion to detain Sullivan for the performance of field sobriety tests. These facts , although not rising to the level of probable cause , were sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion. In addition , Officer Norin opined that the performance of one test , in his experience , would be insufficient to effectuate the purpose of the stop. Officer Norin also testified that approximately half of all intoxicated persons who he had stopped were able to successfully perform the ABC test. Thus , one could reasonably conclude that the legitimate purpose of the stop was not completed. Under the facts and circumstances of this case , a reasonable officer could continue to suspect that Sullivan had been operating her vehicle while intoxicated , despite her successful performance of the ABC test.

Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery , which has been modeled by the G 0 distribution and , under which , regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter , which is the number of looks , is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and , therefore , of the performance of classification procedures. This paper derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one , while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum , we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing , even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Bhattacharyya . </conclude.v.1006><conclude.v.1007>The ailing Lloyds is set to agree a deal whereby the Government insures £ 285bn of its assets in return for a stake of up to 70 , according to today ' s FT.

He showed that the Michelson-Morley experiment performed in such a rotating frame did show fringe shifts , and concluded that , even if linear motion was relative , rotational motion was absolute. DeSitter noted that stellar aberration was the same for both components of distant binary stars , even though the relative velocity of each with respect to the observer was quite different. Therefore velocity in some special frame ( we might now say velocity in the local gravity field relative to the distant gravity field ) rather than relative velocity between source and observer determines aberration. Both of these experiments were blows to SR 's contention that all motion was relative.

Following his lead , and refusing to create a false dichotomy between the apocalyptic and the social ( and the charismatic ) , this section will highlight essential elements of the prophetic that should be present if it is to be exercised appropriately today.

Behe argues that known natural pathways are improbable to explain 'X ' , since 'X ' has functioning parts , one can infer 'design'. But the statement says nothing about the 'designer ' and thus any process which can cause the appearance of teleology , such as for instance evolutionary processes , needs to be considered. Since Intelligent Design does not propose any explanation , pathways or mechanisms ( although ID proponents seem to contradict themselves occasionally ) , intelligent design can not even compete with the 'we do n't know ' explanation. In fact , lacking any positive , independent evidence , there is no reason to conclude that an intelligent designer was involved . </conclude.v.1065><conclude.v.1066>'We are also hopeful that the Left will eventually see the light and back the deal.

P tzer et al. ( p. 472 ) tested cytokine-based gene therapy in woodchucks with primary hepatocellular carcinomas by using AdIL-12/B7.1 , an adenovirus vector carrying genes for murine interleukin 12 and B7.1. One to two weeks after tumors were injected with AdIL-12/B7.1 , the authors observed substantial tumor regression accompanied by massive T-lymphocyte infiltration and increased levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and interferon gamma , compared with tumors injected with a control vector. When a tumor injected with AdIL-12/B7.1 was followed for 7 weeks , the authors observed a 95 or more reduction in the size of the tumor compared with its size before treatment. Thus , the authors conclude that adenovirus vector-based immunotherapy appears to be an effective treatment of large nontransplanted tumors . </conclude.v.1074><conclude.v.1075>The proper term to use when referring to someone of Jewish ancestry or a member of the Jewish faith is Jewish , although Jew is technically correct.

Korea should realize , however , that the targeted completion of negotiations by early 2007 is dictated by the July 1 , 2007 , expiration of trade promotion authority , which permits the U.S. president to negotiate trade agreements with other nations without the threat of subsequent modifications to the agreed-upon text by the U.S. Congress. Although Korea and the United States could conclude a free trade agreement without this agreement from Congress to either accept or reject the agreement but not to modify it , this would be extremely difficult as a practical matter. The U.S. Congress could amend and effectively disregard the negotiated language of such an agreement. Moreover , the power to reauthorize that presidential authority lies solely with the U.S. Congress , and for domestic political reasons it appears doubtful at this time that the U.S. Congress will do so next year.

In its ruling on the second motion for modification , the trial court refused to increase father 's support obligation for daughter because it concluded that no substantial change of economic circumstances had occurred; it reinstated father 's support obligation for son as a result of son 's transitional release from state boot camp; and it declined to terminate father 's support obligation for daughter based on father 's contention that ORS 107.108 violates the state and federal constitutions . </conclude.v.1088><conclude.v.1089>Given this historic pattern , and reflecting the degree of institutionalization in the strategic relationship ( see detailed discussion below ) , it is possible to conclude that limited disagreements over the Middle East peace process are not likely to impact the strategic relationship.

It seems quite plausible ( though not certain ) that enactment of the ERA would increase the likelihood that courts would indeed mandate recognition of same-sex marriages. The arguments that the ERA would lead to such a result can no longer be dismissed , as it once was , as a " hysterical " " emotional scare tactic " " canards.

A good example of this strategy was the tobacco industry ' s assertion that certain characteristics of the region preclude a confident conclusion that environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) , otherwise known as second hand smoke , is harmful to health. The tobacco industry proposed that several Asian cultural and dietary features were confounding variables1 in the central question of environmental tobacco smoke affecting health. Some of the Asian characteristics in question include extreme heat and high humidity , incense smoke from Buddhist shrine , and highly spiced food often prepared on smoky coal burners ( O'Sullivan et al. 2000 ) . Assunta et al. further conclude that the ETS consultant program was successful in delaying and diluting smoke-free legislation in Asian but the ETS consultants program was in disarray by the mid 1990s . </conclude.v.1119><conclude.v.1120>No. 6 : Do not discuss the weather.

We do n't understand how water vapor comes into the equations , and that is a big deal. Heat sources represent other major unknowns , after all , heat drives the atmosphere. We make assumptions about these unknowns , and as long as these fit for the moment , the forecast looks good. But a slight error will only magnify as the forecast is further extended , " Goldstein wrote. " We can get an idea of a trend , but specifics 30 days or 90 days out are seldom correct.

The sample deviation rate is calculated by dividing the number of sample deviations by the sample size. The allowance for sampling risk is calculated by subtracting the sample deviation rate from the tolerable deviation rate. If the allowance for sampling risk is large and positive the auditor would most likely conclude that the design and operation of an internal control is effective. However , if the allowance for sampling risk is small or negative the auditor would conclude that the design and operation of an internal control is not effective. What constitutes a large enough difference is a matter for professional judgement. Generally , smaller allowances for sampling risk are tolerated with higher risks of assessing control risk too low and larger sample sizes . </conclude.v.1145><conclude.v.1146>In this paper we present results related to achieving finegrained activity recognition for context-aware computing applications.

First we examine the magnitude of corporate strategic alliance activity and conclude that it has increased since the study period of Chan , Kensinger , Keown , and Martin ( 1997 ) in the finance literature and of Das , Sen , and Sengupta ( 1998 ) in the management literature. Second , we question whether alliance activity is successful as measured by increases in shareholder wealth. We conclude , consistent with the work of Dacin , Hitt , and Levitas ( 1997 ) , that approximately 50 percent of alliances fail.

Although the first covenant and its commands have been made null and void , the divine wisdom is evident in the covenant that God set before His people at Mt. Sinai. If Israel had combined the Mosaic covenant with faith , they would have received far more blessings than they could count ! ( Malachi 3 : 10 , 11 ) Remember , it is God 's desire that we mature in faith and leading naturally selfish , self-centered people ( the human race ) to step out in faith is almost impossible ! In this light , the Ten Commandments represent a starting place for spiritual growth ! They are simple and direct. The fourth commandment is a test commandment that helps to develop our faith. The devil has done all he can to place a certain contempt on the observance of the seventh day. Ironically , the fourth commandment is the only commandment of the ten that requires us to do nothing ! We just have to do it at the right time each week to honor God . </conclude.v.1184><conclude.v.1185>However , on 14 Jun South Korea was told by U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab that Washington had officially asked Seoul to renegotiate a bilateral free trade deal to reflect Washington 's new trade policy guidelines.

The Court also concludes that defendant has established legitimate interests warranting enforcement of the covenant. What remains unresolved is plaintiff 's contention that he was fraudulently induced to execute the Agreement containing the restrictive covenant a contention that goes to both the validity and enforceability of the covenant and whether it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its authority to narrow the scope of the covenant so as to narrowly tailor it to CROG 's legitimate interests in restricting Dr. Awwad from the practice of otolaryngology. Accordingly , the Court must deny both CROG 's [ *9 ] motion and Dr. Awwad 's cross-motion for summary judgment on the issue of the validity and enforceability of the restrictive covenant , with the claim of fraudulent inducement being reserved for trial . </conclude.v.1189><conclude.v.1190>PayPal may use funds held in any currency balance to recover amounts owed to PayPal due to chargebacks or for any other reason.

Nevertheless , under pressure from the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , an extremist environmentalist group , the EPA asked Uniroyal Chemical Company to conduct carcinogenicity tests on UDMH alone , without daminozide. To comply with the agency 's instructions , the researchers gave UDMH to mice in amounts four to eight times the MTD that is , 133 , 000 to 266 , 000 times the highest estimate for a preschooler 's daily intake of UDMH. This is analogous to drinking daily , for life , 19 , 000 quarts of juice made from Alar-treated apples. Eleven of the 52 mice that had been given UDMH daily at eight times the male MTD developed cancerous or noncancerous tumors. Eighty percent of the male mice died prematurely not from cancer , but rather from amounts of UDMH that had rendered the chemical toxic. The EPA acknowledged that the use of such large quantities of UDMH made this study questionable; yet on February 1 , 1989 , the agency ordered a phaseout of Alar use that was to conclude by July 31 , 1990 . </conclude.v.1196><conclude.v.1197>Although teen heroin use rose from 0.3 percent in 1994 to 0.7 percent in 1995 , the actual number of surveyed teens using heroin rose from 14 to 32.

" However , Ivan never speaks the sentence in question , and neither does any other character in the novel !

The earliest passover for Jesus ' ministry would have been in the Spring of AD 29. If the Passover of AD 29 were Jesus 1st passover mentioned in the gospel of John , then the 3rd Passover would have occurred in the year AD 31. The available information reveals that the year AD 30 is too early to be a truly viable date. Some people may not accept that the year AD 30 was too early based on preconceived ideas. But if you accept all available information from all the gospel accounts , it is logical to conclude that the year AD 30 is too early and is therefore not the year of the crucifixion . </conclude.v.1202><conclude.v.1203>26.

We recommend that the Government should think more creatively about ways in which it might increase contacts with North Koreans without simply benefiting the regime 's elite.

Or should it be investigated historically for past fulfillment shortly following the original prediction ? 2000 years ago , the middle first century was called " these last days " in which " the time was near " and the end of all things was at hand. Here lies the crux of the problem. Authorities explain this was just a little misunderstanding , and quickly conclude the end time is now. Abundant evidence shows there was no misunderstanding , and the time was at hand then. If you explore prophecy in terms of those who lived 2000 years ago , and consider historical evidence , you will find the " end of the age , " popularly known as the end time , was the late first century . </conclude.v.1214><conclude.v.1215>Many Objectivists acknowledge that Man is fallible on the conceptual level , but then seem to promptly forget this fact.

But even if we ca n't conclude FTAs with other countries at the moment , we must conclude an ECFA with Mainland China. Globalization and regional economic organizations are a macro-level trend. Taipei must seek the same tariff treatment as other countries on Mainland China. It must provide incentives for companies to build plants on Taiwan. Therefore it must conclude an ECFA. Taiwan 's exports constitute 70 of its GDP. Taiwan 's exports to Mainland China constitute 40 of its total exports. We now face ASEAN+1 ( Mainland China ) , ASEAN+3 ( Mainland China , Japan , and South Korea ) , ASEAN+6 ( add India , New Zealand , and Australia ) , and ASEAN+7 ( Russia ) . Do people really want manufacturers on Taiwan to relocate , rather than conclude an ECFA ? Those who oppose ECFA do not object to products from Taiwan being sold on the Mainland. Do they object to products from Taiwan being tariff-free ? Do they object to manufacturers on Taiwan remaining on Taiwan ? Of course it would be best if Taipei could also conclude FTAs with other countries. But for the time being it can't. Therefore it must conclude an ECFA with Beijing . </conclude.v.1216><conclude.v.1217>We are thus driven by logic to the inescapable conclusion that God , in some mysterious way , must incorporate both unity and plurality. To avoid a logical contradiction He has to be a unity in one sense and a plurality in a different sense. ( Christians would be guilty of violating the basic law of non-contradiction if they insist that God is both a unity and plurality in the same sense ) . Biblical revelation states that god is a unity in His Essence and has a plurality in Personality. How these two requirements combine is a mystery which we take by faith but that they should combine is a logical necessity and not an absurdity. A mystery is best defined as a logical necessity which can not be unraveled by reason alone. It is not so with superstition. Superstition is believing against the requirement of reason. Faith is believing along the line of reason and beyond it , but never against it. We can therefore legitimately conclude that reason and faith belong in the same continuum . </conclude.v.1217><conclude.v.1218>[ 9 ] On September 8 , 1951 , the United States and Japan signed the Mutual Security Treaty , which provided the initial basis for the Japan 's security relations with the United States and provided the legal basis for the continued presence of U.S. troops in Japan.

We observe substantial improvement in the performance of the nonprofit organizations as well as increased capacity for their future performance. Somewhat surprising , we also observe that funding for programs with common performance measures received large increases in funding while programs with unique measures were cut dramatically.

But here the event of a battle ( as formerly the judgments of God ) determines the justice of either party; since between states there can not be a war of punishment no subordination existing between them.

While we understand that each case is different in nature , and some cases may require additional time to resolve , concluding the negotiations with Peru and Ecuador should be conditioned on the resolution of a great majority of these disputes. While some cases pending before international arbitral panels are subject to fixed timetables , it is certainly reasonable to require the final resolution of many of these cases , including those involving Peru ' s SUNAT. We have had enough of roadmaps. We need action , not words hechos , no palabras. If the opportunity to conclude a free trade agreement with the United States should fall by the wayside , Peru and Ecuador may have to wait years for another chance to enter into such an economic relationship with the United States.

This approach is used when the parties wish to finalize a contract for the shipment in one direction ( export contract ) before they are able to agree on the contract for the shipment in the other direction ( counter-export contract ) . The purpose of the countertrade agreement in such a case is to express the commitment to conclude the counter-export contract or contracts and , to the extent possible , to outline the terms of the future contract and to establish procedures for concluding and carrying out the supply contracts to be concluded. Possible issues to be addressed in such a countertrade agreement are enumerated in paragraphs 29-39 . </conclude.v.1237><conclude.v.1238>It 's hard to know just what to make of this isolated study.

This was to be achieved , supposedly , by strikes against Yugoslav fielded forces on the ground in Kosovo. By the end of the campaign , and retrospectively , the central purpose of the campaign was said to be that of dissuading Milosevic and his henchmen from directing this brutality and coercing them to negotiate a settlement. This aim required quite different tactics. The confusion of purpose indicated by those preliminary and ex post facto descriptions of its objective , we believe , dogged the campaign. We conclude that NATO did not make manifest at the start of Operation Allied Force the necessary clarity of purpose about the aims of its military intervention in Kosovo.

It is important to initially note that as a result of the teachers ' refusal to read the disclaimer , school administrators were forced to make special appearances in the science classrooms to deliver it. No evidence was presented by any witness that the Dover students are presented with a disclaimer of any type in any other topic in the curriculum. An objective student observer would accordingly be observant of the fact that the message contained in the disclaimer is special and carries special weight. In addition , the objective student would understand that the administrators are reading the statement because the biology teachers refused to do so on the ground that they are legally and ethically barred from misrepresenting a religious belief as science , as will be discussed below. ( Trial Tr. vol. 25 , Nilsen Test. , 56-57 , Oct. 21 , 2005; Trial Tr. vol. 35 , Baksa Test. , 38 , Nov. 2 , 2005 ) .

The USTA is working to develop recommendations and guidelines for coaches of young players in order to increase the durability as well as the longevity of these individuals. The High Performance Profile ( HPP ) , a testing battery for musculoskeletal alterations that have been found to be associated with injury risk , was presented. Mr Aaron Sciasca presented some strategies for conditioning tennis players based on the findings of the HPP.

Section 15.50 states that " a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement at the time the agreement is made ... . " Simply reading the text , the clause " at the time the agreement is made " can modify either " otherwise enforceable agreement " or " ancillary to or part of. " No amount of pure textual analysis can tell us unequivocally which preceding clause is modified. Light stated that the agreement must be enforceable at the time the agreement is made , and therefore concluded that " at the time the agreement is made " must modify " otherwise enforceable agreement. " We now conclude , contrary to Light , that the covenant need only be " ancillary to or part of " the agreement at the time the agreement is made. Accordingly , a unilateral contract formed when the employer performs a promise that was illusory when made can satisfy the requirements of the Act . </conclude.v.1269><conclude.v.1270>9.

This risk is involved with situation , when developer fails to receive a building permit or any other legal decision , which is necessary during investment process and consequently is not able to construct a building. In such a case , in reference to patterns of reservation agreements that are in common use , recovery of reservation fee can turn out to be quite difficult. Besides , even if a developer returned this fee , the consumer would probably not receive interests on reservation fee. Additionally the reservation agreement does not grant the consumer the right to force the developer to conclude the final sale agreement.

For example , if a coach finds a relationship between the performance of her football team ( wins ) and the weather ( rainy days ) , she might conclude that her team plays better in rainy conditions. However , if every game day that it does not rain , her team goes out for ice cream before the game , their performance might actually relate to the effect that eating ice-cream has on their performance rather than the weather. In general , a confounder is a mixing of effects that confuses an association. Figure 1 illustrates that a confounding variable must meet the following criteria : 1 ) it must not be a mediator in the causal pathway between predictor and outcome , 2 ) it must be associated with the predictor under investigation , 3 ) it can cause or prevent the outcome of interest ( Last , 2001 ) . It is important to think critically about potential confounding when examining a reported cause-effect relationship. Unless researchers make deliberate adjustments , it is not possible to distinguish between the effect of confounding variables and the variables being studied ( Hulley et al. , 2001 ) . </conclude.v.1282><conclude.v.1283>37.

Centred on Christ , our Faith is supported by Scripture , as interpreted by tradition and understood through reason. This approach is rooted in the understanding of the " father of Anglican theology " , Richard Hooker , ( 1554-1600 ) : What Scripture doth plainly deliver , to that first place both of credit and obedience is due; the next whereunto is whatsoever any man can necessarily conclude by force of reason; after these the voice of the Church succeedeth. That which the Church by her ecclesiastical authority shall probably think and define to be true or good , must in congruity of reason over-rule all other inferior judgments whatsoever ( Laws , Book V , 8 : 2; Folger Edition 2 : 39 , 8-14 ) . Hooker also cautioned us not to impose too much on Scripture : [ paraphrase by Gibson , Paul , in Discerning the Word ] " Just as exaggerated praise may actually undermine the reputation of those to whom they are offered , so we must be careful not to attribute to Scripture more status than it can enjoy lest our exaggeration of its importance results in people treating it irreverently.

To understand these distinctions let 's consider how one goes about supporting a generalization. To support a generalization one needs to take a sample. If , for example , I wanted to know whether or not the majority of Sonoma County college students say Sonoma County rent is too expensive , then I will asks some Sonoma County students to answer this question. Imagine that I asked 2 students , and both of them said that housing is not too expensive. Is this enough information to conclude that , in general , Sonoma County college students would not say that Sonoma County rent is too expensive ? No ! Why not ? I need to ask more people. So , one of the essential pieces of information we look for in an Inductive Generalization 's premises is how large its sample is. This is called a sample size . </conclude.v.1307><conclude.v.1308>We conclude that divorced parents of children attending school are not a suspect class for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause and that ORS 107.108 should not , therefore , be subject to heightened scrutiny on the basis that it discriminates against a suspect class.

First , tacit collusion can not flourish where , as in railroading , rate concessions can and are made secretly through confidential contracts. Second , rail services are extremely heterogenous , making price comparisons for purposes of collusive behavior difficult. Finally , high and declining fixed costs in the rail industry strongly induce carriers to compete for additional traffic through rate concessions. Despite the fact that DOJ has been informed of this proceeding and has been served with the merger application , and with pleadings containing and discussing the Alliance Agreement , DOJ has not participated in this proceeding. We may conclude from this that DOJ does not find this agreement any more troubling than the normal activities that rail carriers typically undertake in negotiating interline pricing and service arrangements . </conclude.v.1311><conclude.v.1312>234.

We can imagine circumstances in which such a process would allow a creditor to collude with a debtor , partake in a fraudulent transfer of the debtor 's funds or otherwise loot the corporation so as to obtain payments from both the debtor and the guarantor while exposing the guarantor to an inflated risk of recovering nothing from the original borrower. Such a risk may be different enough in kind from those involved in an ordinary release that cases like United Orient Bank and Gannett would be inapplicable. We do not reach this issue here , however , because the district court did not make any factual findings that would suggest this kind of collusion.2 In the absence of such findings , we see no basis to conclude that CFC 's acquisition of Prodipe and its subsequent sale to MIF increased in any meaningful way the risks that Weinstock had assumed in the Guarantee Agreement . </conclude.v.1316><conclude.v.1317>Can we conclude that Mars has life on it ?

The monopoly existed before the sale. It was conceded that the Doerners had about ninety-eight per cent of the Canadian market in the goods that they manufactured and sold prior to the sale transaction. The monopoly had been created by the appellants themselves and it rested largely upon their skill and industry in the pursuit of their business activities. They sold the product of their skill and industry and were paid for it.

The European Union , Brazil and other economic powers have blamed the U.S. for gridlock in global-trade talks.

This policy of " general continuances " is implemented by simply filing a Trustee 's Worksheet indicating that the meeting has not been concluded and by not continuing the meeting to a specific date and time . </conclude.v.1366><conclude.v.1367>And thus Syria secured its new role through its authorisation to implement the Taif Agreement and enforce it among Lebanese factions , or , more precisely , between two political endeavours represented by late Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri , allied with Riyadh , and Hizbullah , allied with Tehran. While Syria became involved in the Madrid peace conference and continued negotiations with Israel , Iran , which did not warmly welcome Syria 's involvement in the peace process , maintained its position in Lebanon during each episode of the Lebanese- Israeli conflict. It did so , for example , in 1993 and 1996 , during which the April agreement was concluded under French-American- Iranian-Syrian auspices and which limited fighting between Hizbullah and Israel to military targets . </conclude.v.1367><conclude.v.1368>Still , why would the merger agreement which is so well crafted in every other respect ignore specific mention of this issue ? One would suspect that the issue isn ' t addressed because the parties didn ' t think it was one , and it will likely conclude with the F.D.I.C. ' s process. The review for the national bank is a similar one to the F.D.I.C. review . </conclude.v.1368><conclude.v.1369>Continuing from last month , where an examination of the scriptural basis for the idea of covenant in the Old Testament was begun , ancient suzerain treaties as models for the Biblical covenant were examined. It was pointed out that " although it is true that the Biblical form of covenant making is similar to the then existing practices , it is not true that therefore we must conclude that this form of covenant making indicates that Israel , in its religious practices , simply adopted the culture of the surrounding nations.

" [ 32 ] The security needs and objectives of America and Western Europe have simply diverged to the point that the community of interests necessary to sustain the alliance no longer exists. Such an observation is even more pertinent with respect to ANZUS. David Lange wistfully demonstrated that point in analyzing his country 's dispute with the United States. " The fact that two treaty partners could take such different views of the character of the alliance raises serious questions about how the alliance will be managed , and the security of the South Pacific maintained , in the future. " [ 33 ] </conclude.v.1372><conclude.v.1373>Why should we conclude that God is a Trinity of persons ? What compelling evidence is there to conclude that there are three eternal relationships within God 's essence as Trinitarians claim ? Most people who believe in a Trinity believe such because they go to the Scripture and find many distinctions between Father and Son , and to a lesser degree the Holy Spirit. If God 's oneness is a numerical oneness of person ( meaning He is uni-personal ) , these distinctions become very perplexing , if not meaningless. After all , how is it that Jesus prays to the Father , and speaks of the Father as though the Father is another person distinct from Him if Jesus ' deity is the deity of the Father ? It would be the same personal deity in both cases , and thus there would seem to be no reason to make any distinction between Father and Son . </conclude.v.1373><conclude.v.1374>One of the minor variations that is interesting enough to note is the version with the iridescent green/brown pouch ( picture below ) .

We aim to conclude an agreement on mutual recognition of conformity assessment ( which includes certification and testing procedures ) for certain sectors as soon as possible. We will continue the ongoing work in several sectors and identify others for further work . </conclude.v.1376><conclude.v.1377>Hobin 's final issue is whether the trial court properly dismissed his claim of violation of New Hampshire 's Consumer Protection Act. Although some courts have concluded that the parties ' contractual choice of a foreign law to govern their agreement militates against an application of the forum 's statutory protections , see , e.g. , Demitropoulos v. Bank One Milwaukee , N.A. , 915 F. Supp. 1399 , 1412-14 ( N.D. Ill. 1996 ) , we do not address the issue here because both parties argue the merits under the New Hampshire statute. Cf. Mundaca Inv.

The comparison is based on a case study of a Java embedded architecture , comprising a Java native processor and a memory management unit. The processor is a micro-programmed , pipelined , Java-optimized processor ( JOP ) , initially written in VHDL , and its BSV re-designed match BLUEJEP. Its memory management unit implements the bytecodes dealing with memory allocation , along with a mark-compact garbage collector. The two design flows are examined from several points of view , including both quantitative and qualitative measures. Based on this design experience , we conclude that the new high-abstraction level languages , such as BSV , offer in comparison to register-transfer ( RT ) level classic approaches roughly the same trade-offs that C++ offers vs. assembly language in the software world . </conclude.v.1379><conclude.v.1380>2. We conclude that no matter how difficult the circumstances facing the military in Afghanistan , the use of air power and acts of considerable cultural insensitivity on the part of some Coalition Forces over an extended period have done much to shape negative perceptions among ordinary Afghans about the military and the international effort in Afghanistan. This problem has caused damage , both real and perceived , that will in many instances be difficult to undo. We further conclude that recent policy changes which aim to improve procedures , combined with the commitment of senior military figures to adopting better practices , are a welcome development. We recommend that , in its response to this Report , the Government supply us with detailed information on measures that are being taken by Coalition Forces in Afghanistan to provide more pro-active and appropriate protection of civilians in the future. ( Paragraph 29 ) </conclude.v.1380><conclude.v.1381>Earlier , session moderator Klaus Schwab , founder and executive chairman of the WEF , told participants that to adequately address the global financial crisis , we must have multi-stakeholder involvement.

We conclude that Japan has offered valuable support to the international community through its very generous funding of peacekeeping and reconstruction activities , not least in Iraq and Afghanistan. We further conclude that the Japanese Government has displayed political courage in deploying Japanese ground and air forces to Iraq , and Japanese naval forces to assist in refuelling coalition vessels conducting operations in the Indian Ocean , and that these deployments are to be welcomed. We recommend that the Government should continue to engage with Japan as a co-operative partner in promoting international security and the fight against terrorism , and to encourage Japan to expand its participation in UN peacekeeping and international military missions as far as permitted by its Constitution to do so.

Overall , the plan 's strategic directions are consistent with Parks Canada 's mandate and management policies. The assessment has , however , raised certain concerns regarding the protection of cultural and natural resources. Potential conflicts between preservation of commemorative integrity and protection of natural heritage have been noted. Solutions or at least partial solutions will be addressed when various management documents are drawn up , such as the plan for the preservation and development of cultural landscapes and the natural resource management plan . </conclude.v.1390><conclude.v.1391>Note that God also shed his own blood in this covenant transaction. This seems somewhat confusing. When did God Almighty shed his blood ? We know when Jesus as representative of the human race shed his blood , but when did God shed his blood ? We conclude that Jesus , being fully man , and fully God , shed God 's blood upon his cross at the precise moment that he shed humanity 's blood. We recall those precious powerful words which Jesus rehearsed in the ears of Philip . </conclude.v.1391><conclude.v.1392>If the Parties can not resolve the matters stated in the notice within forty-five ( 45 ) days after they meet and confer , the Party who served notice may bring suit seeking damages , injunctive relief and/or specific performance of the Agreement in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

We show that the conventional asymptotic critical values for the stationarity tests of Kwiatkowski et al. and Leybourne and McCabe may have substantial size distortions if the model under the null hypothesis is highly persistent. Such size distortions have not been recognized in the literature. The practical importance of these distortions is illustrated when testing for long-run purchasing power parity under current float. Size distortions of tests of the null of a unit root may be overcome by the use of finite sample or bootstrap critical values. We show such corrections are not possible when testing the null of stationarity , and we conclude that tests of this null can not be recommended for applied work unless the sample size is very large . </conclude.v.1395><conclude.v.1396>27 April 2004 : The Health Committee agreed to take forward the issues raised in the petitions PE689 and PE718 within its forthcoming inquiry into workforce planning within the NHS.

Science attempts to understand what the paint and canvass is composed of , the relationship of the individual paints , and the brushstrokes that are involved in the final product.

The definition of common objectives will be first required in order to then explore how to maximise complementarity between the UN and non-UN humanitarian actors. This session will also conclude the meeting and the aim is to agree on areas for follow-up action among participating organisations . </conclude.v.1400><conclude.v.1401>41. We conclude that , although there is undoubtedly a high level of public support for the death penalty in Japan , the moratorium on its use in 2005-06 , under Justice Minister Sugiura , demonstrates that the Japanese Government is not necessarily immovable on this subject. We recommend that the Government should continue to convey its views on the death penalty to Japan , both directly and through EU channels; and that it should encourage the Japanese Government , if it remains committed to the death penalty , to reform the system so as to eliminate the unnecessary secrecy and arbitrary delay to which attention has been drawn by the UN Committee against Torture.

How does one bring broad universalisms down to practical application , and have the confidence one 's judgments are right , and not someone else 's view of dogmatism ? I discuss the mystery that lies behind the process of judgment , and conclude that the best check against the illusions of reason is our ability to have a relation with , and understand the viewpoints of , others. In particular , I consider Buber 's concept of dialogue , and how it might affect common types of ethical decisions in business . </conclude.v.1402><conclude.v.1403>Thank you for the invitation to join the meeting today. At this juncture in time , I can not emphasise enough how much we need the ongoing trade negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda to be concluded successfully and on time , which is by January 1 , 2005. There are four compelling reasons for urgency in the negotiations. The first is clearly the warning signals from the IMF of the slow world economic recovery , and the uncertainty in economic conditions around the world . </conclude.v.1403><conclude.v.1404>An example of inductive and deductive reasoning is seen in the following two responses to David 's action.

Instead , we will pass on to Adam 's consent unto the compact which the Lord God set before him. This may be inferred , first of all , from the very law of his nature : having been made in the image and likeness of God , there was nothing in him contrary to His holy will , nothing to oppose His righteous requirements : so that he must have readily attended . </conclude.v.1409><conclude.v.1410>Second , we can not even conclude from the evidence that God is finitely perfect. For all we know our universe could be a lot better than it is; our universe might even be a lousy universe , compared to what it could be. And so our designer could be a lousy designer. Moreover , even if we knew our universe was a perfectly wonderful universe , that still would not allow us to conclude that our designer is a perfect designer. He could have gotten lucky with this project , he could have copied it from other designers , or else this could have been a final successful try after a string of failures . </conclude.v.1410><conclude.v.1411>A possibly apocyrphal reply to theologians who inquired if there was anything that could be concluded about the Creator from the study of creation; as described in " Homage to Santa Rosalia , or why are there so many kinds of animals " by G.

In the run-up to the election , America ' s allies must question whether the United States ' comparatively enormous stockpile of nuclear weapons remains necessary. Questions need to be asked as to whether the U.S. threat to resort to pre-emptive nuclear war , rather than rely on minimal deterrence , increases or decreases international security. To conclude , the leaders of the NATO Alliance need to make some significant moves to transform their reliance on nuclear doctrine because , if not , the most important non-proliferation treaty in history will fail to receive in 2010 the support it requires for building a more secure world . </conclude.v.1412><conclude.v.1413>Beginning with problem identification and diagnosis in the late 1990s , the narrative traces the pre-negotiation and negotiation phases in 1999 and early 2000. It then explores the politics of legitimation and ratification that were publicly manifest in New Zealand in mid-late 2000 , and ends with a passage on implementation in 2001. An assessment of the negotiation against six criteria is essayed next. A penultimate chapter distils from the narrative a number of negotiating techniques employed by New Zealand officials. This study concludes that the Agreement has been modestly successful so far , but that further assessment would be advisable after more time has elapsed . </conclude.v.1413><conclude.v.1414>From the conclusions of the Swiss , Russian and German scientific clinical studies , we can no longer ignore the microwave oven sitting in our kitchens.

Concluding ECFA will give us a 5-10 percent Mainland tariff reduction. This pertains to benefits for our exports. Even more important is total exemption from tariffs. That would allow manufacturers to keep their factories on Taiwan , increasing employment opportunities on Taiwan. If we do not conclude an ECFA , the manufacturers may be forced to move their plants to Southeast Asia or Mainland China. If that happens , the unemployment problem on Taiwan will surely deteriorate. Therefore , one of the reasons for signing ECFA is to encourage manufacturers to keep their roots on Taiwan. Those who oppose signing ECFA may ask " What 's wrong with relocating ? " This may solve the manufacturers ' problems. But it will exacerbate unemployment on Taiwan. If manufacturers are able to set up factories on Taiwan and made our exports become less competitive , why should they be forced to move to Southeast Asia ? </conclude.v.1420><conclude.v.1421>For the reasons discussed , the Court concluded that the nonsolicitation agreement between Pearson and A &amp;A was valid under Nebraska law and that the right to enforce the agreement passed to Aon by operation of law when it acquired A &amp;A by merger.

We welcome the focus on long-term solutions and the Government 's commitment to assisting Pakistan to strengthen its civilian institutions. We conclude the balance of the UK 's relationship with Pakistan particularly regarding its co-operation on counter-terrorism has to be improved.

He repeats the main argument of Treatise 2.3.3 ( that passions are original existences , and so lack a representative quality , and so can not be contrary to a truth discovered by reason ) , and supplements this with a battery of subsidiary arguments . </conclude.v.1434><conclude.v.1435>So there you have No. 1 on the list of Things Not To Say If You Are Muslim : Do not say anything about air safety. Granted , that 's a staple , albeit morbid , topic for skittish fliers the world over , but you are not " the world over. " You are Muslims in America , post Sept. 11. You may not discuss air safety. Not even to say , " For criminy sake , Malik , take your Valium and shut up; flying is perfectly safe.

" One may conclude that it is " wrong " to execute individuals no matter what they may do -- no matter how many lives they take , no matter the pain they cause , no matter the heinous quality of their behavior and/or motivation , no matter the wanton evil they seek to perpetrate. Such beliefs have much in common with pacifistic views condemning the use of force in the international arena. I conclude , to the contrary , that it is " right " in certain specified circumstances to execute individuals duly convicted of particularly horrible acts. I would go further and say that it is " wrong " to let them live because letting such individuals live denigrates the condemnation by society for the acts in question. Providing free room and board along with comprehensive medical and dental care for life , albeit in confined quarters , seems a wholly inadequate punishment for certain heinous crimes . </conclude.v.1436><conclude.v.1437>This is a strong indicator that they may want to move on or are not interested in the other person or uncomfortable in the moment.

In the syllogism [ p. 340 ] of the first class , I conclude from the transcendental concept of the subject , which contains nothing manifold , the absolute unity of the subject itself , of which however I have no concept in this regard.

Our law dealing with non-competition covenants is based on whether such a covenant in whatever enterprise amounts to an unfair restraint on ordinary competition. In Duffner , Chief Judge Cracraft concluded the opinion by observing " that the enforcement of this covenant would do no more than prohibit ordinary competition. " 19 Ark. App. at 142 , 718 S.W.2d at 114. That inquiry is valid no matter what the enterprise may be that is subject to the non-competition covenant . </conclude.v.1440><conclude.v.1441>To illustrate , consider that the scriptures nowhere specifically address suicide.

Of course , consumer prices of imported American goods will not drop immediately as much as tariffs even after the FTA takes effect. It 's possible , for example , that separate taxes may be levied on imported goods , or importers may set their prices strategically high. Tariffs are normally imposed on the import price , so there naturally exists a gap between import and consumer prices -- plus importers tend to be cagey about the exact import price. Taking all that into account , the Chosun Ilbo studied possible price changes of some items to show how consumers could benefit . </conclude.v.1443><conclude.v.1444>The latest issue of Wine Business Monthly ( July 2009 ) featured a well-written , in-depth review of point-of-sale software for wineries.

Specifically , if a retaliatory strike was consistent with the principles of necessity and proportionality , it might be legal in extreme circumstances . </conclude.v.1445><conclude.v.1446>The Courts of Appeals have disagreed about whether the employee must then provide additional evidence of discrimination once he has shown that the employer 's stated reason is false. Six Courts of Appeals , including the Third , Sixth , Seventh , Eighth , Ninth , and Eleventh Circuits , contend that if the employee provides enough evidence that the employer 's stated reasons for the adverse employment action were false , the court or jury can conclude that the alleged discrimination occurred. In contrast , the First , Second , Fourth , Fifth , and D.C. Circuits have ruled that employees must show not only that the employer 's stated reason for its action was false , but also that the real reason was , in fact , discrimination . </conclude.v.1446><conclude.v.1447>7. Particularly in the context of the failure of the global Doha trade round , and given our support for a strengthening of relations among regional states , we conclude that bilateral and regional trade agreements involving Japan and South Korea are to be encouraged , provided that they do not prejudice economic access to local markets for the EU nor undermine any remaining prospects for the conclusion of a global trade agreement. We recommend that the Government should remain vigilant in assessing the implications of such agreements for the UK and the EU , and ensure that the EU maintains a similar stance.

This action comes hard on the heels of a July decision by an international arbitration tribunal , which ordered the government of Ecuador to pay Occidental a $ 75 million tax rebate. It is difficult to conclude that the government of Ecuador ' s move to terminate Occidental ' s contract is anything but retaliation for the unfavorable arbitral ruling. These actions send an alarming signal to foreign investors , but the true losers in this dispute are the people of Ecuador , who stand to benefit from development of the energy sector . </conclude.v.1453><conclude.v.1454>The end-of-year deadline for negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United States looks increasingly precarious , and contingency plans have been laid for more talks in January. The development came as the Prime Minister , John Howard , prepared to offer concessions in exchange for a large-scale liberalisation of US agriculture trade barriers. His remarks add weight to concerns that local content rules for new media will be traded away and that US drug companies will be granted more expensive medicines and changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. A spokesman for the Trade Minister , Mark Vaile , remained confident that the talks would conclude before year 's end , but conceded hotel rooms had been booked and plans laid for further talks in January.

The number of end matches identified for the cut ends was lower than for the torn ends ( 81 percent vs. 92 percent ) . Although no errors ( misidentifications ) were reported in the initial administration of the test , reevaluation of the test sets resulted in two misidentifications by different analysts. Based on these findings , it is recommended that an analyst proceed with caution when conducting end matches on cut pieces of duct tape. Jagged-edge cuts or ends resulting after the tape has been bunched up and then cut would have more points of comparison for aligning two pieces than straight or near-straight cuts . </conclude.v.1455><conclude.v.1456>On what basis is one to conclude that a policy to correct a market failure is as successful as possible ? The first consideration is whether government has any reason to intervene in a market : Is there evidence of a serious market failure to correct ? The second is whether government policy is at least improving market performance : Is it reducing the economic inefficiency , or " deadweight " loss , from market failure ? Of course , the policy could be an " expensive " success by generating benefits that exceed costs , but incurring excessive costs to obtain the benefits. Hence , the final consideration is whether government policy is optimal : Is it efficiently correcting the market failure and maximizing economic welfare ? </conclude.v.1456><conclude.v.1457>The FTA with Mexico has essentially been agreed upon.

And here 's the clincher - the two experts who originally said the flashes were gunfire can not refute the report.

We conclude that the claims made in the September dossier were , in all probability , well-founded on the basis of the intelligence then available , although , as we have already stated , we have concerns about the emphasis given to some of them. We further conclude that , in the absence of reliable evidence that intelligence personnel have either complained about or sought to distance themselves from the content of the dossier , allegations of politically inspired meddling can not credibly be established . </conclude.v.1461><conclude.v.1462>But we ca n't conclude it unless we 've got the combination of technical work being done to conclude the very difficult outstanding issues and the political will to drive it.

There is a lot of opportunity for political engagement going forward , hopefully what we can do is to give instruction through our leadership to our officials to task them with trying to conclude the detail that will enable the round to be concluded , and to continue to report progress to us as we engage at this level of political activity . </conclude.v.1462><conclude.v.1463>243.

Sehn asserts that if , as the trial court and we have held , the $ 100 , 000 was paid as consideration for the covenant not to compete , then Earthworks still owes him $ 100 , 000 for the physical assets of the corporation.

We conclude that South Korea has recorded major improvement in its human rights observance since the advent of democracy two decades ago. We welcome this. We further conclude that despite these significant improvements , several human rights concerns remain , such as the policing of demonstrations , the scope of free speech on the internet and the rights of migrant workers. However , we recognise that these issues also pose challenges to many other open societies , including the UK. We recommend that , in a spirit of partnership , the Government should continue to encourage South Korea to address human rights concerns and to ensure that human rights are safeguarded in new legislation and its implementation , prioritising the rights of migrant workers , the development of alternatives to military service , and reform of the National Security Law. We further recommend that the Government should update us on the steps which it is taking in these areas in its response to this Report.

Drawing from the model of a completely excitatory system , Freud concluded that nervous energy ( caused by excitation due to , say a , thought ) could only be discharged by some sort ofa MOTOR action. An outcome of this theory is that once you got a notion in the brain , it would be passed around the nervous system until you decided to face it and do something about it , or until it found a way to manifest itself , either in an unintended action , such as the famous Freudian slip , or in form of visual imagery , such as a dream . </conclude.v.1501><conclude.v.1502>In May 2004 , the United States launched negotiations for a free trade agreement with Colombia , Peru , and Ecuador , dubbed the U.S.-Andean Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) .

All this empathy talk is simply code word for letting justices write laws from the bench. The purpose of opposing Sonia Sotomayor is not to stop her because it ca n't be done. The purpose of opposing Sonia Sotomayor is to explain to the American people who Barack Obama is.

It has been the express intention of this author to highlight the salient issues within the prophetic time clock that focus upon this most volatile period of human history. Again , the sine qua non which introduces the inhabitants of the earth to the final week of apocalyptic history Daniel ' s 70th Week is the infamous Treaty with Death and Agreement with Hell , orchestrated by the Coming Prince with a vulnerable Israel. This very Coming Prince in the midst of the 70th Week of Daniel , through his religio-political machinations during the first 3 years of that fateful week , will himself in conjunction with the revival of the Israel ' s temple worship , usurp the title as Prince of the Covenant. This willful act will provoke such an outrage in Jewry that to surmise a wound in the head of this Usurper assassination is not out of the question; it is altogether likely , given the propensity of Antichrist ' s proximity to the Jews ' religion . </conclude.v.1519><conclude.v.1520>The system presented by Lamennais is almost identical with that of de Bonald. Our instruments of knowledge , namely sense , feeling , and reason , he says , are fallible. The rule of certitude therefore can only be external to man and it can consist only in the control of the individual senses , feelings , and reasoning by the testimony of the senses , feelings , and reason of all other men; their universal agreement is the rule of certitude. Hence , to avoid scepticism , we must begin with an act of faith preceding all reflection , since reflection pre-supposes the knowledge of some truth. This act of faith must have its criterion and rule in the common consent or agreement of all , in the general reason ( la raison g n rale ) . " Such is " , Lamennais concludes , " the law of human nature " , outside of which " there is no certitude , no language no society , no life " ( cf.

Johnson and Strunk were therefore not entitled to summary judgment on their contrary argument. Since the covenant was enforceable , Johnson and Strunk were not entitled to recover attorney fees. ASM did not move for summary judgment on the enforceability of Johnson 's covenant; thus , the case must be remanded to the trial court. Obviously , the one-year period during which Johnson 's activities were to be restricted has passed , and ASM is no longer entitled to the injunctive relief it sought , and for a while obtained , at the outset. But ASM 's claim for damages for breach of the covenant remains pending . </conclude.v.1521><conclude.v.1522>If NamesBeyond.Com determines in its sole discretion that your conduct violates the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy , NamesBeyond.Com may suspend , restrict , terminate , or take any other appropriate action with regard to your Services without any obligation to refund fees paid.

" Unless the flexible interpretation of " actual cost " applied by JMD in its 1998 opinion is adopted , the " actual cost " restrictions of section 4006 would conflict with , and therefore would be overridden by , the Attorney General 's authority under section 119 to contract for detention services " on any reasonable basis , " " [ n ] otwithstanding any other provision of law.

Communicating with the British public on this issue is notoriously difficult , particularly for the current Government , whose credibility on nuclear issues we recently measured as very low ( 2007 ) . The nuclear industry has done much to rehabilitate its Cold War past , but is still held back by the British scepticism for companies and private profit generation , particularly profits made out of public utilities , and by the growing obsession with risk aversion in all areas of life.

Dr Javier Maquirriain presented a study showing that older tennis players demonstrated x-ray evidence of early arthritic changes , but this did not correlate with symptoms or altered play. Dr Lynn Crosby reviewed the forces that occur in the shoulder with tennis play , and compared them with the estimated " safe " loads that total shoulder replacements could tolerate. He concluded that patients with severe shoulder arthritis should be counseled that return to unrestricted tennis play is not a goal of undergoing total shoulder replacement. Dr Cale Jacobs reported on a survey of doctors regarding tennis play after total shoulder replacement and found no consensus and minimal science to support any recommendations about play. The consensus of the discussion that followed was that the relief of pain following shoulder replacement may encourage players to play tennis again , but that there were increased risks of problems with the replacements , and that the level of tennis play may not be as high as wished . </conclude.v.1548><conclude.v.1549>The researchers present their findings , with data clearly set out in over 50 figures and tables , and discuss the implications for policy.

Ethanol competes for the same enzyme and is thus a sort of " antidote " for methanol poisoning. In aspartame , methanol is not present with ethanol , and thus may be processed more quickly and be more potent. Although this is true and would support the findings that methanol levels increase with excess use , no conclusive evidence has been found to show that an increase in methanol levels increases the levels of formic acid ( 3 ) . Therefore , in order to conclude that methanol makes aspartame unsafe , one would need to show that formic acid levels are increased in some way . </conclude.v.1550><conclude.v.1551>But before we rush to conclude the end is nigh , it is worth taking a closer look at the very specific dynamics of this market.

Article I of that agreement provided , Japan grants , and the United States of America accepts , the right , upon the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace and of this Treaty , to dispose United States land , air and sea forces in and about Japan. Such forces may be utilized to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East and to the security of Japan against armed attack from without , including assistance given at the express request of the Japanese Government . . . . As in the case of the proposed strategic framework agreement with Iraq , the treaty did not require or obligate the United States to use military force nor did it provide any explicit security commitment from the United States to Japan. But the security commitment was implied and understood by the parties to the agreement and hence the agreement was submitted to the Senate for approval as a treaty under Article II . </conclude.v.1564><conclude.v.1565>Jeff Green ended over a combined total of 15 , 000 miles of testing with the top reported lap time at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

It is a measure that , as other speakers have said , will indeed reinforce stability. The question I have with this Government guarantee is that , contrary to what some people have said , the big end of town will benefit , because it has a guarantee. I think Mr Foss and others said the shareholders of the larger Aussie-owned banks will benefit. Any institution that has a guarantee has greater stability and greater confidence , which is therefore seen by those who may invest in it that is , the shareholders. Generally in my world of market economics anyway that encourages an increase in the share price as a vote of confidence in a company or bank that holds that Government guarantee. I do not think we should delude ourselves by saying that the bill will not benefit shareholders and banks. Give me a break; of course it will. But the question is whether it will have a counterbalancing effect , because the bar is very high a BB credit-rating for the non-banking institutions that may not have the scale to meet the mark.

Dad is not happy with that answer. One day they go to a Tridentine Mass. Dad asks again : what does the priest hold in his hands after the Consecration ? The child answers : God ! His father asks : What is the difference ? The priest , says the child , genuflected just after the Consecration !

We further conclude that there is a real possibility that without a more equitable distribution of responsibility and risk , NATO 's effort will be further inhibited and its reputation as a military alliance , capable of undertaking out-of-area operations , seriously damaged. We recommend that the British Government should continue to exert pressure on NATO partners to remove national caveats and to fulfil their obligations. We further recommend that where NATO allies are unwilling to commit combat troops , they must be persuaded to fulfil their obligations in ways which nevertheless contribute to the overall ISAF effort , for example , by providing appropriate support including equipment and enhanced training for the Afghan National Army.

No additional substantive terms are required. The time and geographical limitations on the covenant remain intact. The only change is to narrow the class of BDO clients to which the covenant applies ( cf. , Karpinski v Ingrasci , supra [ narrowing the scope of the prohibitive post-employment activity ] ) . Moreover , to reject partial enforcement based solely on the extent of necessary revision of the contract resembles the now-discredited doctrine that invalidation of an entire restrictive covenant is required unless the invalid portion was so divisible that it could be mechanically severed , as with a " judicial blue pencil " . . . .

What we should be seeing today is not the Liberal Democrats making some footling technical point about the amendment 's drafting , but a constructive , helpful suggestion from them on how it might be improved.

Both sides need to make an agreement by the end of March to meet the June 30 deadline of the Bush administration 's trade promotion authority. With the impending deadline , the Korean government stressed the need to " discuss " and " seek out " compromise on all issues.

But you could not conclude that he is infinitely strong , or that there is nothing he can not lift. All you can conclude , given the evidence , is that he is strong enough to bench press 400 pounds. When we reason from effects to causes , we are only justified in inferring what is necessary to explain the effect. All that is necessary to explain the effect in the case of the man is that he is strong enough to lift 400 pounds. All that is necessary to explain the effects in the case of the designed universe ( assuming , for the sake of argument , that the universe was even designed ) is that there be some intelligent designer or designers behind it.

It may be , and usually is , just a string of bad luck. It is meaningless. It should not be noted or thought about and certainly not " corrected. " You can not correct such a " slump " in batting any more than you can in die throwing. A youth-baseball season is so short that a player could have a luck " slump " that lasts the entire season. Look at an all-star Major League position player 's entire season. I 'll bet you can find his worst stretch and that it will approach or exceed the total number of at bats a youth baseball player gets all season. ( There are about 30 to 75 plate appearances per player in a youth season. ) I 'll bet the typical all-star pro was not an all-star for his worst 30 plate appearances during his all-star season.

Borg , like Crossan and even more like Thiessen , is difficult to fit into the categories used to structure this paper. He is a member of the Jesus Seminar and sees Jesus as a subversive sage , but he also argues that Jesus was a radical social prophet and movement founder who espoused a fully here-and-now approach to eschatology and apocalyptic. However , Borg argues that all of these ideas about Jesus are firmly rooted in the notion of Jesus as a Spirit-Person , and this becomes the fundamental paradigm that he applies to Jesus. Thus , as a Spirit-Person Jesus was a visionary mystic , a channel through which God 's Spirit flowed to others , a healer , and a person with a deep personal relationship with God. Borg also highlights the fact that this notion of Jesus as a Spirit-Person also fits well with the charismatic experiences that abounded in the New Testament church. Finally , as a Spirit-Person , Borg 's Jesus is incredibly compassionate , and thus Borg 's focus on Jesus as a charismatic is used to downplay the moral teachings of Jesus . </conclude.v.1679><conclude.v.1680>We love sales data.

The court concluded that the facts failed to indicate the existence of a bona fide debt , even though the debt was repaid in full , with interest , within two years. The court also found no intent to repay the debt at the time it originated , apparently due to the taxpayer 's statements regarding the existence of collateral and his intent not to foreclose. It would appear that , based on Hitchins , Bhatia and Bergman , only direct loans from a shareholder to an S corporation create basis; restructuring related-party loans to create basis is generally ineffective.

The Court said that the ultimate inference from the facts established Builders ' allegations and failed to establish Czerwinski ' s impairment of collateral defense. Although Builders released the deed of trust on the office building as collateral in 1991 , the release did not violate an obligation under the Guarantee , and based on the evidence , Czerwinski was estopped from succeeding on a claim of impairment of collateral. By Czerwinski ' s use of the office building as collateral to secure other indebtedness starting in 1999 , Czerwinski was not deprived by Builders of preventing the loss protected by the Guarantee. Accordingly , giving Builders ( as the party against whom Czerwinski ' s summary judgment was entered ) the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible from the evidence the Court conclude the district court erred as a matter of law when it granted Czerwinski ' s motion for summary judgment. They therefore reversed that portion of the district court ' s order . </conclude.v.1686><conclude.v.1687>The goal of this meeting is for individual institutions , regional associations and the national office to come away with a better understanding of each other ' s expectations and challenges , and to find solutions to common problems that will allow us to function more effectively and efficiently at all levels.

In his own study , focusing on Middle East alliance behaviors during the Cold War , Walt concludes that arms transfers or foreign aid have relatively little impact on states ' alliance choices.

Challenge 21 sets out a series of social challenges that call for a vision of a new society. But it does not stop there. It concludes by calling for " patterns of co-operation that enable self-sustenance and self-determination " .

Meanwhile , the Left Front has threatened to ally itself with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) in order to bring down the UPA government.

For example , after seeing many people outside walking their dogs , one may observe that every dog that is a poodle is being walked by an elderly person. The person observing this pattern could inductively reason that poodles are owned exclusively by elderly people. This is by no means a method of proof for such a suspicion; in fact , in the real world it is a means by which people and things are stereotyped. A hypothesis based on inductive reasoning , can , however , lead to a more careful study of a situation. By inductive reasoning , in the example above , a viewer has formed a hypothesis that poodles are owned exclusively by elderly people. The observer could then conduct a more formal study based on this hypothesis and conclude that his hypothesis was either right , wrong , or only partially wrong . </conclude.v.1701><conclude.v.1702>recognising that the principle of free and unimpeded flow of goods and services should guide their relations , the Parties will enter into negotiations with a view to concluding agreements on economic co- operation , including trade and the establishment of a free trade area , investment , banking , industrial co- operation and labour , for the purpose of promoting beneficial economic relations , based on principles to be agreed upon , as well as on human development considerations on a regional basis.

In Karpinski v Ingrasci ( 28 NY2d , supra , at 51-52 ) , this Court expressly recognized and applied the judicial power to sever and grant partial enforcement for an overbroad employee restrictive covenant.

The order forbade only American Brands from making the reduced tar claims , and authorized only American Brands to use low tar descriptors only if accompanied by conspicuous disclosures of tar and nicotine content. The order can not reasonably be viewed as directing the use of the descriptors. Indeed , it prohibited their use unless certain conditions were met. No reference whatever is made to the descriptors light or lights , as used by [ Philip Morris ] . The plain facts , therefore , demonstrate no basis to conclude that lights is a like qualifying term to low in tar. Thus , even if other cigarette marketers read the published consent order , they could not reasonably conclude it specifically authorized any descriptors other than low tar or lower in tar. Nor could they conclude that the agreed resolution of the Commission 's claim against American Brands was anything other than the compromise of a disputed claim. It was not , and did not purport to be , a rule or regulation permitting the entire cigarette industry to use these or any other descriptors . </conclude.v.1717><conclude.v.1718>5.

The only issue of material fact that precluded summary judgment in defendant 's favor is plaintiff 's claim that the restrictive covenant was the product of fraudulent inducement. However , the Court finds that defendant has demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success on this point as to warrant preliminary injunctive relief. The record demonstrates that plaintiff was represented by counsel in his pre-employment dealings with CROG , that the terms of the Agreement were the product of negotiation between counsel , and that the employment agreement a writing that appears clear and complete on its face includes the restrictive covenant but makes no reference to the post-employment covenants of other CROG physicians ( unlike the agreement negotiated by Dr. Sara Scheid ) . Under these circumstances , the Court finds that plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on this claim , particularly with respect to demonstrating reasonable reliance on any alleged oral misrepresentations ( see e.g. Skillgames , LLC v.

What if instead of a covenant not to sue , the patent owner offers the defendant a license in order to resolve the dispute and the patent owner does not insist on marking ?

Although performance persistence exists , the authors conclude that it is difficult to choose the best CTA.

Considering this political puzzle , they also answer the related economic question of why some countries experience successful economic development and others do not. The authors construct a provocative theory on the selection of leaders and present specific formal models from which their central claims can be deduced. They show how political leaders allocate resources and how institutions for selecting leaders create incentives for leaders to pursue good and bad public policy. They also extend the model to explain the consequences of war on political survival. Throughout the book , they provide illustrations from history , ranging from ancient Sparta to Vichy France , and test the model against statistics gathered from cross-national data. The authors explain the political intuition underlying their theory in nontechnical language , reserving formal proofs for chapter appendixes.

From the Japanese perspective , Hayashi found the British not only willing participants in negotiations , but quite hospitable to Japanese suggestions. The failure of renewed British overtures to Russia convinced Britain 's Ambassador Lansdowne of the need for Japan 's support. Great Britain soon found Japan to be an agreeable and potentially useful partner that could check Russian ambitions in Asia. The Japanese realized they could not have agreements with both nations and they were reluctant to alienate England. The British had not only abstained from interfering with their victory at Shimonoseki , but they had been the first Western Power to renounce extraterritoriality in Japan.

Additionally , morphological and biological comparative analyses were conducted of T. saimirii-like and T. rangeli development forms from haemoculture and xenodiagnosis. Illustrations are given of blood trypomastigotes as well as of developing flagellates in triatomine and axenic culture. Mean values of blood trypomastigotes of T. saimirii differ statistically from those of T. rangeli in only two out of ten morphological characters measured , and ranges overlapped. The developing forms of T. saimrii-like parasites were essentially identical in both xenodiagnosis and haemoculture to those of T. rangeli. Trypanosomes confirmed as T. rangeli were transmitted to mice by the bites of the great majority of triatomines that fed on T. saimirii-like infected monkeys.

A final agreement is subject to the approval of the boards of Northwest and Continental , the Department of Justice and certain third parties . </conclude.v.1794><conclude.v.1795>We conclude that as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive , the President has the plenary constitutional power to detain and transfer prisoners captured in war. We also conclude that neither the GPW nor the Torture Convention restrict the President ' s legal authority to transfer prisoners captured in the Afghanistan conflict to third countries. Although the GPW places conditions on the transfer of POWs , neither al Qaeda nor Taliban prisoners are legally entitled to POW status , and hence there are no GPW conditions placed on their transfer. While the Torture Convention arguably might govern transfer of these prisoners , it does not apply extraterritorially. If detainees in the future are held within the territory of the United States , however , a more complex set of rules would apply . </conclude.v.1795><conclude.v.1796>31. We conclude that the Government must ensure that our armed forces are provided with the appropriate resources to undertake the tasks requested of them , particularly in an environment as challenging as Helmand. We further conclude that in spite of well-documented difficulties , British armed forces are now gradually beginning to create and sustain the conditions that make it possible to extend good governance and the rule of law in the most heavily populated areas of Helmand. We conclude that the support provided by additional equipment and by the US 'surge ' of troops in Helmand will be of considerable assistance , and is greatly to be welcomed. ( Paragraph 248 ) </conclude.v.1796><conclude.v.1797>Knox County - We granted this appeal to determine whether the dismissal of a legal malpractice complaint because it was untimely and for lack of standing constituted a " favorable termination , " which is a required element of a malicious prosecution cause of action. The Court of Appeals concluded that the plaintiffs ' malicious prosecution claim was based on a favorable termination of the legal malpractice action but granted summary judgment to one defendant after determining there was no genuine issue of material fact as to his involvement in the legal malpractice claim. After reviewing the record and applicable authority , we conclude that the plaintiffs ' cause of action for malicious prosecution was not based on a favorable termination because the underlying legal malpractice complaint was dismissed on procedural grounds that did not reflect on the merits. Since both defendants were entitled to summary judgment , the Court of Appeals ' judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part for the reasons stated in this opinion . </conclude.v.1797><conclude.v.1798>We would like to thank Dr Raja for his interest in our article on some inflammatory effects of coronary artery bypass surgery where we compared on- and off-pump operations in a randomized study. Our conclusion was that the difference between the two groups was surprisingly small; in fact the only major difference was in complement activation. All other measured inflammatory parameters including leukocyte counts , neutrophil activation , or IL-6 and IL-8 , did not show significant differences between groups. Therefore , we concluded that evaluated parameters suggested that the dark side ' of CPB may be overestimated and that the surgical trauma could be the more important contributing factor to the enhanced inflammatory response during cardiac surgery . </conclude.v.1798><conclude.v.1799>6.

There are , indeed , sometimes real slumps in performance at all levels of baseball. They do need to be corrected. What I am trying to say here is just that you must not be too quick to conclude that a player is in such a slump , or allow the player or his parents to draw such a conclusion. Do not use batting average or similar statistics to diagnose slumps. Rather analyze by the criteria of " Did the batter make good decisions about what pitches to swing at ? " and " Did he hit the ball hard a normal percentage of the time when he swung at good pitches ? " Wade Boggs was once asked about a " slump " he was in. He responded with words to the effect that , " I have been hitting the ball hard all along. The recent string of lesser success at getting hits is meaningless. All it reflects is that an unusually high percentage of my hard-hit balls were caught for outs. There is no performance slump , only a string of bad luck , and I will make absolutely no changes.

We conclude that although there had been some risk of a disjunction opening up between the evolution of the bilateral South Korean-US military relationship and the formal responsibilities of the wider UN Command for peace and security on the Korean peninsula , under UN Security Council Resolution 84 and the Armistice Agreement , the UN Commander and his team are making efforts to avoid this risk , and that this is to be welcomed. We recommend that the Government should participate actively in UN Command preparations for the transfer of operational wartime command to South Korea in 2012.

The global economic downturn is far from over , and few countries have dismantled the dangerous protectionist barriers they imposed in response to it , the World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy has stated. In remarks to the WTO 's 153 members , Lamy said that import penalties and other border restrictions are closing off markets and causing more difficulty in a time of depressed demand. While saying there was no " outbreak of high-intensity protectionism " to date , Lamy raised the possibility of an amplification of trade disputes , retaliatory restrictions , and sanctions if unfair barriers are kept in place. The WTO is analyzing economic stimulus measures to prop up banks , insurers , carmakers and other key sectors in developed markets , where the credit crisis began. Lamy , who attended the G8 summit in Italy last week where world leaders promised to work to conclude a new global free trade pact in 2010 , told WTO members that it is too early to count on an economic recovery . </conclude.v.1804><conclude.v.1805>This virtual class will meet online through d2l and will begin in Summer I and conclude at the end of Summer II.

The working conditions at the Complex for North Koreans need to be improved , but they are better than they are elsewhere in North Korea and the project enables important North-South contact , so we conclude that its operation and further expansion should be supported.

It is a proven teratogen in animals and in humans. The type of defects induced by hyperthermia in experimental animals are : anencephaly/exencephaly , encephalocele , microphthalmia , arthrogryposis , abdominal wall defects , limb deficiencies , embryonic death , and resorption. In humans it has been observed that infants prenatally exposed to hyperthermia presented with spina bifida , encephalocele , microphthalmia , micrognathia , external ear anomalies , cardiac defects , hypospadias , gastrointestinal defects , cleft lip and/or cleft palate , abdominal wall defects , diaphragmatic hernia , Hirschsprung disease , Mobius syndrome , oromandibular-limb hypogenesis spectrum , and spontaneous abortions. We describe an additional case with severe limb deficiencies whose mother had fever over 39 degrees C for 2 days in the second and in the fourth month of amenorrhoea. We conclude that , based on the degree of development of the humeri and the femora and the type of limb deficiencies , this case presents a disruption that most probably occurred in the fourth month of gestation . </conclude.v.1811><conclude.v.1812>But the authors say they could find no evidence that increasing flu vaccination coverage among people 65 and older lowered mortality rates.

As Justice Jackson explained in Youngstown Sheet &amp;Tube , when the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress , his authority is at its maximum. [ 1 ] When the President instead acts in absence of either a constitutional grant or denial of authority , he can only rely upon his own independent powers. [ 2 ] That means that if a President seeks to conclude an agreement on his own he is severely limited in what he can agree to.

In the same manner , we see here a scheme of religion and morality unlike and superior to all ideas of the 87human mind , equally impossible to have been discovered by the knowledge , as invented by the artifice of man; and , therefore , by the very same mode of reasoning , and with the same justice , we conclude , that it must derive its origin from the same omnipotent and omniscient Being . </conclude.v.1814><conclude.v.1815>Our clients say Conclude delivers innovative and practical software tools that deliver high value.

Our supreme court has recognized that covenants not to compete are a legitimate means of protecting a principal 's desire that a former employee not appropriate its customers. See Borden v.

[ 9 ] For example , the US Trade Representative delayed signing RTAs with Chile and New Zealand after the countries openly opposed the US war in Iraq. As President Bush tries to garner support for re-election in 2004 , it is increasingly unlikely that the US will make concessions on its massive agriculture subsidies in WTO negotiations , or conclude any controversial trade agreements. The passage of the Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) in August 2002 had a significant impact on US trade policy by making it easier for the President to negotiate and conclude RTAs. TPA , also known as fast track , grants the President the authority to directly negotiate trade agreements , bypassing the arduous task of gaining support from Congress. Critics of TPA , representing sectors of the economy that are traditionally reluctant to remove trade barriers such as agriculture , steel , automobile , and textiles , are wary of how much freedom TPA gives the President going into FTAA negotiations . </conclude.v.1825><conclude.v.1826>Accordingly , the delegations agreed to convene a working meeting in Singapore to draft an announcement and to begin work on a draft FTA text , with supporting papers to underpin each.

The New Zealand delegation was also informed that Singapore had shifted its goal from stimulating a P5 agreement to a renewed focus on an AFTA-CER free trade area. Singapore then proposed that the two prime ministers make a public announcement when they met in Auckland , timed for September 11 , 1999 , before it could be overshadowed by APEC events ( which it was anyway , because the East Timor crisis erupted ) .

Pearson argued that the trial court failed to properly perform its gatekeeper function and that Hein ' s methodology was suspect because he failed to include all relevant expenses. The Court said that not every attack on expert testimony amounts to a claim under Daubert/Schafersman and Pearson ' s motion in limine and objections during trial did not raise a DaubertlSchafersman issue. Pearson ' s assertion really is an attack on the factual basis of the opinion , a criticism that goes to its weight , not its admissibility. As the admission of expert testimony is ordinarily within the trial court ' s discretion , the Court concluded that the district court did not err in receiving Hein ' s opinions regarding damages over Pearson ' s objections . </conclude.v.1833><conclude.v.1834>If necessary , the two presidents should announce that they will extend START until they can conclude negotiations on the new START-plus agreement as allowed for in Article XVIII paragraph 2 of START , which allows the two parties to extend the treaty for a period of five years unless it is superseded before the expiration of that period by a subsequent agreement on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. </conclude.v.1834><conclude.v.1835>At this point the CIA also had received " several intelligence reports " alleging that Iraq wanted to buy uranium from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and from Somalia , as well as from Niger.

I track the development of Kant 's thought through two texts : Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime 1764 and Critique of Pure Reason 1781. My purpose is twofold. Firstly , I examine Kant 's strategy and possible allegiance to the maintenance of the patriarchal order in the context of enlightenment thought. Secondly I consider the implications of his strategy for the emergent concept of reason and the need for and possibility of retrieval.

That requires steps including the denuclearization of the peninsula , arms control between the two Koreas , normalization of diplomatic ties between the North and the United States and the North and Japan , and conclusion and guarantee of a peace agreement. Determining which to give priority to -- denuclearization or a peace framework -- is vital. Of course , it is possible to start talks on a peace framework by forming a separate forum even before North Korea dismantles its nuclear facilities. But a peace agreement should be concluded when North Korea dismantles its nuclear facilities and that has been verified to a considerable extent . </conclude.v.1864><conclude.v.1865>There will no doubt be more difficult tasks ahead of us.

Additionally , morphological and biological comparative analyses were conducted of T. saimirii-like and T. rangeli development forms from haemoculture and xenodiagnosis. Illustrations are given of blood trypomastigotes as well as of developing flagellates in triatomine and axenic culture. Mean values of blood trypomastigotes of T. saimirii differ statistically from those of T. rangeli in only two out of ten morphological characters measured , and ranges overlapped. The developing forms of T. saimrii-like parasites were essentially identical in both xenodiagnosis and haemoculture to those of T. rangeli. Trypanosomes confirmed as T. rangeli were transmitted to mice by the bites of the great majority of triatomines that fed on T. saimirii-like infected monkeys. We conclude that , based on morphology and on the development in triatomine bugs and haemoculture , T. saimirii should not be considered a distinct species. We therefore propose T. saimirii to be a junior synonym of T. rangeli </conclude.v.1866><conclude.v.1867>We could all refer to the 'myth of anabolic steroids ' , or the 'myth of HGH ' or the 'myth of the myth of PEDs'. Or we could conclude that scientific studies of the performance enhancing qualities of these metabolic hormones ( testosterone , HGH , IGF-1 , insulin , HCG , thyroid hormone ) remain incomplete , and will never be totally conclusive. What constitutes a PED depends on a multitude of factors including genetics , dose , synergistic drugs , and work-out effort. However , by using these drugs , an athlete introduces powerful metabolic hormones with myriad effects that alter basic physiological functions. How much enhancement , and how effective the enhancement depends on pharmacological , physiological , environmental , and genetic factors ? Odds say that the PEDs enhance measures of athletic performance thus giving an unfair advantage to the PED abuser; the evidence also indicates these hormones produce potentially dangerous side-effects . </conclude.v.1867><conclude.v.1868>Consequently , GBIO has concluded based on our research that no family under 500 FPL should suffer financial penalty as a result of the individual mandate at this time.

The two sides tried to conclude an eleventh-hour deal in two rounds of high-level talks. The free trade talks , which started last June , have been a success in small matters but failed to clinch a big deal.

Then , successive generations of heterosexuals were influenced towards having these negative attitudes both because of the same biological instinct , but also because of the cultural disapproval of homosexuality , conveyed in rules , laws , and verbal statements from others. This cultural influence has also affected many homosexuals to view their own homosexuality negatively. But it is not the case , for any of these homophobic persons , that the basis of their attitudes towards homosexuality is rational reasoning , or intellectual argumentation. Such endeavors have been added afterwards , to try to give the homophobia a nicer and more respectable framing. As seen , however , these attempts to argue intellectually against homosexuality are utter failures. Alas , If I am right about homophobia being emotionally based , then this realization , of the arguments being faulty , will not cause homophobes to change their attitudes.

Emperor Kojong and his court labored under the misplaced expectations that the United States supported Korea 's independence and neutrality and would use its " good offices " to mediate the growing dispute. The United States government however , had consistently maintained a non-committal stance with regards to Korea.

Although it might have been possible to raise a ripeness question in this appeal given the possibility that the Robertson litigation might ultimately conclude without an order or agreement requiring the return or destruction of all Nexsen Pruet  s internal documents , neither party addressed this issue and we express no opinion on it. We instead focus on the fact that the circumstances in this case involve the retention of documents in direct violation of a court order and that for no apparent reason , the court system was not asked to make a preliminary call regarding the retention of the policy manual until after the manual had been used in subsequent litigation . </conclude.v.1888><conclude.v.1889>I concluded , after looking through the two references to Galileo in the index and finding nothing of his ordeal with the church , that this is the way Stark dismisses such questions.

Firstly , we point out that the combat takes place only in some kinds of actions. Secondly , we examine Hume 's position by interpreting his famous statement " " Reason is the slave of passions " " . We find that Hume oversimplifies the relation between reason and passion and particularly he misconceives how reason could influence passions.

Reason , which was for other ages the mistress of theology , is now a prisoner of human will ( of which the various and destructive technologies of the last century bear testimony ) . For us she is merely a factfinder , clarifying language and identifying inconsistencies but able to say little about the ends toward which human freedom ought to be directed. As a consequence of this annulment , it is common for people of our time to conclude that reason can be used just as well to justify one moral opinion as another.

In such a battle , the Company ' s conclusion might be that you did not properly go through the complaint process about sexual harassment before quitting , and therefore you can ' t sue over the employer ' s failure to stop the harassment.

We therefore conclude that there were no genetic effects of flanker performance . </conclude.v.1914><conclude.v.1915>The special Strategic Alliance Committees of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees , which included elected and staff leaders of the two unions , held two days of discussions as part of its inaugural meeting that concluded Oct. 31 . </conclude.v.1915><conclude.v.1916>From this brief study , I conclude to say that in this book , God 's role , is the Son of God.

Relations since then have continued on the same steady path , especially as the United States , after the events of 9/11 , expressed a new strategic commitment to India. In 2005 , China and Pakistan signed a landmark Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation , whereby they committed that neither party will join any alliance or bloc which infringes upon the sovereignty , security and territorial integrity of either nation , while simultaneously positing that both parties would not conclude treaties of this nature with any 3rd party. </conclude.v.1917><conclude.v.1918>Perhaps the most important -- and controversial -- part of the president 's trip is an effort to conclude a groundbreaking agreement that would , for the first time , permit U.S. companies to sell civilian nuclear power reactors and technology to India , whose booming economy is starved for energy . </conclude.v.1918><conclude.v.1919>The two governments also concluded a new Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) and Action Plan regarding the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) in Paraguay.

These facts constitute a puzzle because debasements provide no additional inducements to bring coins to the mint. On theoretical and empirical grounds , the authors reject explanations based on by-tale circulation , nominal contracts , and sluggish price adjustment. They conclude that debasements pose a challenge to monetary economics. This article was originally published in the Journal of Economic History ( December 1996 , vol. 56 , no. 4 , pp. 789 808 ) .

The draft statement , expected to be delivered at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit in Singapore later this month , said the grouping was " ready to exercise all possible flexibility in order to accelerate the pace in negotiations. " WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said last month the goal of signing a new global commerce deal in 2010 was out of reach unless countries accelerated their negotiations.

This sanguine conclusion would be erroneous. The current conflict involves issues that go to the heart of the ANZUS alliance. It is not the result of inept diplomacy or miscommunication but of a growing divergence in the perspectives , objectives , and perceived security interests of the three signatories. The anti-nuclear policies of the Lange government merely brought into public view critical stresses within ANZUS. In so doing , those policies are giving impetus to a long-overdue reassessment of the 35-year-old military alliance.

In the second example , we could certainly conclude that the governor will win in Orange County , and perhaps we might be willing to conclude that the governor should be favored in similar counties , though the nature of the similarity may not , at first , be very apparent -- if geographical , demographical , political , and economic , and so on.

The majority of the tests showed no difference between the short-time and long-time smoke holders. A few of the tests showed minor differences , but the researchers concluded that this was simply a result of the participants holding their breath for a long time ( maybe due to lack of oxygen ) . They concluded this because when the participants held their breath for a long time , they did worse on these tests whether they were smoking pot or whether they were smoking a placebo ( a substance that looked and smelled like pot , but had no psychological or physical effects ) . </conclude.v.1960><conclude.v.1961>50.

But if we are going to look merely at the distinctions between Father and Son , and conclude from the very existence of those distinctions that God must be more than one person ( a triune being ) , then we must with those same distinctions further conclude that Jesus is not God at all. We realize this would be a false deduction because there are Scriptures that clearly declare Jesus to be God. This demonstrates that the mere existence of distinctions between Father and Son does not give us warrant in itself to understand those distinctions as eternal and personal distinctions within God 's very essence.

In the latter area , the IG Metall metalworkers ' union has already taken the initiative and demanded that Gesamtmetall conclude a new framework collective agreement providing that , from the first hour , all overtime should be compensated by additional free time ( currently the first 16 hours of overtime within a month can be compensated with money ) .

Trustees are benefitted by knowing early in the case which assets are to be administered and creditors are benefitted by a clear unequivocal deadline to file their objection. Many trustees in many districts comply with F.R.B.P. 4003 ( b ) . It is understandable that Chapter 7 trustees with high case loads may find it difficult to meet the 30-day deadline of F.R.B.P. 4003 ( b ) and may even find it difficult to announce at a meeting the date and time of any continued meeting. However , a general continuance policy is contrary to bankruptcy rules , the holding of the Supreme Court and this Circuit 's decision in Smith. If trustees believe the 30-day deadline is unworkable , that issue needs to be addressed to the rule makers , not used as a reason for circumventing the rule . </conclude.v.1971><conclude.v.1972>27.

It is reasoned that if the deity of the Son and the deity of the Father are the same personal deity , then Jesus ' communication to the Father was simply God talking to Himself. The simple fact that Jesus communicates with the Father and has a relationship with the Father does not de facto indicate that God is a Trinity of persons. We have to understand why Jesus communicates with the Father. While it could be due to the fact that God is tri-personal , is there compelling evidence to conclude so ? There are several reasons why Jesus ' communication with the Father should not be understood to indicate that God is a Trinity. We need to ask a few questions about the Biblical data before we can conclude why Jesus communicated with the Father . </conclude.v.1980><conclude.v.1981> It is unfortunate that the proceeding took so long to conclude , as copyright owners have continued to be harmed by China ' s practices during that time.

Behaviors of planets , biological factors , weather patterns , and " set theories " were understood from thousands of observations about things in nature. One such " scientist " concluded that the discovery of an eighth planet was clearly false because everything in nature happened in patterns of 7 ! Galileo 's contribution was significant because he was the first to define the elements that pertained to the nature of motion ( distance and time ) , defined the relationships of those different elements to each other ( when distance is divided time we get velocity ) , and thereby gave us both the methodology and a starting formula for natural science . </conclude.v.1985><conclude.v.1986>2.1 That You will not use any form of mass unsolicited electronic mail solicitations , news group postings , IRC posting or any other form of " spamming " as a means of promoting Your Website or for the purpose of directing or referring users to any websites owned , operated or controlled by Seek4Fitness.net.

Specifically , insofar as it is relevant to the issues in this case , we find no basis on which to conclude that the principles applicable to the determination of supervisory status established by section 7103 ( a ) ( 10 ) of the Statute are sufficiently unique to the Federal sector as to require us to ignore the experience gained in the private sector under section 2 ( 11 ) of the NLRA. Compare National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA , 826 F.2d 114 ( D.C. Cir. 1987 ) ( the court found that the policy that it was required to apply was unique to the public sector ) . Consequently , we adopt the principles used by the NLRB to determine supervisory status and will apply them in determining whether Carr is a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103 ( a ) ( 10 ) of the Statute.

Although the Arkansas statute at issue did not include direct references to the Book of Genesis or to the fundamentalist view that religion should be protected from science , the Supreme Court concluded that " the motivation of the [ Arkansas ] law was the same . . . : to suppress the teaching of a theory which , it was thought , 'denied ' the divine creation of man. " Edwards , 482 U.S. at 590 ( quoting Epperson , 393 U.S. at 109 ) ( Arkansas sought to prevent its teachers from discussing the theory of evolution as it is contrary to the belief of some regarding the Book of Genesis. ) . </conclude.v.1993><conclude.v.1994>While there is little legal authority on this issue the Court was persuaded by decisions from other jurisdictions holding that the existence of a fiduciary duty of an officer in a closely held corporation depends on the ability to exercise the status which creates it. Although Aon is not a closely held corporation , the Court found that this rule is applicable to the facts of the instant case. Pearson exercised low-level , local management authority in a large corporation. This authority was taken away from him in March 2001 , and at that point , he was simply one of hundreds of Aon vice presidents. At the time of Pearson ' s alleged breach , he had no involvement in the management and operation of the corporation beyond his own production and the Court concluded that Pearson owed no fiduciary duty to Aon at the time the alleged breach of the duty occurred. Thus , the Court ruled that the district court properly granted summary judgment in his favor on this claim . </conclude.v.1994><conclude.v.1995>As the agency and intervenor note , IBM 's proposal stated that it viewed the Air Fortress infrastructure requirements as not applying to IBM 's proposed ESL transmission equipment.

Inasmuch as all prophecies that have been fulfilled have been fulfilled literally , consistency demands that this method must be adopted for those portions of the prophetic Scriptures that , as yet , may be unfulfilled.

This argumentation is fallacious , since it confounds incomprehensibility with inconceivableness , superiority to reason with contradiction. The mind of a creature can not , indeed , grasp the inner nature of the mysterious truth , but it can express that truth by analogies; it can not fully understand the coherence and agreement of all that is contained in a mystery of faith , but it can refute successfully the objections which would make a mystery consist of mutually repugnant elements . </conclude.v.2031><conclude.v.2032>Other times you hear things like , " That was really wonderful what happened to her; I 'm sure that it was just meant to be.

We conclude that the British Council is correct to identify the potential for increase in the take-up of UK education services among South Koreans , especially in light of the Lee Administration 's push to enhance English language provision in South Korea 's state schools.

We further recommend that , inasmuch as resources allow , the British Council should seek to increase its British cultural promotion work in South Korea , since the existence of a modern and dynamic cultural profile will contribute to the attractiveness of the UK educational offer. Given South Korea 's history as an Olympic host nation and its strong showing at the 2008 Games , we recommend that the British Council should consider capitalising on the approach of the 2012 London Games as a means of giving focus to this objective.

After that , major innovations ended , and a tremendous population expansion occurred. The car , once modernized into a viable mass-market product , exploded onto the scene. The billions of cars since then have remained as a cohesive species , with only superficial and minor changes.

If one considers the first cause-related marketing venture by American Express in 1981 as the starting point of the recent intense interest in social marketing partnerships , it seems fair to conclude that most reported social alliances to date have been contractual alliances. The early American Express project to contribute to the restoration of the Statute of Liberty was a contractual arrangement with a fixed closing date. The dominance of the contractual form may be changing as commercial organizations see the strategic potential of social alliances and so develop longer term , more open-ended relationships. One example of a longer term alliance is the agreement recently signed between Coca-Cola and the Boys &amp;Girls Clubs of America ( BGC ) through which Coca-Cola will invest $ 60 million and significant staff time over ten years to help BCG increase the number of young people participating in its programs.

The Court 's conclusion resolves a conflict between the Circuit Courts of Appeals by finding that employees may not have to provide extra evidence of age discrimination in order to win a claim , as some of the courts have required.

Many agree that this question has never been answered satisfactorily and , with our modern understanding of the physical universe , is unnecessary. Spinoza proposed that physical things and mental things were just aspects ( or modes ) of the substance of the universe.

This is particularly true when it comes to providing subsidies in order to induce development. The public is being asked to pay for part of a project that it has not had a chance to compare with alternatives. And the public price tag on the current FCRC proposal seems likely to be large. After private negotiations , on February 18 , 2005 , the city and state signed a Memorandum Of Understanding ( MOU ) with FCRC that called for $ 200 million in public infrastructure expenditures. However , this relatively recent disclosure of the amount of public cash to be committed to the project fails to capture the whole picture. Good Jobs New York ' s experience tracking city and state economic development subsidies leads us to conclude that $ 200 million is a gross underestimation of the total cost.

But it takes a certain bias , contradicted by many facts , to conclude that this decision was taken on the basis of cowardice. It takes even worse bias to conclude that it was taken because of anti-Semitism.

At runtime , the SQL engine uses this information to determine which key to use for iteration. For example , assume there is a key on the LAST_NAME column in a table and one on the STATE column. Now assume that all people in the table live in New Mexico , Colorado , or Texas. Also , assume that most of the people do not have the same last name. If the SQL engine knows that there are more distinct values in the LAST_NAME column than there are in the STATE column , it can conclude that searching on the LAST_NAME key is probably going to require that it read fewer records. If the SQL engine does not know that LAST_NAME is more distinct than STATE , it has no way of knowing which key is more efficient for searching . </conclude.v.2099><conclude.v.2100>To judge from the notions expounded by theologians , one must conclude that God created most men simply with a view to crowding hell.

So it is not far-fetched to conclude that there is more to nature than what we observe in our own limited corner of it.

The hypothesis to be tested is whether all funds have the same mean returns , after adjusting for risk. This is the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is rejected , then it is possible to conclude that performance persistence exists. Tests were performed on the total data and also on sub-categories. The result of the analysis is that the differences in the means of the individual funds explain only a small part of the variation in the funds ' monthly returns. For all CTAs , this percentage of explanation is equal to 3 . For the sub-categories , the percentage is situated between 1 and 6 .

Instead , these scholars prefer to present Jesus as a prophet that more closely resembles our contemporary understanding of charismatic prophets. We will begin by looking at the work of Gaza Vermes , before moving to James Dunn 's comments. We will then briefly examine the writings of Graham Twelftree and Ellis Rivkin before commenting on Marcus Borg 's model of Jesus ( which fits this category , albeit awkwardly ) . Finally we will conclude with some critical reflection upon this perspective . </conclude.v.2163><conclude.v.2164>35. We conclude that the expansion of the stated justifications for the UK 's mission in Afghanistan since 2001 has made it more difficult for the Government to communicate the basic purpose of the mission and this risks undermining support for the mission both in the UK and in Afghanistan. We welcome the Government 's recognition that its strategy must be grounded in realistic objectives. However , it is not easy to see how this can be reconciled with the open-ended and wide-ranging series of objectives which form the current basis for UK effort in Afghanistan. We recommend that in the immediate future the Government should re-focus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security.

Then again , voters might not even recognize that the senator 's wife is talking about their personal hardships. But if they do n't , the ad loses its power. It seems necessary that we have an emotional reaction to Elizabeth Edwards ' illness and the shared pain of the loss of their son to receive the message about her husband 's private strength. Otherwise it 's just a wife saying nice things about her husband. Elizabeth Edwards is both a witness to his strength and proof of it . </conclude.v.2165><conclude.v.2166>If ratification is postponed , the next administration must conclude negotiations with the National Assembly , when it should put more effort into drafting strategies and creating a framework for national administration. To make matters worse , the agreement and other economic negotiations might not be high on the agenda of the next administration , and thus failure to reach a conclusion is possible. ( SITE NOTE : The FTA is high on the Lee agenda simply because of the high stakes involved and the protential benefits that would provide an economic stimulus to the economy. If it does get delayed , the US public will view the ROK-US FTA as something that is perhaps a mistake since the ROK itself does n't want it. The PR campaigns could prove disastrous in the US for the FTA passage through the US Congress . ) </conclude.v.2166><conclude.v.2167>We asked 456 California voters in all.

We conclude the allegations in Copeland ' s complaint together with his discovery responses constitute a sufficient showing Copeland " does not possess , and can not reasonably obtain , needed evidence " to establish reliance damages and , therefore , Baskin Robbins was entitled to summary judgment.

These principles are written by God in the natural law and are therefore accessible to human reason apart from special revelation; they are , according to Cooper , the plain dictates of that reason and common sense with which the common parent of men has informed the human bosom. Moreover , it is a satisfaction that these principles are also confirmed and impressed by the instructions , precepts , and examples given us in the sacred oracles. In this way , Cooper could conclude that reason and Scripture will forever sanctify America ' s Founding principles . </conclude.v.2169><conclude.v.2170>How can an owner determine that his pet rabbit is suffering from illness ? Keep in mind that rabbits often show few external signs of distress when they do suffer from illness or are in pain. Besides the rabbit ' s behavior in relation to food habits and attitude do change considerably. It may happen that at one fine morning you find that the rabbit is neither chewing nor showing any curiosity to food and drink. You have to conclude the reason of restlessness and all may take place due to the presence of any kind of disease. Once you notice these elusive signs , there are several simple diagnostic measures you can take to find out whether an emergency trip to your rabbit-experienced veterinarian is necessary . </conclude.v.2170><conclude.v.2171>Gentlemen , I will not be Tolerated only Celebrated , I 'm caring , fun , forgiving , kind , honest , loving , true , respectful and respected.

Under this construction , Tenet could wait , possibly for years , to conduct a reconciliation and then sue Patino for excess collections. Such an interpretation would circumvent public policy considerations underlying the statute of limitations. Such considerations include balancing the State 's interest in setting a reasonable time for plaintiffs to present claims with the countervailing interests of imposing finality and cutting off the pursuit of cases in which " the search for the truth may be seriously impaired by the loss of evidence , whether by death or disappearance of witnesses , fading memories , disappearance of documents or otherwise.

The Russian authorities have already announced that they do not wish to renew the Agreement as it stands. The EU must therefore give thought to the type of agreement it could conclude with Russia. In particular it should identify those parts of the current Agreement that remain relevant and could be incorporated in a future new agreement , as well as making new proposals. It will also be necessary to ensure that the roadmaps adopted for the four " common spaces " are effectively implemented . </conclude.v.2175><conclude.v.2176>If , as father contends , it violates Article I , section 20 , to treat divorced parents differently from married parents with regard to the obligation to support their 18- to 21-year-old children who are attending school , then it violates that provision to treat parents differently with regard to support for their children under 18 years of age. As far as we know , every state in the country distinguishes between divorced parents and married parents with regard to state involvement in decisions about the financial support of their children under the age of majority. It would be remarkable for us to conclude that the constitutional guarantee of equal treatment that is found in some form in most , if not all , state constitutions and in the federal constitution , is violated by such a difference in treatment.

It interprets various aspects of Russia ' s political and social-economic systems in its own way and will not accept the serious growth of Russia ' s role in the world.

We further conclude that drone attacks remain a high-risk strategy and must not become a substitute for the challenging yet vital task of building a Pakistani civilian government counter-terrorist capacity and army capable of conducting counter-insurgency operations and dealing with extremist threats.

Interestingly , however , we only find such communication after the incarnation. If the communication between Father and Son is a major reason why Trinitarians feel compelled to conclude that the Father and Son are two distinct and eternal persons , and yet the communication only begins after the incarnation when God became man , what compelling evidence is there to conclude that God is eternally Father and eternally Son ? If the communication began at a certain point in time , maybe the Son is not an eternal person in the Godhead. Maybe there is another explanation for the Father-Son distinction , and another explanation for the Son 's communication with the Father . </conclude.v.2186><conclude.v.2187>The authors conclude that based on the limited data available so far , there is some concern about the rate of MCM with topiramate when used in polytherapy regimens. The rate for topiramate monotherapy is well within the accepted range for other AEDs , but as for other drugs studied , its inclusion in polytherapy regimens seems to increase the risk. It is not clear whether this is due to interaction between the drugs , or a reflection of unidentified patient characteristics. More information from larger numbers of women in a range of registers is needed to allow appropriate counselling of those taking the drug. The authors note that topiramate has been licensed in the US for use in migraine prophylaxis , and monitoring of women prescribed the drug for this condition should also be encouraged . </conclude.v.2187><conclude.v.2188>The centerpiece of the meeting should be a robust board discussion around a key strategic , organizational decision ( examples : a strategic alliance , a new fees for services revenue opportunity , a move to a new site , adding or eliminating a core program ) .

There should be thoughtful preparation for this board discussion , possibly with two or three options presented in a concise presentation for the board to consider. The board might not be asked to make a decision at the meeting; this might be a decision that will take more time to decide. But the board should be engaged in understanding the matter and sharing their diversity of perspectives and expertise. The board chair should make sure that the conversation is inclusive. And the board chair should conclude the discussion by explaining the next steps and the timeframe in the process to address the strategic matter . </conclude.v.2188><conclude.v.2189>H0 : there is no difference between the two drugs on average.

Therefore , in order to avoid uncertainty or disagreement , the parties may wish to include in the countertrade agreement clauses indicating the extent of interdependence of obligations ( paragraphs 37-42 ) . Such clauses may address in particular the implications of the following problems in the completion of countertrade transactions : failure to conclude a supply contract as stipulated in the countertrade agreement ( paragraphs 43-48 ) , termination of a supply contract ( paragraphs 49-55 ) , failure to meet a payment obligation under a supply contract ( paragraphs 56-60 ) and failure to deliver goods under a supply contract ( paragraph 61 ) . </conclude.v.2190><conclude.v.2191>No. 5 : Do not talk sports.

Perhaps the world 's first study of leadership as it relates to heredity was conducted by Sir Francis Galton in 1869. Galton invented the science of eugenics , the study of hereditary improvement of the human race using selective breeding. Eugenics was " used to blame social ills on the perceived genetic traits of entire groups of people. Under Adolph Hitler , it was used to justify the murder of millions " ( Sorensen , PG ) . Clearly , Galton was on the wrong path; but there may be some truth to the idea that leadership skills and other personality traits are inheritable.

Our conclusion was based on the parameters that we investigated. We are aware that there is a severe limitation in this , because inflammation involves a massive activation of blood cells , receptors , cascade systems , and bioactive substances , of which we only investigated a small part. We can not draw conclusions on behalf of the parameters that we did not investigate. However , we believe that we included some of the crucial inflammation factors related to cardiac surgery. Dr Raja lists an abundance of possible reasons why CPB and cardioplegia theoretically may cause a major inflammatory response including postpump organ dysfunction. We agree that from a theoretical point of view this is the case , and we were surprised by the small differences we found between on- and off-pump surgeries. This is a case where the map and the terrain do not fit together , and we feel confident that the terrain is correct. Therefore , we conclude that based on our findings , other aspects of coronary artery bypass surgery than CPB , including the tissue trauma , may be as importantor maybe even more importantfor the whole body inflammation that is a part of the operation . </conclude.v.2197><conclude.v.2198>However , while the limping Doha Round was not brought up as an official topic of negotiation to avoid rising tensions , it was the subject that was weighing on everyone ' s minds.

The intraregional agreement among the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) - the ASEAN Free Trade Area ( AFTA ) - differs from the true FTA that Japan concluded. This is because ASEAN countries are developing countries , and AFTA is a quasi-FTA based on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) resolution ( except for authorized items and protections allowed for developing countries ) .

Not only ca n't we accurately compare players from different eras , we ca n't even compare players from the same era or from the same season. All we can do is draw imprecise conclusions that are full of variables that can not be controlled. This does n't mean we may be wrong if we conclude that in 2004 Carlos Delgado was a better player than Jason Giambi , but it does mean that even when two players have virtually the same offensive season , such as A.J.

From these words we should conclude that the Second Coming of Christ will look substantially different from the first one , during which He willingly humbled Himself and came in the semblance of an ordinary man. Then He lived in poverty and voluntarily suffered all kinds of humiliations. His Second Coming will also differ in purpose. First He came to give His soul for the salvation of many; then He will come to judge the world and recompense everyone according to his deeds.

You will notice that this belief has no basis at all in reason and that is what we call a superstition. If I sincerely believed such a kind of an entity without applying my mind to it to see whether there is any basis for this belief , I would be guilty of credulity. This is why pure faith ( fideism ) fails as an adequate test for truth. Unfortunately , there are many Christians who take a fideistic position ( that faith alone is the criterion for truth ) and therefore conclude that reason can have no place in the life of the Christians , at least where his 'spiritual ' life is concerned . </conclude.v.2268><conclude.v.2269>A lot has been written for Thanassis Veggos and more books and articles are yet to be published.

In Part IV , we apply the simple model to the U.S. tax system. The analysis reveals that current law , under which gains on sales of used capital are taxed at ordinary tax rates and buyers are allowed to depreciate their purchase cost , imposes a tax penalty on sales of used capital. That penalty , which is larger for long-lived property , increases the cost of capital and depresses investment. We identify three reforms that would eliminate the tax penalty in the simple model : zero taxation of capital gains with recapture of excess depreciation , zero taxation of capital gains with the seller 's basis carrying over to the buyer , and reduced tax rates on capital gains. In Part V , we discuss extensions to the model and conclude that basis carryover and reduced rates may be the preferable policies . </conclude.v.2270><conclude.v.2271>One day someone is going to write a great book about how this all happened.

The New Zealand delegation was also informed that Singapore had shifted its goal from stimulating a P5 agreement to a renewed focus on an AFTA-CER free trade area. Singapore then proposed that the two prime ministers make a public announcement when they met in Auckland , timed for 11 September 1999 before it could be overshadowed by APEC events ( which it was anyway , because the East Timor crisis erupted ) .

Of the 0.98 remaining , 95 of that ( i.e. 0.934 ) , or almost all is the inert gas argon. Carbon dioxide CO2 is a trace. It is less than 400ppm ( parts per million ) or 0.04 of all the atmosphere ( on a dry basis ) .

The Report was widely welcomed by member states as a useful input , for all stakeholders of the Organization , to improve key elements within the management and administrative areas of WIPO such as human resource policies and performance management. The recommendation of the Audit Committee that the secretariat develop an implementation plan and road map was supported. Several member states believed that while the Report would assist the Organization in improving important aspects related to WIPO ' s human resource management , adequate care and attention would need to be given to the multilateral nature of the Organization and its complex mandate which consisted of service provision to both the private sector and member states. Member states concluded that the proposal for implementing the recommendations of the Desk-to-Desk Assessment Final Report under an integrated Organizational Improvement Plan and the corresponding road map prepared by the secretariat would be reviewed by the Audit Committee and then be submitted to member states for their consideration and approval . </conclude.v.2289><conclude.v.2290>At the highest levels of both our governments , there is a true commitment to this process , which will give us the extra resolve needed to conclude a high-quality agreement in a timely fashion.

The employers deposed in an affidavit that ' a competent chemist may be able to analyse the chemical composition and the percentages of the chemicals therein '. This admission drove His Honour to conclude as he did. So , public policy favours the protection of trade secrets , confidential information and the like.

This would mean that 'reason ' is not an inherently sexist concept , mobilized for the oppression of women , but rather a concept essential to discourse that has been polarized by sexist societies. If it is agreeable to roughly equate 'reasonability ' with 'intelligibility ' , then it should be very clear that the contemporary philosopher 's relationship to reason is basic; Rooney 's concern about how to think about reason as something distinct from masculine tendency should be , for the most part , resolved . </conclude.v.2299><conclude.v.2300>Alicia H.

Its active role and interest in regional agreements can be explained by the boom in trade between the Asian countries , and the desirability of access to the US market. Singapore is also an attractive country for RTAs because it has a fairly open and transparent economy , with good opportunities for investment in telecommunications , e-commerce , finance , and other services - sectors which were previously protected by trade barriers. [ 10 ] The Singapore-US agreement has been heralded as a model for reducing barriers to investment and strengthening intellectual property rights. However , some NGOs that are particularly concerned with the environmental and economic impacts of deregulated investment argue that the agreement represents the primacy of the US 's interests over the welfare of Singapore.

In doing so , the Court abandoned the opposite precedent , which had been established in Illinois in Stutz v.

First , some studies derive an estimate as the residual of the world minus industrial country gains , providing possibly misleading and overly optimistic estimates for developing countries. Second , while most studies conclude that developing countries generally will gain , they do not take into account the lack of resilience and leverage individual countries have in exerting influence on world supply , demand or price. Third , revenue gains for developing countries have not included the additional technical and financial resources that would be needed for a robust and rapid supply response to price or demand changes in the world. Many of the world 's developing countries earn foreign exchange via exports of tree crops , the supply of which can not be increased significantly in the short run. Furthermore , these studies have not considered the lack of infrastructure , agribusiness equipment , land restrictions or climate. And , finally , economic methods used to estimate income gains or losses from the UR agreement have been derived from known responses of first world economies , not third world ones . </conclude.v.2347><conclude.v.2348>After television news , daily newspapers are the most influential information medium in America.

They start not from any true beginning , and truly they see nothing true in their imagination. Of those men the Philosopher says that it is not right to trouble about them , or to have business with them , saying , in the first book of Physics , that against him who denies the first postulate it is not right to dispute.

For example , when I decided that Y'hovah was probably the correct transliteration for God 's name in the Old Testament , I did not do so because Nehemia Gordon said so. I did so after looking through the Old Testament manuscripts myself , looking at the vowel points and carefully reasoning out what they likely were telling us were the original vowels.

These researchers discovered that of the 715 amino acids that comprise the FOXP2 protein , only three differences exist between the human and mouse protein , and only two amino acids differ between the human protein and that of the great apes. Based on an evolutionary perspective , the team concluded that because of the key role that the FOXP2 gene plays in development , it has been highly resistant to mutational change. Presumably , any mutation that alters its structure , and hence function , would be so disruptive to the development process that death would result. In other words , natural selection prevented mutations from occurring in the FOXP2 gene . </conclude.v.2352><conclude.v.2353>White Papers Both conclude that successful project managers need a mixture of the two.

Given the UK 's close relationship with both Afghanistan and Pakistan and its historical ties to the region ( which include the imposition of the Durand Line by British colonial administrators ) , we further conclude that the UK has a moral imperative to provide whatever diplomatic or practical support might be deemed appropriate by the relevant parties to assist them in finding ways of addressing the many problematic issues that are the Durand Line 's legacy.

During our visit we were struck by the sheer magnitude of the task confronting the UK. We conclude that there has been significant 'mission creep ' in the British deployment to Afghanistan , and that this has resulted in the British government being now committed to a wide range of objectives. We further conclude that in its response to this Report , the Government should set out , in unambiguous terms , its first and most important priority in Afghanistan.

The Russian-Chinese Treaty of July 2001 is clearly not the type of security treaty , commonly found throughout history , that is concluded in anticipation of impending war. Neither Russia nor China perceives a threat of imminent use of force by another state against itself or its vital interests , nor does either plan in the foreseeable future to use force on behalf of its own objectives. But the threats that impel states to seek allies are not limited to imminent crisis or war. Rather , they can take the shape of longer-term unfavorable trends in the distribution of capabilities , or of specific actions on the part of third parties that , if left unbalanced or unchallenged , could provoke an eventual choice between war or the surrender of vital interests. For both Russia and China , this form of threat is most clearly posed by the dominant global power , the United States . </conclude.v.2389><conclude.v.2390>Moral judgments are perceptions in the human mind.

To put this into the proper perspective , imagine that you 're told to figure out when a young child will turn 10 years old and are given the following tools : a tape measure and a pediatrician 's growth chart for children. You measure the subject child 's height , and consult the growth chart. From the growth chart , you find that children are , on average , the same height as the subject child when they are 5 years and 4 months of age. From this evidence , you conclude that the subject child is currently 5 years and 4 months old.

According to the Court , a judge or jury could reasonably conclude that the employer provided an untrue reason for the employment decision in order to cover up a discriminatory purpose , without considering any further indication of discrimination. Applying the standard in this case , the Court determined that the employee clearly made a prima facie case and provided sufficient evidence that the stated reason for his termination was false and , therefore , reversed the Fifth Circuit 's opinion and reinstated the jury 's verdict. The Court , however , also emphasized that there could be other cases in which showing that the employer 's explanation is false would not be enough to prove discrimination.

We concluded in Owens that trade secrets could be adequately protected by appropriate protective orders and a provision in the Secretary 's contract with the outside expert that would allow the employer an enforceable third-party beneficiary interest. Owens described the manner in which a trade secrets claim should be raised by an employer. It also set forth the procedure to be followed when an employer 's trade secrets claim is disputed by the Secretary , as well as the minimum requirements of an acceptable protective order.

Rep.

Moreover , to reject partial enforcement based solely on the extent of necessary revision of the contract resembles the nowdiscredited doctrine that invalidation of an entire restrictive covenant is required unless the invalid portion was so divisible that it could be mechanically severed , as with a " judicial blue pencil " ( see , Blake , op. cit. , at 681 ) . The Restatement ( Second ) of Contracts rejected that rigid requirement of strict divisibility before a covenant could be partially enforced ( see , Reporter 's Note , Restatement [ Second ] of Contracts 184 , at 32 ) .

The nonsolicitation agreement signed by Pearson did not prevent him from engaging in ordinary competition with Aon after leaving its employment. It only prevented him from business contacts with those customers with whom he had personal business dealings during the last 2 years of his employment with Aon. The agreement was properly focused on the legitimate purpose of protecting Aon ' s goodwill with its customers. Therefore , the Court concluded that the nonsolicitation agreement was reasonable in the sense that it is not injurious to the public , not greater than reasonably necessary to protect Aon ' s legitimate interest in retaining the goodwill of its customers with whom Pearson dealt personally , and not unduly harsh and oppressive on Pearson.

To allow a foreign creditor ( as regards provisions relating to the right of withdrawal , claims against the creditor for the supplier 's breaches , and early payment and rebates ) , to invoke the mode of implementation of the Directive prescribed by its own law rather than that of the consumer causes serious problems. In the first place , it exposes consumers to two different sets of mandatory rules without their even being aware of that fact. Secondly , it prevents consumers from obtaining local advice as regards the foreign mandatory rules. Thirdly , in the event of proceedings by the creditor in the consumer 's Member State , the parties would incur delay and considerable expense in arranging for experts on both sides conversant with the foreign law concerned to give evidence ( and possibly conflicting evidence ) of its content and effect.

They signalled a lack of resolve on NATO 's part; they resulted in serious military planning and preparation for such an option effectively being discontinued between August 1998 and April 1999; they hamstrung the Alliance 's diplomatic leverage for securing Milosevic 's compliance without recourse to military means; and they removed a critical element of uncertainty and danger from Milosevic 's assessment of the Alliance 's intentions. Moreover , they are likely to have given comfort to Milosevic and strengthened his hand on the domestic front , and so to have been a significant factor in encouraging the Serbian lite to continue to support him in defying NATO.

American wealth producers are being hurt prices of inputs are now rising faster than the prices of their products their ability to produce and to export has weakened.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins is involved in the control of apoptosis; overexpression of the proteins is associated with reduced apoptosis in solid tumors. Gautschi et al. ( p. 463 ) hypothesized that simultaneous inhibition of two closely related genes , bcl-2 and bcl-xL , might allow apoptosis to proceed. They tested this idea by treating cell lines from a variety of tumors with antisense oligonucleotide 4625 , which was designed to act against both of the genes. They found that oligonucleotide 4625 reduced both transcription and protein expression from the two genes and resulted in resumption of apoptosis in the cells tested. In mice , the oligonucleotide inhibited the growth of transplanted breast and colorectal tumors , with concurrent decreased bcl-2 and bcl-xL protein levels.

While we fully support IPSAs efforts to limit the possibility of MPs inappropriately channelling public funds , we are concerned that the principle may be interpreted to restrict MPs ' outside interests.

It is clear that the authority to evaluate employee performance is not specified as an indicia of supervisory status in section 7103 ( a ) ( 10 ) of the Statute.

There was considerable apprehension in Washington that the new government of Prime Minister Robert Hawke , under pressure from his party 's left wing , might seek a phase-out of American military installations. Quiet but uncompromising U.S. diplomacy convinced the Hawke government that such actions would place the future of ANZUS in jeopardy , and any inclinations to seek removal of the bases were at least temporarily abandoned.

OPINION HOLDS : The purpose of the bid bond is to provide liquidated damages if the successful bidder fails to enter into a contract for the project. Harper argues Fairfield never offered it a contract and the bid documents allow a bidder to withdraw its bid if a contract is not entered into within thirty days. Fairfield did not send Harper a contract because Harper did not fulfill its pre-contract responsibilities to seek minority participation as set forth in the bid documents. Harper ' s failure to fulfill pre-contract responsibilities , thus giving rise to a failure to enter into a contract , damaged Fairfield. Its proper remedy was to retain the bond as liquidated damages. We conclude Fairfield was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law . </conclude.v.2577><conclude.v.2578>" Looking at Japan , we conclude that the Government is right in principle to support Japan 's case for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council , given Japan 's economic strength , commitment to democracy and ability to make continuing contributions to the finances and work of the United Nations.

( p. 427 ) used a panel of three predefined biomarkers ( DNA ploidy , the bladder cancer antigen p300 , and G-actin ) to establish whether a profile based on these biomarkers could serve as a basis for risk stratification for bladder cancer in a longitudinal study of asymptomatic individuals in a Chinese cohort occupationally exposed to benzidine. The authors found that the risk of developing bladder cancer was approximately 19 times higher for workers if either DNA ploidy or p300 was positive than workers negative for both markers , but 81 times higher for workers when both the markers for DNA ploidy and p300 were positive. Nearly 90 of workers who developed bladder cancers were correctly stratified for more intensive screening.

State , 465 N.E.2d 169 , 170 ( Ind. 1984 ) ( emphasis added ) . In our view , a mere reckless disregard for the truth of information in a written instrument is inconsistent with an intent to deceive; one simply does not have the intent to deceive if one does not believe the information is false. To the extent that Final Instruction 6 suggests that a person making a representation with reckless disregard for its truth may have the intent to deceive , we conclude that it is not a proper statement of the law . </conclude.v.2593><conclude.v.2594>I assure you of my prayers for the continued success of the many worthy projects which your Orders have undertaken.

There will be syllogisms therefore which have no empirical premisses , and by means of which we conclude from something which we know to something else of which we have no concept , and to which , constrained by an inevitable illusion , we nevertheless attribute objective reality. As regards their result , such syllogisms are rather to be called sophistical than rational , although , as regards their origin , they may claim the latter name , because they are not purely fictitious or accidental , but products of the very nature of reason. They are sophistications , not of men , but of pure reason itself , from which even the wisest of men can not escape.

The current paper extends the meta-analysis by including studies published in the year 2000 , and by further evaluating the causes of heterogeneity among individual study results. Using a random effects model , clinical chorioamnionitis was significantly associated with both cerebral palsy ( RR 1.9 , 95 CI 1.5-2.5 ) and cPVL ( RR 2.6 , 95 CI 1.7-3.9 ) . Sources of heterogeneity included widely varying practices in the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis , different gestational age characteristics , and varying study year. We conclude that based on the available literature , chorioamnionitis is a risk factor for both cerebral palsy and cPVL . </conclude.v.2596><conclude.v.2597>Qtones shall be entitled to rely on the assumption that the person or entity responsible for the wireless account for mobile handset to which content is downloaded is responsible for all use of the Service through that wireless account.

Because the balance-sheet approach leads people to conclude that Israel is more of a good guy than a bad guy , or more of a good guy than Hamas or whomever it is opposing , there is a tendency to think it ought to be supported in whatever actions it happens to be taking at the moment. That may make emotional sense but not logical sense. The frequent reminders that the U.S. and Israel share democratic values lead people to forget that the policy issues chiefly concern Israeli policies that have nothing to do with defending democracy but instead have to do with such things as actions in occupied territories ( and also lead them to forget that every occupation is inherently undemocratic ) . Litanies of other interests that the United States and Israel share lead people to overlook the other matters -- perhaps less numerous , but still very important -- on which U.S. and Israeli interests diverge. The litanies tend to reinforce the unfortunate taboo against any discussion of divergence between US. and Israeli interests . </conclude.v.2599><conclude.v.2600> Prevalence of Lady Beetle Allergy. ( Abstract P274 : Nov. 11-12 , Noon 1 : 00 p.m. ) Jeremy Drelich , M.D. , and Kathleen Ruffing May , M.D. , Cumberland , Md. Asian lady beetles ( Harmonia axyridis ) , which have become household nuisances since their introduction into the United States in the latter half of the twentieth century , have been identified as triggers for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. Investigators found that 20 percent ( 90/456 ) of all patients tested for allergies in their practice were allergic to lady beetle. Authors conclude that skin test reactivity to the Asian lady beetle in rural Western Maryland is common and about as prevalent as cockroach and birch allergy and more common that Alternaria ( a type of fungi ) allergy . </conclude.v.2600><conclude.v.2601>" But how could this group of very smart people see the same intelligence members of Congress were considering and conclude such a program existed ?

Living as North Americans at the end of the twentieth century they have seen the way in which apocalyptic expectation and prophetic fervour can be manipulated by the State in order to engage in vicious acts of violence and terror around the globe. Apocalyptic expectations are used to fund Israeli terror against the Palestinians , and an appeal to prophesy is made to garner fundamentalist votes for a political party that makes war in the Middle East. In response to these things , the Seminar tries to offer a largely apolitical subversive sage , who ends up looking strikingly like a sophisticated , and somewhat counter-cultural ( or at least counter-cultural in the way that most middle-class liberals consider themselves to be counter-cultural ) , American university professor. We can therefore conclude that , despite their good intentions , the Jesus Seminar has largely thrown out the baby with the bath water when it comes to examining the historical Jesus. These neo-liberals , have made the same mistake that Schweitzer argued the liberals had made -- looking for Jesus , they have found their own reflection . </conclude.v.2603><conclude.v.2604>8.

If you know the current gestation , you can calculate the due date by subtracting the current gestation from the average length of a pregnancy and adding the result to the date of the ultrasound. For example , if you did an ultrasound on a pregnant woman on June 23 , 2002 and found a CRL of 31 millimeters , you would conclude that the pregnancy was 70 days gestation. If you subtract 70 days from 280 days , you get 210 days. If you add 210 days to June 23 , 2002 ( the date of the ultrasound ) you get a due date of January 19 , 2003 . </conclude.v.2606><conclude.v.2607>Elbow and wrist : The final session was devoted to the elbow and wrist.

Dr Michael Redler presented an overview of treatment of TFCC injuries of the wrist , with pearls for diagnosis and indications and techniques for surgical repair. Arthroscopic repair results in good outcomes if all the elements of the injury , including the ligament tears , are addressed.
