Christians who advocate the Death Penalty cite Matt. 10 : 29 ( " ... one sparrow shall not fall on the ground without your Father " ) , and Eph. 1 : 11 ( " ... God worketh all things after the counsel of his own will " ) , in order to deny that an " early hell " is possible . </deny.v.2><deny.v.3>Hence this same man of the Lord , St. Columba , when a few of the brethren would sometimes inquire into the matter , did not deny but that by some divine intuition , and through a wonderful expansion of his inner soul , he beheld the whole universe drawn together and laid open to his sight , as in one ray of the sun . </deny.v.3><deny.v.4>The complaint also said that as Mansfield walked to the grave , he laced his comments about Martinez -- a former town councilman -- with profanities. . . .If the allegations are true ( and the church denies them : " " We deny the allegations and Father Mansfield denies the plaintiff 's allegations " ) , then this is just awful behavior. Perhaps the priest felt he had a good theological reason for what he was doing. But under common standards of decency , this is just awful , and I think the rest of us are perfectly entitled to judge this man under the standards that we think are right . </deny.v.4><deny.v.5>Well , I personally , and most atheists I 've really discussed this with , really do n't believe that the Christian God makes any sense. I actively disbelieve in that one. I think the Bible is crazy and nonsensical , I think everything I 've ever been told about that god somehow contradicts something else about him , and I think I 'd have to be labotomized to start believing in him at all. Now , just because I 'm fairly certain that that one particular god is fictional , does n't mean that there could n't be some being out there that fits one of the definitions of " god. " So while I do n't firmly disbelieve in all gods , it would make absolute sense , as far as my opinions go , to deny the Christian Holy Spirit. I ca n't speak for the other atheists out there , but I 'm sure there are many more who hold a similar belief . </deny.v.5><deny.v.6>This , then , includes not only the nations and religions of heathen countries , but also such cults as the Jewish , Mormon , Unitarian , Universalist , which are found in Christian countries , but which do not have the true God and are outside of Christianity , because they either deny the Trinity altogether , or refuse to accept Christ as the Son of God and Savior of the World. For " he that has not the Son of God has not life " ( 1 John 5 : 12 ) . " Whoever abides not in the doctrines of Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ , has both the Father and the Son " ( II John 9 ) . " Whosoever denies the Son , the same has not the Father 1 John 2 : 23 ) . " He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent Him " ( John 5 : 23 ) . </deny.v.6><deny.v.7>Some may object that to allow the husband , but not the wife , to deny paternity constitutes discrimination on the basis of gender. But appearances are deceiving. The marital presumption itself is gender-based. It necessarily applies to the relationship between the husband and the off- spring , not the wife and the offspring. It is necessitated by the inherent ambiguity of the paternal link , as opposed to the maternal link , which is obvious by pregnancy and birth. The presumption establishes the biological and legal father-child relationships and support obligations in an efficient manner , without the need for cumbersome and costly genetic tests . </deny.v.7><deny.v.8>Simon Peter was almost certainly Superman , relative to me. He was so brave that even if it cost him his life , he knew he would never deny Jesus. He was so certain that although he no doubt offered some half-hearted prayers about it , he did not take with sufficient seriousness Jesus ' warning of his need to pray for God 's protection from this particular temptation. Not surprisingly , he fell . </deny.v.8><deny.v.9>We therefore reject the decrees of the so-called Council of the Vatican , which were promulgated July 18th , 1870 , concerning the infallibility and the universal Episcopate of the Bishop of Rome , decrees which are in contradiction with the faith of the ancient Church , and which destroy its ancient canonical constitution by attributing to the Pope the plentitude of ecclesiastical powers over all Dioceses and over all the faithful. By denial of this primatial jurisdiction we do not wish to deny the historical primacy which several Oecumenical ouncils and Fathers of the ancient Church have attributed to the Bishop of Rome by recognizing him as the Primus inter pares . </deny.v.9><deny.v.10>If , then , a time comes when a clergyman can no longer conscientiously teach something central to his church ' s doctrine ( such as the personal deity of Jesus ) which he has solemnly undertaken to teach , we urge that the only honourable course open to him is to resign any post he occupies as an accredited teacher of his church ... in the last resort ( i ) if a central Christian doctrine is at stake , ( ii ) if the clergyman concerned is not just questioning it but denying it , ( iii ) if he is not just passing through a temporary period of uncertainty but has reached a settled conviction , and ( iv ) if he refuses to resign , then we believe the bishop ( or other leader ) should seriously consider withdrawing his licence or permission to teach in the church.

The carrier would undoubtedly deny your claim on the grounds that it is for " special damages " and they were not on notice that there would be extra charges for rental of equipment , etc. if they missed the appointment time.

Do we also want to deny that person a voice in the medical treatment of his or her partner ? And do we really want all the worldly possessions of a deceased gay person to revert to the family who rejected them 30 years ago , instead of going to their partner of the last 20 years ? There are fundamental issues of justice and fairness here that can be resolved without a paradigm shift in our basic definition of marriage.

It 's done often , none the less. I took a case of a fit parent a few years back where the judge gave him physical custody of his children on the same day she gave legal custody to the Division. ( I was n't the attorney at that point ) . The parent became the " placement " and was still required to participate the unfit mother 's " case plan " to get legal custody back. It 's nuts. We did successfully challenge the order for him to pay for the mother 's services in that case. For a variety of reasons in that case , we held off on the fit parent hearing , and he eventually got legal custody.

If , as the commentator suggests , the faithful in North America believe that persons who publicly and grievously sin should be admitted to Holy Communion and that it would be wrong to deny to them the Sacrament , then effectively the faithful have been scandalized , that is , they have been led to forget or to disregard what the perennial discipline of the Church , beginning with Saint Paul 's admonition to the Corinthians , has always remembered and safeguarded. This is not the scandal to which can. 855 2 , of the Pio-Benedictine Code refers . </deny.v.16><deny.v.17>Life moves on , whether we act as cowards or heroes. Life has no other discipline to impose , if we would but realize it , than to accept life unquestioningly.

They did n't understand the human and the divine in Jesus and therefore they could not understand the human and the divine within themselves. Having seen the weakness of human nature , they thought they had to deny the divine nature that occasionally flashes forth even in the lowliest of human beings . </deny.v.21><deny.v.22>An illustration of this testing and sifting took place in the Jewish harvest , foreshadowing what we may expect here. The temple or sanctuary class at the first advent was represented by the Lord 's disciples , of whom he said , " Ye are clean , but not all [ of you ] "; and following the casting off of nominal Israel ( A.D. 33 ) came a severe testing to those representing God 's temple , the clean and the unclean , to separate [ C189 ] them. Peter was sifted , and almost failed ( Luke 22 : 31; Matt. 26 : 74 , 75; John 21 : 15-17 ); but , being " clean , " true at heart , he was enabled to come off victorious. Judas also was tested , and he proved to be unclean , willing to sell the truth for earthly advantage , to deny the Lord for money , even while kissing him in profession of love . </deny.v.22><deny.v.23>What was the greater sin ?

I take there to be only one kind of belief and explicitly deny that occurrent belief is a kind of belief. Also , he worries about how a belief can play any role without being activated , apparently endorsing the view that to become activated is to become occurrent ( p. 271 ) . But being activated does not necessarily mean being explicitly thought beliefs can play a role in reasoning , inquiry , recall , and association without coming to mind. Also , Rey rightly points out that the sustained and recurrent thought that p is evidence for believing that p , but he seems not to appreciate ( p. 272 ) that on my view , if the unpleasant belief is the belief that p , self-deception involves the avoidance of the sustained and recurrent thought that p. That is , self-deception suppresses the subjective evidence that one believes that p . </deny.v.25><deny.v.26>In other words , it ' s not impossible for men to control their urges. We need to stop thinking that men are so weak that they ' ll want to molest the first woman they see. We are not that weak. If a person has a problem with lust , that is an individual issue. Even when you say Muslim men are weak , you can not deny that many Muslim men blame their lustful behavior on women for ridiculous reasons . </deny.v.26><deny.v.27>Lastly , I don ' t believe secular society will be a utopian one , in fact I pointed that out in my previous post. Perfection is a dream , it has no bearing on reality. That said , I do think that secular societies are far better at achieving the goals humans commonly aspire to. Think of Sweden , Norway Finland etc. They are the most secular and have the lowest abortion rates , the lowest murder rates , the lowest teenage pregnancy rates the highest levels of education. It ' s ironic that in this sense , their lifestyles are the most Christian ! They are by no means utopian though ! If I ' m being arrogant I apologise. I also deal with humanity , and while I don ' t deny the nasty , I don ' t deny the good either. Secularism won ' t get rid of the nasty bits , but it will get rid of the nasty bits that religion gives rise to; which is progress . </deny.v.27><deny.v.28>But for us GenXers and Millenials , it is enough for the Church to preach the Gospel of Life , so that women in tough situations make the right choice. It seems crazy to us that a bishop would deny communion to a pro-abortion politician. NOT BECAUSE we think the Church should be pro-choice but rather because we think that overtly POLITICAL actions actually DIMINISH the Church ' s power to teach. Does that make us Liberal ?

( Because we want Nancy Pelosi to be held accountable like the rest of us ? ) </deny.v.28><deny.v.29>238Luther completely denied the sacrifice of the Lord 's Supper , necessarily then he denies that our Lord partook of a sacrifice whose existence he denied. After Luther another Protestant , John Faens , ( mentioned by Le Brun , Explic. de la messe , t. 3 , p. 546 ) wrote a whole treatise on the subject denying our Lord 's partaking.

To claim that because he is Emperor he may act against the will of God and of common justice , is to deny the very authority upon which his crown rests. </deny.v.32><deny.v.33>I completely disagree with point two. The extent to which something holds the possibility of , at some future time , being knowable , or becoming known ( something which in itself is most often unknowable until that future time ) is not necessarily important to whether or not someone is within intellectual rights to deny its existence. To claim such a thing is to hold what we consider knowledge , or what it means to know something , to some unattainable criteria of infallibility . </deny.v.33><deny.v.34>A case from the history texts : Mississippi Sen. Theodore Bilbo , a Democrat , was known as the " archangel of white supremacy. " But after a while his crude bigotry became so embarrassing to his colleagues that it was partially responsible for the effort to deny him his seat in 1947. Campaigning for reelection in 1946 , Bilbo said that " the way to keep the nigger from the polls is to see him the night before. " Glen Taylor , the liberal Democrat from Idaho , figured that was enough. He called for the Senate to investigate his colleague 's behavior because it " reflects seriously on the integrity of this body.

This is so not because Congress , in affording a facility , can subject it to any condition it pleases. It cannot. Congress may withhold all sorts of facilities for a better life , but if it affords them , it can not make them available in an obviously arbitrary way or exact surrender of freedoms unrelated to the purpose of the facilities. Congress surely can provide for certain clearly relevant qualifications of responsibility on the part of leaders of trade unions invoking the machinery of the Labor Management Relations Act. The essential question now is whether Congress may determine that membership of union officers in the Communist Party creates such an obvious hazard to the peace-promoting purposes of the Act that access to the machinery </deny.v.35><deny.v.36>In the mind of all men was a sense of moral law.

And , as soon as the child attains the use of reason , his parents teach him that Jesus is only a man and that God is not the Most Holy Trinity , without mentioning the Catholic Church or the Catholic religion. Therefore this child has neither heard of the Catholic Church or the Catholic religion nor had a chance to apply diligence in further learning about his own religion; nor can these dogmas be known by reason and the law upon the heart. </deny.v.38><deny.v.39>Sixth , the blatant Christian glosses count against a brilliant interpolator. Someone trying to sound like Josephus would hardly make the obvious blunders found in the TF that give away the game ( " he was the Christ , " if it indeed it is correct to call him a man , " and " he rose from the dead on the third day as foretold by the prophets " ) . Of course , it could be argued that the original interpolator 's account was more neutral , and that later blundering scribes added the obvious Christian glosses. But , as alluded to in point four , this would defeat the purpose of the entire effort. What possible purpose could a Christian have in interpolating such a neutral account about Jesus when no one was arguing that he did not exist or denying that he was believed to have done some impressive deeds ? And why unnecessarily use terms that cast so much doubt on your own creed ? ( such as the ambiguous term " paradoxa " ) . As noted by Professor Vermes , " [ i ] t would be meaningless to invent a testimony that did not support the belief of the interpolator.

Yes , I am denying that. Attachment to that hoary implication might incline you to insist that Ben believes the bridge is closed. Yet it ' s not clear that we need to accept that. Maybe knowledge involves something like a capacity and belief something like a tendency : One might have the capacity without the tendency. [ 15 ] I know how to juggle six balls if I have the capacity to do so , even if I usually fail; perhaps also I know that the capital of Burkina Faso is Ouagadougou even if I usually stumble in actual recall; and , more to the point , Juliet knows that the races are intellectually equal even if her black students are right in saying she doesn ' t quite believe it : She has the capacity to respond knowledgeably , even if doesn ' t usually do so . </deny.v.40><deny.v.41>Repression. It is similar to suppression in that a thought or feeling or emotion is not expressed -- but in repression , we deny that the element even exists. The repressed element might come into our conscious awareness and then be denied , or it might be prohibited from our awareness at all ( as in the action of the Freudian " dream censor " ); it is blocked because it has been judged it to be potentially disruptive to our psychological stability or our self-image. Obviously , both the stability and the self-image are illusory , because they are based on a rejection of the reality of our own thoughts , feelings , and emotions . </deny.v.41><deny.v.42>Since we published this column , Comair have sent us a press release strongly denying their involvement in any collusion.

To try and deny that both wars took , and have taken , a heavy toll on those who were thrust in those conflicts is simply absurd.

And I hope that you and I condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their Presidency to Protestants and those which deny it to Catholics.

Their courage has forced society to face painful realities about trusted community leaders , established organizations , and cherished institutions. Despite the tendency to deny the existence and extent of child abuse in institutions and organizations , it is not surprising that society has been slow to acknowledge such acts of abuse. Until a proper understanding is achieved , most community members would seek to disavow or minimize the events because the institution in question has been sanctioned by them to serve an important and desired function. Moreover , some forms of abuse are readily disguised within the function of the institution itself , thus confusing abuse with its proper role , such as discipline , childcare , and socialization. On the other hand , the overwhelming evidence of such widespread abuses and harm to the lives of many speaks to the need for greater public understanding and action . </deny.v.45><deny.v.46>We deny that the New Testament teaches two classes of Christians : ( 1 ) those who have accepted Christ as Savior but remain in a static state of immaturity or carnality ( so-called " secret believers " or " carnal Christians " ) and ( 2 ) those who have gone on to obey Christ as Lord and thereby then become His " spiritual disciples.

I have n't wanted the humiliation of dragging my cross to Golgotha and sacrificing my self-centeredness , self-righteousness and selfish ambition. I 've wanted to avoid discomfort , not voluntarily embrace it for you. And yet you said , " If anyone would come after me , he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me " follow the Lord who was crucified for me. You leave me no option. It is so basic that you even drive home the nails by placing the statement in three Gospels. You want the best for me and from me. It 's scary. I recoil from it as if I had touched red-hot metal. And yet , Lord , you 've promised resurrection the other side of death to selfishness. And how can I hold back when you 've sacrificed everything for me ? Moreover , you gave your all for me when I deserve nothing , while you my Creator , my Redeemer , the supreme Ruler and the God of perfection deserve everything . </deny.v.47><deny.v.48>Wagner apologists have had to acknowledge Wagner 's racism , since there is no way to deny something that was so well documented by Wagner himself. Recognizing that they can not defend him on that ground , they then deny that any racism is expressed in his " music dramas " . Some , after peeling away the veneer of fairy tales , are horrified at what they discover in the dramas , as was Thomas Mann in 1940. So , they then try to defend the music by divorcing it from the drama , which is completely contrary to the mandate of the composer 's Gesamtkunstwerke [ Total Works of Art ] , which will be respected here. They naively claim that music alone is amoral , i.e. , that it can not communicate any moral or political messages. As such , the operas are stripped down to mere tone relations in order to prevent and insulate them from the identification of possible racist propaganda . </deny.v.48><deny.v.49>The text of the canon is clear. Those under the imposed or declared ecclesiastical penalties of interdict and excommunication , and those who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be given Holy Communion. The text makes it clear that the Church has the responsibility to deny Holy Communion to those who are known to be under the imposed or declared penalties of excommunication and interdict , and to those who are known to persist obstinately in manifest grave sin. Although the text does not state so explicitly , it is clear that the Church 's responsibility is carried out by the minister of Holy Communion . </deny.v.49><deny.v.50>No , no , no.

The Cartesian bifurcation has never been solved. None of the prevalent answers really provide the complete solution. How do I know that something is out there ? Not because of the neurons in my brain reactingneurons and consciousness are not the same thing. There is a very big leap between them.

This is the function of conscious mind. Since the " logic circuit " is natural mind principle of operation , detection of error is not within its function. It simply integrates premises given. Since it performs in this manner by natural law , it is " infallible. " If understood , it is the greatest error detector available to any and every individual.

One act involves the restriction of an irreversible operation on a defenceless child , the other is an act of theft against the wealth of grown adults. Not the same thing at all. Head meets brick wall. To the socialist concerned you would make two arguments. ( 1 ) A 90 tax rate is theft. ( 2 ) A 90 tax rate will lead to all the rich people leaving. Now , assuming the socialist had a half a brain , he would recognise these as separate arguments. He would deny your premises with regard to ( i ) , but might be persuaded with regard to ( ii ) .

In Sacred Scripture are found elements , both implicit and explicit , which allow a vision of the human being and the world which has exceptional philosophical density. Christians have come to an ever deeper awareness of the wealth to be found in the sacred text. It is there that we learn that what we experience is not absolute : it is neither uncreated nor self-generating. God alone is the Absolute. From the Bible there emerges also a vision of man as imago Dei. This vision offers indications regarding man 's life , his freedom and the immortality of the human spirit. Since the created world is not self-sufficient , every illusion of autonomy which would deny the essential dependence on God of every creaturethe human being includedleads to dramatic situations which subvert the rational search for the harmony and the meaning of human life . </deny.v.63><deny.v.64>" And our cases long have recognized that whether a ruling is 'final ' within the meaning of 1291 is frequently so close a question that decision of that issue either way can be supported with equally forceful arguments , and that it is impossible to devise a formula to resolve all marginal cases coming within what might well be called the 'twilight zone ' of finality.

But God , or good , is omnipresent , so the apparent absence of good ( evil ) is unreal. It is only an appearance of evil , just as the moving sun was an appearance. You need not wait to discuss this matter of evil or to understand fully all about why you deny it , but begin to practice the denials in an unprejudiced way , and see how marvelously they will , after a while , deliver you from some of the so-called evils of your daily life . </deny.v.67><deny.v.68>The believers of 'Advaita ' ( a form of Hindu philosophy ) admit the existence of supreme God. However they say that He is everything in the universe and all that we see is an illusion and that everything in this world will appear and disappear like bubbles in the ocean and like a dream that we see. If everything we see is illusory , can the truth which is God be proved on the basis of falsehood which is an illusion ? Can falsehood result in truth ? It is not possible. One who maintains that everything is false will try to establish his own word as truth. If everything is false , then what one tries to establish firmly as truth also must be false. In attempting to elevate the Supreme Being , such people foolishly deny what is existing and end up showing that the omnipresent God is nowhere present . </deny.v.68><deny.v.69>And where has it ever been said that the choice is simple ?

( And the causes can of course be quite variable too. ) Most found denying themselves difficult and a long process , often marked with some failures along the way.

According to Larry Arnhart ( First Things , November 2000 ) , " Most of the opposition to Darwinian theory ... is motivated not by a purely intellectual concern for the truth or falsity of the theory , but by a deep fear that Darwinism denies the foundations of traditional morality by denying any appeal to the transcendent norms of God 's moral law. " In a forthcoming response to an article of mine in American Outlook ( November 2000 ) , Michael Shermer takes an identical line : " It is no coincidence that almost all of the evolution deniers are Christians who believe that if God did not personally intervene in the development of life on earth , then they have no basis for their belief; indeed , that there can be no basis to any morality or meaning of life.

Because the nineteenth-century English novel has considerable salience in highlighting vexing questions of voice , agency , and representation , and because these questions also dominate analysis of the textual presence of converts -- a presence at times so elusive and impalpable as to turn converts into abstractions -- a methodological convergence between the representation of converts and that of colonial subjects is not surprising. In a subtle Bakhtinian reading of how the novel form employs complex , multivocal systems only to deny them , Graham Pechey has argued that , though dialogism in the English novel exists as the liberal incorporation of hegemonic and subaltern voices , it finally affirms only the voice of the dominant subject as the voice of active agency.25 The colonized , he argues , are never the second person in dialogue; in the bulk of nineteenth-century English novels , as Edward Said too has shown in Culture and Imperialism , the peripheral places occupied by colonial subjects are a mute testimony not only to the imperial reach but also to an imperializing literary form.26 </deny.v.83><deny.v.84>Many people have been tormented by fear in thinking that they have denied the Lord because of some type of sin in their life.

It seems that conditional abjurations were only necessary for such persons whose baptisms were doubtfully valid.

Most philosophers now will agree that when we talk about the concept of truth we are talking about the truth predicate of a language , although some will treat it as a genuine semantic predicate which ascribes the property of truth to what instantiates it and some will deny it as a genuine predicate or refuse to admit of the predicate any substantive property . </deny.v.104><deny.v.105>When divided into groups based on their level of defensiveness , high-defense subjects , who tend to deny problems , disavow unseemly feelings and impulses , and avoid threatening ideas , also performed significantly below chance when they used the pop strategy.

Since the biological link between mother and child is obvious by pregnancy and birth , this case hardly arises save in the rare instance of baby switching. Unlike the husband 's right to deny his paternity , the wife 's entitlement to do so furthers no other legitimate right or interest.

It is not necessary to challenge the proposition that , as a general rule , the state , having power to deny a privilege altogether , may grant it upon such conditions as it sees fit to impose. But the power of the state in that respect is not unlimited , and one of the limitations is that it may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of Constitutional rights. If the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right [ such as the right to travel made possible by a passport ] as a condition of its favor , it may , in like manner , compel a surrender of all. It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out or existence. </deny.v.185><deny.v.186>Where the mother enjoys the right to rebut the legitimacy presumption , marital children who are not the biological offspring of the husband have no remedy to avert their bastardization and no protection against a mother seeking to terminate the legal and de facto relationship with their presumed father , unless of course they are able to successfully invoke one of the legal doctrines discussed above.

Well , what are national borders but segregation ? According to modern Christianity , God despises anything that divides people into us and them because we ' re all equal. Well , that ' s exactly what national borders do. In fact , that ' s the entire reason for national borders to divide people into us and them. If Jim Crow and apartheid were hate , then so is opposition to immigration.

It makes sense not to deny this , since a large percentage of the people who are thoughtful with regard to their faith are going to reach that conclusion on their own.

He was motivated also by the same unfounded fears , thinking that because Rebekah was beautiful , the men of the place might kill him in order to get his wife.

It is also the deathblow to all specific Christian instruction. For , if a Protestant Reformed person would subscribe to this declaration , he would thereby most emphatically deny the confession of his own church; disavow the very principles for the maintenance of which we were expelled from the fellowship of the Christian Reformed Church.

So the question is : how much useless torture is justifiable in these troubled times ? The authors concede that their modest proposal may not lead to torture that saves a life. But they do not tell you the logical corollary : it must and will lead to torture , and therefore by their own reasoning it must and will lead to torture that does not save a life.

It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the revelation contained in the Bible is axiomatic , rather transcendentally necessary , else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience ( see also epistemic foundationalism ) . To a non-believer who rejects the notion that the truth about God , the world and themselves can be found within the Bible , Christian theology literally has nothing to say; however , some presuppositional apologists believe that such a condition is impossible , claiming that all people actually believe in God , whether they admit or deny it . </deny.v.270><deny.v.271>Professed Christians are bound to maintain a life consistent with their profession.

It is called EMTALA. So the arguement that this is a way to deny care is false. This is true whether you are a for-profit or not for profit. Also , the main difference between a for profit vs. not for profit is that the not for profits DO N'T PAY TAXES ! Look at what taxes the for profits pay , millions of dollars anully , but they recieve NO charity reimbursement for the uninsured they have to see. All hospitals , regardless of type have huge payrolls. Nurses , aides , lab techs , secretary 's , people to do thousands of pages of paperwork so that they will get some payment from insurance companys or medicare. The hospital where I work writes off over 4 million dollars a month in bad debt and uninsured discounts. Yes health care is big business.

These traditions were recounted in the writings of the church fathers and the first official church history , Ecclesiastical History , written by the historian Eusebius in A.D. 325. Although we can not at this time verify every detail historically , the universal belief of the early Christian writers was that each of the apostles had faced martyrdom faithfully without denying their faith in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Another great leader of the early Church was Polycarp who was martyred at the age of 86 by being burned alive before an audience of thousands in the amphitheatre in the city of Smyrna. When the Roman governor demanded that the aged bishop deny his faith in Jesus and worship the emperor to save his life. Polycarp refused the invitation to save his life by blaspheming Christ and denying his faith in these timeless words , " Eighty and six years have I served Him , and He never did me wrong; and how can I now blaspheme my King who has saved me ?

Under Texas law , this is sufficient for an arrest. Being in possession was enough to intimidate me into taking a plea agreement.

Unfortunately there is nothing more obstructive to 'woman-centred care ' than disinterested authority combined with the midwife 's buffering effects of denying responsibility. There is a distinction between what is logical and what is psychological. On a purely quantitative basis , it could be perceived as worse to deny all women a 'home birth ' , than it is to deny one woman the experience. Yet the latter is psychologically the more difficult act. In relation to numbers , diffusion of responsibility and the physical barrier of protocols and patterns of care neutralise the moral sense.

Yet , in truth , there is no remedy except to throw over the axiom of parallels and to work out a non-Euclidean geometry. Something similar is required to-day in economics.

Nowadays the existence of modern genetic testing obviates this old approach to the problem of conflicting presumptions when a court is to determine paternity. Nowadays , genetic testing makes it possible in most cases to resolve competing claims to paternity.

" If we say that we have no sin ( i. e. , no principle of sin ) , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us " ( 1 Jn. 1 : 8 ) .

Believing the Representation Problem to be insoluble for realists , they conclude realism must be false. In this article I review a number of anti-realist semantic challenges to realism all based on the Representation Problem : ( i ) The Manifestation Challenge claims the cognitive and linguistic behaviour of an agent provides no evidence that realist mind/world links exist. ( ii ) The Language Acquisition Challenge claims that if such links were to exist language learning would be impossible. ( iii ) The Brain in a Vat Challenge holds that realism entails both that we could be massively deluded ( " Brains in a Vat " ) and that if we were we could not even form the belief that we were. ( iv ) The Conceptual Relativity Challenge alleges it is senseless to ask what the world contains independently of how we conceive of it. The objects that exist depend on the conceptual scheme used to classify them. ( v ) The Model-Theoretic Challenge contends realist must either hold that an ideal theory passing every conceivable test could be false or that perfectly determinate terms like ' cat ' are massively indeterminate. Both alternatives are absurd according to anti-realists . </deny.v.320><deny.v.321>What is the big deal if it was one crowing or two ?

Men who assert biologically based parental rights in children born into an extant marriages are seeking to derive a benefit from commission of an adulterous act , which alone may by judged not to merit recognition as a matter of state policy. There is a long tradition of denying such fathers standing to rebut the marital presumption. On the other hand , there is no justification for letting a biological father escape the financial responsibilities of parenthood based on the fact that conception results from an extra-marital liaison , if this is deemed to be in the child 's and the state 's interest. In short , there is justification for not granting extra-marital biological fathers superior rights to a child born into an extant marriage , but to hold them liable for support , should the presumed father disclaim paternity . </deny.v.325><deny.v.326>Of course they were overstepping JimD , I do n't deny that , the point is , they would n't have had to do ANYTHING if CG was n't resorting to slime ball campaign tactics.

You need at least one receptive and one expressive mode of communication to work in order to be able to reach the outside world. Amanda can hear and read , and she can write. She is a successful communicator. However , there are individuals who may have difficulty with all the modalities. And there are individuals in betweeen.

In the Judeo-Christian societies I think many people would find it hard to express unalloyed pride in such achievements if they were achieved at the expense of jailing dissenters , curbing free speech and denying the rights of individuals to justice and the law.

More importantly , Florio seems to be translating " refusal to own up to it " as " denial " - something Lynch clearly never did. He kept his mouth shut - again , completely legal , and never attempting to deny the accusations - and let the legal process play out. Lynch should n't take flack for keeping his mouth shut , because he had every right to do so.

Next , did the State s decision protect a compelling state interest ? The Court finds that there is clearly an infringement on the woman s right to free exercise because she was placed in the position of having to choose between the benefits and her religious tenants. Receipt of the unemployment benefits should not be conditional on certain religious decisions. The State has no compelling reason for denying the woman benefits.

On the other hand , they refuse to go with the German rationalists in altogether denying their inspiration. They still claim to accept the Scriptures as containing a Revelation from God. But may they not hold their own peculiar views with regard to the origin and date and literary structure of the Bible without endangering either their own faith or the faith of Christians ?

One objection laid against the affirmation that human beings can not disavow first principles by a law of nature is as follows : 'In some periods , especially in our own , people can be found who deny these principles.

And by recanting of " the infidel faith " in a Jewish Jesus , the conquered " converts " will then not be beheaded by the all-conquering sword of Islam. All they have to do is declare publicly , " There is no God except [ Mohammed 's God ] , and Mohammed is his prophet.

They want to deny that any system or framework of concepts is correct in the sense of matching or fitting or corresponding to the structure of the world. There simply are no concepts that divide things up into groups in a way that corresponds to the way things are truly divided up in nature; to adapt Plato 's metaphor , there are no concepts that carve reality at its joints ( Phaedrus , 265e ) . In this metaphor reality is like a chicken; there are real joints out there , facts about which things there are , independently of how we parcel things out in thought. This is what the conceptual relativist typically wants to deny . </deny.v.375><deny.v.376>At present , only the federal government can collect and disperse eagle feathers , denying even BIA-Indians and BIA-designated tribes the traditional right to gather sacred objects even on their own sovereign lands -- leading to further subversion of spiritual tradition and practice , conducted only in a climate of fear , secrecy and intimidation. Even where laws have been added/ amended to allow spiritual practice , such as the Native American Church ' s use of the sacred plant peyote for religious worship , what happens if a church member is caught with an eagle fan used in the service itself ?

OSU policy required that all student groups adopt a non-discrimination policy that would prevent a group from denying membership or leadership positions to students on the basis of religion or sexual orientation , among other things. In 2003 , OSU de-recognized CLS and barred the group from the privileges of being an approved club. OSU took these actions because another student group filed a complaint that CLS violated OSU ' s non-discrimination policy by requiring members and officers to profess faith in Jesus Christ and to exhibit a lifestyle consistent with orthodox Christian doctrine . </deny.v.377><deny.v.378>It is even more interesting that the West German Supreme Court abortion decision of 1976 refused to deny the unborn legal personhood.

As explained below , three rulings of the California Supreme Court and four rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court since 1993 have protected the denied employment opportunities to African Americans.

The fact is that some impairments in and of themselves create very real problems for the people who have them. Chronic pain or fatigue are real and not something that is imposed by society. They are symptoms that might come as part of an impairment and people need to find ways to cope and deal with them. So while it is important to highlight that MANY problems and challenges that people with disabilities face could be alleviated with a change in social attitudes and barriers , we will not eliminate them all. However , if we got rid of most of those social barriers the impairments themselves would be much easier to face because you wouldn ' t be bogged down with all the other unnecessary crap. Let me be CLEAR that I am not denying the pain and anguish that can often accompany impairments. I am fortunate in that I don ' t have a LOT of chronic pain or fatigue to deal with ( some , but nothing unbearable or not workable ) and so that does color my outlook.

But the only thing worse than costing a patient extra money by sending them elsewhere , potentially making it impossible to get care due to travel concerns , denying a service that may be time-sensitive , and all around discriminating against women , is to refuse to even tell that woman where she can go to find a person who is not and asshole and willing to do their goddamn job.

Nobody would deny the worth of the first two commandments , many such as the prominent writer Khushwant fail to acknowledge that if man were more cognizant of the Infinite within , he would be more aware of his place within the creation and more in tune with the fundamental unity of all of God 's creation. All creation , human and otherwise , would then be less subject to man 's puffed up sense of self.

Not only have parents the right to send children to schools of their own choosing but the state has no right to bring such schools " under a strict governmental control " or give " affirmative direction concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools , entrust their control to public officers , and deny both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers , curriculum , and textbooks.

The first case involves occult grievous sinners who ask for Holy Communion.

If , however , they publicly seek the Sacrament and the priest can not deny the Sacrament to them without causing scandal , then he is to give Holy Communion to them . </deny.v.429><deny.v.430>E.

He even teaches in one place that the baptized man must also deny the teaching authority of the Catholic Church to become a heretic , which implies this man must first know about the Catholic Church. Therefore Peter has changed his position again by refuting the other conditions that he rightly mentioned in CRI , those conditions being that a baptized man can become a heretic without having heard of the Catholic faith or Catholic Church : </deny.v.432><deny.v.433>The Gnostics in apostolic times denied that Jesus came in the flesh. To deny the incarnation was to fail to abide in the doctrine of Christ on which the gospel rested.

This was said of " men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh " ( v.7 ) .

That is what the science of anatomy declares , supported by the experience of all mankind. Certainly this truth sounds harsh in our ears , at least as harsh as the questionable propositions of Malthus and Ricardo. Must we , then , to spare the delicate sensibilities that have suddenly developed among modern political theorists and that have given rise to socialism , deny the existence of evil ? And must medical science boldly affirm our eternal rejuvenation and immortality ? Or , if it refuses to stoop to such mummery , must people cry out , frothing at the mouth , as they do to the social scientists : Medical scientists admit pain and death.

Then let us further assume the the government revises the official definition of the " gallon , " reducing its size by one half , so that on the next delivery the pensioner receives 1000 of the new gallons , leaving the tank only half full.

What the rebels had hoped for in fighting the Revolution they were , of course , its footsoldiers , unpaid , in the end , by war profiteers in both federal and state governments was an end to the cronyism and inside baseball that had made their lives so hard for many generations.

Jesus cited this psalm in order to display his opponents inconsistency in allowing mere humans to be called gods while denying him , the eternal Son of God , the same privilege. The law , Jesus pointed out , truly called the judges " gods , " but he proceeded to teach that he was God in a different and far more exalted sense. The leaders of Israel " received the word of God " in their political appointments; Christ is the incarnate Word of God , " whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world.

An application of the four-part balancing test of Barker v. Wingo , 407 U. S. 512 , 92 S. Ct. 2182 , indicated that the defendant had not been denied her right to a speedy trial.

In the process , he must admit the failure of everything that had given his life meaning , although he clings to what he considers rational order in his obsessive killings. The man of science has become a pathological exterminator ( the film thus slyly alluding to Nazi notions of genocide ) in a private war to maintain his prized sense of reason. Price essays this role surprisingly well : he is unusually restrained and in the process captures the sense of despair and defeat with which this man exists , sitting forever on the verge of the resignation to despair but believing such would be the ultimate admission of the failure of reason and rationality. He thus holds out a faint hope of communication but has become an indifferent murderer , arguably as monstrous as the vampires he destroys. His pathological homicides are an attempt to deny the power of the irrational world that has overtaken him and to re-assert rationality.

And surely only flippancy could be responsible for the suggestion that constitutional validity of a requirement to salute our flag implies equal validity of a requirement to salute a dictator. The significance of a symbol lies in what it represents. To reject the swastika does not imply rejection of the Cross. And so it bears repetition to say that it mocks reason and denies our whole history to find in the allowance of a requirement to salute our flag on fitting occasions the seeds of sanction for obeisance to a leader.

A standing order requiring genetic testing in cases brought by the child support agency , where the putative father denies paternity , did not deny the father due process and he was not subject to unconstitutional search and seizure.

Thus the survivor becomes " numb and dumb , " as parts of or entire abuse experiences are lost from conscious awareness.

Nominalism about truth seems to be a natural result of , first , dissatisfaction with realistic views and conceptualistic views of truth , and second , the inspiration provided by the formal correctness of Tarski ' s theory of truth. The proponents of nominalism draw back from the unfruitful discussions of truth common to objective/subjective , realist/antirealist , and ontological/epistemic debates , and made the concept of truth a relatively trivial concept with no important connections with reality or any epistemic concept.

In the Arar case , the Bush Administration did not deny that the right against torture in some general sense had the requisite clarity , but only that it was uncertain that the right extended to foreign nationals who were tortured on foreign soil by foreign officials.

This is all still the result of violating God 's laws of health and nature. In fact , there would BE NO SICKNESS if Adam and Eve had n't sinned in the first place. God does n't invent sickness , it is the result of living in a sinful world and is amplified by our own unhealthful practices. This is what she meant by calling it " sin.

The point still remains that while the traditional understanding of marriage has its pitfalls ( and we must continue to strive for improvement in this regard ) , traditional marriages are , by far , above anything else the world has to offer. Every other permutation and combination has proved a colossal failure , and the beginning of the end of any nation that harbours deviancy on a wide scale.

It was evidently written and published to rescue their doctrines from the misrepresentations of their enemies , and to justify themselves before angels and men for choosing to die rather than renounce their sentiments. Can credulity itself suppose it possible , that Pedo-baptists falsely charged with denying their darling dogma , and ready to be offered on account of this false accusation , would solemnly publish a creed setting forth the baptism of believers in the most emphatic language , and wholly omitting the most remote allusion to the baptism of infants ? To suppose this , is to charge them with failing to bear testimony to the whole truth -- with proving recreant to principles lying at the very foundation of the church of the Redeemer.

He might suggest that Juliet ' s racism is strand 1 and her egalitarianism is strand 2. My take on Frankish is more or less the same as my take on Gendler : I worry that the strands are so inextricably intertwined that any division of this sort between them is artificial. ( This isn ' t to deny that there ' s psychological evidence for some dual process theories that posit competition or co-operation between slow , conscious processes and fast , non-conscious ones.

It opposes the great truth of the crucifixion , that , not only was Christ crucified on Golgotha , but that the world which crucified Him is utterly at enmity with God. It gives the Israelite a superior position upon no other ground than his physical descent.

Physicians were reportedly more likely to deny than affirm the possibility of a connection. Rejection of a possible connection was reported to occur even for symptoms with strong literature support for a drug connection , and even in patients for whom the symptom met presumptive literature-based criteria for probable or definite drug-adverse effect causality.

The turning away in droves of people from religion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the West was not at all accidental , because religion addresses humanity in the context of a universe that is full of consciousness. Not only is the divine reality consciousness , but also there are the hierarchies of angels , of various conscious beings that are now reduced to UFOs. This emphasis of religion upon a cosmos replete with conscious beings holds also true in the non-Abrahamic world , in the Buddhist tradition with the hierarchy of the various Buddhas and boddhisatvas , and all kinds of other beings in intermediate worlds , and also in the world of Hinduism with its gods and goddesses. There is no religion whose traditional universe is not filled with consciousness.

There was no evidence that the conduct required of the students was forbidden by their religion.

For example , " The secret of responsibility would consist of keeping secret , or 'incorporated , ' the secret of the demonic and thus of preserving within itself a nucleus of irresponsibility or absolute unconsciousness " ( 20 ) . Responsibility here is connected to Christianity and thus , at least superficially , " historicized. " But because Christianity remains an ahistorical metaphysical structure , responsibility also stays within the ahistorical realm of metaphysics. Responsibility remains primarily a " concept " with only the most superficial connection to history. Derrida 's gesture towards historicity is to a large extent a red herring; he still operates under the presupposition that the concept has a life independent of historical practice and thought. The process of history remains " extrinsic " just as in the Platonic metaphysics which he criticizes , but within which he finally remains.

It aims to deter unions from challenging the making , or indeed the contents , of workplace agreements. It even introduces punitive action directed against unions seeking to protect their members by moving to federal awards.

That we must agonize how to give , or in your personal experience how to introduce your 8-year-old to the notion , is horribly out-of-date.

It is retroactive intellect , and displays so well how the modern age lost the human association of primitive societies. This struggle is legend , one that I see no end to , but the struggle is the soul of human community , and by circumventing it you deny our very communal soul. More to the point , there is no accumulation of personal giving that will eradicate poverty , distribute wealth equitably , or de-nuclearize the world.

Physicians were reportedly more likely to deny than affirm the possibility of a connection. Rejection of a possible connection was reported to occur even for symptoms with strong literature support for a drug connection , and even in patients for whom the symptom met presumptive literature-based criteria for probable or definite drug-adverse effect causality.

The issue is whether the owner of the womb has greater rights than the resident , who the owner must surely bear some responsibility for placing in residence in the first place. To use an analogy , if I get drunk and let somebody else rent my basement , I have some moral responsibility for that , and if I later regret the decision that does n't mean I can just fling them out immediately.

Yet , in truth , there is no remedy except to throw over the axiom of parallels and to work out a non-Euclidean geometry. Something similar is required today in economics.

As a legal matter , the claim is no stronger. Under the Florida Supreme Court 's ruling , the counties had discretion to decide whether to conduct a recount. And the canvassers steadfastly deny that they were " intimidated.

It had taken moral courage to make the decision to stand and fight , but now it would take even more to execute that decision , along with Buford ' s considerable military skills. As he put his defensive plans together on the evening of June 30 , Buford remarked to Colonel Devin that the battle would be fought at that point and that he was afraid it would be commenced in the morning before the infantry would get up. Therefore , Buford decided to make use of the terrain west of Gettysburg and attempt to execute one of the most difficult of all military tactics a defense in depth against a vastly superior force. His goal would be to delay Lee ' s army until Union infantry could arrive on the scene , initially support his delaying tactics , and , then , occupy the key ground southeast of Gettysburg.

If one accepts the Epistemic conception of vagueness then one will hold that a ' penumbral ' case of red could indeed be red even though we could not in principle determine that it was. Since this is precisely how the realist thinks of truth , as applying or not independently of our capacity to determine this , the analogy would be apt. But the Epistemic theory of vagueness is highly controversial and other theories of vagueness deny that borderline red surfaces must either be red or not. Perhaps the realist could then link the two theories , claiming that since there is no incoherence in the Epistemic interpretation of vagueness , there is no incoherence in the realist notion of truth ? Predictably , though , the anti- realist will reply that if these two theories really must stand or fall together , then they fall together . </deny.v.753><deny.v.754>Philip I agree with your analysis.

If the power to initiate and prosecute a war are united in the president , how is Congress to act as a check against presidential warmaking ? Your answer , John , is that Congress can deny funding for the war. This is unrealistic on two counts. First , any attempt to deny funding to an effort that has already commenced is easily prey for demagoguery : " the sponsor of such legislation does not support the troops. " Second , the president can protect himself against ex ante restrictions on his war-making discretion by using his veto power.

As they caution , however , none of these characteristics is significant by itself and may not even indicate a false allegation when they appear in combination.

And the marvel is not lessened , when it is remembered , that these charges were made without concert , in different ages and countries , under widely differing circumstances and for various purposes; and that the Waldenses themselves , in none of their confessions and publications , should ever deny them; but , on the contrary , should so state their doctrines as to lead the most candid of every persuasion to believe that they were Baptists.

This enfeeblement of the methodology of epistemology , which was never a problem for traditional philosophies , has everything to do with the total and radical partition created between what we call consciousness and matter " matter " meaning the material world , the corporeal world. With the very deep , categorical , absolute , division drawn between consciousness and matter , how can one know anything belonging to a completely different order of reality ? No wonder some take recourse to denying the reality of human consciousness , but do so consciously . </deny.v.853><deny.v.854>Turning to the merits of the speedy trial issue , and applying the four-part balancing test of Barker v. Wingo , 407 U. S. 514 , 92 S. Ct. 2182 , 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 ( 1972 ) , we are not able to say that the District Court erred in denying appellant 's motion. Appellant was indicted June 27 , 1969 , along with her husband , in nine counts charging tax fraud in evading income taxes for 1963 , 1964 and 1965. The appellant did not assert a right to a speedy trial until her motion to dismiss was filed in September , 1972. The appellant herself was a contributor to the delay. She was arraigned July 25 , 1969 , at which time her counsel sought and was granted sixty days in which to file motions , subsequently extended another thirty days. When , in July , 1971 , the case was set for trial in October , 1971 , the appellant sought and was granted a continuance because of a conflicting court engagement of her chief defense counsel . </deny.v.854><deny.v.855>You seem to be unable to follow a fairly simple concept.

The way the Bush administration pursued the war against Iraq , as a superpower-led act of Nietzschean will to power , simply made it look in the Middle East as though al-Qaeda had been right.

There would still be people doing horrible things , but they could not point to the Bible to legitimize their actions.

First , it does not mean denying that we believe in death , and deluding ourselves into thinking that we will not experience death within the illusion. On the contrary , the Course wants us to acknowledge our belief in death squarely , and not attempt to sweep it under the rug , as so many of us try to do when faced with death. The whole point of targeting our compromises with death is to show us just how deep our investment in death really is , and how grim the implications of our belief in death really are. Acknowledging our belief in death ( and the inevitable effect of that belief : that we and those around us will die , at least within the illusion ) is not a compromise with it; rather , it is the first step toward questioning that belief and ultimately renouncing it . </deny.v.865><deny.v.866>Finally , of course I 'm not saying that CAIR 's statements implicate the constitutional freedom of religion. CAIR was making an ethical argument , not a legal one.

I disagree : I think that denying the truth of another 's religion is a fundamental and perfectly ethically legitimate part of theological debate . </deny.v.866><deny.v.867>It is notorious that , to the unthinking mass of mankind , nine-tenths of the facts of life do not suggest the relation of cause and effect; and they practically deny the existence of any such relation by attributing them to chance. Few gamblers but would stare if they were told that the falling of a die on a particular face is as much the effect of a definite cause as the fact of its falling; it is a proverb that " the wind bloweth where it listeth "; and even thoughtful men usually receive with surprise the suggestion , that the form of the crest of every wave that breaks , wind-driven , on the sea-shore , and the direction of every particle of foam that flies before the gale , are the exact effects of definite causes and , as such , must be capable of being determined , deductively , from the laws of motion and the properties of air and water.

What the exchange does is negotiate standard-rate premiums , the way a large-group employer would , for everyone who buys through the exchange , so you get all the benefits of a large-group plan without actually having to be employed by Hewlett-Packard or whoever. The government is free to dictate terms to health plans available through the exchange and deny them access to the exchange if they don ' t comply.

He can doubt the existence of the air. There is nothing that he can not doubt. The only thing he can not doubt is himself , who is doubting other things.

All that could hope to achieve is to constantly deny ourselves opportunities for evolving , learning and growing. We are creative beings , co-creators with God. We are all specially gifted in some line of creative endeavour , which is meant to be dedicated to fulfilling some specific task; the one we were created for. Read more about this in ' You are Special ' . Finding out that this is so , brings with it the responsibility to make an effort at finding out what our particular special gift might be. Besides , we are pioneers of a New Age , in a world that is getting to be ever more exciting. Everybody is now required to learn to live ever more creatively , yet many have not yet woken up from the illusion of Earth life and have found out that this is so . </deny.v.918><deny.v.919>And this is especially so when the information is connected to such an important government activity , and may be relevant to whether it 's being carried out soundly. The Missouri law , according to a New York Times story published yesterday , was enacted following a controversy over supposedly flawed executions : " A Missouri doctor who had supervised more than 50 executions by lethal injection testified last year that he sometimes gave condemned inmates smaller doses of a sedative than the state 's protocol called for , explaining that he is dyslexic. 'So it 's not unusual for me to make mistakes , ' said the doctor , who was referred to in court papers as John Doe I.

If Acts tells us that Paul preached repentance , then Paul preached repentance. Feldick has no authority to deny it and claim that Paul did not preach repentance. Paul made it clear that repentance was part of the universal call of the gospel here as well : " Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance , God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent , because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed , having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead " ( Acts 17 : 30 , 31 ) .

It is the universal experience in the administration of criminal justice that those charged with capital offenses are granted special considerations. Examples of such will readily occur. All States allow a larger number of peremptory challenges of jurors in capital cases than in other cases. Most States permit changes of venue in capital cases on different terms than in other criminal cases. Some States require a verdict of 12 jurors for conviction in a capital case , but allow less than 12 jurors to convict in noncapital cases. On the other side of the coin , most States provide no statute of limitations in capital cases. We think the distinction here made by the Illinois statute between capital cases and noncapital cases is a reasonable and valid one . </deny.v.930><deny.v.931>In his initial brief , Mason contends that because the trial court provided no explanation in denying his motion , the district court acted arbitrarily and its decision must be reversed.

Denying something means that you have knowledge of what it is that you are being asked to affirm , but that you have rejected that particular concept. To be without a belief in God merely means that yhe term god has no importance , or possibly no meaning , to you. Belief in God is not a factor in your life.

Again , the judge , as stated above ( Question [ 67 ] , Article [ 1 ] ) , is the superior in relation to the person whom he judges. Therefore the accused is in duty bound to tell the judge the truth which the latter exacts from him according to the form of law. Hence if he refuse to tell the truth which he is under obligation to tell , or if he mendaciously deny it , he sins mortally. If , on the other hand , the judge asks of him that which he can not ask in accordance with the order of justice , the accused is not bound to satisfy him , and he may lawfully escape by appealing or otherwise : but it is not lawful for him to lie . </deny.v.1008><deny.v.1009>The people of " Israel " today have other names for their nations , and even though their nations have become " melting pots " of many people , that does n't change who they were founded by , or who they are as political entities.

If the glorification of self is the basal root of sin , then the whole edifice of Mormon theology is founded upon what Paul termed " flesh : " that is , the sphere of man 's depraved nature. This is clearly seen , for example , in the Mormon doctrine of man 's absolute freedom. As a moral agent , man is free at any moment to choose either good or evil , and is restricted in his choice neither by the will of God or the dictates of his own nature. The divine purpose is thus made subservient to man 's will , and self-determination replaces the Biblical doctrine of effective foreordination. In like manner , the Mormon doctrine of man 's natural ability to perform righteous works only exagerates an already colossal egomania. Righteousness then becomes a product of man 's unaided efforts , and reflects credit upon the creature instead of the creator. Like the Jews of Paul 's time , the Mormons have sought to establish their own righteousness at the expense of the righteousness attainable solely by grace ( Rom. 10 : 3 ) . </deny.v.1023><deny.v.1024>There 's exploitation when they deny visas and make people apply for four times or more.There 's exploitation when Americans hire illegal people to clean their mess and pay less than half if they were american.Now they want these people to die in hospitals because they are not allowed to have care !

There are several reasons that Arminianism must be considered a damnable heresy. First , Arminians deny crucial aspects of God 's nature. The Bible teaches that God is absolutely sovereign over creation and has total control over whatsoever comes to pass ( Ps. 115 : 3; 136 : 6; Job 42 : 2; Dan. 4 : 35; Isa. 46 : 10-11 ) . The Scriptures teach that Jehovah even has power over the human heart ( Prov. 16 : 1 , 9; 19 : 21; 21 : 1; Rev. 17 : 17; 2 Thess. 2 : 11-12; Rom. 9 : 18-21; Ex. 10 : 1 , 10; Dt. 2 : 30; Josh. 11 : 19-20; Ezr. 1 : 1 , 5; Jn. 12 : 39-40; Lk. 24 : 4; Ac. 16 : 14; Phil. 2 : 13 ) . Arminians teach that God is not sovereign. They argue that God can not control the human heart. To support their assertion Arminians must either deny God 's omnipotence or His immutability. In other words they must either argue that God is finite and can not carry out His decretive will or that God has denied Himself and somehow limited His own sovereign power.

Our awareness of our mortality , I believe , is the fundamental motivation for this seeking of comfort and security and the tendency to deny or ignore anything which threatens these.

A large part of me would much prefer to escape this nasty truth and return to a more comfortable life. So I can understand why so many want this whole climate change business to go away.

" 75 One year later , in striking down a state statute denying a putative father standing to establish paternity , the Texas Supreme Court expressed the view that the state 's interest in minimizing familial disruptions may have " had merit in an earlier era when the true biological father could not be established with near certainty and when illegitimacy carried a significant legal and social stigma " but no longer.76 </deny.v.1061><deny.v.1062>Germany is starting to get it.

Now firstly , emergency room coverage is almost always not excluded from coverage. I challenge anyone to find a plan that does not cover it without restrictions. Insurance companies are required by most states to provide its members a rationale for when they deny coverage for elective services ( meaning non-emergent ) . This is based on clinical information provided by the health care provider either in the form of a request for pre-authorization or in a claim for services rendered. They indicate the reason for the services with a diagnosis code. However there is no diagnosis code for " domestic violence " in the current ICD-9-CM terminology.

It is not difficult to find elements of gnosticism within orthodox Christianity during every step of its history. Even as the early church fathers battled against the gnostic heresy , elements of gnosticism crept into Christian theology. One might even argue that gnosticism simply emphasizes features already present in Christianity. For these reasons , the refutation of Derrida 's analysis demands more than simply showing that his conception of Christianity is gnostic. It is necessary to demonstrate that the gnostic and Platonic influences do not undermine the fundamental core of responsibility within Christianity. Augustine is a key figure in this regard since he was both a gnostic and a Platonist before he became a Christian , and he formulated his theology in opposition to the gnostic heresy . </deny.v.1081><deny.v.1082>I too thought the creation of Israel was a wonderful thing.

Which group is Paul referring to in this trustworthy statement " if we deny Him , He will deny us " ? There is considerable divergence of opinion among the commentaries as discussed below. Take for example Demas in 2 Timothy 4 : 10. Was his desertion of Paul a momentary lapse or an indication of an unregenerate heart ? Frankly , I do n't think one can be absolutely dogmatic. Ultimately only God knows whether a man 's denial is like Peter 's " thrice denial " or represents a settled state of mind and heart.

They argue that Americans become " Fourteenth Amendment citizens " only voluntarily -- through entering into some sort of contract with the federal or state governments. " Contracts " are obviously defined quite liberally as any sort of agreement or reciprocal relationship , including paying income taxes , applying for social security numbers , and using drivers ' licenses. Common law theorists refuse to accept the alleged subversion of common law rights. In the words of one common law tract , " Each freeborn , Sovereign American individual has the authority and the Right to deny and to disavow all Equity jurisdiction , and to refuse to acquiesce to the jurisdiction of Courts of Equity , or to Equity jurisdiction of any Executive or Legislative branch of government agency or agent , State or Federal or County ... Compelling a freeborn , Sovereign American individual to do anything , except upon the verdict of a Common Law Jury , constitutes an enforcement of the alien and evil Roman Civil Law and is in fact fascist totalitarianism.

If this were the case , he said , then racism , antisemitism , and other forms of prejudice would find no home. To expect rational dialogue to constitute the sole barriers against the attempts to deny the Nazi annihilation of European Jewry would be to ignore one of the ultimate lessons of the event itself : Reasoned dialogue has a limited ability to withstand an assault by the mythic power of falsehood , especially when that falsehood is rooted in an age-old social and cultural phenomenon. There was no rational basis to the Nazi atrocities. There was , however , the mythic appeal of antisemitism. Hitler and the Nazis understood this. Mythical thinking and the force of the irrational have a strange and compelling allure for the educated and uneducated alike. Intellectuals in Nazi Germany were not immune from irrational , mystical thinking.

With regard to Neeley , we hold that the sentencing judge committed no error when refusing to sentence her as a minor participant under U.S.S.G. sec. 3B1.2.

Is it true that when Bill Clinton came to Madisonville to speak on behalf of his wife 's candidacy that he refused to meet with Mayor Cox due to his outspoken support of Obama ? Is Bill Clinton a racist ? Bishop one of the things that makes America great are the rights we have that allow for disagreement and dissent. Without those rights , the great accomplishments achieved by Martin Luther King would not have been possible.

No , one can be reasonably well-adjusted , remarkably well-educated ( as many design theorists are ) , and still think Darwinism is a failed scientific paradigm. Let me stress that my students represented quite a cross section of opinion. I had two or three who were conservative Christians actively involved in Campus Crusade. I also had a few who were staunch Darwinists and came to love Richard Dawkins when later in the term we read Dawkins ' book The Blind Watchmaker. Yet none of my students left the course thinking that the debate over Darwinism was like arguing over whether the earth is flat.

Expediency in regulating familial relationships and adjudication of conflicts in the courts is a secondary , but nonetheless important public policy consideration. Given the rising incidence of illegitimate births , legislatures have adopted legal provisions for establishing parent-child relationships ( and the attendant support obligations ) through voluntary legitimation or paternity suits where such relationships do not exist by virtue of wedlock. It furthers State policy goals to establish and strengthen parent-child relationships , rather than severing them , unless important countervailing interests ( protection and welfare of the child ) call for it.

They claim to reveal character traits and state of health solely from the form and distribution of the writing itself. If graphologists claimed nothing more than that cultured people might write with a cultivated hand , or that stingy people fill every corner of the page to avoid wasting paper , there would be little dispute.

The theist can not simply assert that whatever they have in mind must also be something which the atheist has in mind.

Moreover , it is unreasonable to conclude that Josephus would have so uncritically taken their word for so many things , but then proceeded to repeat their account in such blatantly un-Christian language.

Some maintain that deception is inherently other-regarding , and thus the skeptical conclusion is advanced that there actually is no such thing as self-deception. What is commonly called " self-deception " needs to be given a more accurate description. [ 66 ] Others say that words like " deceive , " " know , " or " believe " are used in a non-standard fashion in accounts of self-deception , not having the same intended sense as in descriptions of other-deception. [ 67 ] Finally , others who deny the other-deception parallel recommend that we " look and see " what conditions actually hold when self-deception locutions are utilized , in which case we will notice that self-deception situations do not involve two incompatible beliefs ( as in other-deception ) , but rather only a particular kind of single belief entertained under peculiar circumstances. Thus we speak of " self-deception " when we want to reprimand irresponsible holding of an unwarranted belief , [ 68 ] or self-deceived beliefs are taken as those held in belief-adverse circumstances , [ 69 ] or where there is an irrational refusal to look at evidence , [ 70 ] or where one simply desires to hold the belief , [ 71 ] or where weak-willed dishonesty permits desire-generated blindness , [ 72 ] or some emotion has irrationally obscured the contrary evidence.

At first it was not challenged outwardly by those who were the great masters who created modern science.

This belief seems counterintuitive. What compels those who have been granted immunity to tell the truth , or even to speak at all ? Evidence suggests that there is already enough information to warrant subpoenas as a part of the inquiry process , and subpoenas compel testimony more effectively than asking for volunteers. Moreover , if supporters of a Commission of Inquiry expect contrition , such an outcome is also unlikely if immunity is granted. Under those circumstances , the individuals most responsible are likely to deny they did anything wrong and to maintain that they did not break the law.

The moral theologian must therefore exercise careful discernment in the context of today 's prevalently scientific and technical culture , exposed as it is to the dangers of relativism , pragmatism and positivism. From the theological viewpoint , moral principles are not dependent upon the historical moment in which they are discovered. Moreover , the fact that some believers act without following the teachings of the Magisterium , or erroneously consider as morally correct a kind of behaviour declared by their Pastors as contrary to the law of God , can not be a valid argument for rejecting the truth of the moral norms taught by the Church. The affirmation of moral principles is not within the competence of formal empirical methods. While not denying the validity of such methods , but at the same time not restricting its viewpoint to them , moral theology , faithful to the supernatural sense of the faith , takes into account first and foremost the spiritual dimension of the human heart and its vocation to divine love . </deny.v.1180><deny.v.1181>What I don ' t understand is why people become OB GYN ' s when they ' re opposed to women ' s sexual health !

A couple of years later , Fr. Panteleimon would appear with a different bishop , with no explanation as to why his previous choice was now unacceptable. This happened many times. No unbiased observer could deny that Fr. Panteleimon was not " batting 1000 " as far as his choice of Old Calendarist bishops goes.

The deniers ' selection of the name revisionist to describe themselves is indicative of their basic strategy of deceit and distortion and of their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate historians engaged in the traditional practice of illuminating the past. For historians , in fact , the name revisionism has a resonance that is perfectly legitimate -- it recalls the controversial historical school known as World War I " revisionists , " who argued that the Germans were unjustly held responsible for the war and that consequently the Versailles treaty was a politically misguided document based on a false premise. Thus the deniers link themselves to a specific historiographic tradition of reevaluating the past.

Luke ' s account says , But Peter said , ' Man I do not know what you are saying ! ' Immediately , while he was still speaking , the rooster crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said to him , ' Before the rooster crows , you will deny Me three times. ' So Peter went out and wept bitterly ( Lk. 22 : 60-62 ) .

While they loudly proclaim that we are saved by God 's grace alone they explicitly deny this truth in their doctrine of salvation. They do not believe that Christ 's death actually saves anyone , but only that it makes salvation possible if men do the right thing and allow God to save them by accepting Christ. They explicitly reject the biblical doctrine of atonement , that Jesus Christ by His sinless life and sacrificial death perfectly satisfied God 's justice , thus meriting and procuring all the saving graces : regeneration , faith , repentance , sanctification and glorification for the elect. Smeaton writes , " If we compare Arminian views with biblical teaching on the subject of satisfaction [ i.e. , atonement ] , we soon find that they can no more be harmonized than light and darkness; for , according to apostolic teaching , the deliverance follows the ransom. Thus the whole doctrine was put to hazard. It was held that the death of Christ only made God capable of reconciliation , while the actual reconciliation was left to men themselves working out their own salvation.

Because they recognize the link between philosophical and scientific naturalism that you are trying to deny. I 'm not sure why you want to deny it.

Belief , another hard word to describe , simply means what one believes to be true ; as I can not properly define your belief system , these scientists do not have the authority to declare millions of spiritual people delusional spiritual authority only derives from the individual.

It is the freedom to worship the Creator of the Universe in the way He has told us to. Obedience and worship are inseparable , " if you love Me keep My commandments " , Jesus said. He also said , " Thou shalt worship the Lord Thy God and Him only shalt thou serve " . At the heart of Deuteronomy , we are told that we are to educate our children and that this education is to be God-centred and is a God-ordained parental responsibility. Thus for the state to refuse to allow this , is to declare war on a fundamental Christian doctrine - a fundamental worship requirement. This means to deny freedom of worship. As Dabney has said , " While the State can not authorise the theological beliefs of the Christian citizens , neither has it a right to war against them " ( Ibid p.238 ) . If the state will not let us worship God in the way God has said , then they have declared war on freedom of religion and on God.

However , mothers in need of financial assistance to raise their children may be required to either establish their children 's paternity or maintain a presumption of paternity that has arisen in a particular man. Mothers who wish to eliminate a social or presumed father from their children 's lives may challenge a presumption of paternity or seek to establish paternity in another man.

And in a sense Christianity had already made its contribution to the treasury of the Hellenistic civilization. The school of Alexandria had a considerable impact on the contemporary experiments in the field of philosophy. But Hellenism was not prepared to concede anything to the Church. The attitudes of Clement of Alexandria and Origen , on one side , and of Celsus and Porphyrius , on the other , were typical and instructive.

Graduate assistants who refuse to accept the terms of the Employer 's offer of employment are free to reject them. The limitation on academic freedom the Employer anticipates , therefore , is not the obligation to offer employment conditions on terms the graduate assistants are willing to accept ( i.e. negotiate with the graduate students as individuals ) , but the obligation to do so collectively.

No one seeks to deny him that right , least of all this Court. What respondent seems unaware of is that freedom of speech and of expression , like all constitutional freedoms , is not absolute and that freedom of expression needs on occasion to be adjusted to and accommodated with the requirements of equally important public interests. One of these fundamental public interests is the maintenance of the integrity and orderly functioning of the administration of justice. There is no antinomy between free expression and the integrity of the system of administering justice. For the protection and maintenance of freedom of expression itself can be secured only within the context of a functioning and orderly system of dispensing justice , within the context , in other words , of viable independent institutions for delivery of justice which are accepted by the general community.

The term agnostic was fittingly coined by the 19th-century British scientist Thomas H. Huxley , who believed that only material phenomena were objects of exact knowledge. He made up the word from the prefix a , meaning without , not , as in amoral , and the noun Gnostic. Gnostic is related to the Greek word gnsis , knowledge , which was used by early Christian writers to mean higher , esoteric knowledge of spiritual things ; hence , Gnostic referred to those with such knowledge. In coining the term agnostic , Huxley was considering as Gnostics a group of his fellow intellectuals  ists , as he called them who had eagerly embraced various doctrines or theories that explained the world to their satisfaction. Because he was a man without a rag of a label to cover himself with , Huxley coined the term agnostic for himself , its first published use being in 1870 . </deny.v.1336><deny.v.1337>While I desire freedom in Iran , I am a committed anti-Islamist and anti-communist in general.

Plaintiff had sued , seeking coverage by estoppel and for bad faith refusal to settle , arising out of Travelers ' alleged failure to timely deny coverage. The jury found in favor of Travelers and the Florida appellate court affirmed. It observed that the basis of the claim was that Travelers , in not denying insurance coverage at the outset of the case and in proceeding to defend when there was no coverage , prejudiced the insured by " blowing " a settlement opportunity because plaintiffs would have settled the case with the putative insured for an amount less than the limits of the primary insurance carrier 's policy. Plaintiff then claimed that Travelers had refused in bad faith to settle the claim within the limits of the policy on which Travelers should have denied coverage at the outset.

In the present situation , the current Muslims understand loyalty and disavowal as follows : In this world , there are two homes , Dar al-Islam ( dome of Islam ) and dar al-harb ( home of war ) . While We the muslims belong to the home of Islam , every non-Muslim ( and thus every infidel ) belongs to the home of war. We : ( as Muslims ) must reject , deny , and disavow all the infidels , while we must harbor and support and advocate each other as Muslims. Some radical groups even go further and call for the killing of any infidel with contempt as long as the infidel prefers not to belong to the home of Islam. Based on this totally distorted way of understanding , most Muslims utilized the terminology We to refer to their group in opposite to They that refers to the other groups of either different Muslim sect , or different religion. With this creed , intolerance and disrespect emanates among Muslims groups and between Muslims and non-Muslims , which leads to fight and violence and sometimes terrorism in the name of Islam . </deny.v.1399><deny.v.1400>Shelby County - This is a medical malpractice action in which the jury found in favor of Defendant hospital.

For example , Wells does not merely object that the New Testament presents contradictory testimony written years after the events being attested to; rather , the Mythicist emphasises a developing picture of Jesus that evolves in historical detail and complexity as the New Testament documents are examined chronologically. The earliest stage is almost entirely lacking in historical context and the ultimate implication is that the earlier Christian texts were not inspired by the sort of historical Jesus only evidenced in the later writings. As for D3 , Mythicism need n't rely on any such broadly formulated probabilistic objection to criticise Core Facts; while Wells ' thesis could be combined with probabilistic considerations of a naturalistic or even simply non-Christian sort , it is quite able to undercut Core Facts without such reasoning . </deny.v.1403><deny.v.1404>Cain is cursed by God and also by the earth , which will deny him its fruit ( cf.

Since the court relied upon the statute as a declaration of the public policy of Georgia that the disclosure of a rape victim 's name was not to be protected expression , the statute was drawn in question in a manner directly bearing upon the merits of the action , and the decision in favor of its constitutional validity invokes this Court 's appellate jurisdiction.

It is to love action rather than intention , reality as opposed to lofty ideals , life consummated not in utopia , but in life. As our survival as well as our search for truth and meaning depends on our commitment to an idea of an abstract humanity and a concrete other , than to abandon or be abandoned is finally to lose this commitment both to each other and to truth and , consequently , the hope that either can be achieved.

These writers are forced to interpret the denial by Christ not as a denial that He knows them ( so that they are not believers ) but as a denial of rewards at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Thus they will not receive the rewards they would have had they not denied Him. This latter interpretation is " weak " because the statement specifically declares " He will deny us " not " He will deny us rewards " ( see the following excellent technical note from the Net Bible ) . The plain reading of the " trustworthy statement " therefore favors the interpretation of the denial by Christ as not being a denial of rewards but of the individuals themselves.

The " amixia , " the stubborn defense of his historical identity , and his right to maintain his religious distinctness , which puzzled and angered the Greeks ( compare Haman 's argument in Esther iii. 8 , the precipitate of the Maccabean era ) , is still a pretext for denying to the Jew genuine religious feeling , and a provocation to class him among the wanton deniers of God . </deny.v.1456><deny.v.1457>Great idea that website/url esp. the private part ...

For example , Professor John Allegro of Manchester University wrote a book entitled The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross in 1970 which suggested that the earliest Christians were actually a secret cult group that used sacred mushrooms and utilized the name " Jesus " as a code word to avoid letting outsiders know about their activities. Not surprisingly , Allegro 's thesis was criticized immediately by almost every major historical scholar.

We also see even during the dogmatic definitions of the doctrine ( in 1208 and 1215 ) , the reigning pope , Pope Innocent III understood salvation to be extended to those who desired baptism , but died before receiving it. We also see the Council of Trent affirming baptism of desire , and if there were any questions at all , the Trent catechism affirms the salvation of adults who died before receiving water baptism. In fact , in the three Catechisms promulgated by the magisterium ( Council of Trent Catechism , Pius X Catechism , and the Catechism of the Catholic Church ) , all three of them in effect categorically deny the Feeneyite view of salvation.

Are you being called , through the messages you are hearing , to deny yourself or to indulge yourself ? </deny.v.1507><deny.v.1508>In other words , MacArthur is saying that we can know without any doubt that God loves us. MacArthur is not saying we are inherently worthy of God 's love. He is simply pointing out the fact that God has chosen to love us and chosen to bestow value upon us. To deny this is to deny the very words of Jesus Christ. MacArthur then makes the following statement. " We were so important to God that He gave up His Son to die on our behalf. . . .Thank God for considering you valuable enough to bestow such riches upon you. . . . If you 're struggling with a lack of self-worth , remember that you were important enough for God to give you to Jesus as an inheritance. " </deny.v.1508><deny.v.1509>In June , the D.C.

To deny this child proven treatment is unethical. As for not having funds , hospitals such as Albany Med and other don ' t deny non elective treatments for children that need it.

In fact , the Director of Education for the State of Tennessee testified that most teachers do not adhere to the suggestions in the teachers ' manuals and a teacher for 11 years in the Hawkins County system stated that she looks at the lesson plans in the teachers ' editions , but " does her own thing.

They were burnt at the stake in the mid 16th Century , because they would not deny their Christian faith in Jesus Christ and receive the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. Neither Ridley nor Latimer could accept the Roman Catholic mass as a sacrifice of Christ. Latimer told the 'commissioners ' , " Christ made one oblation and sacrifice for the sins of the whole world , and that a perfect sacrifice; neither needeth there to be , nor can there be , any other propitiatory sacrifice. " However through today 's ecumenicalism , unity with Roman Catholicism is promoted by many denominations in Britain , such as the Baptist Union , and internationally recognised figures such as Chuck Colson , Billy Graham , J.

Therefore , it is necessary to administer all such stimuli to individuals when their ability to resist has been reduced by privation and exhaustion.

He suggests that forgetfulness , shyness , feigned and actual fatigue , as well as the more serious issue of eating disorders , are all unconscious manifestations of negative emotions that have been repressed and denied. Amada continues his analysis by suggesting in Chapter 3 that people are inclined to avoid , dread , deny , and disavow negative emotions and thoughts because these angry feelings usually cause a person to feel physically uncomfortable. People often do n't want to acknowledge their feelings , and actively suppress and deny their negative emotions , because " angry thoughts and emotions often feel psychologically and physically painful and , if the pain becomes truly unbearable , one is inclined to use any means possible to exorcise such feelings " ( Amada ) . Amada suggests that people often suppress their angry thoughts and emotions because they fear damaging or losing the object of the wrath. Guilt toward the hated individual , magical thinking , fear of losing control , and religious proscriptions are all explored as reasons why people often deny and suppress their negative emotions . </deny.v.1525><deny.v.1526>" I was asked a question on the Glenn Beck show today regarding my thoughts on the so-called 9/11 Truth movement.

While her opinion does not affirm the hearing of the dead as Ibn Taymiyya notes in his Legal Opinions ( Fatawa ) and in other places , we have no excuse for following it. For the question necessarily concerns a well-known matter of faith which no one has permission to deny. In fact A'isha has also narrated that the Prophet said , as Ibn Rajab has noted in Ahwal al-Qubur : " Surely they know now that what I said to them is true. " This narration of hers supports those which say that the dead hear , for if it is possible for a dead man to know , surely it is possible for him also to hear.

Moreover , they worry that they have transformed the good internalized parents into hate-filled and persecuting bad internal objects that wish to retaliate. Klein viewed the melancholic person as longing for the restoration of the lost good parents while being persecuted by the bad internalized parents. She observed the development of manic defenses , including contempt , denial , omnipotence , and idealization , which are used in an effort to disavow the bad internalized objects , rescue and restore the lost good parents , and deny the sense of extreme dependency on others for love. Clinical manifestations of these manic defenses include a contemptuous attitude toward those persons who arouse dependency in the patient , an inappropriately euphoric state of mind in the context of adversity , a thoroughgoing denial of any anger or hatred toward others , and a grossly exaggerated idealization of certain persons in the patient ' s life . </deny.v.1538><deny.v.1539>ANSWER The formal response that is required to be filed by " defendant " .

They have generally taken an exclusivist position : that Pauline Christianity is the only valid religion. In fact , in several passages of the Christian Scriptures , the deities of other religions are described as demons. This leads inevitably to the restrictivist belief which has been historically taught by Christianity : that only Christian believers attain Heaven , while everyone else will go to Hell. The above quote by Susie Shellenberger illustrates this clearly. Ultimately , it would not matter one iota whether the non-Christian believes in a deity or not. Strong Atheists , those who deny that God exists , will go to Hell. The many types of non-Christian theists listed above -- followers of Aboriginal faiths to Zoroastrians -- will go to Hell.

Our coming Messiah is loved by His own and He is hated by the world. King David wrote a song about this conspiracy by the nations and their hired religious leaders. He wrote the song 3 , 000 years ago. So it is no secret to the saints. The whole drama of the end-time is written out quite clearly and succinctly in the lyrics of Psalm 2. There is a conspiracy of raging anger and of disinformation concerning the coming of Messiah. The principalities and powers of this world seek to deny His coming rule in the Millennium of Messiah . </deny.v.1566><deny.v.1567>I do. Not about whether Paul believes in the TOE - I could care less. But he has now demonstrated that he will pander to the fundies. That is a significant issue facing the fate of our republic , yes , because as a group , the fundamentalist evangelicals are probably the largest group in our country that harbors significant undemocratic ideals. So yes , it matters. Paul 's libertarian credentials are suspect , imo , not only because of this but also his idea of letting states decide on abortion rights is akin to denying abortion rights to many poor women - hardly a libertarian stance. He also supports the " Do n't Ask , do n't tell " gay policy for the military - again , not a libertarian stance. He supports mandating school prayer and teaching " scientific facts that support creationism " in schools ( there are none , so what is he talking about ? ) . These are not libertarian stances. His is a " squishy " libertarianism . </deny.v.1567><deny.v.1568>We must have a president that will bring us together not divide us.

In our society a man does sometimes have the right , in the strong sense , to disobey a law. He has that right whenever that law wrongly invades his rights against the government. If he has a moral right to free speech , that is , then he has a moral right to break any law that the government , by virtue of his right , had no right to adopt. The right to disobey the law is not a separate right , having something to do with conscience , additional to other rights against the government. It is simply a feature of these rights against the government , and it can not be denied in principle without denying that any such rights exist . </deny.v.1573><deny.v.1574>Where are the studies that show that ADS work long term and prevent relapses ?

They also deny that the Prophet , on him be Allah 's blessing and peace , can intercede in the behalf of perpetrators of acts of disobedience and assert that perpetrators of disobedience will reside eternally in hell fire and so on and so forth with respect to their teachings. Again , not one of the ulama of that time declared them unbelievers but the scholars among the Successors and those who succeeded them confronted them. They refuted them and explained to them the falsity of their doctrine. They did not exact on them the laws against apostates. On the contrary , on them and those before who made unwarranted innovations in the religion they carried out the Muslim laws of inheritance and marriage and buried them in Muslim ground . </deny.v.1576><deny.v.1577>But those who are unwilling to learn it should be told that they deny Christ and are no Christians , neither should they be admitted to the Sacrament , accepted as sponsors at baptism , nor exercise any part of Christian liberty , but should simply be turned back to the Pope and his officials , yea , to the devil himself.

Jesus does not deny the Law but brings it to fulfilment ( cf. Mt 5 : 17 ) : the Law and the Prophets are summed up in the golden rule of mutual love ( cf. Mt 7 : 12 ) . In Jesus the Law becomes once and for all the " gospel " , the good news of God 's lordship over the world , which brings all life back to its roots and its original purpose. This is the New Law , " the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus " ( Rom 8 : 2 ) , and its fundamental expression , following the example of the Lord who gave His life for His friends ( cf. Jn 15 : 13 ) , is the gift of self in love for one 's brothers and sisters : " We know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brethren " ( 1 Jn 3 : 14 ) .

You can subjectively deny natural laws of mind and matters , but natural law determines the consequence of objective actions. It is natural law that will determine the outcome and there is nothing you can do about it. Your only choice is to go with , or go against.

But there was no mention of denying communion to Catholic politicians , from Kerry on down , for their active support of an " unjust war " . ( See Pope statements. ) There was no controversy played out on the front pages of our newspapers or Faux news about Catholic congregants ' holy soul-saving requirement to vote against politicians who support unspeakable , anti-Christian actions like unjust wars. Unjust wars are a big deal Catholicly speaking , but were given a pass in our previous election by the Church , in stark contrast to their unremitting attention to the abortion issue. There is no denying that the Church 's stance was pure manipulation , but I still do n't get what their benefit was. Justpaul offers some speculation , but its theology does n't make sense to me that innocent fetuses are so much more important than innocent " collateral damage " in an UNJUST war or death penalty victims , etc. Jesus nor the Catholic Church never taught that . </deny.v.1584><deny.v.1585>You ca n't just deny yourself out of a positive drug test if you 're an olympic sprint runner or wrestler.

( See , B.E.B. v. R.L.B. , 979 P.2d 514 ( Alaska , 1999 ) ) . In that case , the father was married to the mother when the child was born 8 years after the father had a vasectomy. Although he was not the girl 's biological father , the husband treated her as his own , until the parties separated three years later. After the separation , the father distanced himself from this child , but she continued to think of him as her father. The divorce court found that the father was estopped from denying paternity , based on evidence of potential emotional harm to the child. The Supreme Court of Alaska reversed , and held that estoppel should only be applied where the petitioner could show financial harm.

This he little expected , for he was so prejudiced against those people , that , on entering their metropolis , he said , " Surely the fear of God is not in this [ 542 ] place. " But he was happily disappointed. For Abimelech , in his appeal to Heaven , says , " Lord , will you slay a virtuous nation ? " And the Lord did not deny his plea , but heard and answered his request. There appears in the whole narrative no difference in the religious views or practice between Abraham and Abimelech the king of the nation . </deny.v.1587><deny.v.1588>The unbeliever has to admit much ignorance and to believe more mysteries than believers. For the atheist , unbelief is a far greater miracle than belief in the biblical account of creation for the Christian. The miracle of unbelief is that nothing created something. This mindset of unbelief is to swallow a camel and strain out a gnat , that is , the belief that God created the heavens and the earth. How does one account for both male and female in evolution. Did both evolve at the same time as infants or did they both evolve at the same time as full grown male and female ? Were both male and female produced as coordinates with the existence of the earth as infants with no parents ? If so , they could not have arrived to maturity. Do infants survive today without care ? No ! Experience teaches that the first pair must have been adults when first ushered into being. For one to deny the plain evidence of one ' s survival as infants , one has to suppose , contrary to all experience , that the first pair ( male and female ) were not the same as the species known today . </deny.v.1588><deny.v.1589>And forgiveness is what we need.

We prefer a " comfortable Christianity , " one that requires no serious sacrifice , no serious self-denial.

These martyrs that we see in the Middle East have no shame of their convictions and this is transparently clear. These people most certainly have had socio-economic problems and no one is denying that. However , you continually ignore the elephant in the room. In every war and every violent conflict in the Middle East , resides a prime reason as to why these brutal conflicts occur. The media mainly reports about issues of politics , land , honor , and terrorism , and although these compose of surface reasons , people rarely stop and look at the deeper systemic roots , the fundamental bases for violence. I suspect that part of the reason why everyone fails to mention the elephant , involves an association by guilt. If they reveal the problem , the problem reveals itself back to their own political party and their own religion , so by ignoring or denying the root problems , they avoid direct conflict with their citizenry and their own beliefs . </deny.v.1623><deny.v.1624>However , she was also ridiculously cool.

Riffe , 359 Md. 396 , 754 A.2d 389 ( Md. 2000 ) . The Maryland Court of Appeals recently held that Family Law Article Section 5-1038 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( i ) ( 2 ) applies to any action to disestablish paternity , regardless of the date when paternity was established. This provision gives an adjudicated father the right to reopen and challenge the paternity declaration against him , when post declaration genetic test results show that he is not the child 's biological father. The Court further held that the adjudicated father may request a blood or genetic test in order to confirm or deny paternity. A determination of the best interests of the child is inappropriate and irrelevant to deciding whether to order genetic testing or disestablish paternity. The Court observed that , " to avoid redetermination of paternity , it is possible for courts or plaintiffs to order or request mandatory blood testing in all paternity cases. This would resolve the most frequent request in redetermining paternity , i.e. blood testing , but would also involve a substantial expenditure of public funds to cover the additional blood tests requested. " The decision impacts any Maryland paternity determination made without genetic testing ( although not voluntary acknowledgments entered under Maryland 's current statute ) . </deny.v.1626><deny.v.1627>I 'm curious whether there are any prominent Catholic politicians in the country who support gay marriage.

Neeley was involved in the daily operations of Pocketown , and was in charge of all of Pocketown 's bills , corporate papers , stock certificates , and contracts. Neeley also assisted Pocketown in the locating and purchasing of two apartments in New York on Hill 's behalf. In obtaining one of the apartments , Neeley represented herself to be the manager of Pocketown. Additionally , Neeley was the sole signatory on two of Pocketown 's corporate accounts and was also responsible for depositing various cash amounts into those accounts. Based on the record before us , we do not agree with the defendant 's arguments and find it inconceivable that Neeley could be considered a minor participant in the money laundering conspiracy for which she was indicted and convicted. See Griffin , 150 F.3d at 787; Brown , 136 F.3d at 1185-86. Accordingly , we are of the opinion that the district court did not commit error , clear or otherwise , in denying Neeley 's request for a minor participant reduction . </deny.v.1628><deny.v.1629>In addition to denying her employment with the ATF , the bureau attempted to claim that Howe was " unstable , " her emotional state and her " loyalty " to the ATF being in question.

The chancery court granted the parole board ' s motion to dismiss the petition , and the prisoner appealed. This Court affirmed the chancery court ' s decision to dismiss the petition insofar as the prisoner alleged error with the decision to deny parole , but reversed and remanded as to the decision to defer parole consideration for ten years , finding it arbitrary. On remand , the chancery court ordered a second parole hearing , but later vacated the order. However , a second hearing had already been held at which the parole board again denied parole and set a date for the next parole hearing six years from the date of this second hearing. The chancery court ruled that the decision of the parole board to defer parole consideration for six years was not arbitrary , and concluded that the prisoner had been granted the relief to which he was entitled , dismissing the petition.

The prosecuting attorney , under purported authority of a California statute , Cal.Penal Code , 1323 ( Hillyer-Lake , 1945 ) , argued to the jury that an inference of guilt could be drawn because of appellant 's failure to deny evidence offered against him. The appellant 's contention in the state court and here has been that the statute denies him a right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. The argument is that ( 1 ) permitting comment upon his failure to testify has the effect of compelling him to testify , so as to violate that provision of the Bill of Rights contained in the Fifth Amendment that " No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself " , and ( 2 ) although this provision of the Fifth Amendment originally applied only as a restraint upon federal courts , Barron v.

Denying something means that you have knowledge of what it is that you are being asked to affirm , but that you have rejected that particular concept. To be without a belief in God merely means that yhe term " god " has no importance , or possibly no meaning , to you. Belief in God is not a factor in your life.

Ye must not think that this is only the work of ministers and men in eminent stations , to deny themselves; no , you have Jesus Christ Himself saying , " If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me.

Another factor that may give this theory additional credibility is the counter-intelligence principle that if your were going to create a new misdirecting and misinformation OT 8 you would probably want to create one that is relatively innocuous cancels out the negatives of the old OT 8. It would be even better and would be a good cover story if it could be deliberately leaked out to cover the PR problems the earlier OT 8 was causing . </deny.v.1683><deny.v.1684>Moreover , the Priesthood of Christ so forcefully insisted on in Holy Scripture , both by the Psalmist ( Ps. , CIX , 4 , compare with Hebr. , V , 6 , VII , 15 , 17 , 21 ) and by St. Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews ( priest , V , 6 , VII , 15 , 17 , 21 , high priest ( ierea megan ) , X , 21 high priest ( arxiereuj ) , II , 17 III , r , IV , 15 , V , 10 , VI , 20 , VII , 26 , IX , II; great high priest , IV , 14 ) , would of necessity be wanting , if Christ did not offer sacrifice in the strictest sense of the word : For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it is necessary that He also should have something to offer ( see Hebr. VIII , 3 , compare V , 1 ) . And really , if we deny to the Passion its sacrificial character , the priesthood of Christ does not exist; it is from the Passion that Christ is Victim , and the sacrificial condition is in the Eucharist only from the Passion . </deny.v.1684><deny.v.1685>In fact , he is still effectively lying , by denying it.

Furthermore , such a sabbatarian argues , this remaining Sabbath keeping is a direct inference drawn from the same Psalm 95 , that is , He again defineth a certain day , To-day ( Hebrews 4 : 7 ) . How can you sentimentalists deny that the writer to the Hebrews argues that Joshua failed to bring this rest and , afterward , the Spirit of God speaks of another day , namely , To-day , and the writer specifically asserts that it is a certain day ( tina hemeran ) ? Not only that , the writer uses the term sabbatismos to define this Sabbath keeping that remains when everywhere else in the letter he uses katapausin. Surely it must be evident that the writer is telling us to make one day holier than another. Let us look , then , at what the writer to the Hebrews intended for us to understand by To-day , and in what things he considered a Sabbath keeping to remain . </deny.v.1688><deny.v.1689>There is one question that demands an answer a straight answer from those who would seek to lead this nation and its people.

It noted a long line of cases standing for this proposition , and pointed out that the failure to provide notice to all insureds of an assertion that there is no coverage may waive the right to deny the coverage or estop the carrier 's ability to assert an exclusion. While the court found the permissive driver to be an insured , it held that even if the exclusion were valid , the carrier would still have an extracontractual duty to make reasonable efforts to notify persons that it would disclaim all liability under the policy. According to the Hagen court , this duty persists even when valid coverage exclusions are present . </deny.v.1690><deny.v.1691>The use of the Greek charakter ( " exact representation " ) is a strong argument against the claim of groups like Jehovah 's Witnesses who present Jesus as the highest of God 's creation , but not himself sharing the nature of God. To support this claim the Jehovah 's Witnesses publish their own edition of the Scriptures which mistranslates Greek texts such as John 1 : 1 and Colossians 1 : 15-17 to support their position. The claim that Jesus represents in human form the exact character of God is astonishing but too well supported by the Scriptures to deny . </deny.v.1691><deny.v.1692>University of Wisconsin-Madison Roman Catholic Foundation ( UWRCF ) was a student organization that applied for student activity fee funding for the 2006-07 academic year.

In seventy percent of secondary appeals , the decision is overturned , and SSI is granted. The second appeal is heard in front of an Administrative Law Judge , which in reality is not officially a " judge , " but is a lawyer who specializes in administrative law. SSI will be back-paid from the original application.

In this 60 , 000-word treatise Marguerite , addressed to women in particular , she employed imagery similar to that of Hadewijch and Mechtild to describe seven stages in the soul 's ascent to complete union with God. It was condemned by the bishop of Cambrai and burned in the public square of Valenciennes. Its use was prohibited but this did not deter Margueirte who continued to teach.

Polls reveal that for every American who believes in Darwin 's account of evolution , there are five others who endorse the Biblical alternative. Science has lost by a landslide. And I think it is a lot harder for people to give up on the soul than to give up on creationism. The origin of species , however interesting , is about the past , but the question of the immaterial soul concerns the future your future , and the future of those you care about.

In trampling upon the law of God , they deny the authority of the Lawgiver. It is as easy to make an idol of false doctrines and theories as to fashion an idol of wood or stone. By misrepresenting the attributes of God , Satan leads men to conceive of Him in a false character. With many , a philosophical idol is enthroned in the place of Jehovah; while the living God , as He is revealed in His Word , in Christ , and in the works of creation , is worshiped by but few. Thousands deify nature while they deny the God of nature. Though in a different form , idolatry exists in the Christian world today as verily as it existed among ancient Israel in the days of Elijah. The god of many professedly wise men , of philosophers , poets , politicians , journalists -- the god of polished fashionable circles , of many colleges and universities , even of some theological institutions -- is little better than Baal , the sun-god of Phoenicia . </deny.v.1701><deny.v.1702>Sixth , abortion brutalizes those who perform it , undergo it , pay for it , profit from it , and allow it to happen. Too many of us look the other way because we do not want to think about abortion.

Do we mean Jesus was totally Divine in his flesh ? No , Apostolics do not believe the flesh of Jesus was Divine. We believe it was totally human and of the seed of David. We believe the body of Jesus was human flesh. So we do not believe the flesh was Divine. Here is why many Apostolics find an agreement with Muslims who also reject the Divine flesh of Jesus. However , we believe more about Jesus : we believe the Spirit within him was God. This Muslims deny ! We believe Jesus was God and man. This Muslims deny. Here is where the battle is at between Muslims and those they call Christian infidels. They say Jesus was not God in flesh or Spirit. We say he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

[ Footnote 6 ] The statute does not , however , specifically forbid persons who do not sign the affidavit from holding positions of union leadership , nor require their discharge from office. The fact is that 9 ( h ) may well make it difficult for unions to remain effective if their officers do not sign the affidavits. How difficult depends upon the circumstances of the industry , the strength of the union and its organizational discipline. We are , therefore , neither free to treat 9 ( h ) as if it merely withdraws a privilege gratuitously granted by the Government , nor able to consider it a licensing statute prohibiting those persons who do not sign the affidavit from holding union office. The practicalities of the situation place the proscriptions of 9 ( h ) somewhere between those two extremes. The difficult question that emerges is whether , consistently with the First Amendment , Congress , by statute , may exert these pressures upon labor unions to deny positions of leadership to certain persons who are identified by particular beliefs and political affiliations . </deny.v.1717><deny.v.1718>It is admitted on all hands , that their enemies charged them with denying baptism to infants.

Once the system musters sufficient cause to suspect molest , the child becomes a ward of the system and the family is forced to comply to its dictates or suffer the loss of the child. If the court believes a molest occurred and the family member could have been responsible , a " true finding " is made and wardship declared. If a father denies molest and a true finding is made , he suffers the ultimate Catch 22 he can either admit and take a chance that the department will allow him to begin reunification with his family or he can deny and no reunification will occur . </deny.v.1739><deny.v.1740>" tone changes dramatically in the last two lines of verse 12 : if we disown him , he will also disown us. This warning has the treachery of apostasy in view. Both the we and the us , as well as the language of denial ( 1 Tim 5 : 8; 2 Tim 3 : 5; Titus 1 : 16 ) , show that Paul is thinking of rejection of the faith by those who profess it. Not only actual false teaching but also a rejection of the call to endure give evidence of a decision to deny Christ. Jesus ' own words may lie behind this warning : whoever disowns me before men , I will disown him before my Father in heaven ( Mt10 : 33 ) . In that context too faithfulness includes a willingness to suffer , struggle and die. Rejection by Christ means exclusion from eternal life.

By adding 378 names of our Lord to the NIV where the Greek text does not call for it , they even claim more wisdom and ability than the Holy Spirit who gave the original words.

After our review of the record , we refuse to hold that the district court committed error in denying the motion to withdraw Alvarez 's guilty plea.

Because of their agenda ! They have bought into Rothbard 's claim of a pure 100 gold monetary system as mandatory in order to avoid price inflation. Thus they must deny any claim that the interest rate and discount rate are separate in origin. If they do n't , they then have to confront the fact that credit is not monolithic to be drawn solely from savings. Credit can then possibly exceed savings ( i.e. , gold and silver reserves ) without causing price inflation. Hazlitt 's concept of inflation then is more valid. All these conclusions threaten the promotion of their agenda. This , I contend , is the reason for the ad hominem barbs on the part of Corrigan in response to Fekete 's declaration of the difference between the origins of the interest rate and discount rate. Fekete 's declaration has to be ridiculed to the Rothbardian choir by any means possible lest a very real danger to the credibility of Rothbard 's agenda be unleashed for astute minds to ponder . </deny.v.1843><deny.v.1844>Watch for stalking or menacing behaviors , and if you notice anything , report them to the police immediately.

Davis ' most persuasive cases are decidedly evidentialist-internalist in their structure; while I would not argue that Davis disapproves of externalist defences of resurrection-belief , such do not seem to be a concern to the soft apologetics he uses to defend DT.

It is unconscionable for our government to put the onus on law-abiding veterans to affirmatively demonstrate that they are not engaging in fraud. The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD disability is extremely time-consuming. It requires the compilation of medical records , military service records , and testimony from other veterans who can attest to a person 's combat exposure.

With the rise of the first universities , theology came more directly into contact with other forms of learning and scientific research. Although they insisted upon the organic link between theology and philosophy , Saint Albert the Great and Saint Thomas were the first to recognize the autonomy which philosophy and the sciences needed if they were to perform well in their respective fields of research. From the late Medieval period onwards , however , the legitimate distinction between the two forms of learning became more and more a fateful separation. As a result of the exaggerated rationalism of certain thinkers , positions grew more radical and there emerged eventually a philosophy which was separate from and absolutely independent of the contents of faith. Another of the many consequences of this separation was an ever deeper mistrust with regard to reason itself. In a spirit both sceptical and agnostic , some began to voice a general mistrust , which led some to focus more on faith and others to deny its rationality altogether . </deny.v.1894><deny.v.1895>There are competitors that will take these risk and they will get away with it 99 of the time.

( 85 ) That is because what is meant by the phrase : " Those in the graves " in the first verse and by " the dead " in the second verse are the unbelievers , who are compared to the dead lying in their graves. Just as the dead do not hear with a beneficial kind of hearing -- that is , with a hearing made complete by the mutual exchange of address between the hearer and the speaker -- in the same way the unbelievers do not hear the warning signs that the Prophet addresses to them in a way that benefits them by guiding them to faith in Allah . </deny.v.1981><deny.v.1982>B.E.B. v.

Nevertheless , the husband treated the child as his own during the next 3 years before separation. He did distance himself from this child after separation but the child continued to think of him as her father. In divorce proceedings , a lower court applied paternity by estoppel based on evidence of potential emotional harm to the child and found the husband was estopped from denying paternity and was required to pay support even though DNA tests determined he was not the child 's biological father. The Supreme Court of Alaska found that , despite its prior adoption of the " emotional harm " rule , paternity by estoppel would be applied only under a narrower " financial harm " test . </deny.v.1982><deny.v.1983>Repression can be a useful defense mechanism. Although repression is generally viewed as a destructive act , it is rightly called a " defense mechanism " because it defends us against psychological material which might indeed be dangerous if we do n't have the ego strength or psychological skills to manage certain challenges to the ego. For example , if a young boy must play the role of a " perfectly sweet child " to please his demanding parents , he might not know any way to survive except to deny his occasional anger; however , he could select the option of suppression if knew that he could secretly acknowledge -- within the privacy of strong ego boundaries -- both the anger and the unfairness of his parents ' demands . </deny.v.1983><deny.v.1984>Other bishops have strongly warned manifest sinners , but have refused to declare they would deny nor have they issued diocesan wide discipline.

Some women sought help from swamis , staff or from Gurumayi herself. They were told that they had brought their mistreatment upon themselves and to be silent and tell no one. Thus , when ashram staff and swamis are not officially denying that such things ever happened , they switch stories and claim that Muktananda 's sexual activities had a divine purpose.

Indeed , the difficulties of sustaining a seamless narrative without suppressing the voice of active agency often cause narratives to buckle under the sheer weight of insupportable contradictions. Novels about the civil emancipation of religious minorities particularly reveal the fragility of secular postures. Such novels bear comparison with narratives of conversion because both types of works are centrally concerned with exploring questions of inclusion and exclusion. If the former works more narrowly within existing religious categories , even effacing them in order to assert the supremacy of the tolerant state , the latter by definition must be capacious enough to imagine different positions within society.

In such cases it is often more illuminating to consider the type of relativism ( e.g. , normative ethical relativism ) directly , without a detour through a discussion of relative truth , and it also can make it easier to align discussion with much of the literature on various kinds of relativism.

However the Christian can challenge the non-Christian approach to interpreting human experience only if he shows the non-Christian that even in his virtual negation of God , he is still really presupposing God. 18 He puts the point succinctly in saying : Anti-theism presupposes theism. 19 The intel-lectual achievements of the unbeliever , as ex-plained in The Defense of the Faith , are possible only because he is borrowing , without recognizing it , the Christian ideas of creation and provi-dence. 20 The non-Christian thus makes positive contributions to science in spite of his princi-ples 21 because he is inconsistent.

As such , Lincoln could invoke all means to prosecute the war , short of those universally recognized as being cruel or inhumane. Therefore , he could emancipate the slaves held in the South , denying his enemy a valuable resource , and also allowing those now freed the opportunity to fight their oppressors , There was no emphasis on the slaves as property , but , rather , there was now a vision of them as an oppressed people for whom the war offered a chance , as Lincoln wrote , to be forever free.

Of the 23 states that mandate employers to provide insured coverage for prescription contraceptives to their employees , 14 have exemptions for religious employers , and Missouri allows any employer , religious or secular , to deny coverage for any kind of contraception. During the 2005 legislative session , more that 80 bills in 36 states were introduced that would restrict minors ' access to birth control. On the federal level , the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act , currently being considered in Congress , would allow insurers to ignore state laws mandating contraceptive coverage. And then there is the matter of pharmacists and " conscience clause " laws. South Dakota , Arkansas , Georgia and Mississippi already allow pharmacists to refuse to fill contraceptive prescriptions. And at least 15 states have legislation pending that would allow not just pharmacists to refuse to dispense prescriptions , but would also protect cashiers who refused to ring them up . </deny.v.2094><deny.v.2095>There are two basic deceptions of hubris in this scenario familiar to most Christian parents.

In my mind , they ARE deserving of equal rights , and over time , we ( as a society ) will come to view them as no different than heterosexual couples. Which means that there may very well come a day that in public schools children will be taught , as a matter of history and civics , that at one time , homosexuals were discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. That at one time , people fought to keep them from equal marriage rights based on a religious conception of marriage.

Judge Rutherford was a major literary and writing force for and on behalf of the Jehovah 's Witnesses , thus the reference to " Satan " on the lead-in. This same circumstance tends to render his motives and scholarship suspect in the eyes of many. Judge Rutherford does not seem to have any substantiation or references with regard to the above beyond his claim that it had appeared some 30 years earlier ( c. 1900 ) , in a St. Louis magazine. It certainly seems unlikely that he would fabricate any of the above simply to further his religious-based arguments against " Big Business.

The argument is plainly fallacious. The United States can make the contract only if the federal power to tax and to appropriate reaches the subject matter of the contract. If this does reach the subject matter , its exertion can not be displaced by state action.

Some maintain that deception is inherently other-regarding , and thus the skeptical conclusion is advanced that there actually is no such thing as self-deception. What is commonly called self-deception needs to be given a more accurate description.66 Others say that words like deceive ,  know , or believe are used in a non-standard fashion in accounts of self-deception , not having the same intended sense as in descriptions of other-deception.67 Finally , others who deny the other-deception parallel recommend that we look and see what conditions actually hold when self-deception locutions are utilized , in which case we will notice that self-deception situations do not involve two incompatible beliefs ( as in other-deception ) , but rather only a particular kind of single belief entertained under peculiar circum-stances. Thus we speak of self-deception when we want to reprimand irresponsible holding of an unwarranted belief , 68 or self-deceived beliefs are taken as those held in belief-adverse circum-stances , 69 or where there is an irrational refusal to look at evidence , 70 or where one simply desires to hold the belief , 71 or where weak-willed dishonesty permits desire-generated blindness , 72 or some emotion has irrationally obscured the contrary evidence.73 </deny.v.2163><deny.v.2164>Thomas , you do not approve of Haitham posting these pictures.

From this it is obvious that the examination of " dogmatic differences " between heresies and Orthodoxy must be done with indifference , indeed , confession and true belief aside; that is , not with the intention of combatting heresy , which is destructive to the soul , or out of commitment to the salvific Faith of Orthodoxy , but simply by virtue of historical knowledge , as do unbelievers. For this reason , those Orthodox who fall to Ecumenical delusion do not carry out missions. Moreover , they will not receive heretics wishing to return to Orthodoxy , but turn them away. They are told that , as heretics , they are members of the One Church. Indeed , one such clergyman outside Greece recently complained that , though in eight full years he had not Baptized a single heretic returning to Orthodoxy , the Ecumenists in the Phanar had not promoted him !

Unfortunately this willingness can not develop as long as Greece and Bulgaria deny the existence of Macedonians and refuse to accept the fact that they illegally occupied and annexed Macedonian territories. The first step in gaining this willingness is to have Greece and Bulgaria recognize the existence of ethnic Macedonians not only in the Republic of Macedonia but also in their respective territories. In other words , Greece and Bulgaria must allow its citizens to self declare their ethnic identities with their support and protection. The next step is to accept the fact that Macedonia was partitioned without the Macedonian peoples ' consent and then by referendum allow Macedonians to make the choice of separating and reuniting with other Macedonians or remaining within their respective states. Macedonians may chose to reunite Macedonia culturally and still remain administratively tied to the existing states.

Since no father-child relationship was created and the husband has not supplanted the child 's opportunity to develop a father-child relationship with his biological father , this husband would not be liable for child support under the Principles ' concept of estoppel.21 Both of these situations involve men who reject children upon learning that they are not their biological offspring. In the first illustration , however , the husband is held responsible on the basis of his acceptance of the paternal role and the passage of time.

On the flip side , good parents who do home schooling and are not sheltering their children , have the right to live how they choose.

If Peter believes that this is the only way a baptized man can become a heretic and a non-Catholic , then he condemns his other conditions and does believe that Mr. X was Catholic for the first 21 years of his life when he was a self-professed Protestant and invincibly ignorant of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Peter must also believe that the self-professed Amish mentioned above are Catholics and that the baptized children in my Examples 1 , 2 , and 3 ( in my book Baptized Non-Catholic Children ) are also Catholics.

Between them there is this difference : that the German school leans more or less to the teaching that all the sacrificial activity of Christ is internal , at the same time it will not deny that these activities are shown outwardly by some bodily manifestation; the French school on the other hand rather insists on the sensible external condition of our sacrificial action . </deny.v.2290><deny.v.2291>Why would some one do this ?

For Wittgenstein , as natural historian of the average person 's world-view and as mystic , to doubt or to deny the existence of God is a mere joke or a pose. It manifests the ignorance of a savage in the face of the forms of language. To doubt or deny the existence of God is a misuse of ordinary language. Doubt or denial of God can have no practical consequences; it can never lead to any change in the mode of life.

The Council added : " Nor does divine Providence deny the helps that are necessary for salvation to those who , through no fault of their own , have not yet attained to the express recognition of God , yet who strive , not without divine grace , to lead an upright life.

Therefore , insofar as the science is in , in favor of evolution , teaching the controversy about evolution in science class steps clearly outside the role of the public school , and becomes partisan advocacy . </deny.v.2329><deny.v.2330>I pay my tribute to the gallantry and heroism of those British soldiers who fell beneath their flag.

My morality is not cribbed , cabined , and confined by geographical lines. I mete out to the savage the same measure of justice which I extend to more civilized races. Altho a man be a savage , we ought not to deny him the degree of praise which is due to his patriotism , as praise is paid to Caractacus and Kosciusko. This Zulu king stood within his own territories. He only did what Queen Elizabeth did in the case of the Spanish Armada when it threatened English soil.

I wouldnt want an alcoholic who lacks the skills to survive in a normal society raising my children. On the flip side , good parents who do home schooling and are not sheltering their children , have the right to live how they choose. What worries me is mental illness , pedephilia etc. Social services should look into any family who isolate their children for abuse , lack of provisions , education , and/or neglect. Other than that , most of these people are survivors from their own demons and dont appear to be hurting anyone.

For instance , you and I ca n't go back to the market for more money by issuing new rounds of equity. We are n't limited-liability structures in the eyes of the law and no matter how hard and how effectively we try to avoid responsibility , society puts ( at least some of ) it back on us. Sarbanes-Oxley is legislation designed to put responsibility back on people 's shoulders , and Kozlowski , Lay , Ebbers , and others are feeling the pinch of that pressure despite tremendous efforts to avoid both corporate and personal responsibility. We and our legacies ultimately have to live with our actions , not deny and disavow them to some abstraction.

Publicly supporting abortion is a grave sin. I am not talking about interior qualms or philosophical musings individuals may sometimes entertain , I am talking about publicly supporting the killing of children. That is objectively speaking a grave sin. Recall the Bible verse regarding discerning the Body of Christ before receiving ? And if not , it is to him condemnation ? It is , in fact , an act of charity to deny Communion to those who are clearly and objectively in grave sin.

Once strain starts , a number of psychological mechanisms may be implemented to reduce the severity. For example : denial , dissent , avoidance , circumvention , minimal compliance , blaming and projecting responsibility on to others. The intellectual litheness of the human mind and its capacity to dissipate strain allows processes such as denial to come into play. It works through the intellectual mechanism of rejecting apparent evidence in order to arrive at a more consoling interpretation of events. Observers of the Nazi epoch ( see Bettleheim , 1960; Blass , 1993; Churchill , 1997 ) point out how persuasive denial was among both victims and persecutors.

For a discussion of the distinction in terms of types of ascription , see Searle 1983 , Dennett 1982 , Brandom 1994. ) Many who understand the distinction as between two types of ascriptions deny that there are actually two types of belief involved , but those who understand the distinction in terms of two types of belief must admit that there are still two types of ascriptions ( namely , those that ascribe de dicto beliefs and those that ascribe de re beliefs ) .

The fact that its charity record is relatively low is not conclusive that a hospital is not operated for charitable purposes to the full extent of its financial ability. It may furnish services at reduced rates which are below cost , and thereby render charity in that manner. It may also set aside earnings which it uses for improvements and additions to hospital facilities. It must not , however , refuse to accept patients in need of hospital care who can not pay for such services.

Denying that the Nanking massacre happened is part of removing distortions. Another theme of neo-nationalists is Japan 's continuing subservience to the United States for which the domestic political establishment ( more than the United States ) is lambasted. General constitutional revision -- not just of Article 9 but of the entire basic law -- is seen as a necessary step toward independence. China is a popular theme.

The Shadow can consist not only of parts of us that our culture at large would view as shameful or destructive , but may also include a " Golden Shadow " made up of otherwise constructive talents and strengths that , for one reason or another ( ie : they posed a threat to an authority figure 's status ) , were not valued or were shamed by influential people in our lives. Elements cut off from consciousness within the Shadow may exert an enormous unseen influence in our lives and relationships. As long as we refuse to acknowledge their existence within ourselves , they threaten to project themselves onto others , with the potential for either exaggerated idealization , as may occur in hero worship or romantic attraction , or intense demonization and scapegoating. Indeed , the very occurrence of such experiences points to a likely unconscious origin within some aspects of our own Shadow . </deny.v.2455><deny.v.2456>But payers can deny or only partially pay any of your claims for a wide variety of reasons.

The untied front will reveal its value when Communist detachments will come to the help of Socialist detachments nd vice versa in the case of an attack by the fascist bands against Le Populaire or l'Humanite. But for that , proletarian combat detachments must exist and be educated , trained , and armed. And if there is not an organization of defense , i.e. , a workers ' militia , Le Populaire or l'Humanite will be able to write as many articles as they like on the omnipotence of the united front , but the two papers will find themselves defenseless before the first well-prepared attack of the fascists . </deny.v.2468><deny.v.2469>This broad understanding of the Constitution is reflected in the provisions of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 , which prohibits torture by United States officials wherever they act and against whomever they act.

On the contrary , whenever human minds reach their full measure of completeness and perfection , religion 's merits and prerogatives with regard to reason become totally manifest. Is there in this age , an age of the mind 's progress , anything more abominable than denying reason its proper scope , especially when the cardinal pivot of religion and the capacity to perform its duties is based on the ability to reason ? For the obligation to carry out the duties of Islam falls away when mental capacity is absent.

Posse adherents discovered a draft Constitutional amendment from the republic 's early days , one that would deny citizenship to Americans accepting titles of nobility. This was one of many amendments which failed because not enough states ratified it. But Posse adherents decided not only that it had been ratified , but that its ratification had been covered up by a conspiracy. Their erroneous beliefs were bolstered by discovering some old printed copies of the Constitution which listed the draft amendment along with other , actually ratified amendments. Posse " scholars " combed through state archives , looking for votes on ratification , or hints of cover-up , and concluded , not surprisingly , that there had indeed been a cover-up. Why did the Posse spend all this energy ? Because of the way that they interpreted the meaning of the amendment. To the Posse , all lawyers had " titles of nobility , " because they put the term " esquire " after their names.

It is no advantage whatever to be an Israelite today.

Black Americans who aspire to socioeconomic success generally must acquire a facility in Standard English as a precondition of advancement , even if they retain a fluency in black speech. Successful blacks who have grown up in the ghetto literally become bilingual , learning to switch back and forth between black and white dialects depending on the social context. This " code switching " involves not only a change of words but a shift between contrasting cultures and identities. Although some people acquire the ability to make this shift without difficulty , it causes real social and psychological problems for others. For someone raised in the segregated environment of the ghetto , adopting white linguistic conventions can seem like a betrayal of black culture , a phony attempt to deny the reality of one 's " blackness.

Predestination or the sovereignty of God is not the issue here for it is certainly a biblical truth and what we should all be agreeing on.

Thus the initial justice of war requires reflection. Pacifists deny that war , or even any kind of violence , can be morally permissible , but , as with the other positions noted above , a variety of opinions exists here , some admitting the use of war only in defense and as a last resort ( defencists ) whereas others absolutely do not admit violence or war of any sort ( absolutist pacifists ) . Moving from the pacifist position , other moralists admit the use of war as a means to support , defend , or secure peace , but such positions may permit wars of defense , deterrence , aggression , and intervention for that goal . </deny.v.2566><deny.v.2567>Matthew 26 : 34 , 74-75 and Luke 22 : 34 , 60-61 , both say that Jesus told Peter that he would deny him 3 times before the cock crowed.

Gary Sick , an Iran expert quoted by columnist Jim Lobe in a recent article , seems to think the reputation for irrational and dangerous actions enjoyed by the Bush administration is being used as a psychological lever.

The view is rejected as an unfounded confidence in perfect human rationality and an underestimation of the power of expression to enliven prejudice and confirm inflexible belief systems. Entrenched prejudices , such as racism , easily distort the rational reception of ideas and can deny equal access to the public forum , especially for those who are already marginalised.

If against me , are any miracles wrought by me ? By my means or in my name ? Why , then , grudge me what is not mine ? If it be against the martyrs ( for if they bear no grudge against me , it can only be against them ) , they show that the martyrs were of another faith than that which they believe.

" My concern here is not with the truth or falsity of this preposterous belief , but with its psychological function as a guarantee that offers human beings a way to deprive death of its finality.

There is much that we can face apparently only when we can deny it through the working of what we 'll soon see is an entire system of guarantees.

In those days , it was not recognized as it is today that most of the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree. If the States had any power , it was assumed that they had all power , and that the necessary alternative was to deny it altogether. But this Court , which so often has defeated the attempt to tax in certain ways , can defeat an attempt to discriminate or otherwise go too far without wholly abolishing the power to tax. The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits. The power to fix rates is the power to destroy if unlimited , but this Court , while it endeavors to prevent confiscation , does not prevent the fixing of rates.

Even the most optimistic glossers of those events now can scarcely deny that the chickens of contradiction have come home to roost. In the early morning hours , the high-church protestant wing , adhering to the ' 28 books , would show up to say the spoken prayers.

The actors of the Revolution were in fact dealing with some classic issues of macroeconomics , and far from being haphazard innovators or ignorant victims of incomprehensible phenomena , we see them as drawing upon contemporary economic thinking , as well as recent experiences in various countries. That they may have failed in a great number of respects does not deny them the presumption of rationality; nor of free will. They tried to solve problems they inherited from the Old Regime : both explicit problems , and implicit contradictions of the condemned order; but also problems of their own making.

State Farm Fire &amp;Casualty Co. , 217 Cal. App. 3d 210 , 265 Cal. Rptr. 710 ( 1989 ) . Plaintiff homeowners brought a claim against their insurer based on several cracks they discovered in the floor and foundation of the house. State Farm denied coverage under an exclusion in the policy. The plaintiffs subsequently filed suit against the insurer , claiming that the asserted cause for the denial was improper under the terms of the contract since the cause asserted by the plaintiffs was a concurrent proximate cause of the damage and , therefore , should have been covered. Plaintiffs also alleged that State Farm breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by " failing to pay benefits when it knew the claim was covered under the policy , refusing to conduct a geological survey to discover the nature and extent of the problem , and selectively denying the claim while paying benefits to other homeowners similarly situated.

Wagner himself would have laughed at such naivety. Symbolism and metaphorical representation have long been documented in these works. To deny that racist tracts , like Judaism in Music , have no representation in his operas is particularly naive. By the same " logic " , his other essays , such as Opera and Drama and Artwork of the Future would also have no bearing on his music , but no one claims that. In fact , Wagner himself stated the opposite. His prose works compile an ideology meant to bear upon and become manifest in his music . </deny.v.2746><deny.v.2747>Archbishop John Nienstedt , in harmony with his predecessor and other U.S. bishops , does not support , endorse or recognize CPCSM.

Acts 6 : 8-7 : 60 ) and the Apostle James ( cf. Acts 12 : 1-2 ) , who died as martyrs in order to profess their faith and their love for Christ , unwilling to deny him. In this they followed the Lord Jesus who " made the good confession " ( 1 Tim 6 : 13 ) before Caiaphas and Pilate , confirming the truth of his message at the cost of his life. Countless other martyrs accepted persecution and death rather than perform the idolatrous act of burning incense before the statue of the Emperor ( cf.Rev 13 : 7-10 ) . They even refused to feign such worship , thereby giving an example of the duty to refrain from performing even a single concrete act contrary to God 's love and the witness of faith. Like Christ himself , they obediently trusted and handed over their lives to the Father , the one who could free them from death ( cf. Heb 5 : 7 ) . </deny.v.2750><deny.v.2751>Amazing and sad that ignorant Prohibs want to continue to deny the vast usefulness of cannabis.

Only a few were underage , and many were accompanied by their relatives. I do not deny that human trafficking exists nor do I dispute the fact that the Benin slave ship incident was a case of child slavery.

Instead , as Brian Kalt indicates , the Senate would most likely argue that it has the power to judge an appointment analogous to its power to judge an election. This is a reasonable position ( supported by prior Senate precedent ) , but it creates a certain awkwardness if the Senate wants to contend that its decision is immune from judicial scrutiny under the political question doctrine. The power to judge appointments , unlike the power to judge elections or qualifications , is not textually committed to the Senate . </deny.v.2753><deny.v.2754>Peter G : You have chosen to overlook how prominent Catholic bishops were in comdemning Senator John Kerry for not being the sort of Catholic they wanted.

His stance was known before the actual campaign , yet it was only during the campaign that such a threat was uttered ?
