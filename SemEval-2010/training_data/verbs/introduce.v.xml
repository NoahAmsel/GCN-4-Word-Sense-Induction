Lowell Liebermann is perhaps the most widely performed and commissioned composer of our time. His Piano Concerto 2 , which won a 1998 GRAMMY Award nomination for Best Contemporary Classical Composition , has been called by the Baltimore Sun perhaps the best piece in the genre since Samuel Barber ' s Concerto.

However , this is n't readily apparent in the music offered by the album 's four long tracks , which is essentially instrumental fusion dominated by the occasionally melodious but generally pyrotechnic solos and exchanges between Frantisek Grigl k 's guitar and Tom s Berka 's electric piano and synthesizer. Here and there , however , the band introduce more progressive elements into the mix : a stately piano/cello duet , some vocalise on a folkish melody , a wailing , synth-harmonised guitar solo against a spacey string-machine scenery. The fusion sound is still the dominant throughout , with Ladislav Lucenic 's funky bass and Karol Ol h 's driving drumming providing smooth vamps , over which guitar and keyboards can work through the standard and also a few slightly exotic scales. However , unlike Iceberg whom Fermata have sometimes been compared to , the symphonic or ethnic flavours are much less prominent on Huascaran than on the Iceberg albums I have heard.

The case discusses the biological basis of the temporary euphoria that may accompany drug use and certain aspects of the biological basis of addiction. It also introduces neurotransmitters and their mechanisms of action at a synapse. It does not attempt to address all of the complexities or biological mechanisms of addiction , but discusses general concepts using cocaine and opiates as examples.

The digital world introduced opportunities to create and communicate without " control " in the manner suggested here. If anything , the " professional " critic is now replaced by creative writers and readers who exchange activities and artefacts directly. The world we live in is not about too much , at all , it is about empowerment , engagement , experience and exchange. And I say this not naively. Simply , if you believe in the power of " centralised " publishing , reviewing , creating and communicating then it is *that belief alone* that makes this so , not the digital world , which offers all creative writers and all readers so very many opportunities. We are living now in the age of creative experience . </introduce.v.83><introduce.v.84>The Eurolinux Alliance of software companies and non-profit associations has been informed by reliable sources that the European Commission ( EC ) will publish within a few days a draft proposal for a European Community Directive on the limits of patentability with regard to computer programs. Most programmers want not patents but only copyright to apply to software. Evidence from economic studies suggests that software patents stifle innovation and reduce productivity. The EC will pay verbal tribute to this reality in its press release. However , in its directive draft , the EC will propose to legalise US-style software patents in Europe and to remove all effective limits on patentability. With some reading skills in european patent lingo , you will easily notice this discrepancy. If you can afford 20 minutes , we will teach you the basics and introduce you to a debate , which is likely to stir unusual political passions at least for the next 1-2 years , as the directive draft attempts to pass through the European Parliament and the European Council . </introduce.v.84><introduce.v.85>As a young girl , I always had enjoyed the old fairy tales of yore. I read them and re-read them. Therefore , when thinking about designing a game , I naturally gravitated to what I liked and felt comfortable with. I felt comfortable with the idea of fairy tales , and so , put that passion into my game of King 's Quest. The first King 's Quest was really a compendium of many of the most common fairy tales , and , really was nothing but a big fairy tale that someone could directly experience in a very interactive way instead of in the old passive way of books , movies , or oral tales. I introduced Sir Graham as the main character or 'hero , ' and then , when going on to develop King 's Quest II , I decided to develop him and his future family as the main characters for this series set in Daventry. Even though Daventry , itself , was n't always where the game play took place , it was always there as the 'home ' of King Graham and his family.

They do not have force in reference to religious music in other settings. For some time it has seemed to me that religious words may be sung to instrumental accompaniment in other settings than the assembly when other purposes are in mind -- such as at a concert hall or around a piano at home. On the other hand , the ready availability and acceptance of religious music with instrumental accompaniment in other settings is undoubtedly part of the current pressure to introduce instruments into the assemblies. Those who have opposed singing religious songs to instrumental accompaniment in any setting have tried to prove too much , it seems to me , but they have a certain consistency on their side , and in the present climate , although offering a position difficult to maintain in practice , they provide a cautionary word that deserves respect . </introduce.v.96><introduce.v.97> I make it absolutely clear to the Parliament and the people of Victoria that we will not tolerate the sort of abuse of taxpayers ' money that has been occurring in the funding of political advertisements under the government.

When asked to compose a tribute , Bertolozzi said , I was told not to write another march but to come up with something different. I tried to introduce an introspective , meditative point of view into the genre of military music. Surely there are times when soldiers must think hard on their responsibility to perform their duty in the face of personal danger. This to me is the essence of bravery , to knowingly put yourself at risk. " Though not literally programmatic , The Contemplation of Bravery expresses those feelings. The voice of the horn represents the personal , solitary thought , while the rest of the ensemble surrounds it with a landscape appropriate to evoke thoughtful reflections on the motto of West Point : Duty , Honor , Country . </introduce.v.105><introduce.v.106>Hoping it would be successful , Del.

If you have not already built a good relationship with an MSP that you have been working with , look for one likely to be enthusiastic in your Bill proposal by going through the party manifestos , MSP biographies , cross party groups , PQs and motions and other information on the Scottish Parliament website. Check also whether they have already introduced a Bill or have put forward Bill proposals. An MSP can only introduce two Members ' Bills in a four-year session and would be unlikely to want to introduce more than one , given the amount of work involved.

The flexibility and malleability of software suits this immediacy , and organizations that embrace software development as a core business process will move ahead of the pack. Ironically , this great advantage -- the relative ease of making changes -- is also a great source of weakness. A small change can introduce a flaw that brings down entire systems and can cripple a business. From a broader perspective , software development teams can fall into a " we'll-fix-it-later " mentality , forgoing the discipline required in all other fields of engineering. In essence , the ability to change software and change it rapidly is good for business because it enables innovation , but it can also be bad for business if poorly managed because it can lead to poor software quality . </introduce.v.151><introduce.v.152>Washington - Today Sen.

The heroin addicts who had excess supplies sold off what they did not need and in order to create a profitable market for themselves encouraged their friends and neighbours to start using the drug. Those few British doctors spawned the first of the country 's drug pushers. After all , one of the classic ways of acquiring a drug market is to give away free supplies of a drug to non-users who try the free sample , like it and then have to pay for their supplies. This technique is regularly used by professional drug pushers. Incidentally , shortly after the benzodiazepines were first introduced into Britain supplies were donated free to hospitals in order to calm government anxieties about the cost. This mass marketing programme must surely have helped lead to the massive addiction problem which now exists . </introduce.v.284><introduce.v.285>Piano strings ( also called piano wire ) , which must endure years of extreme tension and hard blows , are made of high quality steel.

Far and away the vast majority of violence and violation that we are directly exposed to comes through the position of witness. Nor is there only one position from which we witness : we may be aware of what we are witness to or unaware , empowered or disempowered in relation to it. Many people in the humanitarian , therapeutic and human rights fields experience themselves as aware and disempowered witnesses to what they observe daily. The task is always to find ways to become empowered. Healing of memories and helping others to do so is one essential way people can move from feeling disempowered to empowered. Self-reconciliation , self-care , forgiveness , reconciliation processes can all be paths to move from the disempowered to the empowered position. But they need not be. The " demand " or " expectation to forgive may be disempowering in the extreme.

Basically , in a nutshell , a lot of thought was put into making the King 's Quest world as beautiful as possible , as easy to navigate and communicate with as possible , and as engaging and entertaining as possible.

In 1907 Ory took his Woodland Band to the city. Over the course of the next decade , he upgraded his personnel to include such future jazz stars as Joe Oliver , Louis Armstrong , Johnny and Warren Dodds , and Jimmie Noone. Ory was also a talented promoter.

When morphine was first introduced it was recommended and widely prescribed as an entirely safe , non-addictive alternative to opium recommended , ironically , as particularly suitable for people who seemed to be hooked on opium.

Calling it the " death tax " is a way to misrepresent it and load the emotional argument against it. It would be like if I were in Congress and I introduced a bill to exempt 6'3 " Jewish cartoon writers from all taxes and called it The Stop Torturing Kittens Law or something like that.

Good negotiating involves both skill and understanding of what one is doing. This course pays attention to both. Students participate in and critique several simulated negotiation exercises , drawn from varied aspects of legal practice. The course also surveys key modern ideas about negotiation. The last few decades have seen a substantial growth in the breadth and richness of negotiation theory , and the course will pay attention to how theory can usefully inform practice.

Lenina is first introduced as a lab worker in the London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. She is described as the ideal character for the society of the novel perfect in appearance and behaviour. Lenina 's trust in the system can be somewhat explained by fact that she is of the Beta caste ( less intelligent than the Alpha ) . Lenina has romantic relationships with both Bernard and the Savage , and both are similar in several ways : Lenina sees them as the ideal person in her society brief relationships that are mainly based on sexual relations and meaningless talk while Bernard and the Savage want deeper and longer relationships that have real meaning. Once Bernard and the Savage realize this they seem far less interested in the relationship . </introduce.v.388><introduce.v.389>From what I have learned about the Healing of Memories ( HoM ) workshops , theatre is often used as a way to help participants retrieve these memories. As Amber notes ( quoted above ) , people sometimes struggle with a lack of memories. The HoM workshops take a creative approach to helping participants retrieve memories - they use theatre ! IHOM has a relationship with a local theatre group that creates a short play based on the context of the workshop. The theatre group performs this play for the participants. IHOM has expiremented with a spin on this use of theatre in their workshop - they introduced Playback Theatre. IHOM used the playback theatre methodology in a workshop in New York.

While only ten states plus Puerto Rico currently have some variant on a voucher program , sixteen other states introduced legislation during the 2002 session to create some form of school voucher. Since the Supreme Court 's decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris ( 2002 ) removed what was widely perceived to be the most formidable legal barrier to vouchers , more states are likely to consider enacting voucher programs in 2003 , and are also likely to take advantage of the choice and flexibility provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ( NCLB ) . NCLB is the first federally supported ( though not mandated ) program that allows federal funds to purchase educational services from private entities. As more voucher programs are initiated , students with disabilities will be increasingly affected , especially if some of the programs are created specifically for students in special education . </introduce.v.417><introduce.v.418>CIR ASAP differs from comprehensive immigration reform bills introduced in 2003-2004 , 2005-2006 , and 2007-2008 in that it contains no new guest or temporary worker program.

First , they are in control of what kind of computer set-up the child has , where the computer resides in the household , and what kind of access the child has to the computer. As noted above , parents also purchase the software their child plays with. And as we have seen , software is everything , so parental knowledge and judgment in this area have a major impact on what a child gains from the computer. Once the computer is set up and software is purchased , there is the question of how productive and beneficial a child 's time on the computer will be. The parent has an important role to play here as facilitator. Young children typically need an adult to guide their discovery process and to ensure that they challenge themselves. Monitoring a child 's computer usage is just as essential. By reviewing hard copy output of a child 's computer activities , for example , the parent can track her abilities to accomplish the task at hand. This enables the parent to supplement learning or introduce new experiences and challenges at the right time . </introduce.v.421><introduce.v.422>As a member of The Golfers Club you will be able to use our 'Introduce a Friend ' feature.

Answer : A new type of " authoring " tool has emerged to take advantage of some of these object-oriented techniques used in OOP. These object-oriented authoring ( OOA ) programs do not provide all the capabilities of object-oriented programming , but they include a number of object-like methods. These authoring systems provide graphics tools and a set of standard " objects " that can have a number of different on-screen characteristics ( they can also be made invisible ) . These on-screen objects can be used to create screen displays that respond to user input , giving nonprogrammers an easy way to prototype applications programs. OOA systems are especially useful for creating applications that give the user a way to interact with graphics-oriented conventions like those used with the Microsoft Windows operating environment and the Apple Macintosh operating system. The first OOA program , HyperCard , was created in 1987 and was introduced to Macintosh users when it was given away free with every Macintosh sold. A similar OOA program , ToolBook , made by the Asymetrix Company , can be used to create applications that run with the Windows operating environment . </introduce.v.443><introduce.v.444>" Events across the nation , events across my community , events across my state , led me to introduce this legislation , " said sponsor state Sen.

Bills may be introduced in the Parliament by ministers or private members. The former are called government bills and the latter , private members ' bills. Bills may also be classified as public bills and private bills.

The movement is actually an intermezzo , or transition , linking directly to the Finale. The bridge , however , is very long , building up considerable tension before finally resolving in the Finale.

The Danish government made an important step two years ago when it decided to introduce heroin maintenance for the most vulnerable group of heroin users. The program will start soon. However , there is no supervised injection facility in Denmark ( like Insite in Vancouver ) , so many people use heroin on the streets , in a risky environment where they face police harassment as well. The local police designated so called no-go-zones in the city center. Homeless drug users are not allowed to enter these zones , even if this makes it difficult to approach the needle exchange service.

It reported that the chief source of illicit heroin were the Turkish poppy fields. The opium was being smuggled through the Lebanon to Italy and France , where it was converted into heroin and exported to the United States. There was little prospect of interception , as the people involved were untouchables; the Mafia , in Italy , and unknown but evidently influential figures in France.

The drug-using career milestones between men and women suggest that drug-using careers are faster in women than in men in this population , with time from first marijuana to injecting being 5.38 years in women and 8.99 years in men. However , with few exceptions , the milestones appear to be similar in order. The exceptions appear to be Mandrax and Valium. Valium came after first heroin injection in women by approximately one year and before heroin injection in men by approximately one year.

The second theme is a poetic , yearning double melody in which the orchestral violins soar upward while the solo violin moves expressively into its low register.

Starting in 1991 , Professor Machover began a new phase of hyperinstrument design , where he focused on amplifying stringed instruments and outfitting them with numerous sensors. He began with a hypercello piece entitled " Begin Again Again ... , " then wrote " Song of Penance " for hyperviola in 1992 , and presented " Forever and Ever " for hyperviolin in 1993.

In balancing Rule 403 , the trial court must consider the need for the evidence , and the offer to stipulate over the reduction in need for other proof.

In felony-in-possession , it doesn ' t matter what type of felony it was. It can be introduced to establish motive or intent , when motive and intent is at issue.

The differential effects of amphetamine on conditioned and unconditioned behaviours are used to support the hypothesis that drug tolerance may occur in situations where the drug causes a reduction in reinforcement density.

It 's been said that the Three Tenors introduced a new audience to opera , but it 's more likely that this cash cow remained strictly a crossover pop act and was accepted as such. Pavarotti by himself , on the other hand , even when he lent himself to trash , was the real thing  " with that voice how could he be otherwise ? One can easily believe that innumerable receptive ears never before exposed to an operatically trained voice were attracted , intrigued and very likely wanted to hear more from a singer whose song seemed to be for everyone. In that respect alone , Pavarotti 's unique contribution to opera history was incalculable.

Newt Gingrich , shortly after winning reelection to a second term as House Speaker , announced , " There are no good excuses for selling drugs. There should be no tolerance for drug dealers. " Gingrich announced plans to introduce a bill " that says if you cross the American border with a commercial quantity of illegal drugs and the jury finds it 's the first time you 've ever done it , you get life without parole; if the jury finds you 're a professional narcotics trafficker who has crossed our border repeatedly , you get a mandatory death penalty , to send the signal we 're ready to save our children.

It is one of the most spine-chilling introductions in all of classical music , made more so by the contrasting secondary theme , a trio for the oboe , flute and cellos which , incidentally , is never heard again. The following Allegro fleshes out motives from the Introduction into a full-fledged theme , developing it with an almost savage energy that threatens to obscure the traditional sonata form. But Brahms was a classicist and introduces two new subsidiary themes into the Allegro , a gentle oboe theme , the mate to the one in the Introduction , followed by another stormy chromatic one with an ascending chromatic scale and its resulting tonal ambiguity , in keeping with the overall mood of the movement . </introduce.v.631><introduce.v.632>We are asking you , as a P &amp;P activist , to write today to both David Miliband and your MP and urge them to include a commitment to introduce a climate bill in the Queen ' s Speech.

These games all share an important characteristic : in any configuration , the moves available to either player are identical. Such a trait is most obvious in the game Nim , which makes no restriction on any player 's moves due to his identity. For Drawson 's Chess , this is not so apparent; since a player can only move pawns which belong to him. Games which possess such a characteristic are said to be non-partizan ( or impartial games ) , as opposed to partizan games ( or partial games ) , which will be introduced next . </introduce.v.633><introduce.v.634>A Melbourne man who was addicted to heroin for 14 years put it this way : " I used to pray they ' d introduce heroin trials.

It seeks to intensively supervise and manage offenders out of crime. It is an exciting new criminal justice initiative which targets drug-dependent offenders who are responsible for many crimes in New South Wales. It has been estimated that heroin addicts commit up to 30 break , enter and steal offences every month. The Drug Court program is a bold attempt to break that cycle. I am pleased to introduce a bill that has clear crime prevention objectives and targets. A key mechanism for achieving the crime prevention objectives of the program is to confront drug-dependent offenders with a stark choice . </introduce.v.635><introduce.v.636>I wonder why prostitution is illegal and marriage is legal , even though prostitution is described as the world 's oldest profession. In marriage , the wife becomes a licensed prostitute , and the wife is doing the same thing. The Chanakya Indian strategist and Writer rightly described a wife in marriage , A good wife is one who serves her husband in the morning like a mother does , loves him in the day like a sister does and pleases him like a prostitute in the night. The abolition of marriage on the Indian subcontinent will bring an end to the source of violence in marriages , the dowry system and any other form of oppression that men and women experience through marriage. Abraham Lincoln said , Marriage is neither heaven nor hell , it is simply purgatory. The religions of the world are trying their best to guide their followers towards heaven while some get married , many get divorced and new groups introduce gay marriage. Thousands are fighting to legalize gay marriage , while religions have declared a crusade to deny such rights . </introduce.v.636><introduce.v.637>Hon.

The United States believes that its letter to Weil notifying him of its intent to introduce other acts evidence at trial satisfies the requirements of Rule 404 ( b ) . The reporting requirement of Rule 404 ( b ) provides only that defendants in a criminal case are entitled to " reasonable notice in advance of trial . . . of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial. " Fed. R. Evid. 404 ( b ) ( emphasis provided ) . Here , Weil was provided notice of the government 's intent to introduce other acts evidence under Rule 404 ( b ) on or about January 22 , 1998 , more than 10 months before the scheduled trial is set to begin.

Though the army officially finds homosexuality intolerable , Artie introduces Stu to a discrete gay military network that looks out for each other. While covering stories , the young soldier sees sides of military life that do n't get printed between magazine covers , jotting down every detail. And though Stu and Mitch eventually do share shadowy evening smooches and sing of a happy future together , the dangers of both their love and their assignment at the front lines challenge their chances at happiness . </introduce.v.652><introduce.v.653>In response to problems related to privacy issues and computers , a number of laws have already been passed. The Freedom of Information Act , passed in 1970 , requires that government agencies allow citizens to know what information is filed on them. The Fair Credit Reporting Act , also passed in 1970 , requires credit bureaus to allow people to inspect and challenge any information in their credit records. The Privacy Act of 1974 makes it illegal for government agencies to collect information on citizens for illegitimate reasons. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 made it a crime to access computers without authorization in order to obtain classified information and protected financial information. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 provides privacy protection for computer communications , including electronic mail. This act makes it a federal crime to intercept these kinds of computer-based transmissions. Since these original laws were enacted , a number of other follow-up acts have been introduced to expand and clarify them at both the national and state level . </introduce.v.653><introduce.v.654>Moreover , the issue of instrumental music has been important in our history because other people made it important. There never would have been a sermon preached against instrumental music if no one had ever advocated introducing it into the assembly. To make out the opponents of instrumental music as the bad guys is to fail to understand history. The Restoration Movement was united on the subjects of music and activities in the assembly until the instrument was introduced. To accuse opponents of instrumental music of being divisive is to ignore the united common practice in the first place . </introduce.v.654><introduce.v.655>Now comes the cunning plan.

We have introduced serious compulsory treatment options. As they prove to be successful and , at least anecdotally , they seem to be successful they will be expanded through the drug accord and the mirror program and similar programs that involve exactly what the Hon.

Though virtually anyone can draft a bill , the rules of the Legislature stipulate that all bills must be in the form and style dictated by the Legislative Research Council ( LRC ) . Therefore , a legislator wishing to introduce a bill generally brings the idea or the draft of a proposed bill to the LRC where staff members either draft the bill or make final preparations on one drafted by others . </introduce.v.663><introduce.v.664>Front Row and the Apple Remote were introduced in the last version of the iMac G5 ( iSight ) , and it was kind of sluggish in that iteration.

Singing in stark unison , flute , clarinets and violins etch a spare melody of wide-open-spaces intervals. The brass provides tenderly virile commentary as the instruments gradually pile in for a first affirmation. As this fades , violas and woodwinds quietly introduce a second theme : close cousin to the first but more flowing and rhythmically active. This , too , builds to another climax until the trombones present the movement 's third theme. In a rising shape and more assertive in spirit , this melody is a harbinger of the Fanfare for the Common Man. The whole orchestra salutes it with dance-like music of great rhythmic energy. A marvelous passage of glittering percussion music leads to a stentorian climax of brass and drums : the peak of the arch. Then , a hushed coda , full of magical instrumental effects , leads back to the opening 's spare simplicity . </introduce.v.665><introduce.v.666>Note : When using our mystery party games , we always suggest you give each guest a name tag showing the name of the character they are playing.

Weil 's conclusory accusation that the United States intends to introduce the other acts evidence for an improper purpose is wrong.

A chirpy motif then appears in the woodwinds followed by an arresting hunting call on the horns. The latter attains big tune status with the piano and full orchestra only to fade into a reprise of what we heard at the very beginning of this movement. The piano next introduces a most attractive closing idea that 's taken up by the orchestra , ending things on a highly romantic note. The finale begins with a wonderfully audacious theme on the piano which soon gives way to a stately , English sounding melody played by the orchestra.

The state was forced to introduce regulating laws , for instance a particular age limit for the acquisition of drugs.

The result is a two tier system where some are registered and others are not. Some people have now drawn the conclusion that control is inconsequential because older children can simply pass the drugs on to those under the age limit outside the coffee shop. From 1984 to 1988 the number of dagga smokers over 15 years of age doubled in Holland.

It is difficult to determine who should be tested. Often times this question is answered in a way that exhibits different biases present in society. Targeted testing , which leaves testing up to the discretion of the hospital and physicians , introduces the possibility of significant bias in decision-making. Tremendous inconsistency is inevitable with targeted testing because it is highly plausible that identification can more be a function of area of residence , hospital policy , and physician prerogative [ 218 ] . One argument for universal testing of newborns is that it is the only way to employ testing devoid of social biases. A second argument is that universal testing also ensures that exposed infants who are detected will be able to receive all available services and treatment [ 219 ] . </introduce.v.766><introduce.v.767>To address this and other issues , the Mauritian parliament adopted the new HIV and AIDS Act at the end of 2006 which introduced a syringe and needle exchange programme and methadone treatment.

We discuss some prisoners ' dilemmas in the real world and some possible real-world remedies. With other plausible payoffs , our game is a coordination problem and has very different outcomes : so different payoffs matter. We often need to think , not only about our own payoffs , but also others ' payoffs. We should put ourselves in others ' shoes and try to predict what they will do.

A plasmid containing a transcriptional fusion between the tetR-regulated P ( tet ) promoter from Tn10 and a FACS-optimized gfp gene was constructed . When harbored by Escherichia coli , this plasmid produces large amounts of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) in the presence of tetracycline . This tetracycline biosensor was used to detect the production of oxytetracycline by S . rimosus introduced into sterile soil . The tetracycline-induced GFP-producing biosensors were detected by FACS analysis , enabling the detection of oxytetracycline encounters by single biosensor cells .

Although Public Bills may be introduced by a Minister of the Scottish Government , an individual Member of the Scottish Parliament , or a committee convener , and range from major Bills of Scottish Government policy to small amending Bills , Budget Bills and Bills to tidy up the statute book , commonly they all involve only changes to the general law and matters of public policy. As such , they are subject to a process that is entirely parliamentary in character and in which only MSPs , elected to serve the public interest , participate. Private Bills are different in that they involve measures sought in the private interests of the promoter , and to which others may object , also in a private capacity. The role of the Parliament remains to legislate but , because of the nature of the issues at stake , it is also to arbitrate between competing private interests. That calls for procedures that are both parliamentary and quasi-judicial in character . </introduce.v.892><introduce.v.893>The psychological aspects in a drug rehabilitation program will try to re-orient the drug dependent person to interact and socialize by being drug-free. Part of the treatment process is to introduce new ways in the person 's lifestyle that will make him depart from the old habits that led him to addiction. In addition , he will be discouraged from associating with persons who are still actively using the addictive substances . </introduce.v.893><introduce.v.894>A multi-party system can lead to a coalition government as Germany and Italy have experienced. In Germany these have provided reasonably stable governments and a successful coalition can introduce an effective system of checks and balances on the government that can promote political moderation. Also many policy decisions take into account all views and interests. In Italy , coalition governments have not been a success; many have lasted less than one year. In Israel , recent governments have relied on the support of extreme minority groups to form a coalition government and this has created its own problems with such support being withdrawn on a whim or if those extreme parties feel that their own specific views are not being given enough support . </introduce.v.894><introduce.v.895>Kari hoped that he would do well in the storywriter 's competition , but regretfully only about half of what he sang was understood by the all-American , all Appalachian panel of judges. He did much better in the guitar completion where talking was not a critical issue , but decided to strum three chords at the exact moment he was being introduced and drowned out what was being said about him. He was off to a bad start , knew it and then faltered over a total of three notes in the competition -- three notes more than some of the boys in the contest had trouble with ! He watched as the fireman lit the " far " to keep off the dampness off the night chill , and thought only of his meeting with Doc Watson and his " priceless " guitar with Doc Watson 's name on it . </introduce.v.895><introduce.v.896>Also , the BJP is slated to introduce the Insurance Regulatory Authority bill after this , which is equally if not more contentious. The IRA bill has pitted the BJP against its parent organisation , the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the many powerful trade unions. But Vajpayee has declared that the bill would be introduced , come what may . </introduce.v.896><introduce.v.897>The House That Crack Built is about more than drugs. It is about peer pressure , feelings , self-esteem , choices , action , communication , and responsibility. Issues that enter all our lives and have no boundaries. It is a valuable resource for anyone who has been searching for a way to introduce this difficult subject. It is also a refreshing change from the proliferation of preachy and self-righteous drug education materials of recent years and can be understood on many levels. As a powerful teaching tool , it can be the starting point for discussions , activities , and further study. Perhaps most importantly , it can have meaning for readers from the primary grades through young adulthood . </introduce.v.897><introduce.v.898>The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the participants to accompaniment playing styles on the autoharp which will allow participants to quickly and easily accompany folk-style singing or lead instruments in a jam by using simple strumming techniques on an in tune autoharp.

Feeling the beat and/or counting will be emphasized along with chord changes . </introduce.v.898><introduce.v.899>" Legislators from Mexican President Felipe 's Calderon 's National Action Party ( PAN -- Partido de Accion Nacional ) have introduced a bill in the Mexican Senate that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of drugs for 'addicts.

Donne , Herbert , Herrick , Jonson , Marvell , Milton all of the great poets of that century , and all of the minor ones ( as well as some now considered unreadable ) are represented there. The hundreds of poets who are at this moment contemplating editing yet another poetry journal or anthology need to ask themselves if they will introduce readers to future Eliots , Bishops , Ginsbergs , or Plaths or merely add more lineated prose to what Beckett would call " the impossible heap. " " The weeder is supremely needed , " Ezra Pound warns , " if the Garden of the Muses is to persist as a garden. " The new math analyzed here suggests that poetry is on Miracle-Gro and is rapidly becoming a jungle . </introduce.v.900><introduce.v.901>Chuck quickly gains his composure , much more so than the nurse , and he , Matt and I have a lovely visit. Nearly every time I visit Chuck , and I try to do so often , he loves to share that story if anyone new comes along , and he loves to introduce me as his pastor. He loves my baby and welcomes Daniel as if he were his grandson. Such sincere affection for one another is what I hope to have as a trademark for the ministry that God has called me to. On that hot June day , I love that God took such a funny and poignant visit and gave birth to a relationship filled with the Spirit. May each relationship be so blessed . </introduce.v.901><introduce.v.902>The term chocoholic was coined as a joke , but there really are people who call themselves a chocolate addict. Chocolate can be just as addictive as caffeine is. People crave this sweet substance , which can play havoc with any plans for weight control , or their overall health. In fact , a person who is deeply addicted to chocolate is in life threatening danger ! Anyone who wants or needs help with drug addictions like this will surely find it here when we introduce them to NLP and hypnosis . </introduce.v.902><introduce.v.903>The Patent Act and Patent Rules require that patent holders/applicants pay fees , including annual maintenance fees , in order for their patents and applications to remain valid for the duration of their 20-year term of protection.

Heroin was more widely prescribed until the 1970s when policy changes and the introduction of methadone curtailed its use. Similarly , in Sweden there was one large-scale prescribing program in the early 1970s. A number of proposals for prescription were put forward in the United States and the Netherlands at that time.

Hafeli , 48 the Court of Appeals held that a defendant could not introduce evidence of threats against persons other than the defendant to prove either reasonable apprehension or to show who was the first aggressor.49 The Hafeli court , however , relied on the then-existing rule that a defendant could not introduce evidence of specific acts of violence directed against members of his family.50 Given that the decisions establishing that rule were overruled in State v. Waller , 51 threats against persons other than the defendant should now be admissible on the same terms as acts of violence against others . </introduce.v.905><introduce.v.906>However , the true impact of software on the computer industry and on almost every other major industry goes well beyond product and services sales. We see the hundreds of millions of dollars that companies have been spending for thirty years on information technology , but industry estimates are that , over the years , 70-80 of the cost of business systems is in the development and maintenance of the software these companies write themselves. As corporations introduce automation into more " front-office , " and therefore more rapidly changing , areas of their business ( e.g. , sales and service vs. accounting and manufacturing ) , even more intense development and maintenance efforts are required. And then there 's the software in the products and services themselves : viewing the commercial impact of computing primarily in terms of corporate information systems is no longer valid . </introduce.v.906><introduce.v.907>Expomed is constantly striving to introduce new and innovative products that will enhance our customers health awareness.

And now , The Blue Bokes 3 , with that dishevelled-looking man sitting on the left with some sort of banjo on his knee , one with a much deeper sound box. Ian Anderson sits in the middle , reporting that he had been asked just before the band took the stage , " who 's going to introduce you ? " to which his response had been , " we 've already met. " After one song , he relents and identifies Lu Edmonds on the left , Ben Mandelson on the right. During the evening , Lu seems to change instrument with every song , a long-necked Turkish-looking item one moment , a guitar the next. Ben is less fickle , preferring mandolin , but switching to baritone bouzouki every now and then. In the centre , Ian plays guitar all the time , and sings on about half the songs . </introduce.v.911><introduce.v.912>Others introduced included Joseph A.

" The title obviously indicates that the anti-spam bill will feature a multi-pronged approach to fighting spam with a role for the CRTC , the Competition Bureau , and the Privacy Commissioner of Canada . </introduce.v.916><introduce.v.917>A repetitive cycle alternating between doubt and encouragement led to continual revisions , second guesses , and obsession over the minutest detail of scoring. At last in early 1859 Brahms was willing to introduce his First Piano Concerto to the public -- performing as soloist and with Joachim at the podium -- but its premiere a few days later in Leipzig was a fiasco that scarred the composer and reinforced his sense of caution ( it would take him more than two decades to write another concerto for piano ) . " At the end , " he plaintively wrote Joachim ( the Leipzig performance was led by a different conductor ) , " three pairs of hands attempted to applaud but were quickly stopped by unmistakable hissing all around. " Brahms went on to take a stoic view of the negative reception -- " It forces you to gather your thoughts and increases your courage " -- and made some further revisions to the score . </introduce.v.917><introduce.v.918>The third time was the charm.

While no longer the Executive Director of the Libertarian Party , I was appointed to work for fusion on behalf of the party and arranged a bill to be introduced by Rep. Jeff Barker ( D ) . Other bills were also introduced with the nudging of the Working Families Party and a new player , the Independent Party of Oregon represented by Sal Paralta. The bill which " got legs " and moved in the legislature was House Bill 2414 , backed by Paralta , so everyone dropped whatever else they were doing and threw their support behind it . </introduce.v.918><introduce.v.919>1976 - Sony introduced a Betamax VCR deck for $ 1300 and began aggressive advertising claiming that it " can actually videotape something off one channel while you 're watching another channel " and " build a library of your favorite shows.

A situation can be envisaged where we would be asked to help to produce evidence for a trial in the North of Ireland , a trial over which we will have no control. Certainly some of the trials that have taken place in the North in recent months and particularly one that took place there within the last week or two , give no confidence whatever that a person being tried for a kind of crime that is envisaged in this Bill would get anything like a fair trial. But we are being asked to introduce a Bill which , together with the Bill in the British Parliament , would be producing evidence and help to put people on trial before that kind of court . </introduce.v.922><introduce.v.923>2.

There were also red beans and rice banquettes on Monday ' s , and nightly dances at neighborhood halls all over town. The New Orleans sound was " good time " music , delivered in a rollicking , sometimes rough manner , which suited everyday people seeking music " with a feeling. " This spirit or emotional content connected the performer to the audience. It offered a musical communication in which all parties could participate ( as with the " second line " dancers who turned out for brass band processions ) . Despite their popular success at home , New Orleans bands often experienced difficulty in trying to win over new audiences in places like Chicago , New York , and Los Angeles. Coinciding with the First World War ( 1914-1919 ) , New Orleans musicians began to travel extensively. They frequently found themselves at an initial disadvantage in their attempts to introduce dancers to the New Orleans sound . </introduce.v.929><introduce.v.930>Thayer approach ( bursting bubble ) : the insurance company has introduced evidence : there would be no instruction regarding the effect of the presumption.

" Ascending Fellowship was set up to properly introduce the virgins into Complex Marriage. This practice also worked to prevent the young members from falling in love with each other and from limiting their range of affection to just the younger members. The main people picked to care for the virgins were people who were considered to be closer to God. These people were of course older and had a special title which was that of Central Member. These Central Members were allowed their pick of a partner over which they would have the responsibility of spiritual guidance.

It appeared to her that he was flirting too much and too obviously while she sat on the sidelines , feeling left out. Usually , Tim did n't even introduce Alice as his wife. If Alice said anything to Tim about her feelings , he told her that she was over reacting. As she became more and more hurt , resentful , and withdrawn , the emotional temperature in the marriage cooled considerably , and the marriage became less satisfying for both of them. Neither one knew what to do to improve the situation . </introduce.v.956><introduce.v.957>Starting with 8 , Frank Springer 's bold inks complimented Robbins ' moody lighting.

In 1968 new regulations were introduced , ensuring that doctors had to be licensed and drug addicts had to be notified to the Home Office. This meant that the addicts who had been created by the prescribing bonanza of the 1960s were now in difficulty and could no longer obtain their supplies quite so easily - and they certainly could no longer make a profit by selling supplies they did not need. The scene was set for smugglers and drug dealers to enter the British market and to start selling heroin. The increased number of addicts and the shortage of heroin made the situation perfect for the illegal suppliers. If the British had sat down and worked out a way to create an illegal drug culture in Britain , they could not have done it more efficiently or more effectively . </introduce.v.964><introduce.v.965>We will also introduce you to all of the popular dances so we encourage the entire bridal party to be a part of your if you have a song ( or songs ) selected , please bring the.

Professional situations in which artists introduce their ideas and answer questions about their practice studio visits , artist talks , press interviews are usually considered secondary to art-making and the final exhibited result. In these humorous , yet poignantly human works , the artists adapt or subvert these forms of presentation in order to test out a concept or reflect on their working process. In doing so , they stage a larger discussion of how art is promoted to and received by different audiences . </introduce.v.971><introduce.v.972>Over the past few years , several bands have made attempts on bringing the hallmarks of Classic Prog-Rock up to date Porcupine Tree , who refused to be labelled " prog " , OSI , who went too much out on a limb for some , Spocks Beard , a great idea overdone , and so on.

It has also led to the persecution and displacement of many thousands of citizens residing in the coca-growing regions. Soldiers conducting forced coca eradication operations have committed gross human rights violations including the harassment , torture , and murder of indigenous people in the Chapare region. The Bolivian human rights organization Assemblea de Derechos Humanos estimates that in the conflicts provoked by eradication campaigns between 1998 and 2002 , in Cochabamba alone , 33 coca growers were killed by security forces.

In 2007 , former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer introduced the same bill to legalize same-sex marriage that Governor Paterson is planning to reintroduce on Thursday. The bill passed 85-61 in the New York state assembly before stalling in the state senate.

A selection of " designer drugs " ( so called " analogous substances " ) has been created in order to open new black markets.

This pamphlet , intended for party propagandists , outlined the new system. One should keep in mind here the Marxist distinction between propaganda and agitation.

Weil is wrong. The other acts evidence is close enough in time to the charged conduct to be relevant and highly probative of issues such Weil 's and his co-defendants ' intent , knowledge , motive , lack of mistake or accident , and common plan or design in entering into the charged conspiracy. The benchmark for evaluating the probativeness ( including temporal proximity ) of the other acts evidence to the charged conduct is October and November of 1992 , not the Indictment date of November 13 , 1997. Here , all of the other acts evidence occurred close enough to the charged conduct to be highly probative of issues at trial.

Despite daily use of doses of heroin far larger than those commonly available in the United States , these men continued to perform their military duties without detection , and in some cases with distinction. Indeed , military personnel addicted to heroin were indistinguishable to their superior officers from their unaddicted comrades-in-arms -- - so indistinguishable that military authorities found it necessary to introduce urine tests to identify heroin users. Addicted military personnel whose terms of duty expired before the urine tests were introduced sometimes re-enlisted-either while in Vietnam or after sampling civilian life and civilian heroin in the United States in order to be close to the supply of low-cost , high-quality Vietnam heroin; these addicts were welcomed back into service with open arms , for their addiction was clinically undetectable.

In Fiscal Year ( FY ) 2000 , 293 million people , 89 million cars , 4.5 million trucks , and 572 , 583 rail cars entered the United States from Mexico. Unfortunately , the growing volume of commercial and pedestrian traffic that plays an integral role in our nation 's economy creates an infinite number of opportunities for drug trafficking organizations to introduce their illegal goods into the commerce of the United States. Illegal drugs are hidden in all modes of conveyances , including the compartments of cars and trucks , and the bodies and baggage of pedestrians. Some organizations may employ couriers who cross the desert in armed pack trains , or who act as human " mules " by strapping the drugs onto their bodies. The means by which illegal drugs enter the United States range from extremely sophisticated concealment methods to simply tossing the drug laden package over border fences to be whisked away on foot or by vehicle. Drug trafficking organizations also utilize boats and ships to position their stash of drugs close to the border for eventual transfer to the United States . </introduce.v.1055><introduce.v.1056>The foil packs are useful tools to encourage discussion and provide an ideal opportunity to give essential advice.

However , it was not legislation but social improvements which led to a reduction in the demand for the opiates. By the time the Dangerous Drugs Act was introduced in 1920 , the number of people using opium , morphine and heroin regularly had fallen dramatically , largely because under the leadership of social reformers such as Edwin Chadwick , Britain had built an impressive series of sewage works , water supplies and other public services which had dramatically reduced the incidence of cholera and other gastro-intestinal problems and had therefore reduced the need for the diarrhoea-stopping qualities of the opiates . </introduce.v.1074><introduce.v.1075>Initially the needle exchange program was introduced to slow the speed of the AIDS virus among intravenous drug users an honourable quest within itself.

In China in the 1950s a massive campaign was launched to eliminate opium usage. Heavy legal controls were introduced and people suspected of using opium were locked up without trial. The result was that huge numbers of opium users switched to using a legal drug - tobacco. The Chinese government was happy about this because of the profit it made. The end result was that today the Chinese people are beginning to show signs of tobacco-induced cancer and heart disease for the first time. Smoking opium is relatively harmless and the Chinese people have been converted to smoking tobacco which kills - by the law . </introduce.v.1089><introduce.v.1090>Defendant further argues there is no assurance of jury unanimity on the charge of possession of cocaine because the State introduced two items which contained cocaine residue.

The program features works chosen to represent this era when intellectual leaders sought to introduce reason as an alternative to the traditional authority of the church and concepts based in mythology through efforts of enlightenment.

It 's based on the true story of a drug smuggler who started out peddling weed in California and , through a chance encounter during a prison stay , met a man that would introduce him to the world of another of the most popular drugs on the planet : cocaine. It 's one of the movies here that focuses more on the addiction to power in the drug trade , rather than addiction to the drugs that are being smuggled.

The committee devised certain laws which can be very effective in controlling the narcotics production and trafficking. These include suggestions of bringing the local law in conformity with the 1988 UN convention on narcotics. However , till now nothing significant has been achieved in this respect because of many institutional hazards and pressing demands on country 's limited resources. Moreover , the main focus of Pakistani drug enforcement agencies is on narcotics seizures rather than being on the arrest and prosecution of major drug barons. These agencies lack institutional initiative , resources to follow up on seizures with case preparation , and co-ordination among each other. Political interference in the working of these agencies and the judiciary is yet another hurdle in enhancing the commitment of narcotics investigators.

The performance history of the Polonaise presents an interesting challenge to the modern notion of a fixed musical work of art. In the original version , the cello part is quite simple , with the piano getting the lion ' s share of the work , but Chopin himself revised the composition for a performance with a professional cellist in Vienna , adding the slow introduction. Ever since , not satisfied with the original ' s modest technical demands , cellists have produced countless editions of the piece , all of which introduce more virtuosic passagework in the cello part , often by transferring filigree passages from the piano part. I don ' t know which of these editions Ma was performing from , though his performance was certainly in keeping with this tradition , adding a liberal , yet effective and convincing , dose of virtuosic embellishment . </introduce.v.1171><introduce.v.1172>3.

In other countries , the first methadone programmes date from 1995 or later , although by 2001 all countries had introduced at least one. However , except in Slovenia , the number of programmes is limited and coverage remains very low indeed. In Slovenia , a nationwide network provides methadone treatment to perhaps 20 of the estimated total heroin-dependent population. In all other countries , coverage is less than 5 , and in many countries under 1 to 2 . This contrasts with an average coverage of well over 30 in the EU Member States ( Figure 2 ) .

The game situations we considered , Chicken , or The Prisoners Dilemma , or Stag Hunt for example , are simple toy games with a limited capacity to model real world interactions. Modeling complex situations with many strategies , spatial concerns , migrations among populations , rates of diffusion of memes , etc. , is much more complex. However , there are relatively simple , but definitely not toy , computer models ( by Gintis et al. , for example ) providing an evolutionary route for the fact that in our species prosocial tendencies are more successful than merely self-interested ones and hover around fixation. As best we can see , for primates survival of the fittest often occurs through cooperative means. In other words , a strong tendency to cooperate is often the key to Darwinian fitness : it pays to be nice. As we noticed , once we jettison or moderate the assumption of random interaction and introduce the idea that cooperators tend to hang together in cooperative structures , as in spatial games , the success of prosocial tendencies is often much faster , well within the temporal span of our evolutionary line . </introduce.v.1180><introduce.v.1181>Do n't feel you have to introduce your spouse to everyone at the function.

In the game the player can control a fleet up to four ships in battle. One ship is controlled directly at a time , while the other three are given commands either by switching control to the ship and changing its course and operations or by switching to an overview tactical map which reduces all enemy ships , friendly ships and objectives to a series of icons and lines.

This basic game could work well enough as a typical thinly themed Euro , but the designers take it a step further.

For example , before this study no one advocating or opposing the use of mandatory minimums had discussed the roles that either time horizons or the cost of arresting a dealer have in determining whether mandatory minimum sentences are the most effective tactic.

When cannabis is available only in well-regulated shops that do not serve kids and do not have other addictive substances , far fewer people in society become addicted to these other substances. Good regulation is the anti-gateway , if you will. The debate on this really should n't include the word " legalization " -- people envision joints being sold at CVS next to the Mylanta.

This 100 to 1 ratio is widely viewed as an unjustifiable disparity. Crack and powder cocaine are pharmacologically the same drug , and although the level of violence associated with crack is higher , it does not warrant such an extreme sentencing disparity.

He showed how the Narconon program can make a person more able , and gives that individual more abilities. The addict is the only person who can resolve their problem , because they were the one who created the problem to begin with. From Will 's own experience he was able to paint a picture for the audience that the quickest way to hurt someone was to introduce them to narcotics. He related this message to the very first time he was introduced to marijuana at the age of 13 , and where his life followed after that. All this was coming from an individual who beat his own addiction; overcame the obstacles , and is now passing his knowledge and experience on to others . </introduce.v.1298><introduce.v.1299>We all accept that energy companies need to make a profitthere is big investment to be made in the infrastructure and so forthbut at the same time they owe a social responsibility to their customers , and that needs to be met.

That would create a lot of good will for them and do a lot to help consumers with their bills at this time of very high energy and food prices.

Tempted by the promise of American aid , the Turkish Government agreed to try to stop poppy cultivation for the black market; and for a while the production of opium was restricted. But as the illicit marketeers were able to offer higher prices , this only meant that it was the supply of legitimatemedicalopium which dwindled. By 1972 some nations were running short; the Japanese representative complained at the U.N. that his country could only get half its legitimate requirements. At the same time the Turkish peasants , who had been instructed to stop growing poppies , were becoming restive. The payments they had received out of the American funds , they felt , were insufficient to compensate them for the loss of so lucrative a crop.

The name used for cannabis in East Africa is 'bhang ' a term from the Indian subcontinent. Variations such as 'banga ' , 'mbanje ' , 'bangi ' , appear to be corruptions of the term 'bhang'. Soldiers returning from the two world wars may have spread the plant and smoking habit. There are some indications that Rastafarians from Jamaica who migrated to Shashemene in southern Ethiopia imported the plant and habit. Shashemene is well known for cannabis abuse in Ethiopia ( ECA.PHSD 1994 ) .

Although John is born in a reserve and is a savage , his parents are not. John is first introduced when Bernard and Lenina visit the savage reservation , and is brought back to London with the two. The Savage falls in love with Lenina , but violently rejects her when she expresses her love as he starts seeing her as a symbol of civilization. From the very beginning , John despites civilization but his feelings reach their maximum strength when his mother dies. At that point John runs away and starts a new life by himself in an abandoned lighthouse. This proves impossible as the civilized people spy on him and see him as entertainment.

Somehow Brahms holds these countervailing tendencies in a persuasive balance.

Some of the people who thought he was their friend might have been jolted by the pointed jabs he took at them. There is a detectable coolness in his references to Charles G. D. Roberts , for example , and an unkind frankness in his portrayal of Lorne Pierce , the editor of Ryerson Press. What stands out , however , is the warmth of his feelings for Brown.

As the story goes , researchers in the areas of behavioral science , strategic planning , organizational behavior , learning and development as well as executives from Lego Company collided in 1996 at a University in Switzerland. The research resulted in the development of LEGO SERIOUS PLAY ( LSP ) - a creative , novel and experiential consulting method that facilitates strategic planning , team building , innovation mining , and change management through the use of LEGO bricks. Designed for the corporate environment , it made its formal debut in 2002 and since that time over 250 global organizations , in 27 different countries have used this facilitated thinking technique. Example companies that offer enthusiastic testimonials for the methodology include Daimler/Chrysler , Verizon Wireless , eBay , Ikea , WesWay and Pfizer.

Torelli also introduced the ritornello form and the use of three contrasting movements which was firmly established by Vivaldi who also added more virtuoso writing for soloist ( s ) . The earliest example of the mature Baroque concerto is by Torelli. Six of the 12 works in his Op. 8 Concerti Grossi ( 1709 ) are true solo violin concertos. In his Op.8 , No.8 Concerto for solo violin and string orchestra , there are three ( open ) ritornellos in expected keys in the last movement ( tonic to dominant; relative major to subdominant; tonic ) . Modulations were occurring within the ritornellos. Vivaldi 's first concertos ( Op. 3 ) were published in Amsterdam in 1711. He used close ritornellos in varying lengths with several themes in his concertos. He added the virtuoso element in solo parts. The Venetian type concerto superseded the Corellian type with its three movement plan , ritornello design and virtuoso solo parts. The classical examples of Baroque concerto grosso are : Corelli ' s Op. 6 ( No.1-12 ) and Handel ' s Op. 6 ( No.1-12 ) ( Corellian style ) and JS Bach ' s six Brandenburg concertos ( Vivaldian style ) . </introduce.v.1390><introduce.v.1391>Yesterday we first introduced you the new brand launched by 10.Deep , speaking to a more mature streetwear customer Division Garment Supply.

Civil actions are established in the same way as criminal child abuse cases. They are most often based on the results of toxicology screens performed on the child at the time of birth. There are questions today on whether a positive toxicology screen is enough to establish neglect , remove the child from the home , and ultimately terminate parental rights.

Chains introduced scientific management to meat production as relatively de-skilled slaughterers repeatedly performed discrete cuts along a conveyor-like 'dis-assembly ' line.54 This technology enabled management to weaken worker control over the production process and certain employers exploited their advantage.55 Yet , managerial control slipped during the post-war development of the industry as the desire of employers to kill and process quickly ever-increasing quantities of perishable stock enabled employees to extract valuable concessions , particularly during peak processing. Knowing that employers would not tend to support each other by refusing to accept stock otherwise destined for a company experiencing a strike , the unions only needed to agitate to extend across the industry the improvements gained at any one firm.56 Employers on the other hand had an incentive to reduce fluctuations in demand and supply to improve their bargaining position.57 They might achieve this objective by extending the kill and processing season . </introduce.v.1441><introduce.v.1442>In most criminal cases , the commonwealth 's attorney will present the court with evidence the defendant is guilty of a crime and the defendant will introduce evidence he or she is innocent.

The Police Foundation report recommends that certain changes be made to the classification of drugs , for example whilst heroin and cocaine would remain in Class A ( the most dangerous category ) ecstasy and LSD would transfer to class B and cannabis would become a class C drug.

After a soft preview , it is blazed forth by brass and percussion , serving as dynamic preparation for the work 's longest and most dramatic movement. A quick , swirling theme , introduced by oboe , grows out of this and generates a dancing fugato , as the other instruments imitate it. Eventually , the Fanfare itself joins in the dance. Belatedly , a second theme , broad and syncopated , sashays in. This music grows in frenzy until stopped dead in its tracks by loud , harshly dissonant chords. Tentatively , the woodwinds resume the dance , which gradually builds to a powerful restatement of the Fanfare. And near the end , we hear again , high in the strings , the simple theme with which the symphony began. Shedding his usual love of understatement , Copland closes his victory symphony with a grandeur that must have delighted Koussevitzky , just as it still delights audiences today . </introduce.v.1576><introduce.v.1577>Iceland govt to introduce bill on EU talks -PM - Forbes.com Home Business Tech Markets Entrepreneurs Leadership Personal Finance ForbesLife Lists Opinions Video Blogs E-mail Newsletters People Tracker Portfolio Tracker Special Reports Commerce Energy Health Care Logistics Manufacturing Media Services Technology Wall Street Washington CIO Network Enterprise Tech Infoimaging Internet Infrastructure Internet Personal Tech Sciences Security Wireless Bonds Commodities Currencies Economy Emerging Markets Equities Options Finance Human Resources Law &amp;Taxation Sales &amp;Marketing Management Technology Careers Compensation Corporate Citizenship Corporate Governance Managing Innovation CEO Network Reference ETFs Guru Insights Investing Ideas Investor Education Mutual Funds Philanthropy Retirement &amp;College Taxes &amp;Estates Collecting Health Real Estate Sports Style Travel Vehicles Wine &amp;Food 100 Top Celebrities 400 Richest Americans Largest Private Cos World 's Richest People All Forbes Lists Business Opinions Investing Technology Opinions Washington &amp;The World Companies People Reference Technology Companies Events People Reference Companies People Companies Events People Reference Companies Events People Reference </introduce.v.1577><introduce.v.1578>Gov.

It proposes to design an enforcement program ( of fixed duration ) that minimizes the total cost to society from both the market and enforcement , subject to the constraint that the market be eliminated by the end of the program.

In turn , international drug policy has been influenced by America 's status and war on drugs , as well as by the legacy of alcohol 's prohibition which has introduced draconian drug laws producing punishments unfitting to the crimes committed. Law enforcement has not significantly deterred drug use or drug trafficking. The United States has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world , with drug-related offenders in state prisons reaching an all-time high ( www.druglibrary.org/ ) .

As the international control efforts against heroin have been directed chiefly at the " Golden Triangle " area of Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe , traditional opium poppy growing regions , the traffickers have simply begun to introduce opium and heroin production in areas not traditionally known for this. Opium poppy cultivation has become so widespread in Mexico , that the country has emerged as one of the leading heroin suppliers to the U.S. market. Moreover , opium poppies have become the natural and preferred substitute crop for coca in South America , and heroin production in being introduced in Bolivia , Colombia , Peru and even Guatemala. Enforcement activities have thus led the black market to its own crop-substitution scheme , and opium poppies are being substituted for coca , with the inevitable result that any reduction in the supply of cocaine will be more than compensated for by a substantial increase in the supply of heroin.

The cut grooves reach very nearly to the center of the disc , leaving no room for a label , and given the primitive mechanics of disc reproduction in those days , there was simply no practical way to publish it. The only way to record the Liebestod or any continuous movement longer than about five minutes was to introduce an artificial stopping place and start again on a second disc , or make cuts in the music , or perform it faster than one would normally have done; all ruinous options for this particular piece.

The main variation in procedure between arranged marriages is in the nature and duration of the time from meeting to engagement. In an introduction only arranged marriage , the parents may only introduce their son or daughter to a potential spouse. The parents may briefly talk to the parents of the prospective spouse. From that point on , it is up to the children to manage the relationship and make a choice. There is no set time period. This is still common in many parts of the world and especially in India. The same pattern also appears in Japan. It should be noted that this open-ended process takes considerably more courage on the part of the parents , as well as the prospective spouses , in comparison to a fixed time-limit arranged marriage.

Castilian literature enters its Renaissance phase later , close to 1500 , in part because of political turmoil. Catalonia and Valencia had closer contacts with Italy , both through trade and because of the Catalan-Aragonese presence in Naples. The Renaissance phase begins in Catalan literature around 1388 , the date of Bernat Metge 's Valter e Griselda , and produces novels , such as Tirant , that introduce details of everyday life accurately observed and interpreted , making them the forerunners of Cervantes and the modern novel; while the Spanish novels such as El Caballero Cifar and Amad s de Gaula are more contrived , more artificial , and therefore less pivotal in the evolution of the novel in Western European literatures.

The longer playing time of these singles allowed the inclusion of extended dance mixes of tracks. In addition , the larger surface area of the 12 discs allowed for wider grooves ( larger amplitude ) and greater separation between grooves , the latter of which results in less cross-talk. Consequently , they 'wore ' better , and were less susceptible to scratches. The 12 single is still considered a standard format for dance music , though its popularity has declined in recent years . </introduce.v.1776><introduce.v.1777>Sanger said the probative value of the material would be " extremely weak , " and he called the prosecution 's attempt to introduce evidence about adoption sites " completely off the wall.

And the number of such people keeps on increasing with every passing day. So people who are looking for any way through which such habits can be curbed then getting admitted to a rehab centre would be the best solution. It is very difficult for an alcoholic to get rid of this habit all by themselves and therefore the need of getting help from an alcohol rehab arises. Alcohol rehabilitation is the first step that an alcoholic should take when he feels that he is in dire need of help. At times the alcoholic himself does not realize the fact that he needs help , in such situations his family members should take a step forward and introduce him to an alcohol rehabilitation centre , so that his treatment can start on time . </introduce.v.1784><introduce.v.1785>Since CBT treatment is brief , only a few specific skills can be introduced to most patients.

When the ballet premiered , The Kansas City Star dance critic , Paul Horsley noted , This engaging four-section piece , in its world premiere , had the passion of Russian ballet , the deft clarity of Balanchine and a loose , fresh , modern quality.

Pop rock , while still being somewhat popular in the 2000s , has taken a somewhat of a backseat to hip hop among the youth , while in other countries it is still considered the most popular genre. CD sales have dropped drastically since the making of devices like the MP3 player and the iPod , which use the downloading of songs off the internet , allowing the person to be able to listen to practically any music imaginable at any given time.

For example , at the last count thirteen countries had the death penalty for possessing or selling heroin and six countries had the death penalty for possessing or selling cannabis. Japan 's first drug control laws were introduced in 1870 and included decapitation with a samurai sword as the punishment for drug smuggling and today the Japanese are still extremely critical of what they regard as 'soft ' or 'lenient ' policies in many other countries - particularly toward drug users , who the Japanese punish almost as severely as they punish drug pushers. They believe that the user is as worthy of punishment as the supplier since without the user there would be no supplier. A simple argument which may be crudely logical , and which is supported vociferously by the drug producing nations who claim that control of those who use and buy drugs would automatically eliminate all sources of supply , but which does lack understanding or compassion . </introduce.v.1812><introduce.v.1813>The Mint knew it had a challenge on its hands when Congress mandated that the government agency create a dollar coin program similar to the state quarters in which the Mint would introduce four $ 1 coins each year depicting the presidents in the order in which they served.

You ' d think instead of coming up with dumb introductory puzzles that add nothing to the story , they ' d take the opportunity to let you know who everybody is. But no.

Following the tradition of Alvin Ailey , Ms. Jamison is dedicated to asserting the prominence of the arts in our culture , spearheading initiatives to bring dance into the community and programs that introduce children to the arts. She remains committed to promoting the significance of the Ailey legacy -- dance as a medium for honoring the past , celebrating the present and fearlessly reaching into the future.

Michel Tapi 's groundbreaking book , Un Art Autre ( 1952 ) , was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapi was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hoffman in Europe. By the 1960s , the movement 's initial affect had been assimilated , yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art , affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract Expressionism preceded Tachisme , Color Field painting , Lyrical Abstraction , Fluxus , Pop Art , Minimalism , Postminimalism , Neo-expressionism , and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to , and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with Hard-edge painting ( Frank Stella , Robert Indiana and others ) and Pop artists , notably Andy Warhol , Claes Oldenberg and Roy Lichtenstein who achieved prominence in the US , accompanied by Richard Hamilton in Britain. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art.

I isolate many of the basic physical parameters of gestural events and show how these form the " atoms " of gesture. Then I show how primitives can be constructed from such gestural atoms in order to form the structures of gesture , and , consequently , how the structures join to form sequences , how the sequences join to form grammars , and how the grammars join to form languages.

Unauthorised use of bup ( aka Subutex ) in jails stands at 1.9 nationally , but more than one inmate in 10 is taking it in several jails , and in some its one in five. Justice Minister David Hanson has decided to deal with this problem by forcing all jails to introduce random testing for buprenorphine ( currently only around two thirds of jails do ) . His theory is that random testing will act as a deterrent , pointing out that use of other drugs has fallen from 24 to 9 since random testing was introduced in 1997 . </introduce.v.1831><introduce.v.1832>I just got my wife to start going fishing with me a few weeks ago.

The quartet began with a mid-tempo avant-bop version of Odwalla picking it up from the first set until it broke down and the swinging stopped. The band was outside and with more power and intensity than they were the previous set and the intensity began to build until it became nearly unbearable. Favors began yelling , abandoning his bass and picking up a megaphone that at first would n't work and as he beat on it and shook it the megaphone came to life with a hiss of distortion , and Favors began to whisper into it incomprehensibly. The intensity continued to build as the horn players drew signals , perhaps not to themselves or to the listeners as much as to the universe and after more than forty five minutes Mitchell signalled the theme to the rest of the group and for a brief moment the intensity broke , and they stepped into Odwalla again at mid tempo avant-bop.

In the European Union , " Healthcare , educational and social policies are becoming more important in reducing drug-related problems in the widest sense , and it is increasingly recognised that the criminal justice system alone is not always capable of handling the problem of drug use. The link between social exclusion policy and drug issues is stronger in some countries , such as Ireland and the United Kingdom , than in others. Several countries in the EU have introduced legislative changes to facilitate the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts and other legal changes have opened up possibilities for early interventions among young experimental drug users. Denmark , Germany , the United Kingdom and Norway have increased healthcare investment in an attempt to reduce the number of drugrelated deaths. In line with the EU action plan ' s commitment to provide a variety of wide and easily accessible treatment options , some countries , for example Finland and Greece , have changed their financing schemes as well as regulations regarding substitution treatment.

" If that were so , he concludes , millions of people who are prescribed opioids for pain relief , some for very long periods of time , and who survive their illnesses and/or recover from their injuries , would emerge as stone-cold , life-long addicts. Very few do. Indeed , as cited in Hungry Ghosts , 4.6 percent of Canadians have tried crystal meth -- today 's scariest , " most addictive " drug -- yet only .05 percent had used it in the past year.

As in Tragler et al. ( 1997 ) , drug prices depend on enforcement ( the higher the level of enforcement , the higher the price ) , so there are also two different prices , and , which depend on and , respectively. The effective prices in social networks are higher than are those in street-markets because the distribution channels are more convoluted , but for the same amount of enforcement price responds less to increases of enforcement than does , because enforcement in social networks is more diluted . However , light users may react more strongly to changes of price , i.e. , their price elasticity of demand may be higher than that of heavy users. It is thus clear that both kinds of enforcement have their advantages and disadvantages , so the optimal enforcement strategy must finesse a difficult trade-off between enforcement against social networks and enforcement against street-markets , and it will be interesting to compare the results of this model with the ordinary light and heavy users model where there is no distinction in the enforcement strategies . </introduce.v.1869><introduce.v.1870>This is Trudi one more time.

Most probably by making them to operate what became known as the 'three-strikes ' system - two warning letters to illegal file-sharers and then net suspension. But by the start of 2009 , despite a general lack of action from the ISPs , ministers did n't seem too keen to pass those promised laws.

It had becomeobvious that narcotics could not be adequately controlled so long as each State had a different set of regulations , and a national Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws had been considering how best to unify them. In 1932 they put forward a draft narcotics law which , it was hoped , all States would introduce , imposing prohibition except for medical purposes. At this stage , the decision whether or not to classify hemp as a narcotic within the meaning of the Act was left optional. Anslinger , regarding this as unsatisfactory , determined to arouse public opinion to the marihuana menace. His Bureau therefore prepared a brochure in which it was claimed that , 'those who are accustomed to habitual use of the drug are said eventually to develop a delirious rage after its administration during which they are temporarily , at least , irresponsible , and prone to commit violent crimes '; and that prolonged use was 'said to produce mental deterioration ' . </introduce.v.1884><introduce.v.1885>On Thursday , Governor Paterson will introduce a bill to the state legislature to legalize marriage between members of the same sex ...

In the last Congress , more than 6 , 000 bills were introduced and only about 500 were passed into law. Fewer still establish substantive policy , since most bills passed by Congress deal with non-controversial issues such as the naming of a post office. Those bills that make or change important policies only pass as a result of deep commitment by the public or other interested parties. With each positive step forward such as a new piece of legislation the voices of the status quo continue to use the politics of fear , attempting to delay action and promote their own short-term interests. That ' s why UCS , our coalition partners , and our activists have to be there at every step of the process , making sure that Congress passes strong , science-based legislation to make our world cleaner and safer , strengthen the economy , and enhance national security . </introduce.v.1910><introduce.v.1911>Gay-rights groups are scheduled to convene in Albany early next month for a day of lobbying , and several lawmakers and same-sex marriage advocates said they hoped that Mr. Spitzer would introduce his proposal before then . </introduce.v.1911><introduce.v.1912>Many of you know that I was one of the primary people that worked on 'HB232 ' in 2003 when Ron Young had the guts to introduce what we believe to be the first equal custody legislation in the country.

For over 200 years , the First Amendment has allowed Americans to voice opinions , thoughts and questions of their choosing without the fear of Government reprisal. This guarantee is now threatened by some liberal ideologues who are frustrated with the free flow of ideas on talk radio. The bill we have introduced will stop them in their tracks and help protect the vibrant marketplace of ideas we have today in our media. I advise every American to be hesitant when government officials offer to regulate the media in the name of ' fairness. ' Our support for freedom of conscience and freedom of speech means that we must support the rights granted to even those with whom we disagree. Simply put , giving power to a few to impose ' fairness ' in the media is a recipe for an Orwellian disaster. </introduce.v.1915><introduce.v.1916>In the Village of Viger , dedicated to Scott ' s infant daughter , was published in Boston ( 1896 ) by Copeland and Day , who had heard of Scott through Bliss Carman and W.E.

Herbert Copeland and Fred Day were never among Parker ' s publishers , but he had been introduced to them by Bliss Carman , and they may have been looking for someone to duplicate his success. In a time when jaded literary appetites were being whetted by Kipling ' s tales of India and Rider Haggard ' s novels of Africa , readers had found Parker ' s version of Northern Canada to be equally exotic. A market had been created for stories of the Canadian frontier. </introduce.v.1916><introduce.v.1917>This is a great assignment to introduce differentiated instruction.

Their opinions are often based on knowledge provided by prohibitionist special interest groups and one-sided media reports. Because the issue is framed in terms of " drug abuse " and the " drug war " , they are unlikely to search out opinions discussing the merits of psychoactives. During hearings for the passage of many of the anti-drug laws , Congress has been unwilling to hear experts testify against their seemingly foregone conclusions. A classic case of this was the first criminalization of cannabis with the Cannabis Tax Act , where Congress turned away testimony against the bill from the American Medical Association. Unfortunately , this leads to an unbalanced view of the issue which allows no room for differentiating between harmful , dangerous drug use and the peaceful , healthy , and possibly spiritual use of psychoactives . </introduce.v.1964><introduce.v.1965>In line with this philosophy , Labour proposes to restore the role of unions , in particular by giving them the sole rights to negotiate collective contracts , impose more restrictions on the negotiation of individual contracts , allow strikes in support of multi-employer contracts ( thus facilitating a return to industry awards ) , bring dependent contractors under employment law , and introduce so-called 'good faith ' bargaining which would greatly extend the scope for judicial meddling in employment contracts.

It s been a while since that dimension of overdubbing on top of live performances has been open to me  I would like to do it a lot more.

When a prescribing bill is passed in California , we want to ensure that the licensing responsibility rests with an independent Board of Psychology rather than with an Omnibus Board that has just a single psychologist sitting among master s level licensees ( as was proposed the last time a sunset bill was pending ) . The prescribing bill introduced this year by NAPPP reflects a one-issue agenda that ignored the ramifications of introducing that kind of bill during the same session that the sunset of the Board of Psychology was on the legislative agenda.

By this time the string section already formed the basis of any large ensemble of players , with brass , woodwind and percussion being added variously as the situation demanded. By the end of the Baroque period ( c.1750 ) this was still very much the case , so that it was not until the end of the eighteenth century when the Classical period was at its height that a full woodwind section had become more or less established , often with the addition of horns , trumpets and timpani. It was finally during the mid-1800s that the orchestra settled into a regular , basic pattern of strings , woodwind , brass and percussion , with various 'exotic ' instruments being introduced from time to time . </introduce.v.2046><introduce.v.2047>Recently , Obama 's campaign staff have been vetted by the IRS to disclose his connection to the criminal money generating underworld.

Drug-monitoring authorities need to be alert to new drugs and technologies that may rapidly introduce transmission risks for blood-born pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B and C , and also to increases in sex work associated with a need to purchase new drugs , which may also be associated with disease transmission.

Thunders did his best to introduce his drug of choice to the London scene , in one instance waving a heroin-filled syringe in Vicious ' face and shouting , " Are you a boy or a man ? " But it was n't until a short while later , when a repulsed Johnny Rotten attempted to halt Spungen 's unwanted advances by introducing her to Vicious , that Sid 's heroin habit began in earnest. The couple took to each other immediately , as Spungen fulfilled her ambition of bagging a Sex Pistol , while Vicious identified with her outcast status and ( some friends thought ) endured her whining , stupidity , and instability simply because no one wanted him to be with her. As a member of the Sex Pistols , Vicious became an instant star; the resultant ego inflation and opportunities for indulgence , coupled with Spungen 's voracious appetite for drugs , spelled trouble . </introduce.v.2059><introduce.v.2060>The Classical Music Series is a season of concerts in Derry given by world renowned musicians.

A similar bill is expected to be introduced in the Senate sometime this session. But it 's unclear how far the effort will go as legislators grapple with state budget cuts and falling revenues. Zuckerman , a progressive , says the economy is the biggest issue in the Statehouse but says there are other committees that can handle other issues.

However , the same was true of all cases irrespective of the cause of infection , and the trend is linked to the effectiveness of tritherapy treatments introduced in 1996. When it comes to assessing the impact of syringe accessibility , it is more relevant to observe trends in the rates of HIV positivity among intravenous drug users.

System and performance testing can not be performed efficiently if the application under test is riddled with architectural defects and bugs that should have been identified and eliminated during unit testing.

Moreover , the Japanese were combatants who fought , and died , in a very different way from other participants in World War II. Code of Bushido 's treatment of the Japanese was a stroke of genius -- the Japanese in ASL are perfectly integrated into the system , yet extremely different in nature. As a result , they are one of the nationalities considered the most fun to play in ASL.

The underlying problem that leads to the addiction usually includes family issues , peer pressure , bullying or other related issues. The addict can escape from these problems through their addiction. Addiction counseling forces the addict to recognize these issues and cope with their problems in a healthy , more effective way. Addiction counseling will also focus on the individual ' s strengths and weaknesses. Addiction counseling will work with the individual to recognize these weaknesses and find ways to avoid situations that the addict finds difficult to handle. The addict ' s strengths will be acknowledged and built upon so that the individual can find ways to introduce these strengths into otherwise difficult situations that may interfere with his or her recovery. The counselor will also offer practice in dealing with negative social interactions and explore ways to deal with them in certain social situations. For example , the counselor and the recovering alcoholic may role-play a variety of social situations that the individual may encounter alcohol.

Evid. 404 ( b ) , the Government also seeks to introduce two prior firearm convictions , both entered in 1996.5 As to the first Beechum prong , the Government contends that such convictions are relevant to prove that Defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed the firearm , as well as to refute the proposition that law enforcement mistakenly attributed the weapon to him. In response , Defendant argues that the prior convictions involved actual possession cases , while the instant firearm charges are predicated on constructive possession. Thus , according to Defendant , the mental state necessary to exert actual possession over a firearm is not equivalent to the intent necessary to exert dominion or control over a firearm , as required in constructive possession cases. See United States v. Gunn , 369 F.3d 1229 , 1235 ( 11th Cir. 2004 ) ( a defendant. . . has constructive possession if he has the power and intention to exercise dominion or control [ over the firearm ] ) . </introduce.v.2372><introduce.v.2373>Example : D is prosecuted for robbery. D would like to introduce evidence that the victim had had a few drinks before the occurrence. Is this evidence relevant ? Four or five drinks might help to show that the victim was intoxicated. But is this material ? is it a fact of consequence ? Intoxication of the victim is irrelevant with respect to proving robbery. It ' s not a defense.

After being overruled by the Supreme Court , Mendelson plans to introduce a bill containing the exact same provision that was ruled unconstitutional ! Since no one gets a certified letter stating they are going to be attacked at a future time and date , the only way to have a gun for self-defense purposes is if it is loaded and fully functional at all times . </introduce.v.2374><introduce.v.2375>6.17 In determining whether an amendment would be inconsistent with the general principles of the Bill , a similar rule-of-thumb to that described under Relevance above is employed. That is , where a Bill is introduced with only one or two principal purposes , an amendment to leave out ( or substantially alter ) that purpose or one of those purposes would not be admissible; but where the Bill was introduced with three or more purposes , it may be possible to leave out by amendment any one of them without wrecking the Bill. In taking a view in any particular case , account would be taken of how substantial the purpose is , the extent to which the remaining purposes would be affected by its removal ( or substantial alteration ) and how close it is in terms of subject-matter from the other purposes of the Bill. Thus it may be possible to remove by amendment from a multi-purpose Bill a minor purpose that stands apart from the remainder of the Bill and on which the rest of the Bill does not depend , but not to remove a substantial purpose that is central to the Bill as a whole . </introduce.v.2375><introduce.v.2376>By now it is evident that law enforcement should not be the first line of defence against illicit drug control. But for any strategy to be effective , and develop new and innovative demand reduction controls , it requires time to bit , which can only be attained via law enforcement ( in the role of supply reducer ) . " We have to deal with the now while we prepare for the future " . For this reason , enforcement should primarily seek to stop as many traffickers and importers as possible before they have the chance to sell narcotics to users or introduce narcotics to potential users. Furthermore , they need to restrain and seize the financial and material resources of organised criminals in order to negate their financial backbone . </introduce.v.2376><introduce.v.2377>The structure of CBT sessions ( and the 20/20/20 rule ) is intended to integrate skills training with effective , supportive therapy that meets the needs of each patient as an individual. Novice therapists , particularly those with little experience in treating substance abusers or unaccustomed to a high level of structure in treatment , often let sessions become unfocused , without clear goals , and do not make the transitions needed to deliver skills training effectively. Such therapists often wait to introduce skills training until the last few minutes of the session. This results in rushing through important points , failing to use patient examples or get patient feedback , and neglecting review of the practice exercise - all of which gives the impression that skills training is not very important . </introduce.v.2377><introduce.v.2378>The INCB noted that " In the Americas , traffickers are turning to new routes of diversion and to preparations containing pseudoephedrine as a source for illicit methamphetamine manufacture. In response , under Project Prism , the international initiative focusing on ATS precursors , Governments have started to introduce voluntary measures to identify and prevent such diversions , such as the assessment of licit requirements in the substance and the sending of pre-export notifications for pharmaceutical preparations containing pseudoephedrine. Exports of pseudoephedrine to Mexico increased five-fold between 1998 and 2004. A number of suspicious shipments of pseudoephedrine to that country were identified in 2005. In response , the Mexican authorities have prohibited brokers from importing pseudoephedrine , and reduced imports of the substance by half.

Violinists will find it 's a perfect showcase for their art , because the composer worked closely with its dedicatee , British/Italian virtuoso Alfredo Campoli , while writing it. In three movements , the first must be one of Bliss ' most lyrical creations. It 's followed by a brilliantly orchestrated scherzo , which is apparently done in full without a cut that was later authorized by the composer. The album notes tell us , and quite believably so , that it was inspired by Berlioz ' Queen Mab scherzo.

Such a process clearly lends itself to early defect tracking , which can shadow development ( see Figure 2 ) . Each build can receive verification that it meets the defined requirements; if not , defects can be reported and resolved quickly and relatively inexpensively while the software is still " pliable.

( 5 refs. ) Due to the dynamics of drug consumption , it is important to understand the main toxicological aspects of blood , noticed in drug addicts , in order to establish the most adequate , efficient , preventive and therapeutic methods , so as to diminish this phenomenon. The products resulting from the two antagonistic metabolic processes ( anabolism and catabolism ) are continuously introduced or eliminated in blood , because blood maintains the connection between different organs and tissues and between different cells and digestive organs. As a consequence , we may consider that the entire composition of blood deviations from normal ( deviations that surpass sanguine homeostasis ) , are significantly correlated with body pathology. Moreover , blood is one of the most accessible tissues in the human body and it can be collected and analyzed without harming the patient . </introduce.v.2444><introduce.v.2445>6.

Whenever a new element is introduced into man 's biological cycle the brain adapts to this newcomer and this new element becomes part of the body 's biological circle. If the element is taken away , the body will suffer. Similarly the mosquito , spider etc. will die if the environment changes. Human beings can adapt. If man goes to a cold place , his body will do a lot of things to adapt to the cold. With narcotics being introduced to the brain , the substance changes the health dynamics of blood pressure , heartbeat and pain regulation , and the suffering is great when the substance is taken away. It is the same concept , and Waismann can prove that such a thing as addicted personality does not exist . </introduce.v.2582><introduce.v.2583>Zydeco Nathan Williams ' previous studio CDs always introduced great new compositions into the zydeco canon , including " Everything on the Hog.

Joao Gilberto 's soothing voice perfectly communicated the beauty of Jobim 's music. The late '50s film Black Orpheus helped introduce Jobim 's compositions to an American audience. Other important early exponents of bossa nova were guitarist Charlie Byrd , tenor saxophonist Stan Getz ( Byrd and Getz teamed up for the highly influential Jazz/Samba ) , and housewife-turned-singer Astrud Gilberto who , along with her husband ( Joao ) and Getz , made " The Girl From Ipanema " a huge hit.

As the Task Force explained , " [ p ] resently , substance abuse facilities must apply for a Certificate of Need if they intend to introduce new services , relocate existing services , or change the services they offer at an existing location. This time-consuming process can take months to complete , resulting in added costs to providers and inefficient utilization of treatment beds and outpatient slots. CON application fees place a further burden on providers. There is some question as to whether the Certificate of Need process for substance abuse facilities , as currently structured , is serving a meaningful purpose. " In the light of these considerations , the Task Force recommended exemption of , or significant modification to , the CON requirements as they relate to addiction service programs. The substance abuse treatment programs currently exempt from the CON process by statute are simply too few . </introduce.v.2635><introduce.v.2636>It should also be acknowledged that the term " second generation " is misleading , since there is often not a direct progression from mimetic , " first generation " designs to transformative , " second generation " ones. In fact , as Professor Machover has pointed out , the history of development of these instruments has shown that some of the most transformative models have come first , only to be followed by mimetic ones. For example , the " Theremin , " which will be introduced in the following section , was an early example of an extremely unusual musical interface which was followed by the advent of the electric guitar and keyboard. Also , early computer music composers , such as Edgar Varese and Karlheinz Stockhausen , were extremely innovative with their materials , whereas the latest ones have made use of commercial synthesizers and standardized protocols such as MIDI. Similarly , Europeans , the initiators of the classical concert tradition , have tended to be more revolutionary ( perhaps from the need to break with a suffocating past ) , whereas the Americans , arguably representing a " second-generation " culture derived from Europe , have primarily opted for mimetic forms ( perhaps from the perspective that the past is something of a novelty ) .11 </introduce.v.2636><introduce.v.2637>I 've heard bits of a talk from these experiments and it seems pretty clear that addiction is caused by genetic affinity for a substance and easy availability of substance. For instance , you can get rats addicted to sugar just as easily as you can get them addicted to cocaine or heroin. You give rats nothing to do but take heroin you get junkie rats. You give rats a four-way decision between food , play , heroin , and sugar , they are just as likely to pick food or play over heroin or sugar. Introduce the option to visit a mate in heat and that choice becomes even more difficult to predict. The more options they have the more the choice depends on the whims of their mood. It 's all genetic affinity and context . </introduce.v.2637><introduce.v.2638>The construction of lightsabers in the new Order differed from that of the old in many ways. Luke Skywalker discovered records in Obi-Wan Kenobi 's hut on Tatooine on how to construct lightsabers that he used himself , and would later introduce to his students. Some other techniques were also recovered by the Jedi , sometimes in less than desirable ways. The malevolent spirit of Exar Kun guided Gantoris in making a dual-phase lightsaber , capable of extending dramatically in length when secondary crystals aligned. Skywalker discovered this , almost at the cost of his life , when the rogue student challenged him to a lightsaber duel. [ 17 ] Corran Horn constructed a similar lightsaber independently , using a process obtained from his ( step ) -grandfather , Rostek Horn. [ 16 ] Occasionally , exceptional students , such as Jaden Korr , were able to construct lightsabers on their own , without formal instruction. [ 29 ] Luke Skywalker also constructed a shorter lightsaber , known as a shoto , to fight Lumiya during the Nagai-Tof War. [ 7 ] This was designed to counteract the dual nature of her weapon , known as a lightwhip. Skywalker kept this weapon for many years , and taught other Jedi Masters , such as his wife Mara , how to construct them. [ 58 ] </introduce.v.2638><introduce.v.2639>Hi.

Two thermostable mutants were isolated after sequential rounds of error-prone PCR performed to introduce random mutations and filter-based screening of the resultant mutant library; we determined that these mutants had six ( mutant TA3 ) and seven ( mutant TA13 ) amino acid substitutions . Different types of substitutions were found in the two mutants , and these substitutions resulted in an increase in nonpolar residues ( mutant TA3 ) or in differences between side chains for polar or charged residues ( mutant TA13 ) . The wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified , and the effect of temperature on the stability and catalytic activity of the enzymes was investigated . The melting temperatures of the TA3 and TA13 enzymes were increased by 7 and 11 degrees C , respectively , compared with the melting temperature of the wild-type enzyme .

While an excellent bassist indeed - technically - his musical approach has sounded a bit unnatural and sometimes irrelevant in context of TFK music. Sort of like using a pair of channel locks for a job when what is really needed is a set of surgical tweezers. On Unfold the Future it appears that he 's developed the type of instinct and musical " sixth sense " needed to blend with TFK sound very effectively. In addition , a noticeable change in the direction and nature of TFK music emerges , resulting from the effects of his influence - a musical version of the Heisenburgh Uncertainty Principle.

Some bills addressed the roles of health professionals; specifically , these bills often required doctors to report incidents of maternal substance abuse to the proper authorities; others required social service agencies to assess families affected by alcohol or drugs for abuse and neglect; and other bills introduced the requirement of commercial vendors who sell alcohol and tobacco to post warnings about the effects of these substances on pregnant women [ 148 ] . </introduce.v.2853><introduce.v.2854>[ ... ]  Two Ohio representatives have introduced legislation that would give the Ohio Capital Fund at least $ 100 million more to invest in the state  s growth industries , such as health care.

Due to the sentencing structure that is currently in place , it takes 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger the five and ten year mandatory minimum sentences. This means that those who deal powder cocaine can sell 2 , 500 - 5 , 000 doses before receiving the same sentence that those who deal 10-50 doses of crack cocaine receive. Further exacerbating this disparity is the fact that it applies not only to mandatory minimums , but it also effects the sentencing when amounts above and below the mandatory minimum thresholds are involved . </introduce.v.2855><introduce.v.2856>But the fact of the matter is , for the UW , there are few families and few individuals that are more important to us than the Gates family , not just Bill , of course , but his mother and his father , and his brothers brothers ? his sisters.

The Supreme Court has indicated that the Commonwealth can not merely introduce a drug certificate to prove that a retrieved product is contraband. Based on this new case law , in most cases , the Commonwealth is required to produe a chemist that examined the item and determined that is was an illegal drug.

While still in its youth SWAMP THING and HELLBLZAER were there to anchor the imprint.

People loved the world Gaiman had created so much that Vertigo kept publishing follow-ups and spin-offs , some of higher quality than others , that continue to this day. While that ' s fine in and of itself , it has made it awfully hard for anyone else to introduce works of horror that aren ' t overshadowed by the earliest , most influential Vertigo books. I admit to being partially responsible for this , as I still haven ' t read the graphic novels about the paparazzi , Lovecraft , and Poe that I ' ve heard such good things about.

In turn , their legislator sponsors a bill , which would allow them to receive the treatment in state.

At this time , processors introduced new methods of production and new payment systems in order to reap the potential benefits of diversifying their products and exporting to new markets. As new technology changed the nature of work in ways that threatened to further disrupt an industry with an already turbulent pattern of industrial relations , the employer representatives strived , with mixed success , to constrain the initiatives of their affiliates in order to present a united front to the industry 's powerful trade unions and to contain operating costs. In a market geared primarily towards exporting , these were not the only factors association officials needed to consider. As the paper explains , association bargaining strategy must be understood within the context of a broad set of interconnected organisational relationships that followed the production of meat from farmer to processor through cold storage and transportation to overseas consumer . </introduce.v.2974><introduce.v.2975>*You will receive your gift vouchers once the person introduced has worked through Law Support for at least 2 weeks in a temporary booking or 6 weeks in a contract/permanent role.

Such definitions are used in two ways : one is to introduce the reader to scientific concepts and the other possibly far more important is to add the scientific mood to the plot , using complex and long terms such as " Bokanovskification " to confuse the reader and introduce him to the futuristic world in which the novel takes place . </introduce.v.2993><introduce.v.2994>Jim Wilkinson , After Five president , presided at the meeting and called on Bill McCann to introduce the speaker.

He was also unusual in his preference for wind instruments; nearly all of his chamber music are for winds with or without piano. Each movement consists of sharply contrasting sections. The first , with a romp that owes much to Stravinsky , after two minutes breaks off abruptly , leaving the bassoon to introduce a slower-moving section.

When said by the Savage , this phrase has in it a metaphor , sarcasm and personification. The metaphor is the of the new world being advanced and powerful where everybody is happy and all problems are solved. The personification is of the world as being 'brave ' , a human quality that is assigned to the world to indicate , among other things , how society becomes unified and can be seen as one person.

Less than 2 percent of the working-age population was dependent on benefits in 1960 compared with 5 percent in 1980 and around 15 percent in the 1990s. Despite better average economic performance in the 1990s , the dependency ratio remains at 13 percent. While wider social and economic developments ( such as marriage breakdown , failures within the educational system and economic adjustment ) contributed to the growth in unemployment and welfare dependency , there can be little doubt that factors such as wider access to benefits and the level of benefits relative to wages the replacement ratio have played a key role. A new domestic purposes ( solo parent ) benefit was introduced in the 1970s and replacement ratios increased substantially in the early 1980s. For example , the maximum unemployment benefit payable to single adults increased from about 36 percent of the average ordinary time wage ( both net of tax ) in 1980 to 42 percent in 1985.

As you well know , the United States and particularly my State of California are already fully immersed in the fight against drugs.

Some researchers indicate that psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy may not be useful either because it is ineffective or because in some patients it may precipitate relapse by stimulating feelings the patient is not yet able to handle. They suggest that exploratory psychotherapy should be used after 6-12 months of abstinence and only with those who wish to explore psychological problems in depth ( Washton 1988 ) . On the other hand , psychotherapy oriented to the stages of recovery is useful. For example , during the first 90 days to 6 months of treatment , patients need substantial support to manage painful emotions and interpersonal stress ( Wallace 1992 ) . In this context , psychotherapy can play a key role in helping patients deal with their emotional states instead of self-medicating with drugs . </introduce.v.3083><introduce.v.3084>Before Bush even considers such a request , he ought to take a long look at the thousands of petitions for a presidential pardon filed by inmates who have never served in elective office.

It ' s weird because things just don ' t look right with 4 signatures on it and it was great to have Tom sign it. One by one the guys came in to say hi and spend some time with the master of the big bottom. The guys rearranged the set so Sweet E was closer to the beginning because Tom didn ' t know how long he would be able to stay.

Biden , Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs and the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control , introduced the Drug Sentencing Reform &amp;Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007 , legislation to eliminate this sentencing disparity. Over twenty years ago , Congress enacted a sentencing scheme that punishes crack cocaine offenses far more severely than powder cocaine offenses , " said Senator Biden. " But as the Sentencing Commission said last month this is a terrible flaw in the criminal justice system , based on the bogus notions that the crack form of cocaine is inherently more addictive than the powder form and crack users are more violent than powder users. That logic just has n't played out. Biden stated this 100 : 1 disparity is unjust , unfair , and the time has long past for it to be undone. As a result , his legislation seeks to remedy the crack/powder sentencing disparity by reducing the sentencing ratio to 1 : 1 . </introduce.v.3099><introduce.v.3100>Start Assessment SetDescription : ...

But even more than musique concr te , serialism foresaw the computer 's ability to perform functions on set blocks of prerecorded sound. Musique concr te may have introduced the idea that sound can itself be subjected to compositional play. However , it was serialism that posited the " row , " or a fixed set of notes , as a sonic object , and thus composition as a paper algorithm that is enacted on that subset. Today 's computer music , especially the live improvisation performed on laptops , enacts those transformations on sheer sound in much the same way. In place of " rows " we have " samples , " and in place of the codified twelve-tone transpositions we have the endless variety of computer mediation , like granular synthesis , in which processing is applied to extremely narrow slivers of sound; surround-sound effects , in which sound can be moved around in three-dimensional space; and backward-masking , that hallmark of tape-editing , just to name a few . </introduce.v.3110><introduce.v.3111>Peter Luff , MP for Mid Worcestershire , introduced a Private Members Bill in 1996 to issue age restrictions on teenage magazines.

Part of this was sociological : it gave the middle class some finances. But isolating the movement from the process of curing drugs was also a stategy : separate the politics from it , take it from the Malcolm X example , the Nation of Islam example , and put it into a more credentialized process. Separating the people from the process of curing drugs was the first stage of the contemporary period of chemical warfare against the oppressed community. The Nixon administration and its National Drug Abuse Council began to investigate another drug. They wanted something to introduce that as a cure-all for the street drugs that existed at the time.

We have to stir the party from top to bottom with discussion on the labor party question and show the party members that they have now a chance to participate in a fight , in a movement. We should aim to inspire them with the perspectives of the big possibilities which are by no means stated in an exaggerated fashion. At the appropriate time our comrades will begin moving in the unions step by step; perhaps to form a labor party club , perhaps to introduce a resolution , perhaps to circularize this resolution to other places , according to circumstances in each case.

The brass bands performed at funerals as well as at Mardi Gras celebrations. This music was not influenced by white popular music and was minimally affected by religious music. It became an integral part of saloons and dancing clubs and thrived in the party atmosphere of New Orleans. But after the great migration of blacks from the South  to the North  , Chicago replaced New Orleans as the center of black entertainment. Around 1920 several radio stations were already broadcasting music but refused to play jazz or blues music. Eventually , the record was the catalyst that led to the popularity of jazz among white audiences. By the mid-1920s some white musicians had joined the jazz scene in Chicago and introduced more solo instrumentation to the jazz body of music . </introduce.v.3149><introduce.v.3150>From workplace to school , from professional sports to the armed services , the advent of drug-testing procedures has stirred debate and controversy. Although designed to detect and thereby curtail the use of illicit drugs , this well-intentioned procedure involves difficult issues which require informed decision making. In this thought-provoking and practical book , Robert Coombs and Louis Jolyon West introduce readers to the complex world of drug testing. Written in nontechnical language for those concerned with substance abuse issues , the authors explore drug-testing methodology and offer guidelines for selecting the appropriate screening techniques. The questions concerning " voluntary " testing , individual rights-of-privacy , and the psychological effects of mandatory testing are also discussed. Separate chapters are devoted to testing in the military , in athletics , and in private industry. Other topics include the politics of drug-testing and the treatment and counseling of drug abusers. This fascinating and important work offers crucial information for policymakers , parents , employers and employees , and will be of particular value to those who are or will be the subjects of drug screening. By telling the story of drug testing , this book enlightens and clarifies the national debate . </introduce.v.3150><introduce.v.3151>The Government has been under pressure from green campaigners , business , consumer groups , trade unions , opposition parties and Labour backbenchers to amend the Energy Bill to introduce a feed in tariff.

How does that add value ? Sometimes it does , and it works when the new breed of intermediaries adds more value than cost. That 's why , at least in theory , the new paradigm , including its use of third-party lenders , could be more efficient than the old paradigm. It 's fast , speeding up time-to-market and cycle time. It 's open , giving buyers and sellers access to bigger markets with more opportunities. It 's automated , avoiding the cost and delay of manual processing. By making credit , like information , an accessible commodity that flows electronically to where it is needed , more business is done more efficiently. And lenders , like everyone else , are subject to competitive pressures to make their credit affordable and to provide more value than cost. Otherwise , they wo n't get business . </introduce.v.3156><introduce.v.3157>Consequences of Heroin Distribution : The real objective of the Swiss heroin experiment is to introduce a definitive program to distribute heroin to addicts as soon as possible.

You are not sent out on 10 or 15 linear , scripted missions. No , it is more like a real military mission : You are sent into the enemy territory without knowing too much about where the enemies are , and what they are up to. The intelligence is sparse , close to none. And you will see that you have to find out what is the biggest threat , and start your ' mission ' from there. To put it simple , you have to kill many enemies on the island to be sure of success , and be able to leave the island. If you play for increasing your score , you can try to hunt down most of the soldiers on the island.

In effect it will introduce a requirement on all businesses to have and operate an adequate anti-bribery policy. This will need to address extremes , from the prohibition of payment of bribes to public officials to obtain contracts , through to what constitutes an appropriate entertainment expense for example , paying for lunch with a potential client.

At the time , China was undergoing dramatic social and economic changes. China 's open-door policy led to the cultural exchange between China and the West. Internally , the Government introduced economic policy and the social structure started leaning towards capitalism. Western art thoughts inspired many younger Chinese artists at the time.

Following this , in order for these problems to be eradicated , the government does not necessarily need to introduce gay marriage , but rather needs to legally recognise homosexual relationships. Partnership registration , application of de facto legislation in the area of same-sex relationships , and adjustment of laws to cover same-sex relationships can be as useful in solving such problems of cohabiting gays and lesbians as gay marriage. For this reason , there is no compelling reason to introduce gay marriage . </introduce.v.3195><introduce.v.3196>This course introduces the student to the history , sources and methodology of Islamic Law and Jurisprudence ( The Shari ' a ) .

The work of English scientist Joseph Priestly , whose research introduced the laws of electrical repulsion , inspired Coulomb 's research. Technically , Coulomb demonstrated that the force between two electrical charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. To put it more simply , two like electric charges , either positive or negative , will repel each other; two unlike charges , one positive and one negative , attract each other along a straight line joining their centers. This phenomenon became known as the Coulomb 's force , or Coulomb 's interaction , and a unit of electric charge was named a " coulomb " in his honor.

Unfortunately , his bad advice is no better than Kieschnick ' s bad advice. In this case , it can be that one can give bad advice even with a statement that contains truth , simply because the statement doesn ' t go far enough. You don ' t participate in STS ' s Communion services ? Neither do I. Would anyone think you or I did do so ? You , perhaps , but not me. Why ? Because I ' m not a member. Your membership introduces a lack of clarity just like one ' s membership in the Elks or Moose ' for social purposes ' but with the rejection of the ritual ( or the claim that the local lodge as a whole doesn ' t do what the national does ) . Your joining a society in which women ' s ordination is an accepted fact ( in spite of your own rejection of it ) is no different from joining a lodge but rejecting its works-righteousness , etc . </introduce.v.3265><introduce.v.3266>This article is an orphan , as few or no other articles link to it. Please introduce links to this page from related articles; suggestions are available.

This is displayed within his composition Ionisation that is written for thirteen players , each with their own unique system. Varese introduces his compositional approach within the first two bars of the score with the use of two bass drums proceeding one another. These are intended to mask the developing gong sound that is struck on the last of three strikes of the bass drum . </introduce.v.3267><introduce.v.3268>Kohl-Welles introduced a similar measure in 2007 , but it never gained traction.

Let me take a minute to introduce myself. I 'm Uncle Bob , a Mod here at PC Perspective. We will be running a series of articles within the forum that will be called Mod Interviews. I ask revealing , embarrassing , stupid , probing questions of Mods and hopefully you get to laugh with us at ourselves and in the process get to know some of us better. Beware , not all the Mods are as forthcoming as you may like , I do my best to uncover the truth , but have n't always hit the mark ! </introduce.v.3269><introduce.v.3270>1927 - Automatic Music Instrument Co. of Grand Rapids ( AMI ) introduced the all-electric coin-operated phonograph , the " juke box , " to replace coin-operated pianos , but few built before 1934 . </introduce.v.3270><introduce.v.3271>It is , therefore , not coincidental that the Australian Lesbian and Gay Legal Services did not recommend marriage as the form of legal recognition of same-sex relationships. [ 15 ] Instead , in 1993 , they recommended registration of domestic partnership , and in 1994 , de facto legislation. In a similar vein , the Equal Opportunity Commission of Victoria , after considering the submissions made in response to a discussion paper issued in 1997 , [ 16 ] produced a report in March 1998 , in which it ' stopped short of recommending that gay marriage be recognised ' . Last but not least , relevant bills introduced in many countries , and in Australia ( 1997 and 1998 ) and New Zealand ( 1997 ) , followed exactly the same path : no same-sex marriage ! [ 17 ] And yet , there are Australian gays and lesbians who believe in gay marriage ( about 20 ) , some of whom are currently considering a challenge to the prohibition of gay marriage in the courts . </introduce.v.3271><introduce.v.3272>Fender is proud to introduce its hardest-working five-watt guitar amplifier ever. The affordable new Champion 600 guitar amp pays tribute to the cute and ultra-collectible 1949-53-era Champion guitar amps , serving up five blistering watts of all-tube tone , plus the classic cosmetics that make the original amps so desirable . </introduce.v.3272><introduce.v.3273>Sarah McCarthy-Fry 's decision to introduce the subject of the cruelty of electric shock collars and propose it in a Private Member 's Bill entitled Electric Shock Training Devices Bill ' is a milestone in the campaign. Each year a ballot is held at the start of the session and the twenty MPs whose names come out top are allowed to introduce legislation on a subject of their choice. Her support is invaluable , " I have a seven year old dog called Dudley. He is a cross between a Jack Russell Terrier and a Lancashire Heeler. I can not imagine using an electric shock collar on him. These collars are barbaric; they train dogs to respond out of fear rather than a natural willingness to behave and are entirely unnecessary. Considering the vast array of positive training methods that exist , it seems to me that there is absolutely no need to use an electric shock collar and I hope Members of Parliament on all sides will support my Bill and introduce a ban.

App. E.D. 1983 ) ( state countered evidence that victim had a reputation for being violent when intoxicated with evidence that he had a reputation for being nonviolent when intoxicated ); cf. State v. Bolhofner , 82 S.W.2d 894 , 898 ( Mo. 1935 ) ( evidence of decedent 's good reputation for peacefulness and quietude was inadmissible where defendant had not introduced evidence of the victim 's violent character ) . </introduce.v.3274><introduce.v.3275>Though the title of the Elseworlds Nosferatu refers to Murnau 's classic film , the opening quote , significant plot elements , and " look " of the comic are borrowed from Caligari. The Lofficiers ' revamping of the familiar Batman names for their Teutonic Elseworlds universe certainly presents a number of stumbling blocks for the young and uninitiated -- as they did for my son -- but by the time we have been introduced to the overtly Caligariesque Dr. Arkham and have entered his theatrical " Cabinet , " where the elite of Metropolis gather to hear Arkham 's psychomancer The Laughing Man predict their respective futures , the story is well underway. Though it certainly helps to have some orientation to their source material , this is a gripping read throughout , building to a marvelously-orchestrated series of climactic confrontations . </introduce.v.3275><introduce.v.3276>EX. Webster , p. 642 : W was convicted of aiding and abetting a bank robbery. State called King to testify against Webster. King ' s testimony exculpated W. Then the gov introduced a prior inconsistent statement given to the FBI inculpating W. Under FRE 607 you can impeach your own witness. Had the govt known that King would give testimony inconsistent with his prior statements , then it would have been guilty of abusing 607. But there is no evidence the govt knew . </introduce.v.3276><introduce.v.3277>A text box lets the user introduce information in alphanumeric form with the computer keyboard.

" 32 In either event , when used to show apprehension , the victim 's statements are not hearsay.33 </introduce.v.3279><introduce.v.3280> We are honored to include a tribute to the Ballets Russes and its extraordinary legacy in this year ' s Fall for Dance Festival , said Arlene Shuler. Since one of the goals of the Festival is to introduce a new generation to dance , it is fitting that we will celebrate one of the most important eras in dance history. We are equally delighted that for the sixth consecutive year , we are able to present a rich array of dance companies for only $ 10 a ticket. </introduce.v.3280><introduce.v.3281>It is through these fundamental errors that we have arrived at two more major misconceptions : that there must be medical and legal solutions to the problem of addiction. These misconceptions have led us to make a number of important mistakes. For example , in our search for medical cures for addiction we have produced an apparently endless series of more sophisticated , more powerful and more dangerous drugs. Almost inevitably those therapeutic drugs themselves then lead to addiction. Morphine was introduced as a cure for opium addiction. Heroin was introduced as a cure for morphine addiction . </introduce.v.3281><introduce.v.3282>Don ' t introduce yourself to the conductor of the new band you just joined and mention that you might need the ladies room during rehearsal.
