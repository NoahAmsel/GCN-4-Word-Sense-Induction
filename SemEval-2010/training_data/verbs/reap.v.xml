However bad your children are at present , still press toward the throng of grace , and you shall have a harvest.

We recommend that adopting a rule which expressly contemplates the probability that a realtor could reap a financial windfall directly resulting from a governmental decision in which he or she participated just because it happens a little more than one year in the future is unwise. It is also probably beyond the scope of the Commission 's rulemaking authority because it would " impair the scope " ( 10 ) of Section 87103 , which provides no statutory basis for such a drastic limitation on reasonable foreseeability . </reap.v.91><reap.v.92>" And another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe , " Rev. 14 : 15.

He who goes out weeping , carrying seed to sow , will return with songs of joy , carrying sheaves with him , is Gods promise in Psalm 126 : 5-6. The joy of the harvest more than compensates for the pain of sowing. No discipline seems pleasant at the time , but painful.

One of those rights recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 was the right of the policy owner to sell their rights in the contract to a third party. The people who benefit from a life settlement are the ones who own those rights , namely the policy owner. How they benefit is by being able to obtain the true value of the policy instead of merely receiving the cash surrender value upon surrender or nothing upon letting the policy lapse. If a person no longer wants or needs their life insurance then why should they be denied the opportunity to receive a value greater than the cash surrender value but less then the death benefit ?

The word is a compound word ( h r + fest ) and its first part has Indo-European roots in *kerp meaning to gather , pluck , harvest. Compare it with the Latin verb carpere meaning to cut , divide , pluck ( Carpe diem ) . So h rfest indicated originally the joyful celebration of finally being possible to gather the mature crops; it extended afterwards its meaning to the all period beginning with the harvest ( autumn ) . Recall also the expression harvest moon which is recorded since 1706 and indicates the full moon within a fortnight of the autumnal equinox ( 21 of September ) . However , as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns ( especially those who were literate ) , the word came to refer to the actual activity of reaping , rather than the time of year , and the terms Fall and Autumn began to replace it in the former sense.

And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

Families celebrate sons who become monks , as it provides formal education and training while spawning spiritual leaders for the community. The same is n't true for women : if a woman becomes a nun , the family loses its chance to reap the financial benefits of marrying her off. One monastery , however , is changing that , offering women a choice.

We have to feel the new interpretation as if it has already happened and experience being the painter of our canvas of life. We are the source of what we create and attract. It is our thoughts and emotions that will create then manifest our destiny. We can not fake it. What I mean by that is we must really know deep down that we are the authors of our story. We must feel and experience the empowerment that follows our changed thoughts. Essentially , we must reap the harvest at every opportunity. All seeds of experience lead to success , Love , peace , and fulfillment. All thoughts , feelings , and emotions lead to the exact experience that is in perfect alignment with the associated frequencies we have put forth. Like frequencies attract like frequencies. When we raise our vibration , we will attract higher vibrational people , places , and things. When we engage in lower vibrational people , places , and things we will lower our vibration and waver back to victimization.

Bosworth says in his book , " CHRIST THE HEALER " , Until the person seeking healing is sure from God ' s Word that it is God ' s will to heal him , he is trying to reap a harvest where there is no seed planted. He is like a farmer that sits on his porch and says , I believe in cotton , so this year I ' m going to sit here and believe for a harvest. I ' m not going to plant any seed; I ' m just going to believe for a harvest. He can sit there forever , but he will not reap a harvest until he plants the seed . </reap.v.325><reap.v.326>We all want to reap a good harvest so we may spend our lives sowing the good seed of righteousness.

" The seedtime is here and may we be as diligent about the sowing as the farmer is about working the ground and getting it prepared and sowing good seed that he may reap a good harvest. He knows he must sow and cultivate if he reaps a good harvest. So may we realize today that we are sowing for eternity. Soon we must all lay down this life and depart this world to experience the realities of another. Then will we reap the harvest of this entire life , and the harvest will be as the seed.

The Word of God is the seed that is sown and , over time and through proper care and conditions , the Lord gathers an abundant harvest of souls for eternal life. In many of Jesus ' parables , the owner of the vineyard is our Heavenly Father and it is clear that He desires that a harvest be gathered from the servants , or stewards , that He puts in charge of it. Graciously and wonderfully the Lord chooses to use us as His stewards to plant the seed , to water and care for the plants , and finally to reap the harvest. In John 4 : 35 , Jesus powerfully challenges His disciples , " Do you not say , 'Four months more and then the harvest ' ? I tell you , open your eyes and look at the fields ! They are ripe for harvest. " Jesus could certainly do it all by Himself , but instead He gives to His disciples not only the privilege to plant but also , as we sing in the Offertory of our Liturgy , to " Gather a harvest from the seeds that were sown.

We are told that as we sow , so shall we reap ( Gal. 6 : 7 ) . If we sow meanness and selfishness , that is what we will reap; if we sow friendship we will reap a harvest of friends , and if we sow money , we will reap money. This is a fundamental law of biblical economics. It works and it works every time.

" He that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle. " O my soul , when thou comest to die , Christ will himself come after thee; when thou art to be cut down he that site upon the throne will cut thee down with a very sharp sickle , in order that he may do it as easily as possible.

Successive generations have benefited from the breakdown of gender biases. In addition , women are bearing fewer children and postponing that decision to a later age in life , which facilitates getting an education and entering the labour force. The decision to have fewer children also allows women to spend more time in the labour market and reduces the costs associated with extended or frequent exits , as well as childcare. All of these influences are causing successive generations of women to reap greater financial and professional benefits from the workplace and this is leading to longer lifetime attachments to the labour force. Odds are that a 30-year-old in the labour market today will still choose to be on employer payrolls at the age of 50 . </reap.v.344><reap.v.345>Moreover , he showed us the " increase in the size of our harvest " reaped from our sowing.

God can use whatever we can give , and wonderfully and miraculously , the harvest often greatly exceeds the amount we plant , as God promises that what we entrust to Him He will multiply. But if from one small seed can come large clusters of fruit , just think of what can come of many seeds ! This is an encouragement to us to give all the more , remembering , Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and whoever sows generously will also reap generously ( 2 Corinthians 9 : 6 ) . </reap.v.388><reap.v.389>But some people , even though they say they are praying with faith , stop praying if they do not receive the answer after some time. In some cases , the reality of the situation seems to be getting worse and going in the opposite direction of what they pray. So they break down what they have built up with their deeds by complaining and speaking negatively. If you change or give up in the middle like this , you can not reap anything , even if you have been sowing very hard . </reap.v.389><reap.v.390>The commandment to count the intervening days between the Day of the Omer and Pentecost can only be explained if the barley omer was reaped on the day following the weekly Sabbath ( that is the Sunday which falls during the Feast of Unleavened Bread ) . If the Omer was reaped on the second day of Unleavened Bread ( the 16th day of the month ) , as the Pharisees and modern Judaism purport , then there would be no reason for the counting. Shavuot would fall on a fixed date every year. According to the Pharisaic model , there is no discernable reason to count the intervening days. Because Shavuot is a fixed date , counting the days would be redundant . </reap.v.390><reap.v.391>Sow a thought and reap an act. Sow an act , and reap a habit. Sow a habit and reap a character.

He 's enjoying the benefits of those efforts. It 's a reminder of one of the wisest laws in the Bible , " Whatsoever a man sows , that shall he also reap " ( Galatians 6 : 7 ) . We usually think about that in terms of the bad consequences of the bad seed we sow , but there 's another side to that reaping equation . </reap.v.399><reap.v.400>It is valuable to take a personal assessment periodically. If one is unhappy with the crop they are reaping in their life , they need to look at what kind of seeds they are sowing. Galatians also spells it out unmistakably. Do not be deceived , God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows , that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption , but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. The word whatever means whatever. What one gives out comes back in some way , shape or form. Other religions teach the essence of this and some call it karma , and there is the modern saying , what goes around comes around. The reason it 's true is because God established the law of seedtime and harvest , or sowing and reaping . </reap.v.400><reap.v.401>That is true , is n't it ?

Why is this happening in my finances ? " Everything is falling apart for them , and it just does n't dawn on them that they reap what they sow. For years this is what they have been sowing. So why does it surprise them when that is what they reap ? As a matter of fact , often in those times people get angry with God. They want to know , " Where is God , and why does it have to be this way ?

But then one night we heard that healing had already been bought and paid for us by Jesus. When we heard that , we knew that our days of sickness were over. We received God ' s Word and that seed bore fruit in our spirits instantly. It doesn ' t take God ' s Word long to bear fruit.

In Paul 's day , food production was a matter of life and death , and sowing was a precondition for harvesting. But sowing and reaping is also a matter of spiritual life and death. Paul went on to say that , spiritually speaking , we can sow to the flesh or to the Spirit of God -- and reap a harvest consistent with each.

They mimic what they see and hear. What if your children were to act like you ! Would you be shocked ? Suppose they were to talk like you , work like you , or have the same attitude about the church.

In the parable of the sower Jesus spoke of the word of God , sown in good soil , as bringing forth 30 , 60 and a 100 fold. That simply means that one grain of seed would produce 30 , 60 or 100. This indicates then that in the natural , moral and. spiritual world , one will always reap more than he sows whether it is for good or for bad. In the words of Hosea , when one sows the wind , they shall reap the whirlwind. ( Hosea 8 : 7. ) In this connection , C. D.

When the barley is ready to be reaped which fell during this period , one sheaf from the standing harvest is cut with a sickle and is brought to the priest. The priest was then to take this sheaf and wave it before the Lord in the Temple. This was to be done " the day after the sabbath. " i.e on the Sunday following the Passover. Among the Malankara Syrian Christians , the sheaf is tied in a bundle and is hung in front of the granary. Prescribed offerings and sacrifices were also to be presented along with the sheaf. The Hebrew word for " sheaf " is omer. An omer is defined as " a measure of dry things , containing a tenth part of an ephah. " The definition of an omer being a tenth part of an ephah is found in Exodus 16 : 36. An ephah contains 10 omers of grain.

It was the end of Christ 's anointing and coming into the world , that he might comfort them that mourn : Isaiah 61 : 3.

The seed gets consumed instead of being sown. We may plant a certain amount of seed. We sow a little here and a little there. However we are not sowing the seed for the purpose of harvesting. The purpose of planting seed is to reproduce the parent plant. Farmers practice this on a large scale and gardeners do it on a smaller scale. You harvest what you have planted. You sow for the specific purpose of harvesting. You don ' t sow because you have nothing better to do. When harvest time comes and it will , you reap the harvest. If you did n't want a harvest you would n't have sown in the first place would you ? I have said all of this to make the point that if we want a spiritual harvest we have to sow . </reap.v.536><reap.v.537>" Do n't be deceived : God is not mocked , " Paul wrote.

Is that the way it works ? Is this a truth about life ? I think we have to say it is the truth , but not the whole truth. Life is not just a quid pro quo arrangement. We do n't just get out life what we put in , what we deserve. Often we get more whether of blessing or bane , of good or ill. Surely if you reflect on your own life and experience you know that. I certainly can not tell those Russian families in the village of Beslan whose school children were the victims of that terrorist attack a few weeks ago that they are reaping what they have sown. I do n't believe Paul would want to say that either. Yet what I think you can say is that years of sowing one kind of violence and oppression are very likely to result in a harvest of other kinds of violence and oppression. When you sow violence and warfare , you are very likely to harvest violence and warfare.

Ernst &amp;Young , the accountancy firm who are currently controlling the company following the governments abandonment , report that although several approaches have come in , no formal offers have been tabled. The purchase of Railtrack by a firm such as WestLB would go against the governments plan for the company to be turned into a non-profit organisation run by train operators , freight companies and passenger groups funded by bonds. Despite its obvious current problems , Railtrack has an equally obvious advantage for potential buyers as it is a monopoly of an essential service.
