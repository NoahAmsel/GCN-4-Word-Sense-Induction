This would make clear that our protests have nothing to do with the platforms of the individual candidates. If anything , insofar as the Democrats are expected to win the coming elections , it would probably be most strategic to focus on Denver , however thorny it might be working out how to demonstrate against an African-American or female presidential candidate . </frame.v.4><frame.v.5>Gerson seems to me to frame his argument in this strange way so that he can vacillate between two points , both of which are weak. On the one hand , he seems to want to argue that morality itself is proof of God 's existence. He goes out of his way ( oddly , twice ) to note that morality is not proof of God 's existence - but he essentially argues that it is when he asserts that atheists can not explain morality without recourse to cruel irony , nor can they offer any reason why morality is binding. Of course , this is a highly problematic proposition - the whole thrust of modern moral theory implies that God 's existence is not a necessary condition for moral maxims to have influence and value . </frame.v.5><frame.v.6>£ 14.99 - Mao Tse Tung print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - Mao Tse Tung print - POSTED £ 29.99 - Mao Tse Tung framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - Mao Tse Tung framed print - POSTED </frame.v.6><frame.v.7>165. In December of 2000 , an Israeli art student by the name of Cohen MEYTAL was observed by a DEA employee sitting on the western street curb of the Dallas Divisional Office selling artwork. The student claimed that a group of Israeli art students ( about 20 ) would paint works of art and sell them at local places of business.

One cluster , which we call autonomy , specifically selects individual idea elements that address the issue of self-determination , whether as women ( the gendered form ) or as individuals entitled to a right to privacy ( the non-gendered form ) . The other cluster picks up those idea elements that speak of protection , whether specifically emphasizing women as needing protection ( the gendered form ) or more generally of the state 's need to act morally , offer alternatives to abortion , consider the reasons that women might have for abortion , and attempt to address social need ( the ungendered form ) . In other words , when abortion is framed as an aspect of the welfare state and justified in terms of helping those in need , we coded this as part of the protection cluster . </frame.v.11><frame.v.12>Welcome to Get Framed !

I am not a conservator , but I have heard that minor decay in the artwork will start to occur within 5 years. This will vary dramatically based on the type of framing components , the environment ( light , temperature , humidity ) of the frame package , the chemistry of the print , and type of mounting. Although some decay may occur , it may not be very noticeable without doing an A/B comparison with the original . </frame.v.13><frame.v.14>But before we resort to these far-fetched and romantic speculations we should exhaust the nearer and more accurate method , and this is what the writers on the sources of the American Constitution have failed to do. Taking the Constitution as it was framed in 1787 , they immediately look for something in Europe from which they assume it must have been copied , instead of tracing its origin backward from itself through the two hundred years of the colonial period . </frame.v.14><frame.v.15>Word-selection or diction has been a component of rhetoric since time immemorial. But most commentators attribute the concept of framing to the work of Erving Goffman and point especially to his 1974 book , Frame analysis : An essay on the organization of experience. Goffman used the idea of frames to label " schemata of interpretation " that allow individuals or groups " to locate , perceive , identify , and label " events and occurrences , thus rendering meaning , organizing experiences , and guiding actions. [ 11 ] Goffman 's framing concept evolved out of his 1959 work , The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life , a commentary on the management of impressions. These works arguably depend on Kenneth Boulding 's concept of image. [ 12 ] </frame.v.15><frame.v.16>Old books are good , old times , old rhymes , but best of all , old friends.

Over the last 30 years their think tanks have made a heavy investment in ideas and in language. In 1970 , [ Supreme Court Justice ] Lewis Powell wrote a fateful memo to the National Chamber of Commerce ... .He outlined the whole thing in 1970. They set up the Heritage Foundation in 1973 " " So if you go on Fox News ... .and the question is , 'Are you in favor of the President ' s tax relief program or are you against it ?

This means building and sustaining the carriers of these frames in various ways for example , by helping groups figure out how to gain access where blocked , and how to strengthen their ability to collaborate better with groups sharing similar goals. Framing contests are about a lot more than staying on message . </frame.v.25><frame.v.26>Contrary to what must be popular opinion , I do n't want that either. My goal as a picture framer is to enhance the artwork. Of course , issues regarding preservation of valuable pieces of art notwithstanding , this may be the primary reason to frame anything at all. Some of us framers consider it a compliment when the framing/matting is not even noticed at an art exhibition . </frame.v.26><frame.v.27>Conceptually , humanitarian space overlaps with the military ' s third block , which has seemingly inserted itself into humanitarian space , muddying distinctions of neutrality , impartiality and independence. Although history notes that militaries have been active in all blocks , the protected and distinct humanitarian space has been the territory of humanitarian agencies since the late 1880s. This environment was never conceived of as being the same physical or symbolic place as the third block of three block wars because it was conceived of through international law while the other through a military commander ' s rubric designed to frame training and intervention from a soldiering perspective in the operational space . </frame.v.27><frame.v.28>PICTURE : The original version got a low 1.5 for being a bright pink beacon in space yet still holding a secret facility.

Suppose that it is a really ugly frame. Does that alter the case ? Does the fact that you cut the picture out of a book before framing it alter the case ? Is cutting the picture out , without framing it , preparation of a derivative work ? Would you conclude that cutting a picture out of a book and framing it , as in this case , is more or is less of a recasting and transformation of the ( pictorial ) work than was painting War Cloud ( a sculptural work ) in the Blazon case ? </frame.v.29><frame.v.30>In 2002 , the painting The Temples of Paestum ( Tate N01029 ) which the artist William Linton ( 1791-1876 ) bequeathed to Tate on his death in 1876 , was cleaned and conserved. It was decided that the painting should be appropriately framed to complement the restoration . </frame.v.30><frame.v.31>As all of our fine art prints are custom framed to order please allow around 10 working days for delivery of your framed print. However , if you do have a deadline to meet , then please give us a call with the details . </frame.v.31><frame.v.32>The ultimate limitation to this study is whether or not the viewers actually comprehend the presence of these frames in war coverage. As previously established , viewers are not mindless slaves to the frames they are presented with. Viewers use their own experiences , preconceived notions , and understandings to frame what they watch on television. In order to determine the possible influence frames in early Iraq-war coverage had on viewers , the viewers must be asked about the frames they saw in the coverage. An appropriate methodology would include a survey of television viewers who watched Iraq war coverage during the first 31-days of the Iraq war . </frame.v.32><frame.v.33>Polikoff believes the LGBT community has been too narrowly focused on obtaining access to civil marriage , when the focus should be on creating a legal framework that values all families equally. Her solution will appeal to those who view children as the purpose of creating families -- of her " three principles for valuing all families , " for example , the first two concern children , with relationships between adults falling a distant third. Thus , in her model , when designing employer-provided health benefits , my partner will be covered only if there are funds left after providing for everyone else 's children ( p. 149 ) . Whatever this system might be , it is not one that " values all families equally " since it prioritizes the childless couple as inferior to those with offspring. While her motives to expand protections are admirable , she moreover fails to consider the administrative obstacles to awarding full financial benefits to any aggregate of individuals who present themselves. Her argument is strongest when framed by the family 's united front before employers and governments , but weakest when considering how the interests of the various persons are to be weighed when such ephemeral groups -- marked by no formalities or registration requirements -- disintegrate . </frame.v.33><frame.v.34>Framed Cabinets are what many of us grew up with. These cabinets are considered traditional. The cabinet box , has a hardwood front frame applied. On framed cabinets with standard doors the " frame " is visible between the doors and around the drawer. On framed cabinets with full overlay doors the framed is barely visable. For two door cabinets a center stile separates each door . </frame.v.34><frame.v.35>The barmaid sauntered past Amalia to the table next to hers , where a group of workmen sat drinking. She was slender , possessing wide hips and generous breasts. A pretty face was framed by her long , wavy black hair , quite the picture of feminine beauty. She set down a platter of roasted chicken pieces , covered in sauce and almonds , along with a loaf of bread and a small bowl of olive oil for dipping.

When she looked up and saw the looming frame of Sheriff Daniel Reeve framed in the flickering blue neon light of the Daily Grind coffee-shop , she realized why it felt as if she had run fast and hard into a brick wall. Danny was a huge man , well over six feet and stocky with it. Indeed , his large size was a benefit in his line of work , as most men thought twice before giving him any trouble. To his frequent embarrassment , many of the unattached women in the town had no such qualms. Good looking , well-mannered , with a decent job and , most importantly , single , Danny was considered a prime catch. However , he was keen to remain free and although he dated frequently , he resisted all attempts at commitment. That was probably the reason why he and Cassie got on so well; after all , he knew there was absolutely no chance she would ever be interested in him . </frame.v.39><frame.v.40>There are two perspectives which would be not be possible under this proposed regime. The first is the declaration that information is inherently free , and that any protection is ill-considered. Both as authors and individuals who would purchase high quality information , we do not believe that all information wants to be free [ 39 ] . The second is the model of code as implemented in UCITA. UCITA is in direct opposition to this proposal as UCITA treats code as specialized service even when packaged with shrink wrap and sold to millions. The extremes as represented by 'information wants to be free ' at one end and UCITA at the other both negate concepts of code which do not meet the narrow mental models of the one who has framed the argument. History has shown that both speech without control and speech with excessive control yield effectively the same result - degradation of dialogue [ 40 ] . This proposal seeks to strike a balance in accordance with the traditions of intellectual property , the realities of economics , and the nature of code . </frame.v.40><frame.v.41>Lakoff , the father of framing , has written that the truth alone will not set you free. It has to be framed correctly. The problem , Lakoff concedes , is that reframing requires a rewiring of the brain , and that requires an investment of time , effort , and money . The challenge for Liberals trying to shake the frame the Conservatives have hung on St phane Dion is that they have a shortage of both time and money . </frame.v.41><frame.v.42>Deep frames can be used as trays , with a bit of lace or a doily behind the glass , to display perfume bottles , candles , or small collectibles. A picture frame without the glass is also still useful. It can be used in a variety of ways , such as to frame interesting fabric , tapestry , or to create one of a kind message boards or bulletin boards. Or , you can hang the frame on the wall to accent a sconce or other art piece . </frame.v.42><frame.v.43>Wilson Bros.

In addition the sizing of the side frame members 12 needs to be accurate to take into account the length of one side of the joint frame member 10 so that the length of the side frame member 12 is less than the corresponding side length of the object to be framed . </frame.v.44><frame.v.45>The Reverend Matthew Blackburne Grier of 1892 ( cat. 37 ) is framed in an early version of an Arts and Crafts frame that is based on Italian cassetta designs of the Renaissance. A cast design of sausage-like spindles and reels on the inner edge of the Grier frame flanks a wide , flat frieze of fine cast reeding. The frame ' s outer edge , now missing , probably was composed of a small , cast Classical pattern. This simple cassetta style was popular in the 1890s as an alternative to the more traditional and fussy Barbizon-style frames with rows of cast acanthus leaf and other ornament on a large ogee ( an elongated reverse or S-shaped curve ) or quarter-round profile. This frame bears a label on its back from Earles ' Galleries in Philadelphia. A similar frame appears on the portrait of Mary Rodman Foxof 1892 ( fig. 77 ) , where the flat , reeded frieze is bordered by a cast pattern of oak leaves , acanthus leaves , and shells on an ogee profile on its outer edge and by a modified spindle-and-reel pattern on its inner edge . </frame.v.45><frame.v.46>Proudly showcase your achievement by having your diploma framed in a high-quality frame , complete with an acid free matte emblazoned with your School 's official logo.

So , you may see the gloves come off a bit.

Read it on the Internet , " one joked ( McLeod , 1996 ) . The listserv discussion had reached the stage where Salinger 's journalistic credibility was being parodied by other journalists. Importantly , it was not only Salinger 's reputation as a journalist , but the Internet as a news source that was being framed as " deviant. " </frame.v.48><frame.v.49>I first started going to Stark June of 1986. I had just graduated from college and moved to Dallas and had not made any friends yet. But , the first night I was there I had a new instant extended family with Chet , Chuck , Jill , Michael , Kent , Craig , and all of the others. For the next four years I never missed a Saturday night and many Friday nights. My family was furious with me for not visiting with them during that period , but I knew that what was happening was special and would probably never happen again and I had to soke up every moment I could of it.

The term also implies the existence of an incomplete and potentially distorted depiction. There are several practical uses of the term framing that may help one to better understand how framing functions from a mediated perspective. One is the idea of being framed , or set up , which is most commonly used in legal situations. A person claims that she/he is made to appear guilty as a result of a falsely constructed case by another person. This false construction causes the authorities to focus their attention and investigation on the innocent person , all the while leading them further away , or deflecting their attention from the person who really committed the crime . </frame.v.51><frame.v.52>In their book ( mentioned above ) Fauconnier and Turner talk about the conceptual blends that usually take place in an environment where redemption is the focus. Fauconnier and Turner alert us to the possibility that redemption is a matter of entering or in fact creating a latter situation that counts as equivalent to a prior situation in which one failed. In terms of AT therapy , the failure ( the one that Fauconnier and Turner speak of ) is framed as a failure to attach. AT therapists then create a new situation the rebirthing or re-nurturing event  that counts as equivalent to the prior failure , again , the failure to attach. The idea behind AT therapy is that as a result of the rebirthing or re-nurturing event , the therapist and/or parental figure succeeds in the latter situation , to quote Fauconnier and Turner. When confronted with a redemption narrative or process , Fauconnier and Turner tell us that </frame.v.52><frame.v.53>zRon was going to take his friend 's photograph down to a frame shop to have it professionally framed , but then he got a great idea.

Including the " flag-waving " one that the reporter particularly mentioned. Indeed , one of the few criticisms I 'd make of the shot framing was that some shots had unavoidable foreground material ( eg the pitch , or people sitting just in front of the camera in the stand ) that were placed in front of the screen and were hard to converge because of their extreme disparity and proximity to the edge of the frame. I believe that the 3D team were understandably limited to camera positions not required for the simultaneous international 2D broadcast , and so they might have chosen differently given free reign . </frame.v.54><frame.v.55>We ' ve all used the thumbtack and Scotch tape techniques at some time in our past.

By framing its struggle as part of a wider conflict between oppressed and oppressors , Hizballah ' s messages have become more meaningful in the eyes of many Shia. Following the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1989 , however , the Party of God has gone through a process of pragmatization; as a result , its diagnostic frames have been flexible and adaptable to changing political and socio-economic circumstances . </frame.v.59><frame.v.60>* Lost ?

Many people do n't like framed Web sites because they 'get stuck in someone 's frames , ' they ca n't bookmark a particular page within a framed Web site , the search engines do n't list their Web sites , and some browsers ca n't read framed Web sites at all. Clearly these are legitimate problems . </frame.v.64><frame.v.65>The Trib focuses most of its attention on the question it framed , accepting the disconnect between the pre-war intelligence and post-war facts , focusing on what Kay and Duelfer found and concluded and what the various post-war intelligence investigations found and concluded. But for the purpose of examining whether a misjudgment was made this can all be reduced to a simple assessment. Iraq did not actually have material CW and BW stockpiles but we believed they did. Iraq had intentions of redeveloping CW and BW capabilities and we believed they did . </frame.v.65><frame.v.66>A logical future direction of this research would be to ask why and how media chooses to frame stories in ways that are consistent with ( or critical of ) an administration 's foreign policy agenda. For now we can say that media framing works and , that the characterization of international paradigms influences public opinion , and thus , has the ability to legitimize or undermine the decisions made by policymakers. This has special resonance for American consumers of media. To paraphrase Rampton and Stauber 's conclusions , as democratic citizens we should ask ourselves to what degree we have bought into our own propaganda , and whether we have been advocating a war for the wrong reasons , against the wrong people , at the wrong time , and with the wrong weapons . </frame.v.66><frame.v.67>In Germany , there has been a dramatic change in gendering of governance on the abortion issue. Women have achieved a notable level of standing both in the media and among policy makers on this issue , and abortion is framed much more a gendered issue there than in the U.S. But on the autonomy side -- the governance of gender -- the U.S. is much more likely to frame women as moral agents compared to Germany and to justify abortion in terms of an individual 's right to make decisions concerning his/her own body and life. German abortion law constructs pregnant women as needy victims whom the state is obliged to help , largely by counseling them to have the child and by pointing out the social supports the state makes available for them in that case. German discourse as a whole also tends to follow this model , and women speakers ' claims to autonomy , advocating the individual woman 's right to decide whether motherhood or abortion is the moral course of action for her , are not echoed by other speakers </frame.v.67><frame.v.68>As a general rule , choose lighter colored frames for art that is light , simple or casual , such as you 'll find in rustic art or botanical prints. Choose dark frames for a more stable , elegant , formal look with museum classics. A thin dark frame can be used with lighter prints because it does n't feel very heavy. Gold frames are very flexible and match a wide variety of art styles. Most modern and abstract art looks good with black frames , while Impressionist art is seldom framed in black . </frame.v.68><frame.v.69>Yard-long diecut calendar from Grand Union Tea Co. , c.1907 , Victorian girl with her puppy , VG cond w/some edge wear , beautifully matted &amp;framed , 36 " H x 17 " W . </frame.v.69><frame.v.70>Recall that , according to Schn , the way a problem is framed determines the decision to be made , the ends to be achieved , the means which may be chosen ( 1983 , p. 40 ) . The framing of the problem of low public confidence as the need for independent measurement requires an independent entity to create or select an instrument that can be administered consistently to students across the province.

Social control and relative power , legitimized monopoly and sufficient social status matter more than universal ideal of abstract truth. Challenges to this monopoly , often aided by technology , which is not immediately chained by powers that be ( print , Internet ) are thus questioned much more fiercely than the ideological questions of media content , which can always be framed and accommodated , contained and neutralized , no matter how rebellious they seem and sound : </frame.v.71><frame.v.72>The New Jersey constitution was begun on May 26 and finished July 3 , 1776.

Dan Pfeiffer , writing on the White House blog , posted an article called " Still not a 'Government Takeover ' , " which activates the conservative idea of a government takeover and hence reinforces the idea. Every time a liberal goes over a conservative proposal giving evidence negating conservative ideas one by one , he or she is activating the conservative ideas in the brains of his audience. The proper response is to start with your own ideas , framed to fit what you really believe. Facts matter. But they have to be framed properly and their moral significance must be made manifest. That is what we learn from real reason . </frame.v.83><frame.v.84>And that dovetailed nicely with the second objective of the Super Bowl ad : to frame Dion as a weak leader , to make sure that as surely as we can ' t not think of an elephant without thinking of an elephant we would never be able to think of the Liberal leader without thinking of his pathetic whine about how hard it is to set priorities.

Framing effects also become apparent when information is scarce but is presented in a strong framework , which may lead people to fill in information gaps through analogical completion. Such completion looks plausible as it is in accordance with the frame , which in turn might tempt one to neglect the critical examination of the sources.

There it is , as noted , an absolutely integral part of democratic theory and American political development. With that right , however , comes great responsibility. Citizens are asked to give their informed choice , not just their vote. They are asked to frame their vote through the lens of national community interest , not merely self interest. It has been assumed for many centuries that the " national community interest " spoken of here is in fact the interest of the American national community , not the interest of a foreign country. Trying to do justice to both community and self interest in a citizen 's voting decisions is hard enough. Throwing in the interests of a citizen 's country of origin places too much unnecessary and counterproductive weight on top of what is already a difficult set of citizen calculations . </frame.v.91><frame.v.92>Our most popular type of wall frame is a collage wall frame.

Was the invasion a fundamental misjudgment ? This is not the same question as framed by the Trib. It is not about who fooled whom then or who is trying to fool whom now. It is important for the nation to revisit Odom 's more basic question , not so much to extract us from our present predicament in Iraq , but because if a misjudgment was made , it was the nation which made it , and it is the nation that needs to learn from it. One thing that is ever so clear is that most politicians in Congress follow the polls , follow public opinion.

Ten weeks into this the Scottish commissioners finally arrived and the Assembly decided to attend to the Solemn League and Covenant and put this revision of the Articles on hold. This important document was framed by Alexander Henderson , received assent from the Scottish convention of Estates and General assembly , and placed before the English commissioners. The Solemn League was read over clause by clause and the explanations were given if necessary. It was then appointed by Parliament , and assented to by the Assembly , that the Covenant should be publicly taken by these two bodies on September 25.

With the action in the lower half of the screen and often to the side , the viewer ' s eye is drawn throughout the frame as Trixie struggles passionately to reattach the fallen leaves.

In fact , somewhat surprisingly , the paper states that the main challenges for EU taxation policy are to be found outside taxation itself. The argument of the Commission is that these challenges relate to three goals , namely employment policy , the smooth functioning of the single market , and the stabilisation of the member states ' tax revenue. It is easy to see the link between tax coordination and the stabilisation of revenue in member states , that is , the third goal. But how can direct tax policy - in the past framed in terms of selective measures against the tax distortions incurred by multinationals - be re-framed as the cement of the single market and EU employment policy ? The mechanism enabling this fundamental shift of political emphasis is the narrative of tax competition , whose causal components are synthesised in figure 1 . </frame.v.105><frame.v.106>We have a large production facility to handle all types of framing requirements.

I do not want to imply that Kelman seems unaware of these problems. In more recent work , he suggests that contemporary legal discourse shifts between viewing values as purely subjective matters of taste and viewing them as relatively more shared or objective; for example , Kelman describes legal norms thatassign legal rights as reflecting commitments to " value objectivism. " KELMAN , supra note 47 , at 86. What interests Kelman in this work is his perception that legal discourse oscillates between these positions and , in his view , suppresses recognition of the widespread commitment in some areas of law to treating values as shared or " objective. " What interests me in this review is that we seem to treat values as incommensurable with regard to many norms other than " legal rights , " and that some CLS scholars frame their critique of legal categories so broadly as to reject the appropriateness of ever conceiving values as incommensurable . </frame.v.107><frame.v.108>37.

Sometimes that can be framed within larger issues ( i.e. a paper on whether a cap on punitive damages is a good thing is useful in deciding if Ohio should have a cap on punitive damages ) but other times it is likely fairly state-specific. For example , Ohio has a particularly complex limitation on property tax revenues that slows the rise of property taxes but also makes for some very confusing tax elections , frequent tax elections , and undoubtedly biases the tax structure in some odd ways. An article on the punitive damage cap issue could wind up in any law review; an article on Ohio property tax law would be lucky to make it in one of the Ohio schools ( and we have 9 ) law reviews. So , faculty are more likely to write the former than the latter , even at state law schools. Faculty are more likely to be rewarded for writing an article that places well , which pushes against the property tax article . </frame.v.140><frame.v.141>Q : I have a number of digital photos that I 'd like to have framed.

If this election is to be won by Obama/Biden , I suspect the campaign will have to grapple with the reality that images will trump reality nine times out of ten.

Based on the notion of intertextuality and adopting an interdisciplinary perspective , the paper critically examines the forms and functions of Direct Discourse in Greek television news. More specifically , it adopts the analytic framework proposed by Fairclough ( 1992 ) ( of discourse as text , discourse practice and social practice ) and his distinction between manifest and constitutive intertextuality. Discourse Representation in general is seen as one aspect of the intertextual construction of discourse. The present paper concentrates on Direct Discourse , which is regarded as a rhetorical/stylistic device used to validate and authenticate particular claims to factuality. The paper aims to relate particular features of texts to ideologies which are implicit in news production processes. The analysis focuses on four related aspects of Direct Discourse : 1 ) its forms , 2 ) the sources quoted , 3 ) its function in news stories , and 4 ) the way it is framed by the reporting discourse of the journalist . </frame.v.165><frame.v.166>We keep a large range of good value ready made wood and aluminium Athena picture frames.

The question is not whether users have a constitutionally protected right of practical access to a preferred version of a work.

The WHO ' s conclusions can be traced to Stanford University political scientist Shanto Iyengar ' s landmark research on framing and its consequences. In the early 1990s , Iyengar conducted a series of experiments in which he and colleagues exposed participants to news stories framed either episodically or thematically and observed the different effects that each framing method had on its audience ' s perception of the issue. Iyengar defined episodic frames as those which focus on specific evens or particular cases , and thematic frames as those which give fairly broad background information on the news story , as they place political issues and events in some general context.

When you walk into a custom frame shop to have a picture framed , the framer shows you many moulding samples on his wall. Usually , he does not actually have these mouldings in stock at his place of business. When you buy a picture frame from the custom framer , the framer orders the " chop " from a wholesale dealer who cuts/chops the molding to the exact size the custom framer wants , and ships it to the framer and the framer puts the frame together. This is how at least 80 percent or more of the frame shops in this country operate. Now here on this web site you can do the exact same thing ! You can order the exact same " chops " from us that the customer framer orders , then just like him , you can put the frame together.

To a significant degree this hope was realized : early investigations by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights were widely covered in the press and helped to frame the first generation of [ *pg 1012 ] national civil rights legislation.237 NHRIs in other countries have occasionally led high profile investigations as well , 238 and investigations by anticorruption commissions often prove newsworthy.

The Raft debates start with a sinking-boat scenario. The main ship is in crisis , and all of the passengers have hurried into lifeboats , saving just one spot for a final survivor. The quandary , however , is that three passengers remain on the sinking ship , and all of them are professors at UAB who must vie with the others for the final seat on the life raft by making the most persuasive arguments for their discipline. The arguments -- a braid of humor , deliberate provocation , and refutation , frame the event , which unfolds in front of colleagues and students. Audience applause determines the winner. The scenario , in effect , contributes a sense of urgency to an otherwise playful ( if viciously candid ) cross-disciplinary interchange. A professor of public health defeated McComiskey ( who was representing English Studies ) in 1999 , but the outcome was inevitably the result of disciplinary incoherence , a problem the book sets out , following the early pages , to resolve : " What exactly is English studies ? " ( 2 ) . </frame.v.235><frame.v.236>Need any advice ?

These days , after years of manufacturing inconsistencies , 100 cotton inkjet canvas is avoided by the majority of the market and hardly any manufacturers produce them anymore. The inconsistencies include shrinking ( when coated or when subject to a high humidity environment ) , expanding ( long after being stretched and framed , causing the print to sag and appear off balance on one side ) , and the presence of visible , black cotton seeds. These black cotton seeds end up in the middle of prints and can make them look dirty or defective. They also have a tendency to fall off , leaving white voids in your print. Collectively , it is for all these reasons that 100 cotton inkjet canvases are not widely used by fine art printmakers any longer . </frame.v.247><frame.v.248>Transcendental arguments are often characterized as arguments designed to show that some obvious feature of experience or knowledge presupposes our having certain concepts and beliefs.

It was not part of Mr Cain 's case that these higher risk groups should be deferred; rather , the argument was framed on the basis that this comparison provided a basis for arguing that if the risk presented by the safe-sex cohort of the MSM group is less than or comparable to that of other non-MSM groups who were eligible to donate blood , they should also be so eligible. The three groups identified by Mr Cain for comparison were young heterosexually-active people , heterosexually-active people who have sexual contact in the Asian region , and Indigenous People ( Closing Submissions , pp34-37 ) . </frame.v.274><frame.v.275>If we contrast this with direct regulation or a carbon tax or fee , the ethical structure of the instruments become more obvious. Imposing a tax on an activity , especially framed as a Pigovian sin tax , means that we are penalizing that activity or asking for compensation to society for damages. In essence a carbon tax is consistent with the valuation of carbon emissions as bad though not criminal. Auctioning permits to emit says that carbon emissions are neither good nor bad , ie. this activity is permitted but has an indeterminate cost and a market value. Already at this level , cap and trade is protecting emitting carbon from moral opprobrium. Like it or not , moral concern , anxiety , anger and outrage expressed and directed wisely is going to have a determinative ongoing role in spurring climate action . </frame.v.275><frame.v.276>Latch -- Yes , I still have several of the t-shirts.

In examining news coverage Iyengar ( 1991 ) referenced the categories of thematic and episodic to explain styles of media reporting. Episodic news coverage focuses on concrete and specific events and the thematic focuses on the issue in a very general context ( Iyengar , 1991 ) . For example , Iyengar notes that political issues take on episodic framing with a focus on specific events , while thematic framing places the political issues in a context ( Iyengar , 1991 ) . Typically , the networks frame episodically when depicting public issues or specific events like a homeless person , unemployed worker or a bombing of an airliner because episodic frames make for good pictures ( Iyengar &amp;Simon , 1993 ) . In contrast , the thematic news frame covers abstract subjects such as government welfare costs and changes in federal jobs programs in the form of expert talking heads or background reports ( Iyengar &amp;Simon , 1993 ) . Given the fast pace of news today , networks tend to rely on episodic framework because it is visually appealing and consists of live coverage ( Iyengar &amp;Simon , 1993 ) . </frame.v.281><frame.v.282>Digital photos framed online - as experienced picture framers and photography enthusiasts , we treat every photo we receive as if it 's one we 've taken ourselves.

A metal framed light hanging off the engine might be a better path to ground than you welding lead hooked to a rusted surface.

Because most writers considered rap Lyrics to be even more explicit than the heavy metal messages , rap Lyrics should have been framed as even more harmful to their young audience. Yet , rather than warning the American public that a generation of youngblack children was endangered by musical messages , the writers argued that the American public at large would suffer at the hands of these listeners as a result of rap music. Clearly , the listener 's welfare was no longer the focus of concern . </frame.v.285><frame.v.286>Framing may also be viewed as the interplay of media practices , cultures , audiences , and producers ( Reese , 2003 ) . Media frames tell people what is important by what is amplified or what is muted. As such , media can manipulate issue salience by framing. Media frames affect the way one understands and perceives social reality ( Baylor , 1996; Entman , 1993; Jamieson &amp;Waldman , 2003; McQuail , 2000 ) . Frames tell us what is important , what the range of acceptable debate on a topic is , and when an issue has been resolved ( Jamieson &amp;Waldman , 2003 , p. xiii ) . </frame.v.286><frame.v.287>What social action is about , in terms of fact and reference , is subject to the talk going on , a talk , however , which is framed by both the action it frames , and by group , grid , and society. That means that there is plenty of space for the selection of information even if nothing in that selection , due to recursive operation , is ever arbitrary. It can be presented as arbitrary , of course , but this is just a special reference to the content figured out of the values the variables are set to. Thus , information , as in Shannon 's mathematical theory of communication , is defined as a selection of a message , here the token of an utterance , out of a set of possible messages , here constituted by the indeterminate space of the form of social action determining the variables to assume certain values when going for communication . </frame.v.287><frame.v.288>Joists are often lapped over a girder running down the center of a building. The lapped ends of the joists may also be supported by an interior foundation or framed wall. It is standard procedure to lap joists the full width of the girder or wall. The minimum lap should be 4 inches. Figure 1-17 shows lapped joists resting on a steel girder. A 2- by 4-inch plate has been bolted to the top of a steel beam. The joists are toenailed into the plate. Solid blocking may be installed between the lapped ends after all the joists have been nailed down. Another system is to put in the blocks at the time the joists are placed . </frame.v.288><frame.v.289>The popularity of art on canvas or board has opened the door to new adventures in custom framing for the collector.

For works of art on canvas or board , the rules of framing are very different . </frame.v.289><frame.v.290>Agency : In picture framing , an Agency is run by an Agent who agrees to have your picture framed but does not actually do it and merely passes the work on to a third party for a fee or commission , much like leaving your clothes to be dry-cleaned at the Newsagent. Agencies were more common in the past , but still exist , particularly in the country. It 's preferable though to leave your artwork to be framed personally by the picture framer , or his~her staff , on their premises.

Generally , such sizes below 11 x 14 are called photo frames. Above that size , we call them ready-made frames. These frames are created to allow the purchaser the ability to frame standard sized art with relative ease. There are downsides to using a ready made frame. First , artwork comes in a variety of non-standard sizes and will not always precisely fit into the frame. Second , ready-made frames make it difficult to customize a design for the artwork using mats and other embellishments. Also , many inexpensive ready-made frames are created using substandard moulding and are imported. At FASTFRAME , since we manufacture your frame , we have the ability to customize it to suit your design needs and the size of the art . </frame.v.294><frame.v.295>As respects facility of change , it is interesting to note that the Constitutions which are most quickly and easily altered are those of Prussia , which prescribes no safeguard save that of two successive votes separated by an interval of at least twenty-one days , and that of France , which requires an absolute majority of each House for a proposal to revise , and an absolute majority of the two Houses sitting together for the carrying of any amendment. The omission of the French Chambers in 1875 to submit to the people the constitution then framed , or to provide for their sanction to any future amendments , was due to the doubt which each party felt of the result of an appeal to the nation. The Republicans , though able to prevent the establishment of a monarchical constitution by the Legislature , were not quite sure that a republican one would be carried if submitted to a popular vote. Thus it has come about that France , which went further towards popular sovereignty in 1793 than any great country has ever done , has lived since 1875 under an instrument never ratified by the people , and which was originally regarded as purely provisional . </frame.v.295><frame.v.296>Ready-Mades.

But it may also be understood as a pattern that one creatively engenders -- empowered as the writer of one 's own script , using one 's preferred metaphors.

By contrast , Plutarch frames his tale of the Titans as an allegory , using the same vocabulary that he uses to introduce other allegorical tales (    ) . If the tale of Circe 's transformation of Odysseus ' men were taken as an aition instead of an allegory , the transformation would have to serve as the precedent and cause of the whole cycle of reincarnations because Odysseus ' men drank the potion and were transformed into swine , so now all mortals undergo reincarnation.

But her Aristotelianism hardly sustains a nostalgic polemic against modernity in the way , for example , that Alisdair MacIntyre enlists Aristotle. [ FN2 ] Instead , through *1521 Nussbaum 's interpretive skills , Aristotle 's thought becomes compelling for contemporary concerns. For she reveals an Aristotle and Plato in profound conflict over competing ethical visions - competing visions that endure and turn out to frame the central divide in contemporary thought across several disciplines.

In our analysis , we utilized Burke 's ( 1992 ) ideas about discovering a " representative anecdote " within a piece of rhetoric something he defined as a story or sub-plot representative of the essence of the entire work under analysis. A representative anecdote is identified by asking , if this discourse were based on an anecdote , what would the form , outline , or bare bones of that story be ? ( Brummett , 1984 ) . One aspect of Burke 's theory of dramatistic rhetoric involves conflict and division that sometimes threatens an existing form of order or hierarchy in this case journalistic cultural authority. Burke 's theory also stresses the role of the rhetoric of identification and separateness ( Nichols , 1952 ) . In this historical episode , we interpret how some journalists framed Salinger as a " journalist , " while others rhetorically constructed him as being outside or separate from the cultural authority of journalists. We also interpret rhetoric that frames Internet " news " information , like that purveyed by Salinger , as being outside the boundary of standards of journalistic reliability . </frame.v.320><frame.v.321>On January 20th , 2009 history was made as Barack Obama was sworn in as the first African American President.

Reframing might entail getting parties to focus on outcome features that serve their interests , rather than on specific preferred outcomes , or positions. In the example above , the stadium debate could be reframed in more general terms of downtown viability , rather than in the narrow terms of building a stadium or not.

Agenda-extension allows for the examination of any differences in the framing of the same issue; using an agenda-extension perspective allows the researcher to comparatively analyze news content for bias. For example , in the 2000 elections , were Governor Bush 's themes positively or negatively framed when compared to the themes expressed by Vice President Gore ? For a good example of using agenda-setting to determine coverage of candidates issues see , Russell J. Dalton , Paul Allen Beck , Robert Huckfeldt , and William Koetzle , " A Test of Media-Centered Agenda Setting : Newspaper Content and Public Interests in a Presidential Election , " Political Communication 15 ( 1998 ) : 463-481. Of note is that these researchers found that no bias was seen in the papers covered simply because the papers covered the issues brought up by the candidates. This otherwise well constructed study shows a limitation of agenda-setting research. Using an agenda-extension perspective , one moves beyond frequency of reporting to examine the manner in which the papers reported the issues -- thus one may look for bias . </frame.v.358><frame.v.359>We are pleased to be able to offer this quality framing to you at very competitive prices.

Because , says Lakoff , embedded in the phrase " tax relief , " is the immediate suggestion that there is an affliction needing relief. What is the affliction ? Taxes.

They also varied in whether they believed they had to follow the instructions strictly , could interpret them creatively , or could ignore them when they believed that was appropriate. How each teacher could address the problem of test stress was constrained by how she framed the problem and whether she believed the instructions must be strictly followed.

As noted in the book , 80 of the talking heads on tv are conservatives and they are well trained in knowing what " language " to use to promote their ideas. The thrust of the early part of the book is that conservatives have framed the debate using a " strict father " approach. The Democrats , largely unknowledgeable about how to respond , have been emasculated. But it 's more than language that needs to change for progressives ... it is indeed , re-framing the debate to begin to change the thinking of Americans.

In common with anti-discrimination law generally , the new offence of sedition does not expressly identify those disadvantaged groups requiring protection under the law. The law is framed in neutral terms as a right to equality or non-discrimination. Thus , for example , under anti-discrimination law , both men and women have a right to equal treatment. There is a significant body of critical feminist scholarship outlining the weaknesses of equality jurisprudence , which conceals and denies remedies for the structural disadvantages in both the public and private spheres that only women experience.

And the externalities are going to be so crushing under some scenarios that are going to materialize in a generation or two that it does seem to me that societies are going to have to really be forced to take a kind of hard look at some of these externalities.

Discounting results when individuals frame the choice as one between near and remote benefits. The effect reverses if they instead frame it as a choice between different sequences of outcomes. In that scenario , they tend to prefer the best at the end.96 It is not likely that these effects directly carry over to governmental choice. For governments are corporate actors , and they choose in a highly institutionalized environment. There is much less psychological evidence on behavioural anomalies in such circumstances. But the psychological observations should serve as a warning. Constitutions , and hence our model , should be open for differences in the evaluation of several points on a time sequence. This is precisely what the present model does in that it allows for a separate a and b for each point in time. Formally , atn would be considerably smaller than at0 . </frame.v.411><frame.v.412>There is a good deal of latitude in how the important concepts of sustainability and intergenerational equity might be applied in particular contexts. A further idea that helps frame the appropriate relationship between pension contributions and benefits is provided by the life cycle theory of consumption. According to this theory , it is a rational choice for people to give up pre-retirement consumption to the degree that it will generate an income in retirement that will permit continuity in their level of consumption. This concept is not always identified in popular pension discourse , but is often implicit in it . </frame.v.412><frame.v.413>These are the pictures that Allison Thibos makes by printing sheets of her hand painted watercolors , embellishing each with gold streaks , then her laser machine cuts them into these wonderful shapes.

Do you want to hang it on a wall or will the picture look better sitting on a desk , shelf , or mantle ? Are you thinking of matting the content if that 's appropriate ? Is glass something wanted or required ? Measure the picture or artwork and understand the affects of having it framed. With most pictures , photos and artwork there is a 1/2 " loss in the viewing area in order for the frame to securely hold it. In the case of tile artwork the loss of a quarter inch on each edge could take away from the art. In which case the frame will require special consideration to fit the tile. Maybe color samples are needed to insure the proper frame color . </frame.v.419><frame.v.420>" Holidays are often a carefully planned and much needed.

These fictionalized presidents contribute to people ' s understanding and imagination concerning the American president in powerful and meaningful ways. Among the numerous cultural texts about American presidents , The West Wing is an outstanding example in terms of influence on the public imagination. For example , notes Simon Phipott and David Mutimer , with a viewing audience of more than 18 million per week , The West Wing reache [ d ] more Americans than any regularly scheduled news broadcast ( 337 ) . In addition , more Americans watched this fictionalized presidency than the actual American presidency : ' When we do the census [ in an episode ] , 13 or 14 million people watch , ' Bradley Whitford told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. ' Somebody at the White House was saying , when they want to talk about something , if they get the news cycle , it ' s maybe a million people. And if they bring up the census , the channel changes ' ( Topping 66 ) . If the way the political world is framed influences people ' s political consciousness , we can not disregard the importance of The West Wing in terms of shaping people ' s ideas about the president and American politics at least in the time period when it was on air . </frame.v.425><frame.v.426>Mr. Heydenryk 's influence was not limited to American artists. From 1945 until 1965 , Mr. Heydenryk worked closely with Samuel Kootz , one of the only American art dealers who was allowed access to Pablo Picasso 's studio in Europe. In 1947 , the first postwar exhibition of Picasso in America was presented in Heydenryk frames. In the late 1950s , Mr. Heydenryk created a series of hand carved frames designed specifically for Picasso 's last exhibitions in the U.S. before his death. In 1969 , the firm sold a frame directly to Picasso. The House of Heydenryk also framed the Kootz Gallery 's inaugural exhibition of paintings by Fernand L ger , who lived in Manhattan during the 1940s . </frame.v.426><frame.v.427>The timber framed garden offices are crafted by the GTF crew using local white pine for most of the structure , only the sills are made of local white oak.

But they considered them principally , as the minutes of their debates will show , for the purpose , or at any rate with the result , of avoiding them. They were intelligent men , a large number of them were college-bred , and they discussed the forms of government of all countries. They were not unmindful of the example of Holland , the democracies of Greece , the Roman republic and empire , and the free republics of the Middle Ages. They took what light they could from them all; and I think as good an argument could be framed to show that they were guided by what they knew of classic antiquity as could be brought forward to prove that they were guided by the British Constitution . </frame.v.431><frame.v.432>What if there is an original design but it is not sculpture in nature. Is any protection available ? Yes. Design patents cover the nonfunctional features of useful objects. Therefore , frames without sculptural qualities may find protection under patent law; specifically , with a design patent. Under the patent law a frame designer may obtain a patent for a new and ornamental design for a frame. To be eligible for a design patent , the design of a frame must be primarily ornamental , meaning the design of the frame must be the product of aesthetic skill and artistic conception. A design patentable frame design can not be driven solely by considerations of function , namely how the frame is secured around the article to be framed ( Note : a regular utility patent might be secured to protect the functional aspects of a frame ) . The frame design does not need to meet the copyright standard of separate identification and independent existence to be patentable. The non-functional aspects of an original design can qualify for a design patent . </frame.v.432><frame.v.433>Industrial democracy once worked as a union-building and regulation-legitimizing concept. It validated solidarity , internal union democracy , and efforts to connect workplace and state. Arguably , these remain essential criteria for any concept meant to frame US labour 's vision today. But that is not to say that US labour ought to resurrect the ideal of industrial democracy. To the contrary , that term is an artifact of the past , and its utility has faded away with the conditions that produced it. It can not be revived. However , it is imperative that US labour find an adequate replacement for the industrial democracy ideal , one that will help labour make its case for a new regulatory order that preserves a measure of worker security. It is doubtful that the language of workers ' rights can serve as that substitute . </frame.v.433><frame.v.434>In many cases , the physics of the world are radically different to the physics of the body , and therefore to the intuitive physics of thought.

We may know that subatomic particles are ' really ' probability functions with no specific and determinable location , yet we know this with a mind that is Aristotelean in its understanding of matter as stuff that exists at a single definite place and time . </frame.v.434><frame.v.435>14.

This second period in London is amply documented , thanks to the survival of Romney 's diaries and framing books. It is clear that most of Romney 's patrons were content to use the artist 's framemaker , rather than go to the trouble of finding one of their own; they were also happy to have their portraits framed in standard 'Romney ' patterns . </frame.v.439><frame.v.440>We are First and Foremost in Westchester as a source for rare original magazine covers , many of which are well sought after by esteemed dealers and collectors.

For example , the concept of framing links with that of agenda-setting : by consistently invoking a particular frame , the framing party may effectively control discussion and perception of the issue. Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber in Trust Us , We 're Experts illustrate how public-relations ( PR ) firms often use language to help frame a given issue , structuring the questions that then subsequently emerge. For example , one firm advises clients to use " bridging language " that uses a strategy of answering questions with specific terms or ideas in order to shift the discourse from an uncomfortable topic to a more comfortable one. [ 21 ] Practitioners of this strategy might attempt to draw attention away from one frame in order to focus on another. As Lakoff notes , " On the day that George W. Bush took office , the words " tax relief " started coming out of the White House. " [ 22 ] By refocusing the structure away from one frame ( " tax burden " or " tax responsibilities " ) , individuals can set the agenda of the questions asked in the future . </frame.v.444><frame.v.445>Fergal Keane tracked down Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in a refugee camp in Tanzania and accused him on film much as he did with Dr. Vincent Bajinya.

Candidates ' views and positions were filtered through media lenses and framed in ways that might not be fair or beneficial to some candidates. Moreover , candidates were infrequently allowed to speak for themselves and have direct mass-mediated communication with voters. The study argues that Web campaigning is a new paradigm that allowed candidates to bypass traditional media and communicate directly with voters. This process of disintermediation enables candidates to provide in-depth campaign information to voters at affordable cost. Because of its interactivity , the Web has the potential of making political campaigns more voter-driven . </frame.v.461><frame.v.462>( 35 ) In the modern age wars were fought between nation-states.

We amplify distrust if the West claims reason , democracy and personal freedoms as Western inventions and properties. If we can only imagine the global as a marketplace rather than a common human discourse we damage our ability to agree on common interests. If we define our main concern in the global age as the defence of one civilization against others then we shall lose , perhaps for ever , the chance to secure the collective conditions for continued human existence on this planet. The final globality of our time is the association of the globe with our fate as a species.

I will examine how Shivaji has been remembered - textually and visually - from the late-nineteenth century to the present. I will discuss how Shivaji figured in the histories of India constructed by colonial historians , Hindu nationalist leaders , and the non-Brahman movement in Western India. Although each of these narratives differs greatly from one another , they all depict Shivaji as a " Hindu " leader ( as variously defined ) who fought against " Muslim invaders. " This communal element of the Shivaji narrative has influenced later memories of Shivaji.

But the probability that those errors will occur on a viremic donation , results in a very low estimate of risk , and at least in the blood programs the testing on the NAT is done on a completely independent specimen collected from and labeled from the donor. So unless both those samples were mislabeled , then if both of -- if they 're independent samples coming through , then the risk is the factor of the -- the probability of viremia times the probability of a test error on the serology , times the probability of a test error on the NAT . </frame.v.548><frame.v.549>Again , the more sophisticated pre-fabricated panels make finishing your home easier.

Also like these authors , Johnston contends that frames shape ideological arguments and that individual actors in social movements hold the power to transform framings of problems and solutions. Johnston distinguishes himself from other social movement scholars who have applied frame analysis by emphasising questions of reliability. He suggests that framing occurs inside the 'black box ' of the mind , and that a myriad of factors present in any particular context influence the way people frame an issue or event ( Johnston , 1995 : pp. 218 - 9 ) . In particular , Johnston argues , the role an individual producer of text performs in a social movement organisation , as well as the social roles that individual plays in broader society , influence the framing processes that person undertakes. Ultimately , however , he argues that no researcher can peer inside the black box of the brain and get a clear picture of what a person is thinking. 'Traditional frame analysis ' , as he sees it , relies on inferential assumptions about mental activities , and , consequently , yields 'too much loose interpretation taking place too far from the data ' ( 1995 : p. 241 ) . </frame.v.558><frame.v.559>[ Henry Clay ] Monument , Lexington Cemetery , Lexington , Ky.

However , until now , what there was not , was a break down of how frames were constructed , and how ordinary citizens could wage the frame battle. He takes a series of landmark speeches and looks at it from the perspective , not of the context , or merely the political objective , but in the means by which the entire course of the debate is set by the basic foundation of discussion. This foundation is the frame , and once established , frames are more difficult to break. However they are not set in concrete.

There are , though , some basic differences between wood and metal frames. Within the framing industry , wood is the preferred frame material. There is a much wider selection of colors and styles from which to choose. Wood frames also afford more protection for your artwork. Their sturdy construction and the ability of the framer to properly close the back of the frame prevent environmental and insect damage from occurring. Metal frames have a modern , sleek type of styling. Available in many colors and styles , they , for the most part , afford a minimalist type of framing. New trends in metal mouldings , such as the Nielsen Elements  line , blend modern technology with a design flair not seen in metal mouldings for many years.

A frame enables someone to make sense of a situation or occurrence. Goffman ( 1974 ) suggests people understand the world around them by using frames. Frames select attention to particular aspects of reality described ( Entman , 1993 ) . The choices journalists make in presenting the news not only affect the salience of issues but also how stories are interpreted by audiences ( Pan &amp;amp; Kosicki , 1993 ) . By framing issues in certain ways , the media influence the way people perceive a problem or issue and its consequences , possibly altering their final evaluation of the issues ( Jasperson , Shah , Watts , Faber , &amp;amp; Fan , 1998 ) . How the media frames a story impacts social reality ( Dillard , Solomon , &amp;amp; Samp , 1996 ) because frames call attention to certain aspects of reality and direct attention away from other aspects ( Entman , 1993 ) .

They can be framed honestly or deceptively , effectively or clumsily. And they are always framed from the perspective of a worldview . </frame.v.609><frame.v.610>In addition to Hartley , some of the major American artists of the 20th century visited the Heydenryk showroom to frame their original paintings. Edward Hopper was a loyal customer for 20 years , from 1947 until his death in 1967. Other painters who framed their artwork at the House of Heydenryk include John Marin , Georgia O'Keeffe , Stuart Davis , Andrew Wyeth , Milton Avery , Charles Sheeler , Philip Evergood , John Sloan , Romare Bearden , Max Weber , Jacob Lawrence and Raphael and Moses Soyer . </frame.v.610><frame.v.611>Memories often fade , and the best way to keep in constant touch with our past is to preserve framed pictures around us. The earliest Picture Frames date back probably to Roman times , though few examples are available. There was not much need of frames , as visual art was in the form of murals and illustrations of events. The art of framing pictures or paintings was initiated in the Renaissance period , due to the need to individualize and enhance creative works. Over time , the industrial temperament changed the artistic responsiveness of people , and along with it the exclusivity of Picture Frames. Wholesale or mass-produced Picture Frames in different shapes and materials hang side-by-side with custom-made or trendy antique , silver or wood frames , catering to people looking for distinctiveness , or to project their affluence . </frame.v.611><frame.v.612>Picture and Photo frames , even digital photos need to be framed , from single pictures to family sets.

The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties. Canadian law professor John Humprey and French lawyer Ren Cassin were responsible for much of the research and the structure of the document respectively. Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights , including representatives from all continents and all major religions , and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi . </frame.v.613><frame.v.614>In the years 1996-1998 , 34 paintings and over 70 sketches by Felix Nu baum were framed by the Pfefferle Workshop. Felix Nu baum ( 1904-1944 ) began his artistic career in Willy Jaeckel ' s studio in Berlin; later he became a master apprentice to Hans Meid. In 1944 he was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In 1996 the architect Daniel Libeskind build a museum for Felix Nu baum in Osnabr ck , in which many motifs are suggestive of the building of the Jewish Musuem in Berlin . </frame.v.614><frame.v.615>8 " x10 " personalized ivory colored linen paper framed in an attractive solid oak frame ( medium stain ) with easel back.

I appreciate the problems brought up in the comments when Collin first mentioned Williams ' monograph back in June -- problems of being too dedicated to problem orientations , of fixating superproblematic. Still , I found this process immensely useful -- returning to Williams , turning Williams ' prototype intro-grammar toward an essay I 've been struggling with , and giving a similarly framed writerly reading to a published article. Williams ' model , like the stases , were exactly the heuristics I was needing to pull apart a few of the stifling think-knots messing up my writing.

The straw bale walls ( plastered and stuccoed inside and out ) which are located around the outside of the timber frame components , sit on their own " toe up " . An insulated and heated concrete slab completes the floor elements. The metal roof of the home combines three overlapping single pitched shed style sections and is made with exposed timber rafters , covered by SIPs ( structural insulated panels ) , offering excellent " R " Values.

The map of a doctrinal scholar will be different from the map of a social theorist , which will be different again from that of the legal theorist wishing to propose a theory of post-modern law.159 These differences are not a reason to abandon mapping , however , but rather a reason to engage with these complexities. Indeed , it is this critical awareness of the contextual and constructed nature of the mapping exercise that distinguishes it from mere commentary . </frame.v.618><frame.v.619>While Machar argued that women had rights that were being usurped by the liquor trade , she defined these rights , in the main , as the right of wives and children to be provided for and protected by their husbands and fathers , a position closely aligned with that of the W.C.T.U.37 Had Machar framed her argument around the violation of individual rights , she would have met Allen on the same ideological ground but it would have been difficult to sustain a convincing argument when women and children were customarily seen as having no legal rights. Husband and wife were one person under the English common law which operated in Canada except in Quebec , and , for all intents and purposes , that " 'one person ' was the husband. " 38 It was 1884 before married women could control their own property and 1897 before they could sign contracts.39 Indeed , one of the concerns expressed by anti-prohibitionists was that prohibitory legislation might lead " husband and wife to break the marriage vow by testifying against each other. " 40 While Machar championed the rights of women and children regardless of the limitations placed on them under the law , her reliance on the seemingly surer ground of community good is not surprising . </frame.v.619><frame.v.620>There is a reciprocal relationship between parties  interests and the way that they frame a problem.

This perspective suggests that the news media 's impact is not so much the result of outright statements about what audiences are to believe , but rather comes from the selection and application of the cultural lenses ( Geertz 1973 ) through which events are portrayed. To examine how the media influence audience perceptions , the codes the media use to frame public discussions of events or objects must be examined . </frame.v.629><frame.v.630>By combining framing design and crafting of frames in one small shop we ' ve returned to the older , sounder approach to framing pictures before it became a big business.

As opposed to those developed within the cultural deprivation paradigm , research and methodologies developed by cultural difference theorists examine the causes of oppositional identity and place the burden of modification on the schools. Curricula and pedagogies are identified by cultural difference theorists as targets for modification because they represent the primary sources of the cultural conflicts. In sum , cultural difference theorists argue that " students have rich cultures and values , but the schools have a culture that conflicts seriously with the cultures of students from low-income and ethnic minority groups " ( Banks , 1995 , p. 16 ) . </frame.v.632><frame.v.633>I think that we have gone overboard of trying to be concerned about older individuals.

Obviously , with Bush and his party diverting funds away from critical domestic budgets ( such as the New Orleans levee upgrade which could have prevented excess flooding aftermath left behind by Hurricane Katrina ) to a losing and futile war in Iraq , it 's obvious once again that Bush and the neoconservatives have no plans whatsoever to protect the homeland whatsoever despite their fake talk on homeland security. The progressives obviously have a chance to take this issue and turn it into a moral issue against the neoconservatives before Bush and his gang , the same neocons who slashed their budget in the first place , finish shifting the blame to state and local officials. Lakoff also warns progressives to be prepared to frame the issues and the debate quickly and proactively rather than be simply reactive because once the conservatives frame their take successfully , reframing the issue will be harder for the progressives . </frame.v.639><frame.v.640>Another critic , James Pinkerton , framed U.S. policy with the words and wisdom of 2002 ' s blockbuster Spider-Man , suggesting that Spidey and the U.S. both have difficulties with recognizing their own strength ( Like Spider-Man , U.S. ' s Gift Is Also Its Curse , Newsday , 5/2/02 ) .

While these are similar in concept to the Vandyke cabins and appear to be copies , their construction methods and detail are quite different. Like the Vandykes , these later cabins had gable roofs , fibro panelled walls , double hung windows , concrete piers and awning covered entrance doors but they were fully assembled on site from pre-cut materials and manufactured components , not integrated units like the Vandykes. These cabins were based on a steel framed system , said to be painted red , but the origin of the cabin 's manufacture is not known.

To change or break out of a particular mindset requires , as Moberg , Seabright , 29 and I27 have argued , an operative moral imagination. Moral imagination is " the ability in particular circumstances to discover and evaluate possibilities not merely determined by that circumstance , or limited by its operative mental models , or merely framed by a set of rules or rule-governed concerns.

Blockading indicates that the important target is the political machine itself , not the individuals who make it up; conversely , attacking the delegates frames the protest as a private conflict between specialized individuals protesters and politicians rather than a conflict between people and institutions. Belligerent protesters are hardly going to change the minds of the delegates , and even if they could , those delegates would only be replaced with others more loyal to the party officials and their corporate masters. Targeting the delegates has sometimes been framed as an application of the SHAC model from the animal liberation movement , in which individuals who do business with animal abusers are targeted personally. This is a thoughtless error , for the SHAC model presupposes that those targeted can take their business elsewhere , whereas the essence of the US political machine is that there is only one route to power . </frame.v.654><frame.v.655>There are many advantages to using SIPs.

There are three kinds of news medias relative to each country. There is independent news media which is independent from corporate ownership. There is foreign news media which is less susceptible to control from domestic politics. And there is corporate news media which is owned by wealthy individuals and large corporations and are used by their owners to push their corporate agendas. The corporate news media defines the issues , frames the debates , and shills the agendas of the wealthy establishment and corporate cartels. The TV corporate news medias are entertainment divisions owned by larger corporations , many of whom are weapons defence contractors. The corporate news media is fomenting a society where the only people who are entitled to the benefits of the society 's wealth are the owners of corporations. The corporate news media reduces civic discourse to the superficiality of personality politics. The corporate news media wants to " control the narrative " , control the " mass culture zeitgeist " , control the " political landscape " , rewrite history , and control " popular opinion " and they do so by " framing the debate " thereby creating " false dichotomies.

In their work , the notion of the ' public sphere ' is conceptualized to include the online offerings on the referendum of French and Dutch political parties and various non-government organizations ( NGOs ) , in addition to the more traditional notion that news coverage of this , or any other , political issue constitutes the public sphere. Building from established work on the nature of news framing namely , Gamson and Modigliani ' s ( 1989 ) framing devices and reasoning devices they present an interesting set of frames that entail a hybrid of generic frames and issue-specific frames. Van Os et al. find that these frames ' donor , ' ' invention ' and ' David vs. Goliath ' are differentially expressed in press coverage and online offerings. They conclude that within online environments , political parties and NGOs provide audiences with extended treatments that is , frames about the European referendum. Additionally , these frames provide thematic perspectives about how to understand ' Europe.

Fortunately I could , because the map was set with transparent tape. As in , it was Scotch-taped to the mounting as the only means of adhering it.

This is largely due to such practitioners as Jack Sobon and Ted Benson who studied old plans and techniques and revived the technique that had been long neglected. Timber framed structures differ from conventional wood framed buildings in several ways. Timber framing uses fewer , larger wooden members , commonly using timbers with dimensions in the range of 6 " to 12 " as opposed to common wood framing which uses many more timbers with their dimensions usually in the 2 " to 10 " range. The methods of fastening the frame members also differ , in conventional framing the members are joined using nails or other mechanical fasteners while timber framing uses mortice and tenon or more complex joints which are usually fastened using only wooden pegs . </frame.v.680><frame.v.681>We will construct timber frames from your own architects design or we can provide a full design and CAD drawing service for your timber framed building project.

In what follows , we explain why we take this view and we also sketch out a preliminary agenda designed to encourage greater human rights preparedness.

One is that society means orientation for action , talk , grid , and group , and space for mating , gaming , tying , and switching , and thus has to provide for consent as well as for dissent , and for conflict as well as for its moderation and settlement. And the other reason is that society , inside the form of social action , is framed by the *unmarked state* of that form. That unmarked state , depending on the social action distinguishing itself , may mean all kinds of things , for instance spirits , devils , and gods , or nature , physics , and universe , or the unconscious , desires , and instincts. As soon as it means something , it gets marked , pushing the unmarked state one variable further to the right , which is a process of semiosis that can only be stopped by a general kind of fetishism , that is by bans to proceed which attract all further attention to the both fascinating and frightening fetish itself ( Karl Marx , Sigmund Freud ) . </frame.v.693><frame.v.694>I understand that 6 Tula holds a very special place for you tied closely with your republican objectives for Thailand.

[ 2 ] These authors outline three 'core framing tasks ' for activists : ( 1 ) 'diagnostic framing ' , or clearly defining a problem and assigning blame for the problem to an agent or agencies; ( 2 ) 'prognostic framing ' , that is , offering solutions , and proposing specific strategies , tactics , and objectives by which these solutions may be achieved; and ( 3 ) 'motivational framing ' , or rallying the troops behind the cause ( Snow and Benford , 1988 : pp. 199 - 202 ) . To this list of 'core tasks ' they add a fourth key element , 'frame resonance'. Successful movements must appeal to the existing values and beliefs of their target population. If movements offer frames which do not resonate , or strike a chord , in the culture in which the would-be movement hopes to operate , then activists must attempt a difficult and long-term challenge of re-educating the target population to adopt new values and beliefs which will resonate with the movement 's frames ( Snow and Benford , 1988 : pp. 198 - 9 ) . </frame.v.698><frame.v.699>This paper presents the current industry practice and codification for the design of domestic cold formed steel framed structures.

We talked about the estate tax , the inheritance tax , being reframed as the death tax. Similarly , taxes in general , which we used to call tax investments. " How are we going to invest our tax monies ? " Then it became , " How are we going to spend our tax monies ? " Remember the Cons started talking about " tax and spend liberals " ? Like spending tax dollars on things like schools and bridges and roads was a bad thing. And taxing people for that was a bad thing. Well now they went a step beyond that. They said , you know , " We do n't want to be paying taxes , frankly " And , you know , the wealthy. And so taxes for them , for the wealthy , are a burden. And so we need to relieve people of the burden , of taxes. In order to have relief , of course , you have to have something that 's a burden , right ? Relieve your suffering. " Relieve your suffering during the allergy season with Privatine " , or whatever it is. So there 's this whole concept that relief is relief from something . </frame.v.704><frame.v.705>Both Janeway and the Borg turned to see the approach of a diminutive young woman carrying a briefcase , puffing slightly as she trotted across the plaza.

The question is , should we say that WTC 1 , 2 , and 7 " collapsed " or should we say they were " demolished " and does it really matter all that much ? At first glance it may not seem to be a particularly important question as to which word we use. I will expose however that it is , in fact , very important which word we use. Furthermore I want to reveal how and why the debate has been framed from the beginning by our opponents with the endlessly repeated use of just one simple word , " collapsed " . </frame.v.713><frame.v.714>After the frame cooled , it was taken to the saw shed where it was planed to its final siding dimension and sawed to its finished inner and outer dimensions , complete with the correct bevel at each point of its perimeter.

In that perspective , it becomes apparent that values do not stand in isolation , neither analytically nor normatively. Rather each culture is characterized by a specific mix of conflicting , often even incompatible values. National differences are much more pronounced with respect to the composition of the specific basket of values than with respect to single values contained in it.64 Yet , analytically , the metaphor of a basket of values , being a highly aggregate concept , is hard to handle. For simplicity , the model therefore narrows the issue down to single values . </frame.v.717><frame.v.718>In the UAW we are in process of re-building the manufacturing base of the union and our units mean that we are communicating to 6 , 000-12 , 000 workers who are mostly assembly &amp;supplier workers.

While the two sides differ in their normative assessment of whether the head start is defensible or not , what they share is actually more telling : both tend to see the problem of affirmative action in terms of damaged runners unable to compete on their own. As long as affirmative action is framed in terms of damaged runners , there is little wonder that opposition to it will continue to be intense , and that support for it , even among some of its beneficiaries , will often be lukewarm . </frame.v.726><frame.v.727>These questions frame this panel , which examines some of the places inhabited by Resident Koreans in postwar Japanese literature.

Because Pasolini framed his own return to prose as " an enquiry into subjectivity , " Gordon argues that Petrolio " provides a vertiginous array of textual and discursive features to confirm , qualify , and re-articulate what has already been discerned in his journalism , poetry , and cinema " ( 268 ) . From Gordon 's perspective , the unfinished fragmentary nature of the text is not a hindrance , but indeed offers an opportunity to study the work of subjectivity under construction. As he argues , " if the sheer weight of unwritten material means that Petrolio can not be the summa ' Pasolini dreamed of , it can be read as notes towards a synthesis and summary of the work of subjectivity in his oeuvre " ( 268 ) . Gordon 's reading is indeed persuasive and it serves a dual purpose as final chapter and conclusion. Thus , his analysis of Petrolio re-enforces and re-articulates the book 's earlier findings by locating their continuing dynamic presence in the unfinished novel . </frame.v.731><frame.v.732>We are a full service frame shop designed to help you with a classic design task of picture framing.

Only one of the cases that Irons selects as mile-posts in the people 's history , Miranda v. Arizona ( 1966 ) , deals in significant ways with criminal justice.

However , as Lakoff quickly proved , the focus and outcome of all debate rests in how one frames that debate. He believes that conservatives have sunk a lot of time and money into framing their issues. In the case of progressives , Lakoff says " a conceptual overhaul " and " reframing " of how to approach and define issues is in order if their message is to be understood. Lakoff 's latest book , Whose Freedom ? The Battle Over America 's Most Important Idea , published in June by Farrar , Straus , and Giroux , discusses the competing rhetoric used by progressives and conservatives in shaping political discourse . </frame.v.819><frame.v.820>Some Builders prefer to layout the rough openings before the studs and cripples are marked.

The dark frame also allows the somber background colors to be legible. A bright gold frame would have overpowered the subtle interplay of dark tones in the upper portion of the composition and made them appear as an undifferentiated dark mass. Thus , the dark Dutch frame works equally well with both the brightly colored draperies and the dark passages of these paintings. The frame for a replica of Sita and Sarita ( Corcoran Gallery of Art , Washington , D.C. ) , which Beaux painted around 1921 , is identical in design to that on the original painting. The portrait Mrs. Thomas A. Scott ( Anna Riddle ) ( cat. 51 ) is framed in a narrow , black , scooped molding with a gadrooned edge that recalls simpler seventeenth-century Dutch frames. An installation photograph of the painting in the Sixty-seventh Annual Exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1898 shows it in this frame . </frame.v.822><frame.v.823>Obama also astutely criticized Bush and McCain for calling any timetable for the removal of American troops ' surrender , ' even though we would be turning Iraq over to a sovereign Iraqi government.

The contradiction follows naturally enough from their method; for as soon as they leave the direct line of growth and begin to search for resemblances everywhere they will find plenty of them. Human nature is in a general way much the same all the world over , and human beings have been laboring for many centuries and encountering the same problems and conditions in one country as in another. Within recent years vast quantities of historical details of almost every country have been published , and a man who has a fancy for some particular nation can easily frame a specious argument to show how other nations have apparently copied from it . </frame.v.837><frame.v.838>In addition , Hizballah framed the proposed Islamic state as the result of a cosmic transformation which was imminent. For example , Nasrallah once claimed that the divine state of justice realized on part of this earth will not remain confined within its geographic borders , and is the dawn that will lead to the appearance of the Mahdi , who will create the state of Islam on earth. ( Nasrallah , 1986 ) This apocalyptic discourse is based on Shia narratives. According to Shia eschatology , the Mahdi or Hidden Imam will return on earth to judge the living and dead; at that time justice will finally triumph and Muslims will see the sole path to salvation. The implication is that the outcome of this struggle is rigidly determined because there is a divine purpose and a preordained time schedule. Such a discourse was largely based on Ayatollah Khomeini ' s perception of reality and the world; for example , he once claimed that ' God willing , with the spread of the Islamic Revolution the satanic powers will be isolated and the government of the downtrodden will pave the ground for the global government of the Mahdi at the end of time ' ( Tehrani , 2006 : 121 ) . </frame.v.838><frame.v.839>I culled this quote from the introduction to a book of quotations called Good Advice on Writing , edited by William Safire and Leonard Safir , ( Simon and Schuster , 1992 ) .

Moreover , since newsworthiness is determined primarily by what other media are covering ( see Steffens 1931; Gans 1979; Loo 2002 ) , media are more immune to understanding themselves as agents of legitimation ( pp. 109-111 ) .

Under s. 44 ( 1.1 ) , the appropriate comparison is between samesex and oppositesex survivors whose partners died before January 1 , 1998; under s. 72 ( 2 ) , it is between samesex and oppositesex survivors who applied for survivor ' s pensions between July 2000 and June 2001. To frame , as suggested by the government , the comparator group in terms of the express distinction made in ss. 44 ( 1.1 ) and 72 ( 2 ) between two groups of survivors of samesex relationships , based on the date on which the relationship ended as a result of the death of one of the partners , would be to miss the fundamental reason for the 2000 CPP amendments namely , to remedy unequal treatment between samesex and oppositesex couples. Here , the Court of Appeal was right to conclude that ss. 44 ( 1.1 ) and 72 ( 2 ) infringe s. 15 ( 1 ) of the Charter. Both provisions treat samesex survivors differently from their comparator group; sexual orientation is recognized as an analogous ground of discrimination under s. 15 ( 1 ) , and the differential treatment discriminated in a substantive sense.

But if a man takes wax bearing the impression of the great seal off from one patent , and fixes it to another , this is held to be only an abuse of the seal , and not a counterfeiting of it : as was the case of a certain chaplain , who in such manner framed a dispensation for non-residence. But the knavish artifice of a lawyer much exceeded this of the divine. One of the clerks in chancery glued together two pieces of parchment; on the uppermost of which he wrote a patent , to which he regularly obtained the great seal , the label going through both the skins. He then dissolved the cement; and taking off the written patent , on the blank skin wrote a fresh patent , of a different import from the former , and published it as true. This was held no counterfeiting of the great seal , but only a great misprision; and Sir Edward Coke mentions it with some indignation , that the party was living at that day . </frame.v.842><frame.v.843>Our preferred supplier for glazing products is Tru Vue  .

The real difference with a timber frame home is that you do n't have framing every 1624 inches , with insulation just placed between the boards. That creates a huge thermal break. In our buildings , the panels basically wrap them like a huge Coleman cooler. A typical frame house has an R-value of 19 in the roof and 28 in the walls. Ours average R-28 in the walls and R-40 in the roof. Besides the energy savings , timberframes have another appeal that seems a bit counterintuitive. Considering that most people opt for timberframing because they like looking at wood , it may come as a surprise to learn that this type of home actually uses far LESS wood than a house that is framed using two-by-fours . </frame.v.854><frame.v.855>Once the frames are displayed , simply click on the frame you want , and your picture will be framed.

Historically , however , when compelled , many negotiations have taken place between parties who do not like each other and whose rationality and capacity to be reasonable is in doubt. The tension between going to war and negotiating continues to be as strong now in the present day as it has been throughout recorded history. Thucydides recounted how various efforts to negotiate peace between the Spartans and Athenians over a 30 year span of time were thwarted in the Fifth Century B.C. , in A History of the Peloponnesian War. His description of The Melian Dialogues , where the risks and advantages of negotiation were strategically assessed , parallels almost word for word the same kind of discussions that have occurred in every war and dispute since and continues to frame discussions of approaches to conflict between liberals and realpolitik hawks .

Note the difference between the framing of an uncertain outcome in terms of the losses ( or gains ) to one party , and the win-lose or " fixed-pie " perception that one party 's loss is necessarily another party 's gain. An example of the win-lose frame is a community 's perception that accepting a landfill hurts it , while benefiting only the landfill 's owner; that is , community and landfill owner can not be simultaneously satisfied -- when one wins the other loses. An example of the loss/gain frame is describing a landfill to the local community in terms of dollars saved ( or dollars spent ) on solving solid waste problems. The loss or gain frame regards consequences to only one party , while the win-lose frame characterizes joint outcomes. In experiments where tasks differ only in frame individuals tend to be risk-averse with the gains frame and risk-seeking with the losses frame ( Tversky &amp;Kahneman , 1981 , 1991 ) . Space change consequences framed as losses may prompt stakeholders to engage in " risky " activist behavior , such as challenges and protests against a proposed development , while a gains frame may dull scrutiny and involvement . </frame.v.859><frame.v.860>246.

Some 18-20 million people had been prisoners in camps and colonies throughout the period of Stalinism at one point or another. The appropriateness of such a response is perhaps indicated by their continued existence until 1960 , long after the USSR became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 , a permanent member of its Security Council and a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The landscape elements , like the rocky ledges behind the evangelists , and the vegetal motifs , like the arching vine at the top of the wall , betray no real perspective and almost press up against the picture plane at the same depth as the figures supposedly before them. These landscape and vegetal elements hint at depth , but they really reveal the material matrix , the wall , on which representation is placed. This sharing of the picture plane by framing motifs and the scene or figures framed is typical of Byzantine art . </frame.v.872><frame.v.873>Coupled with our beautiful wood picture frames , the results are outstanding !

Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein argues that " Americans who vote in a foreign election , occupy any office in a foreign state , enlist in a foreign army , attempt to overthrow the U.S. government , or otherwise affirm allegiance to a foreign nation should forfeit their citizenship. " 41 The problem with that approach is that the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Afroyim v. Rusk ( 1967 ) that Americans could not loose their citizenship for voting in a foreign election. Fein 's solution : " Congress should either propose a constitutional amendment to overcome Afroyim; or , enact legislation that deletes the specific intent requirement in the expectation that the high court will reconsider the precedent. " 42 The problem with this approach is that passing a constitutional amendment is difficult at best , and one can anticipate howls of outrage at what will be argued is a punitive " anti-immigrant " measure. Moreover , having Congress pass a measure specifically framed to have the Supreme Court reconsider their opinion depends on the makeup of the court . </frame.v.876><frame.v.877>We tend to think of timber framed houses in terms of the wooden structures , often kit-built from Scandinavian or Canadian suppliers , that crop up from time to time , are striking when they do appear , but which in this country are seen as a rarity. However a house does not need to look like a log cabin or a tithe barn to be of basic timber construction. The timber frame is the structural , load-bearing part of the house , says Lloyd ' s Marketing Director Duncan Dibble , but you can have any kind of external finish you like brick , block , wood or a combination of these. Basically there is no way of telling from the outside whether a house is timber-framed or not. However timber frame construction offers many advantages over brick , both for the end customer and for Lloyds Timber Frames ' direct customer , the contractor . </frame.v.877><frame.v.878>The same can be said for Kelman 's assertion that the background interpretive constructs that give content to criminal law norms are arational and nondefensible. As a strategy for finding creative openings to undermine existing criminal law policies , there is much to be said for this style of argument. By highlighting ambiguities in the way " the event " is framed temporally and spatially , Kelman 's analysis identifies points of vulnerability on which advocates or policy reformers might seize to press for creative change. But by asserting that these background cultural or moral understandings are arational , Kelman 's arguments undermine the foundation for treating values as incommensurable. [ FN78 ] Unlike Kaplow , Kelman does not offer any specific alternative policies that might follow from his implicit rejection of the incommensurability of values. But even though Kelman 's rejection is not as explicit as Kaplow 's , it is more sweeping; Kelman believes the distinctions that pervade substantive criminal law rest throughout on nondefensible interpretive frameworks that , in effect , mark out certain values as incommensurable with others. And as with Kaplow , it is troubling that Kelman does not address the social and political consequences of assuming that values ought generally to be *1555 commensurable.

Thus , framing implies subjective involvement in an event ( Tuchman , 1978 ) . 38 Entman ( 1993 ) 39 argues that frame building occurs as journalists select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text , in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition , causal interpretation , moral evaluation , and/or treatment recommendation for the item described  ( p. 56 ) . This can be achieved in the media message by the presence or absence of certain keywords , stock phrases , stereotyped images , sources of information , and sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clusters of facts or judgments  ( Entman , 1993 , p. 25 ) .40 Thus news frames are embodied in key words , metaphors , concepts , symbols and visual images emphasized in a news narrative  ( p. 7 ) . </frame.v.884><frame.v.885>Varying degrees of public support for war in Iraq can be traced to variations in the way news media in different countries represented the crisis to their publics. We present related studies of news coverage of the Iraq war in news magazines of six nations over a one-year period leading up to and including the war and its aftermath. We draw on a sample of stories about Iraq in major news magazines from France , Canada , the US , India , the UK , and Germany. We find support for the hypothesis that news media in these different countries show quite disparate patterns of sympathy and " demonization " of Iraq as the enemy. Such differences not only reflect critically important distinctions in national policy positions towards Iraq , they also have likely contributed to differences in public perceptions of the need for war at all. We also find evidence for the hypotheses that international ( non-American ) media framed the issues of war and foreign policy objectives by advocating a less aggressive , more internationalist , and more diplomatic foreign policy approach than US media , and that these distinctions represent the widening gap between the United States and Europe on issues of geopolitics and global cooperation . </frame.v.885><frame.v.886>In 2004 , a little book appeared that made quite a splash among dispirited Democrats : George Lakoff 's Do n't Think of an Elephant.

While some communities supported the expansion , this frame did not yield the desired result. Instead , the prospective loss prompted the formation of the Friends of Shadow Lake. It also elicited public opposition from residents hoping that when the landfill reached capacity it would close. This loss frame encouraged activism and increased opposition to the landfill even after the plan was defeated. In the face of such reactions and of official statements from several communities opposing the plan on environmental grounds , the owner reframed the expansion as a gain to the community -- a water quality improvement project to remedy landfill leaching into park water. Some pro-expansion support was reportedly garnered from 18 or 19 other municipalities who adopted the proposed gains framing in terms of cost savings to the county.

If we understand that any set of events can be framed in numerous ways , it follows that journalists will frame events to make them ' newsworthy ' and likely to be published ( ibid. , 19 ) .

A typical EBS 18 ' by 24 ' timber frame great room might consist of two bents , connected by a purlin roof system and horizontal wall beams. Frames can also be constructed that do not use bents but instead a roof system that uses common rafters. There are no limits to what we can frame with timbers.

This is an inadvisable practice that may cause or promote fogging , condensation and even the sticking of the actual image to the glass. Just as temperature fluctuations can cause your car to fog up on the inside , so can the same thing happen inside a picture frame. This fogging , or condensation , can easily damage your artwork by bleeding inks , smudging a gouache or watercolour , soften photographic emulsions ( the image part of a photogarph ) causing them and other paper-borne art to stick to the glass. It can also promote discolouration or even " fox " ( the small brown spots commonly seen on old prints and papers ) any paper art. To avoid most if not all of the above , we suggest framing all artwork with either a mat or mount or , if the artwork is large , spacers that are special plastic strips placed under the lip of the frame between the glazing and the artwork . </frame.v.906><frame.v.907>28.

The earliest photo frames were joined at the corners with a lap joint , where the picture frames sides overlap , but by the eighteenth century , the mitre joint , where the corners are cut diagonally and are joined by a key on the rear side of the wood picture frame , had become universal.

It comprises many diverse groups which grow and die , divide and fuse , proliferate and contract. It possesses multiple , temporary and sometimes competing leaders or centers of influence.

Van Dijk argues that language , discourse , and social behaviour arise from the cognitive processes by which people perceive , interpret , organise , and represent their knowledge of the world , that is , the way people construct a 'social " reality " ' ( van Dijk , 1977 : p. 99; 1980 : p. 2 ) . Van Dijk distinguishes between the study of language ( a domain including lexicons , semantics , grammars , syntax , and macro/discursive structures ) , which he defines as the study of the parts people use to construct a text , and the study of discourse ( a domain of 'semantic superstructures ' or 'schematic forms ' , such as narratives , myths , arguments , or scientific reports ) , which he sees as the study of types of texts and the way people use these different types to perform specific communicative purposes ( 1977 : p. 153 ) . Van Dijk postulates that framing processes may occur at both the macrostructural and superstructural levels , though he expresses doubts about the potential operation of the latter. He suggests that if superstructural framing occurs , then that process operates independently of discursive structural framing . </frame.v.944><frame.v.945>[ Framed photographs displayed on wall of 'Wee House in the Wood , ' Ashland , Kentucky , August 1968 ] Display of framed photographs on wallpapered wall of Jean Thomas ' 'Wee House in the Wood ' in Ashland , Kentucky.

While painting with a brush loaded with pigments and applying them in a granulous fashion by thick dabs , Vermeer ingeniously develops his mastery as a luminist. The young woman is bathed in light , which streams in through the half open window to the left , and reflects itself from the cream-coloured background that is enhanced to the left by very thin glazes of slightly pinkish tonalities. Her face , exceptionally conveying expression - joy and laughter - appears framed in a kerchief and the collar of her dress. That part of the figure , especially , reveals itself as a symphony of luminosity , set off by the dark sleeves of the yellow jacket on which glittering highlights dance. In contrast , the soldier in the black hat and red jacket is placed close to the viewer , from whom he turns his back.

The Guild is dedicated to establishing training programs for dedicated timber framers , disseminating information about timber framing and timber frame building design , displaying the art of timber framing to the public , and generally serving as a center of timber framing information for the professional and general public alike . </frame.v.999><frame.v.1000>Also , I must share with you an experience unique to researchers and friends that have visited me and sat in the study where I have done my work for the last few years.

The load is spread across the internal skeleton of large timbers and the outer wall panels are simply cladding. This is a considerable attribute for the planning of interesting spaces within the building and , since the bays can be assembled in more or less any permutation , for interesting and varied overall plan forms . </frame.v.1002><frame.v.1003>At City Frames , professional expertise , creativity and personal attention make picture framing a uniquely rewarding experience.

The iCab browser allows the user ( through a contextual menu ) to load an iframe 's content ( or any frame , image , or whatever object ) into either a new window or into the current browser window. But IE 4+ does not do anything like that. ( It lets the user view the HTML source of an inline frame or print its content , when the right mouse button is used for clicking. ) Therefore , consider also providing a normal link to the inline framed document.

This type of description , however , was unable to explain the motives underlying the act portrayed in these powerful images , and thus gave little indication of what rhetorical meaning could be attached to them. It was in the act of contextualizing Brownes photographs that they took on rhetorical meaning. The frames offered by the print media tended to bifurcate into two opposing perspectives : onefeaturing a theme of religious oppression by Diem ' s government , the other featuring a theme of a struggle for freedom against the communists. The photographic image of Thich Quang Dues fiery suicide , the antiDiem protests by the Buddhists , and the war itself , would take on vastly different meanings depending upon the context in which they were placed. We tam now to examine those media that framed the events against a backdrop of religious oppression in South Vietnam . </frame.v.1005><frame.v.1006>The issue has to be framed in terms of the constituency which will respond to the Democratic message.

Moreover , they frequently include large cathedral areas and will need extra ambient lighting to illuminate both the framing and the ceiling. Without additional up lights and wall washers , a cathedral great room can feel dark and oppressive; with appropriate lighting both the space and structure can be appreciated. Another challenge is that unless the timber framed house has a raised second floor deck , it is impossible to use concealed down lights or other fixtures intended to be hidden in floor cavities . </frame.v.1007><frame.v.1008>Light can also cause irreparable damage to artworks. UV filtering glass can be used to minimise the effects of fading ( Hidden House Picture Framing stocks UV glass ) . Other measures , such as closing curtains when a room is not in use and switching off artificial lights when not needed , can be effective in reducing levels of light from damaging your artwork. It should be noted that as well as fading colours within an artwork , UV light could also increase brittleness of fabric and paper fibres. Always attempt to hang your artwork outside the line of direct sunlight , even if your artwork is framed with UV filtering glass. Watch out for the changing positions of the sun throughout the year as this can bring sunlight to areas that were previously in the shade . </frame.v.1008><frame.v.1009>To promote the fact that a post-frame building system is just a structural framing system , it often helps to overview other structural framing/support systems. In general , a structural framing/support system is either concrete-based , steel-based , wood-based , or a combination of these three. Concrete-based systems include buildings supported by either masonry walls , precast concrete components , or steel-reinforced , cast-in-place concrete components. Steel-based systems range from the high-rise , three-dimensional steel-framed structures to buildings entirely framed with cold-formed , light-gage steel components. In between these two steel-framed assemblies are low-rise metal building systems , which are more commonly referred to as pre-engineered steel buildings ( even through all buildings of note are pre-engineered ) . Wood-based framing/support systems include log , timber-frame , light-wood frame , structural insulated panel ( SIP ) , and of course , post-frame . </frame.v.1009><frame.v.1010>Pictureframes.com picture frame mats , custom matting , precut mats , canvas panels , collage picture frames , framing supplies and more . </frame.v.1010><frame.v.1011>Among her stock are valuable 15th-century frames.

The first and most important technique of persuasion is " framing. " The basic idea is that the persuasive appeal of a counterattitudinal message increases if the issue is strategically framed to resonate with already accepted norms.40 Many studies of this technique emphasize the role of strategic " norm entrepreneurs , " who manipulate frames to resonate with target audiences.41 One widely studied and highly successful example of such strategic framing is the campaign to ban antipersonnel landmines. The campaign -- which culminated in the Ottawa Convention banning the production and use of the weapons -- successfully framed the issue in terms of the " indiscriminate nature and effects " of landmines , thereby linking the issue with a universally accepted principle of humanitarian law ( and other successful campaigns against weapons of mass destruction ) .42 </frame.v.1015><frame.v.1016>There are also simple picture color-balance tools in the software.

In a Christian territory with a long history of war against Islam , the figure of the Moor as the enemy of society and religion would not go missing. So , one sees the figure of a knight dressed in armour and helmet and holding his lance at the ready and pointing at the Moor who is trying to escape. The Moor looks back and raises his right arm to plead clemency. It is interesting to see how the artist took pains to describe the trappings worn by the horse , and the knight s armour. The other face of the capital depicts the knight showing clemency to the Moor and taking him prisoner to the castle. In the castle , one can appreciate the fine work of the artist , with its merlons and its entrance framed by a pointed arch leading to the interior of the building . </frame.v.1017><frame.v.1018>This a fabulous flamingo painting by Nadine.

Beyond its value for survival , it provides a valuable training in ingenuity for a context of future social chaos -- whether in providing advantages for exploiting such chaos or through developing the vigilance to counter the criminal activity of others. Crime may be understood as the creative human response to systemic inadequacies. The widespread incidence of crime , and exposure to its consequences , also provides a stimulus to healthy vigilance , as argued with respect to urban violence. Especially challenging to the ingenuity of positive thinking are crimes against humanity -- particularly given the appropriateness of extending the criteria to include those considered relevant by future generations , better able to judge the criminality of actions in the present that are likely to ensure the death of untold millions . </frame.v.1026><frame.v.1027>The first painting on D.

She turned around. The picture opposite the one with the cape was also black and white and exhibited a human shape standing with arms uplifted against a turbulent gray sky on what appeared to be one of the western towers.

The king 's face is framed by the red , familar antique lettering of the magazine section title , which in this context picks up both the color and the traditional associations of the king 's chair. The caption , in large block letters across Abdullah 's chest , provides a contrast , the starker , more modern typocgraphy declaring : " Suddenly ( in grey ) , " " A King " ( in white ) .

Unconsidered by Cunningham while designing Wiki , Wiki itself has been adapted by users to facilitate both intra and extra-textual communications. When Wiki authors commit a change , they leave short ( one line or so ) summaries of their changes. While this is useful to those skimming a particular wiki , this functionality can not facilitate meaningful dialog between Wiki authors. Using the system itself , long conversations are often executed as series of edits to a single page. Each author simply edits a page and adds a bit to the bottom ( or to a relevant place that signifies that it is in response to a particular comment ) . These conversations occur on dedicated Wiki pages and in reserved sections of normal pages to comment on the page topics. Complex systems of notation and etiquette help shape and frame these conversations.

It is important to note that the act of judgement , which attempts to comprehend or assess the legitimacy of an act of war or terror in the name of human rights , takes place within a set of traditions. These traditions of the moral and juridical ordering of violence operate to frame and shape the way in which thinking approaches the act of violence. The conceptualisation of violence through the graduations of ' war ' , ' civil war ' , and ' terror ' locate an act within a sphere of determined legitimacy. Further , the conceptualisation of violence through notions of ' moral duty ' , ' universality ' and ' humanity ' attempts to hide the frailty of the moral justification of violence , which otherwise perches unstably above war ' s moral problem. This is not to say that all judgement is predetermined , or that thinking should abandon attempting to develop criteria for determining the ' legitimacy ' of violence. Rather , the suggestion is merely that moral and legal judgement is situated within a process of ( mis ) recognition , and that the task for judgement concerns the issue of how well it ( mis ) recognises itself in this wider process and manages to navigate through an awareness of its own failures and limitations . </frame.v.1063><frame.v.1064>Main Street Frame Shop specializes in crafting custom picture frames.

Because once you 've defined the frame then you 've colored or tinted or changed the meaning of everything that is contained in that frame. And you get to define it. You get to control it . </frame.v.1072><frame.v.1073>The example nicely demonstrates the rivaling narrative ambitions and " Theories of Mind " at work in textual representations of the scandal. The extract is framed by the best-selling romantic discourse of Andrew Morton ( known also as Princess Diana 's personal biographer ) , an ing nue-story of Lewinsky in which Clinton appears as " a flawed individual , riddled with doubt and desire " ( Monica 's Story , 5 ) . Inside the biographical discourse we read another best-seller , The Starr Report or , in fact , an examination record of the initial interrogation of Lewinsky ( which , outrageously , happened without her lawyer present ) . Two genres , romantic ( " poetic flourish " ) and juridical , both collapse and intermingle; it almost seems as if Morton were jealously guarding his own discursive realm , where rays of sunshine are stock material. Yet these competing narratives are both based on interviews with Lewinsky and the wordings hark back to her romantic frame of mind. Thus the narrative situation seems analogous to those in narrative fiction where the oscillation between narrator 's discourse and character 's discourse creates double-voiced effects such as stylistic contagion or free indirect discourse . </frame.v.1073><frame.v.1074>Greetings to my loving valentine.

It can involve deliberate use of psychological , and intellectual skills , on the one hand , or less conscious skills within a sense of perception. Framing is a set of skills employed to one degree or another by the politician , photographer , chef , advertising executive , historian , teacher , coach , artist , academic , author , and by ordinary people. For example , the skill and depth used in appraising an event aid in helping to understand what might be taking place well beyond the limited knowledge of those who are involved in only part of the event itself. " The essential tool of the information manager is the ability to frame. To determine the entire meaning of a subject is to make sense of it , to judge its character and significance. To hold the frame of a subject is to choose one particular meaning ( or set of meanings ) over another. We manage meaning when we assert that our interpretations should be taken as real over other possible interpretations " ( Fairhurst 1996 ) . </frame.v.1075><frame.v.1076>£ 14.99 - Ernest Shackleton print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - Ernest Shackleton print - POSTED £ 29.99 - Ernest Shackleton framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - Ernest Shackleton framed print - POSTED </frame.v.1076><frame.v.1077>Of course , story headlines also framed the Prop 187 articles , as did photos and caption headings.

If neither pregnancy , insanity , non-identity , nor other plea will avail to avoid the judgment , and stay the execution consequent thereupon , the last and surest resort is in the king ' s most gracious pardon; the granting of which is the most amiable prerogative of the crown. Law ( says an able writer ) can not be framed on principles of compassion to guilt : yet justice , by the constitution of England , is bound to be administered in mercy : this is promised by the king in his coronation oath , and it is that act of his government , which is the most personal , and most entirely his own. The king himself condemns no man; that rugged task he leaves to his courts of justice : the great operation of his sceptre is mercy. His power of pardoning was said by our Saxon ancestors to be derived a lege suae dignitatis : and it is declared in parliament , by statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 24 , that no other person hath power to pardon or remit any treason or felonies whatsoever; but that the king hath the whole and sole power thereof , united and knit to the imperial crown of this realm . </frame.v.1079><frame.v.1080>We offer an extensive collection of Framing Choices , ranging from handcrafted carved moldings , Historically accurate gold leaf Frames , and sleek contemporary creations that span the use of such diverse materials such as Welded Steel , Driftwood and Veneered Inlays.

The latter sequence is essentially wordless , the former - though framed by words - substantially wordless. The two in union make extensive use of music to establish their full weight and meaning. The first experienced of the two is given a sharply etched foreword to serve as opening framework : Sam Houston at Washington-on-the-Brazos ordering his officers to inform the recruits of an assembling Texian army that the men responsible for whatever victory Texas can eventually achieve are themselves doomed. He ends with the words : I hope they remember. I hope Texas remembers. He turns and walks in solitude beside the Brazos River. A chorus quietly emerges to follow his gait with hymnal humming. He reopens and rereads a letter brought by messenger from Travis - it can only be that most famous of American letters beginning To the People of Texas and All Americans in the World - and bows his head. Then the aching figure of Houston disappears into the slowest and eventually the darkest of dissolves . </frame.v.1081><frame.v.1082>The Deck : Typically , a conventionally framed deck ( building material of choice , i.e. dimensional lumber , engineered lumber , steel ) is used as the first floor and the base for your timber frame.

This paper examines a range of framing literature , from the writings of authors including Erving Goffman , Tuen van Dijk , Serge Moscovici , George Lakoff , Alan Johnson , William Gamson , David Snow , Robert Benford and Paolo Donati. Then it develops the theoretical case for defining frames as semi-structured elements of discourse which people use to make sense of information they encounter. Additionally , this paper demonstrates the need to include social system frames , which provide patterns for understanding social relations , among the presently acknowledged frame types. Frames develop in parallel with language , vary across cultures , and shape , but are distinct from other extra-linguistic discourse forms , including myths and ideologies . </frame.v.1086><frame.v.1087>Republicans are constantly invoking Reagan in the most glowing ways possible , but is this spin ? Is it lies ? I do n't think so , at least not always. Their audience consist of a large swath of the electorate that already bought the " Reagan is Great " frame - hook , line and sinker. Those who exist solidly on the left do n't believe that frame , but they also do n't care what Republicans are saying anyway. So , according to the audience of the Republicans , the way Reagan is framed is accurate. It may not be an objective truth , but in politics you do n't get to measure how much liquid is in the glass. Their audience believes the hype about Reagan. They do n't have to spin , because the spinning already took place and the legacy of Reagan in the minds of most Americans has been set. It is wrong , but it is set. Reagan is among the greatest American presidents. This is the subjective truth according to a huge cross-section of the electorate. I know we hate this , but I do n't see how anyone can deny it . </frame.v.1087><frame.v.1088>During the debate over human reproductive cloning , reporters , ethicists , and policymakers alluded to Shelley ' s Frankenstein and Huxley ' s Brave New World as shorthand for the threat posed to society by this new technology.

As he addresses the mock celebratory soliloquy of discontent not to himself , but to the court , the camera moves in to frame the movements of his brutal , willful jaw and show his teeth. The shot alludes , perhaps , to the famous long tracking shot in Young and Innocent , in which a slow movement from the upper balcony of an immense dancehall to a close up of the drummer in the band , a close-up tight enough to reveal the flaws in his blackface makeup and discover the murderer 's disguise , as well as the many references to Richard 's bite in the Shakespeare ( " O Jesus bless us , he is born with teeth; " " beware my bite , etc. ) Hitler is evoked; not only his signature use of the microphone but his suppression of and unintended contribution to the visual record of history . </frame.v.1090><frame.v.1091>The United States Senate is , as we shall see , a gradual development from the Governor 's Council of colonial times , which was first a mere advisory council of the governor , afterwards a part of the legislature sitting with the assembly , then a second house of legislature sitting apart from the assembly , as an upper house; sometimes appointed by the governor , sometimes elected by the people , until it gradually became an elective body , with the idea that its members represented certain districts of land , usually the counties. It had developed thus far when the National Constitution was framed , and it was adopted in that instrument so as to equalize the States and prevent the larger ones from oppressing the smaller ones. This was accomplished by giving each State two Senators , so that large and small were alike. The language in the Constitution describing the functions of the Senate was framed principally by John Dickinson , who at that time represented Delaware , one of the smaller States of the Union , which had suffered in colonial times from too much control by Pennsylvania . </frame.v.1091><frame.v.1092>The 2-story Colonial structural steel framed house preferably has a 30 foot clear span interior with a ceiling height of 107 inches , and optional exposed beams or a lower ceiling , with an overhang of 28 inches.

These frames are based on Louis XIII models of the early seventeenth century and on British Baroque interpretations of these designs from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries the so-called Lely frames , named after the English portrait painter Sir Peter Lely ( 1618 1680 ) , on whose works they so often appear. For similar reasons , Venetian Rococo frames of the early eighteenth century are often called Canaletto frames after the Italian painter Canaletto ( 1697 1768 ) . These frames also contain carved foliate-and-leaf corner and center panels in low relief between unadorned reposes on an ogee profile. Many Arts and Crafts frame makers designed frames that alternate low-relief foliate-and-leaf carving with reposes . </frame.v.1094><frame.v.1095>The first interest , the right to a fair trial , is framed as an individual right but , like other individual rights , it can never be completely separated from the general interest held by everyone in the community in knowing that everyone has the right.

However the government 's line of argument is that Scientology was no religion in the first place , so according to this logic members ' feelings about that kind of language would not have to be considered.

Pakistan was more often covered unfavourably than favourably and more often framed as a foe than a friend , overall. Pakistan was also framed more often as a fundamentalist than a liberal state. Also , most of the stories on Pakistan had US by lines , followed by Indian and Pakistani by lines. The coverage marginalised the culture and social development scenes and instead highlighted demonstrations , riots and political unrest in the country. The newspapers concentrated on foreign affairs within the US global strategy. In this regard , Poornananda ( 1998 ) 52 has said that US media generally portray Third World countries negatively by focusing on stories on crime , disasters , conflicts , and failure of governments , while areas such as science , arts and culture are significantly marginalised.

In judicial opinions this fear and hysteria serves to increase the exigency of governmental interests and therefore skews the balancing courts use in deciding Fourth Amendment cases.

That seems like a backwards way to frame the legal issue -- after all , is n't it common sense that a publication is libelous only if it 's false ? -- but the notion of a legal positive defense gives an individual or organization a way to organize behavior in a way that is both professionally appropriate and also make a legal defense aligned with professional expectations.

Kline served as the film 's cinematographer. Working from sketch artist Maurice Zuberano 's concepts , Wise would judge if they were on the right track. Kline and Michelson would then discuss the look they wanted ( along with Weldon , if effects were involved. ) Each sequence was then storyboarded and left to Kline to execute. The cinematographer called his function to " interpret [ the ] preplanning and make it indelible on film. It 's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength. " Kline would recall that there was not a single " easy " shot to produce for the picture , as each scene required special consideration. The bridge , for example , was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better. It was hard to frame shots so that reflections of the crew in monitors or light spilling through floor grilles were not seen in the final print.

So at 449 we completely reposition the camera using the Top View panel again to move the camera back from the picture plane to give us the complete view of the set. Once we get the right camera set up , we add a keyframe at frame 449 to lock down our starting camera position. This wide shot lasts until frame 552 where we have made a slight adjustment of the camera to give us a really small pan during our wide shot.

I explore the urban morphology of post-socialist cities through the dialectic relationship between social processes and the changing built environment. I show how post-socialist cities are produced , reproduced and transformed ( Pred 1984 ) via the changes in the everyday social geographies , framed as consumption related mobility , in the retail landscape of the case study city of Stara Zagora , Bulgaria. This thesis argues that everyday geographies of city residents are growing in spatial extent with the rise of de-centralized formal retail , while at the same time , everyday geographies are becoming more localized as consumption activates increase in concentration at the micro-level of the neighborhood. Meanwhile , both of these changes to everyday geographies indicate a decrease in consumption related mobility , urban consumption and retail consumption in the city center , in turn , putting the city center at risk for decline.

More important , the civility of the eighteenth century philosophes extended to finding the specific spirit of other periods and civilizations. In following Montaigne they were developing the cosmopolis of the sixteenth century rather than the technical rationality that later came to dominate the idea of modernity ( Toulmin 1990 : x , 198 ) . One recent biographer ( Pearson 2005 : 396 ) points out that Voltaire ' s resistance to the idea of system shows how fundamentally mistaken it is to see the Enlightenment as the forerunner of the Holocaust. The cosmopolitanism of our own time , to which this book is one contribution , is also in no continuous line with the past. It arises wherever cultures find a common humanity in the other. Reason itself surfaces in diverse times and places , for instance among the early Indian Buddhists , as Amartya Sen ( 2005 : 15 ) informs us.

Decomposition analysis is a straight-forward way in which to evaluate the coevolution of actors and ideas and their relative impact on policy framing , but it requires linking policy frames to the actors who use them. Somewhat surprisingly , most existing studies of framing do not link frames to their sponsors , thereby presenting an oddly disembodied picture of policy framing processes. After this link is made , however , decomposition analysis promises to be a fruitful means through which to specify the processes underlying changes in public discourse . </frame.v.1135><frame.v.1136>Staff stated that the question was framed too broadly and failed to focus on the contents of the particular document involved.

Arguably , however , the situation in Europe remains different from the one in the U.S. , and this difference invites more comparison between the U.S. and Europe , for which again one should keep historical trajectories in mind. In the U.S. , with its history of state-building from below , the priority of individual and group action over public action , at least at higher levels of administration , could possibly be considered as something like a self-evident truth. In pre-democratic Europe , in contrast , individual and group action had long been framed within larger arenas of coordination , from medieval cities to absolutist states , and spaces of liberty grew only gradually within those frames. When the idea of self-regulation and market coordination arose in the late eighteenth century tellingly contemporaneous to the founding of the United States and became popular during the first half of the nineteenth century , it was not self-evident at all but posed a challenge to existing forms of coordination , from guilds and corporations to state bureaucracies , and also to the novel idea of coordination framed by collective self-determination , or democracy . </frame.v.1145><frame.v.1146>Do n't say " child care.

When they did this , the surface frame for war restricted our discussions to issues related to war : mobilize an army , engage in military battles , " smoke out " our enemy , and so on . </frame.v.1181><frame.v.1182>" YourFramer offers a unique service to anyone in need of getting their images framed " , says Matthew Leete , of YourFramer .

Integrating empirical results in communication studies on framing with models of comprehension in cognitive psychology , we argue that people understand complicated event sequences by organizing information in a manner that conforms to the structure of a good story. To test this claim , we carried out a pair of experiments. In each , we presented people with news reports on the 1999 Kosovo crisis that were framed in story form , either to promote or prevent U.S. intervention. Consistent with expectations , we found that framing news about the crisis as a particular story affected what people remembered , how they structured what they remembered , and the opinions they expressed on the actions government should take . </frame.v.1184><frame.v.1185>Figure 1 provides a greatly reduced overview of fol. 10 ( 7 ) , recto and verso , as it is now framed in its nineteenth-century paper binding. Far superior to the limitations of print facsimiles , an electronic facsimile allows one to study a dynamic image of the folio in detail at high resolution , in full color , enhanced by ultraviolet , and much enlarged.7 At its normal size one is able to see where Sir Frederic Madden identified the text in pencil as " SS Julianus and Basilissa " in the upper-left frame , recto.

In the last few years , the federal government has begun to consult more readily with the voluntary sector in order to jointly frame the issue. This is important because how the issue is framed initially often plays a large part in the result of the process. Research will be done by ministry staff , but can also be done by voluntary organizations and covers such areas as nature of the problem , the size of the problem , who is affected , the seriousness of the problem , etc . </frame.v.1188><frame.v.1189>TWO FRAMED CHINESE TEXTILES.

Because determinations can be grouped into patterns , essence can be understood as operational in the work at the level of " inner structure. " But one 's embeddedness in specific social-historical situations conditions any " positive vision " of the ( potential ) register of essences , of forms. This sequence generates results such as : there are generalizable features to the structure of perception , therefore perception has an essence. The elimination of the pens e du survol , the transcendent viewpoint , simply means that essence is not present , is not an immanent or potentially immanent phenomenon ( as it might be as a result of the reductions in transcendental phenomenology. ) But that we are asking questions about mode of being presupposes that these regularities are operative and accessible . </frame.v.1192><frame.v.1193>All joys of Easter.

It adds a second layer to the Baroque ceiling paintings , where as in cinema scenes are inserted into frames as allegories to represent societal institutions as a cosmology , as ' the world ' . They contain narratives scenes telling a story on multiple levels , on multiple subjects and from multiple perspectives. A film constitutes a contained universe and a contemporary version of the past as well. This links the Baroque painting to the notion of cinema as a modern version of a system of framing . </frame.v.1196><frame.v.1197>Cutting horse , roping horse , trail horse , thoroughbred , quarter , arab or appie -- they 'll all love to see themselves framed in this western-theme photo frame for 5 " x 7 " snapshots.

A linguist and founder of the Rockridge Institute , Lakoff uses the book to argue that our worldviews are based largely on different frames that provide us with structure for our thinking. Because conservatives have framed political debate in their own terms for the past few decades , our country and its politics are now based on a conservative worldview. In order for progressives to create change , they must re-frame the way we think about politics , ourselves , and America . </frame.v.1199><frame.v.1200>[ Eugene Daily of Louisville , Kentucky ] ( Portrait of Jefferson Circuit Court Judge Eugene Daily of Louisville , Kentucky , wearing a hard collar and printed tie.

" Millian and Bradlee note the breathing and settling of the frame as it settles in with the land . </frame.v.1201><frame.v.1202>The background for Rockridge is that conservatives , especially conservative think tanks , have framed virtually every issue from their perspective. They have put a huge amount of money into creating the language for their worldview and getting it out there. Progressives have done virtually nothing. Even the new Center for American Progress , the think tank that John Podesta [ former chief of staff for the Clinton administration ] is setting up , is not dedicated to this at all. I asked Podesta who was going to do the Center 's framing. He got a blank look , thought for a second and then said , " You ! " Which meant they have n't thought about it at all.

This is most apparent in relation to the offence of urging inter-group force or violence. Rather than forcing these offences into the federal counter-terrorism framework , it would be more effective to address discriminatory violence through anti-vilification provisions ( including sentence enhancement ) at the state or territory level. When framed in this way , the law could address a wider range of conduct that precipitates violent crime against minorities , and would minimise the risk of these measures becoming yet another form of legal oppression for already persecuted communities . </frame.v.1204><frame.v.1205>This is a brief overview of construction processes used by Sessile Oak , rather than a guide to the construction of timber framed buildings.

On the one hand , Johnston contends that two factors produce frames , 'cultural currents of an international scope ' , and the strategic planning in which activists engage as they respond to situational events and conditions in their political environment. Thus , he argues , 'the notion of frame is similar to a Weberian ideal type ' ( Johnston , 1995 : p. 218 ) . Social movements , and other participants in framing debates , such as the media , influence each other 's framing of grievances , and 'one would expect to find parallels between the structure of media texts at these upper levels and the structures of movement documents and the speech of participants ' ( 1995 : p. 241 ) . 'The final test of whether a social movement frame has been correctly described ' , he maintains , 'is if these reconstructions help the analyst understand why individual participants and social movement organisations act the way they do ' ( 1995 : p. 235 ) . </frame.v.1206><frame.v.1207>This study is an analysis of how those debates and discussions about Salinger 's connections to Internet " news " were rhetorically framed by journalists.

The extent of internalisation of human rights within WHO is , therefore , crucial. Little , however , is known about this as the Organization has not been the focus of human rights or , indeed , regulation scholarship.95 But it is obvious that the range of internal staff responses will play a significant role in the design , implementation and monitoring of any human rights-based policies. We can also speculate that any internal divisions on human rights will both increase WHO 's own exposure to organisational risk and affect the handling of the specific human rights matter in question. Consider , for example , Galit Sarfaty 's study of interpretations of human rights at the World Bank. Comparing World Bank investment projects relating to HIV/AIDS prevention in Russia and Saint Lucia , Sarfaty speculates on the reasons why different framings of the human rights dimension were adopted in each case : </frame.v.1208><frame.v.1209>31.

He points out that several thousand people were interviewed by the FBI , the Commission , or the House Assassinations Committee , or were connected in some other way with studying the assassination , and that it is not statistically significant that several dozen or even a hundred died during the extended time period framed by the Warren Commission and House Assassination Committee investigations. But here again , gross statistics mask rather than illuminate meaning. It is less noteworthy how many of the thousands of witnesses and potential witnesses died during the time span , than it is how many met suspicious rather than natural deaths , and how many of these persons knew something or had been in a position to know something that conflicted with the official story. It is quite significant if a disproportionate number of the witnesses who died from other than natural causes could have testified to facts in conflict with the lone assassin story.

Some authors , notably van Dijk , Donati , and Triandafyllidou , develop detailed arguments for defining separate levels of framing at discursive and deep structural levels ( I address these arguments in Section 2 ) . Johnston , in contrast , lumps all framing into a single set of social movement frames ( 1995 : p. 241 ) , and suggests that these frames , or 'higher- level concepts are the basis of sharing and co-ordination for many social movement actions , and it is through their systematic reconstruction and verification that the real contributions of micro-frame analysis lies ' ( 1995 : p. 237 ) . Scholars like Gamson , van Dijk , and Donati , however , do not have the same concept in mind when they discuss framing , and Johnston can not achieve the 'systematic reconstruction and verification ' of frames or the high degree of validity he asserts by simply willing away the differences . </frame.v.1248><frame.v.1249>Another use of the timber frame as a hybrid is to build onto an existing home with a timber framed addition.

Using theories drawn from Michel Foucault , Antonio Gramsci , and the sociology of professions , this paper will situate recent disclosures of abuse in the complex and intimate fiduciary relationships of trust and authority that are created between clergy and laity. Examples will be drawn from a case study of a Roman Catholic religious community in California that organized a response to nuermous disclousres of sexual abuse by priests during the 1990s. Positioning themselves as advocates of institutional reform at local , regional and nation levels , members of this parish sought both a pastoral response to individual survivors as well as structural changes in the institutional church. An appraisal of their strategic tactics and of their success will be framed as one positive response that can occur when clerical misconduct is uncovered . </frame.v.1263><frame.v.1264>The Poster Series is available in six colors.

They do this by comparing the object to images of past events in the collective memory or to revered cultural icons. Such referent images are used as metaphors to frame the meaning of the event at hand and provide a compelling interpretation of it ( Fine and Sandstrom 1993 ) . Following the writer 's lead , readers recall these memories or images , try to apply them as the media writer indicates , and to some degree , either accept or reject this framing of the social phenomenon.

There are , though , some basic differences between wood and metal frames. Within the framing industry , wood is the preferred frame material. There is a much wider selection of colors and styles from which to choose. Wood frames also afford more protection for your artwork. Their sturdy construction and the ability of the framer to properly close the back of the frame prevent environmental and insect damage from occurring. Metal frames have a modern , sleek type of styling. Available in many colors and styles , they , for the most part , afford a minimalist type of framing. New trends in metal mouldings , such as the Nielsen Elements line , blend modern technology with a design flair not seen in metal mouldings for many years.

There were these spectacularly dramatic oak and cypress trees all over that area and Sam Raimi immediately fell in love with them.

It now remains to see how far this general definition can stand a detailed examination that could be best conducted by testing a few typical and some of the most different cases which have in fact made the necessity of a definition so badly felt. While developing it we have tried at each step to free it , so far as it is possible to do so in the case of so comprehensive and elusive a generalization as that , from the defect of being too wide. If we find in testing a few typical cases in the light of this definition that they all fit in well then we may be sure that it is free from the opposite defect of being too narrow.

Moreover , an " Occupation President " sounds more like a military commander disregarding the Constitution rather than a heroic figure out to eliminate global terrorism. Lakoff applies his framing devices to several other political debates , for instance , the use of the term " biconceptualism " rather than references to a moderate position since the former infers an inclusive way of thinking that balances polar perspectives , while the latter picks up on the compromising aspect of being in the middle. With the decisive Democratic victory in both houses earlier this month , the progressive community has an opportunity to gain a foothold through the reinforcement of such inclusive frames in their speeches. From that perspective , Lakoff 's primer becomes indispensable . </frame.v.1299><frame.v.1300>The way modern society works is that our intellectuals frame the debates in ways with predetermined results.

Checking the incidence of key terms can be a useful procedure , and is sometimes used in the present study to give a quick indication of framing devices. However , a more accurate picture seems more likely to come from examining articles in their entirety as far as possible. Particularly in the case of news reports of crises and conflicts , which deal with often controversial , new and fast-moving events , we would expect there to be competing narratives and explanations rather than only one settled perspective. Examining the interaction of different frames within and across texts can reveal much about why some diagnoses and prescriptions become favoured over others.

It is obvious , once we look closely , that the two words really mean two completely different things. We should take note that the word " collapsed " was not chosen by the US Propaganda Ministry by accident. When applied to what happened to the WTC buildings , collapsed means the WTC buildings fell down , while demolished means they were torn down. One term implies the buildings " fell " or " caved in " as a result of weakening from fire and damage while the other term implies the towers were " torn down " or " razed " with pre-positioned explosives. Obviously the word you use to describe the demise of the WTC buildings will depend on your perspective of what happened right ? Not necessarily if the debate has been framed in advance and we have been carefully conditioned through endless repetition in the corpstream media. If we have been " framed " we will see both ourselves and our adversaries using the term " collapsed " on a regular basis . </frame.v.1322><frame.v.1323>£ 14.99 - Stalin print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - Stalin print - POSTED £ 29.99 - Stalin framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - Stalin framed print - POSTED </frame.v.1323><frame.v.1324>Liven up your walls !

The overall coverage of Pakistan in the post-9/11 period in both the newspapers was large as the number of stories and mean story length were significantly greater in this period.

Findings suggest that by the end of formal military operations in Afghanistan , the press was increasingly framing its reports in such a way that President Bush 's public statements were inaccurately transmitted to the public at large. Three key findings are advanced : one , the press depicted the Bush administration as an enemy of civil liberties; two , hard news stories echoed the positions generated by editorials and opinion essays; three , as early as eight weeks after 9/11 , the press was actively contesting the meaning of the War on Terror.

This important addition to Augustus 's collection of old master paintings had to be framed at once and probably triggered the invention of the Dresden Gallery Frame. Between 1747 and 1752 the whole collection of about 1500 paintings was uniformly reframed , both the new acquisitions and existing paintings in the collection , many of which had been acquired by Augustus III 's father , Augustus II , known as Augustus the Strong ( 1670-1733 ) . </frame.v.1369><frame.v.1370>Another example of Sawyer ' s use of the U.S. troops frame and her symbolic use of language to vilify the Dixie Chicks was evident when she asked , If you do support the troops , should you be attacking their Commander-In-Chief ( ABC News , 2003b , p. 2 ) .

Think of the relentless insistence of the movie companies on making video recorders illegal. Nor does the framework of maximalism help if our goal is to have all the interested economic actors in the room when policy is made.

In fact , a Pushkin narrative underwent spectacular critical rereading at a date halfway between Bunin 's writing and Vygotsky 's reading of " Gentle Breathing. " It took Russian literary criticism some ninety years and a modernist focus on framing to notice in " The Stationmaster " ( 1831 ) the writing on the wall of the station : as pointed out by Mikhail Gershenzon ( 1919 ) , the funny German pictures illustrating the parable of the prodigal son form an ironic counterpoint to the heroine 's actual success story. The facts of Dunia 's life belie the sentimental fictions of the prodigal-son cartoons as well as the more transparent Karamzinian subtext , " Poor Liza.

He also reconciled the apparent conflict in American jurisprudence in which some courts have stated the rule in terms of discoverability of injury while most others have framed the rule in terms of the plaintiff 's discovery of the causal relationship between his injury and the defendant 's conduct. The former line of cases can be explained on the basis that the relevant injury was of a kind that put the plaintiffs on immediate notice that their rights had been violated. However , many courts have applied the latter rule which requires knowledge of the harm and its likely cause; see for example Franklin v. Albert , 411 N.E.2d 458 ( Mass. 1980 ) . </frame.v.1385><frame.v.1386>With the Personal Frame Shop at PictureFrames.com , you can upload and frame digital images of your art , see them with different frames , mats ( even double matting with different mat borders ) , and framing kits.

" 26 Allen refused to grant or even acknowledge Machar 's assertion that the exercise of the liquor trade infringed upon the rights of others - specifically , as she reminded him thrice , the rights of women and children , employers , and quiet and sober citizens. However , Allen recapitulated her argument for the restriction of the liquor trade as if it had been framed from the perspective of benefit to society rather than harm to others. Within his own frames of reference , he would have had to acknowledge that harm to others was unacceptable , but he argued with considerable acumen that anticipated benefits of temperance , demonstrable or not , were not sufficient to warrant limitation of what he believed to be a fundamental and self-evident liberty - in other words , a man 's right to eat and drink what he pleases.27 </frame.v.1390><frame.v.1391>Framing the photographs for your wedding is equally as important as ensuring you have chosen the right photographer on the day.

The issue of including a document into another is discussed in question How do I include one file in another ? in WDG 's Web Authoring FAQ. Note that when inline frames are used , the browser ( if it supports them ) sends a request to the server referred to by the URL in the iframe element , and after getting the requested document displays it inside an inline frame. In this sense inline frames are a joint browser-server issue , but only the browser needs to be specifically iframe-aware; from the server 's point of view , there 's just a normal HTTP request for a document , and it sends the document without having ( or needing ) any idea on what the browser is going to do with it.

Taking their cue from Saussure , social scientists working within the embodiment paradigm insist that structuralist tenets need to be revised in the spirit of pragmatic paradigmatism when applied to society and culture. In most general terms , it is appropriate to say that the relationship between grammar and speech is analogous to the relationship between culture and body practices : both are mutually constitutive yet neither can be reduced to the other. But the seminal distinction between language structure and language-in-use draws too sharp a line between a self-contained linguistic system based on binary oppositions and embodied speech acts deemed peripheral to understanding the internal workings of language. Particularly instructive in this respect is the chess metaphor Saussure ( 1986 : 22-23 , 88-89 ) invokes while elucidating his theory , for this metaphor shows exactly where the analogy between the language/speech and culture/body practices breaks down . </frame.v.1398><frame.v.1399>Shadow boxes and Shadow Box Frames made from weathered or distressed wood have a special appeal.

Guy Swanson criticises Goffman for overclaiming the implications of 'underdeveloped and unsystematised examples ' , and for brushing aside problems with the reliability of his method by 'quietly ' abandoning the project of defining frameworks after the second chapter ( Swanson , 1975 : p. 218 ) . Moreover , Goffman suggested that cultures construct social frameworks , but shifts between holding cultural and individual frame users accountable for the entailments of the way they frame reality , and absolving frame users of such responsibility by asserting that we are 'likely to be unaware of such organised features as the framework has and unable to describe the framework with any completeness if asked ' ( Goffman , 1974 : p. 21 ) . Indeed , Goffman did not convincingly distinguish between natural and social frameworks. If the presence or absence of public perception that a wilful agent caused or contributed to the production of an object or event marks this distinction , then how would one classify framings which occur when people wrongfully attribute causation to a 'wilful ' actor , or when people fail to notice the intervention of a party and attribute an event to 'natural ' causes ? </frame.v.1409><frame.v.1410>The frame gallery is the exclusive frame partner and display gallery for some local art galleries and artists.

Books such as Laurie Garrett 's The Coming Plague in 1994 dealt with the consequences of negligence and lack of investments in public health systems around the world.6 A 1996 Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report stated that it is in both the political and the economic interest of the United States to invest in combating disease abroad.7 Others have focused on the intentional spread of disease and on the impeding threat of biological warfare , such as in The Plague Wars by Tom Mangold and Jeff Goldberg in 1999.8 In 2000 both the National Intelligence Council and the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute issued reports on the global threat of infectious disease.9 The Council on Foreign Relations followed with the report , Why Health Is Important to U.S. Foreign Policy , in 2001.10 </frame.v.1412><frame.v.1413>We have vast experience of framing all types of memorabilia.

A principal advantage of the Trussed Tube is that it eliminates the need for the closely spaced columns of a framed tube. In the John Hancock Centre , the column spacing on the broad face is 12 , 2m and on the short face , 7 , 62m. Another advantage of this Tube is that the interior is free from structure for resisting wind action. The Tube is therefore , most suitable for multi-function buildings. Additional interior columns , as required , and simple floor framing complete the system [ 5 ] . The 100-storey , 337 , 5m high John Hancock structure required only 141 , 8 kg of steel per square meter of gross area of floor.

Timber frames are consistently more resistant to trauma from earthquakes , wind uplift , and heavy snow load than stick framed construction. Timber frame homes need to be replaced less often , allowing for forest re-growth over time. Less replacement also decreases construction waste and landfill use.

The young woman is bathed in light , which streams in through the half open window to the left , and reflects itself from the cream-colored background that is enhanced to the left by very thin glazes of slightly pinkish tonalities. Her face , exceptionally conveying expression - joy and laughter - appears framed in a kerchief and the collar of her dress.

" The " aesthetic is the name of the ideal human game. " If we can understand change in larger and larger frames , we can find ourselves sustaining it in the natural flow of things . </frame.v.1443><frame.v.1444>Lack of scratch resistance  " Except for more expensive abrasion resistant versions of acrylic , it is more sensitive to scratching and requires special care. Only soft cloths should be used to clean it. Paper towels are essentially ground up wood pulp and can damage acrylic. Microfiber cleaning cloths work well. This can be a disadvantage if you are reselling framed artwork since you will need to remind your customer to use be careful when cleaning it . </frame.v.1444><frame.v.1445>If an individual 's head is near the top of the screen , he will fill the screen , appearing to the quite large. On the other hand , if his head is near the center of the screen , with his shoulders at the bottom of the screen , he will seem smaller. Thus framing affects image size. Similarly , how two individuals are framed in the same shot can affect how large or small they appear to be in contrast to one another . </frame.v.1445><frame.v.1446>Do n't be afraid to accent curves with framed art.

According to a historical series published in Picture Frame Magazine , these early " framed panel paintings were made from one piece. The area to be painted was carved out , leaving a raised framing border around the outside edge , like a tray. The whole piece was then gessoed and gilded. Painting the image on the flat panel was the last thing to be done.

The men capable of realizing the seriousness of the fact either remain outside the Church or follow Strauss 's counsel inside. The undertaking to frame a psychological presentment of the " real Jesus " is still seriously pursued , albeit the documentary analysis does not leave even a skeleton for the accepted historical figure , wherewith to materialize the silent spectre of Paul 's epistles. Thus Evemerism is still the order of the day as regards the Christian mythus; and people who are supposed to have the elements of a sound culture , including the results of mythological science , are often almost entirely ignorant of any bearings of Comparative Mythology on the Gospels , even though they may have learned to disbelieve in miracles. Mythological science has been prudently restricted to other fields , spiritually remote from modern faith and ritual . </frame.v.1452><frame.v.1453>Kant ' s principle of ' action in accordance with duty ' , as set forth in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals , [ 30 ] can be seen to lay a basis for the demand that states subject their actions to a universal moral law. [ 31 ] In this respect , the problem of war is framed by Kant as a problem of individual moral conviction and moral duty. In considering the notion of moral duty within the sphere of interstate relations , Kant drew attention to two contrasting figures : the ' moral politician ' and the ' political moralist ' . The former conceives the principles of political expediency in such a way that they conform with morality and practical reason. The latter ' fashions his morality to suit his own advantage as a statesman ' . [ 32 ] </frame.v.1453><frame.v.1454>Let us frame an image of who we are ! Bluegrass Frames first opened its doors in 1975 by Nancy and Tom Conley. Their vision was to provide quality and affordable custom picture framing to the Louisville , Kentucky , area. In 1991 , Nancy and Tom 's daughter Susie took the reins of the family shop and used the experience she gained from growing up in the business. To further her knowledge in the industry , Susie Conley received her Certified Picture Framer ( CPF ) designation through the Professional Picture Framers Association in July of 1991. This qualifies her to frame fine works of art to museum standards . </frame.v.1454><frame.v.1455>As currently framed , Plaintiffs ' Complaint seeks to litigate a generalized grievance over one of the most horrific chapters of our Nation 's history rather than a personal dispute , which the federal courts are able to adjudicate. For the reasons stated in the following section , such an " abstract question [ ] of wide public significance " should be left to the representative branches of our system of government. See Valley Forge , 454 U.S. at 475 . </frame.v.1455><frame.v.1456>But let ' s frame the question in its most compelling form. Imagine a system of digital surveillance in which the algorithm was known and verifiable : We knew , that is , exactly what was being searched for; we trusted that ' s all that was being searched for. That surveillance was broad and indiscriminate. But before anything could be done on the basis of the results from that surveillance , a court would have to act. So the machine would spit out bits of data implicating X in some targeted crime , and a court would decide whether that data sufficed either to justify an arrest or a more traditional search. And finally , to make the system as protective as we can , the only evidence that could be used from this surveillance would be evidence directed against the crimes being surveilled for. So for example , if you ' re looking for terrorists , you don ' t use the evidence to prosecute for tax evasion. I ' m not saying what the targeted crimes are; all I ' m saying is that we don ' t use the traditional rule that allows all evidence gathered legally to be usable for any legal end . </frame.v.1456><frame.v.1457>Systematic discussion of framing as such is usually traced to Gregory Bateson ( 1954 , in Bateson , 1973 ) . In this discussion of play , he develops the idea that play activity is framed or categorised as such , and thus different from doing the same thing for " real " . This applies to play activity among animals as well as human beings. Superficially similar patterns of behaviour then proceed according to different rules depending on their framing. Thus framing is the activity of categorising messages. As far as Bateson ( 1955 , also in Bateson 1973 ) is concerned , failure to assign messages to their correct categories constitutes ego-weakness : by implication , ego-strength is the capacity to frame messages correctly . </frame.v.1457><frame.v.1458>Frame : Beautiful gold leaf with linen liner. 11 x 14 framed with the restored Vilnius Divine Mercy Image in English , gold lettering.

He explains how dialogue on issues can be dominated or derailed by how the issues are framed. Framing on the political scene has evolved into a deadly sort of gamesmanship. An example is the Luntz Memo on the Environment , coaching Republicans on how to promote their agenda re increasing arsenic limits in water , pretending that global warming is not a problem , and so on. According to Lakoff , there is no dialogue if parties have disparate frames. Facts bounce off if they do n't fit the listener 's frame. This framing effect is an inescapable part of human cognition . </frame.v.1460><frame.v.1461>Mattson : That conservatives have consistently thought of themselves as rebels as existential outsiders who rail against a monolithic establishment. This is a permanent feature of their thinking , even when they 're not outsiders but in government. I start with the Cold War , tracing out an apocalyptic strain in thinking about America 's role in the world ( especially clear in Whittaker Chambers 's Witness ) . I move into the sixties and trace out Russell Kirk 's embrace of campus radicals and Norman Podhoretz 's love of Norman Mailer and the ways he used the " new sensibility " of the 1960s to frame his own neoconservatism. I then end with the culture wars of today and the rise of what I call " postmodern conservatism " how an almost poststructuralist embrace of diversity and criticism of universal values informs the wars against " objectivity " and the mainstream media , the dominance of evolution and the call to teach intelligent design ( ID ) in public schools , and David Horowitz 's struggle for a student bill of rights in higher education . </frame.v.1461><frame.v.1462>A lot of the arguments show that most people decide how to frame things for themselves.

For example , Tversky &amp;Kahneman ( 1981 ) showed experimentally that different choices are made when the same uncertain outcome of a decision is framed in terms of either losses or gains. Dunegan ( 1993 ) further showed such loss- or gain-frames can affect key cognitive functions including use of information and search for solutions. Hogarth et al. 's ( 1980 ) study of cognitive maps lends support to the possibility that frames distort the basis on which individuals make key decisions about physical change. In that context , frames may drive participants willingness to act , participate , take a stand , or join a group . </frame.v.1463><frame.v.1464>This series provides a first-quality " Museum Framed " look for it 's framed contents.

Indeed , the introduction of such a mental element could be crucial to the achievement of that balance : potential defendants will feel more confident about their actions and the avoidance of prosecution if they know that they will have the opportunity to establish as a matter of exculpation that they did not have the requisite state of mind. It would even be possible to justify a very stringent mental element test , as long as it was a test framed in terms that potential defendants could readily understand. The form in which this mental element should be incorporated into the relevant legislation is discussed further below ( see </frame.v.1465><frame.v.1466>Lakoff also points out two more sources of confusion. First , with Gore unable to define a norms-based vision , Bush was able to blur the lines by supporting " debt relief " where " the return is good " and , of course , in our interests. Second , the moderator , further blurred things by framing the question in terms of which overseas interventions each of the candidates supported. If Gore had first managed to explain his moral vision , this question could have helped clarify its consequences. But without such an explanation , it simply reduced foreign policy back to the same narrow terms of military and economic decisions in our own self-interest -- back to Bush 's frame. Naturally , debating within Bush 's frame meant that Bush would win the debate , maybe not in the conventional sense , but in the sense that mattered : he had people thinking with him , and thinking that Gore 's position was unfocused , incoherent , manipulative , etc. -- all of which are natural results of seeing that position from inside of Bush 's frame . </frame.v.1466><frame.v.1467>Many people today have little idea of the wide gulf between the reality of historical frame design and the currently manufactured reproduction frames. Many , in fact , do n't even realize that many of the frame styles made today are many times removed from earlier period frames. As the awareness of period frame styles and their vital role in art history becomes more widely acknowledged , it is important that this disparity be known. This is not to say that current repro frames have no place in today 's marketplace; only to point out the importance of recognizing the difference and of making an informed aesthetic choice when framing valuable works of art . </frame.v.1467><frame.v.1468>I followed the pings to their source.

These policy frames promote a particular problem definition , causal interpretation , moral evaluation , and/or treatment recommendation and make some aspects of a policy debate more salient to readers than others.75 A social activist could frame GAI policies in terms of their impact on poverty reduction , a business leader might frame them in terms of their impact on work , and a senator might frame them in terms of their costs. Research shows that these types of frames influence the ways in which people make sense of complex policy issues and shape their policy preferences.76 Thus examining patterns in policy framing both shows how spokespeople covered in the media sought to depict GAI policies and provides a picture of the dominant policy meanings that citizens had at their disposal for determining their views of GAI proposals . </frame.v.1486><frame.v.1487>The related practice of " framing " may also serve to undermine the rights of Web site owners. The use of " frames " allows a Web page creator to divide a user 's Web browser window into several separate areas. The programmer of the Web page can dictate what goes into each frame. Commonly , a Web site designer creates a page that at all times displays one frame containing the name of the Web site and other identifying information. For example , a Web site employing frames might always show the original Web site 's graphic logo on the top of the page while allowing the user to view the " framed " site in a different frame.

If there is one person in the frame , then the framing is more comfortable if they are on one of the horizontal thirds too.

But the classification is in keeping with Mr. Lang 's handling of the phenomena of savage ethics and philosophy; and the total result , I repeat , is doctrinal chaos. The very conceptions of a Supreme Being which he sets over against those of Animism are instances of Animism; [ n3 Mr. Lang argues that because the early man did not raise the question of " spirit , " " Animism was not needed for the earliest idea of a moral Eternal " ( Making , p. 182 ) . As if the question were ever supposed to be raised in early Animism at all ! On this view , Animism is indeed not primitive , but late and metaphysical ! Mr. Lang has here in effect altered the whole significance of the term. As framed by Mr. Tylor , it applies to exactly the unconscious assumption which Mr. Lang has in view . ] </frame.v.1501><frame.v.1502>Given these concerns about the modus operandi of many reporters , it should n't be surprising that I 'm also disappointed in many of the resulting stories.

If we do n't accept the view that there is just One True Story of the world told in terms of The One Right Lexicon of Concepts , we do not need to check to see if our concepts are the right ones. Rather , we need to check to see whether our beliefs or sentences ( framed in terms of our concepts or words ) are true. And it is not necessary to go to a neutral cosmic exile , or to find an Archimedean point outside all language and thought , in order to do this. It is something we do all the time , right from where we are; once I have the concept of a dog , it is often obviously and unproblematically true that there is a dog in the corner . </frame.v.1503><frame.v.1504>Give a picture you ' re particularly proud of the attention it deserves by getting it framed for all to see.

In order to make sense of any situation one must select out certain features and relations which are taken to be the most relevant characteristics of that situation. These features allow one to create a story which explains the situation. The authors refer to this selection process as the process of " naming and framing " ( 26 ) They explain , " From a problematic situation that is vague , ambiguous and indeterminate each story selects and names different features and relations that become the  things  of the story -- what the story is about Each story places the features it has selected within the frame of a particular context. " ( 26 ) Schon and Reid refer to these underlying contexts as generative metaphors. Examples of such generative metaphors include the metaphor of disease and health , of sin and redemption , or of natural processes versus unnatural interference.

Also , it is time consuming working out how an image would look framed without having actually seen it. What photographers need is another solution . </frame.v.1530><frame.v.1531>One of the main reasons that pictures buckle after being framed is that the image , mat , and mount board all expand and contract at different rates with changes in temperature. For this reason it is important to leave the image as free as possible to move within the picture frame. The two primary ways of achieving this are mounting with photo corners &amp;hinging tissue. A key component of conservative framing is that the image can be completely removed from the photo frame with no change to the image. To allow the image to freely expand and contract beneath the mat , it should only be hinged at a couple of points along the top edge of the photograph as shown in the diagram. Larger images may require 3 points. How conservative the hinging method is depends on the type of adhesive used in the hinge. For true conservation , there is a special Japanese paper that is used with a water-soluble wheat or rice starch adhesive . </frame.v.1531><frame.v.1532>Established in 1997 as a local and regional source for oil paintings , landscape oil paintings , canvas oil paintings , floral oil paintings , contemporary oil paintings , Unique Oil Paintings , oil paintings on canvas , still life oil paintings , picture frames , photo frames , wood picture frames , gold picture frames , silver picture frame , silver picture frames , ready made picture frames , gold picture frame , wall mirror , oval mirrors , framed mirror , beveled mirrors , decorative mirrors , wood framed mirror , antique picture frames , portrait frames , silver framed mirror , wood framed mirrors.

And framing starts out with the assumption that we all view the world , or hear the stories of the world , or have a sense or carry a feeling about the world , and all the issues in the world , in our world through preconceived frames. And in fact this is not just like an interesting thing , you know , an idiosyncratic thing , or a sometimes thing. This is an always thing and it is a necessary thing. Frames are necessary in order to help us understand and place significance on things. We require frames in order to be able to understand complexity in a simple way. So we have frames like my family. It 's a two word phrase that encompasses something different for everybody but it has a very specific meaning. My country , a frame. Patriotism , a frame.

In psychology it would simply be called a way of framing things . </frame.v.1535><frame.v.1536>In the same way , the key to victory in the frame war is the way the ideas about frames are themselves accepted and disseminated. When Lakoffs ideas are framed as ways to win elections or persuade swing voters , they can be dismissed as slick marketing with an intellectual sheen. But his ideas seem most attractive and more useful to liberals in the long run when they 're framed as a method for improving public discourse by accurately representing what most people value. What makes liberals open to Lakoff 's ideas is that they believe in openness. But the same profile , drawn in terms of the family metaphor , exposes a few other liabilities about liberals. For one thing , liberals are invested in an intellectual egalitarianism that can be crippling. ( Conservatives may be more content with a division of labor in which some people do the thinking and others do the shouting. ) " A lot of liberals do n't want to admit that they do n't have all the ideas , " Lakoff says. " It 's a major problem. A lot of liberals think , 'Well , I do n't have the words , but I have all the ideas. ' The fact is , they dont.

Public Opinion and EU Enlargement The enlargement of the European Union has been politically salient and contentious for more than a decade , with much of the discussion focused on Turkey 's candidacy. In this paper , I argue that the way people frame European integration has important implications for their opinions about enlargement in general , as well as for their relative support for particular candidate countries. I show that frames explain much of the variation in support for various prospective members , both at the individual level and at the aggregate national level. Significantly , the results show that Turkey is less exceptional than public debates occasionally make it seem : the same variables that explain support for other candidates are also crucial in shaping support for Turkey , and there is no evidence of stronger country-level effects in Turkey 's case. The results show that the frames most important in explaining support for enlargement are personal mobility and cultural diversity , rather than frames such as prosperity or democracy that are often considered central to public assessments of the EU . </frame.v.1559><frame.v.1560>Project your corporate image and sense of style through the frames that grace your walls.

When selecting picture frames for non-gallery display , your goal is to match the artwork with an appropriate frame color , style , and material.

Goffman s ( 1974 ) 35 definition of framing in general refers to the principles of organisation , which govern social events  ( p. 232 ) . Thus all events are subject to framing when they are being reported. Specifically , Norris ( 1995 ) 36 describes news frames as cognitive schemata , which journalists use to simplify , prioritise and structure the narrative flow of events. Thus , framing is unavoidable in the course of news construction ( Akhavan-Majid and Ramaprasad , 2000 ) . 37 </frame.v.1570><frame.v.1571>The paper reports on and critiques the research process and its substantive outcomes.

This is done by means of matting , a lining of plastic " spacers " , shadowboxing , stacking two mouldings with the glass in between , and various other methods. If the paper ( or other media ) were to touch the glass directly , any condensation inside the glass would absorb directly into the art , having no room to evaporate. This is harmful to almost any medium. It causes art sticking to the glass , mildew , and other ill effects. Raising the glass is also necessary when a piece is done in a loose media such as charcoal or pastel , to prevent smudging. Care should be taken with these works , however , if Plexiglas is used as a static charge can build up which will attract the pigment particles off the paper. Using real glass helps to prevent this . </frame.v.1581><frame.v.1582>The order in which walls are framed and raised may vary from job to job. Generally , the longer exterior walls are raised first.

It involves a reduction of animals to the status of property , things , commodities , and slaves; it causes , promotes , and legitimates insensitivity to their pain , suffering , and true nature. It is both a philosophical and moral failing. It is the Lockean ownership and property rights mentality that grants exploiters the legal authority to torture and kill other species in any way they see fit , and , conversely , that makes property destruction and economic sabotage for the cause of animal liberation serious crimes.

Part of those interpretations has been the movie frame game  the invocation of frames provided by popular films as instructive.

But I digress , since my main point is that framing isn ' t about upsetting deeply held convictions it ' s arguing that your idea fits into a metaphorical framework that the audience already possesses. Like in my example above , everyone generally agrees both that women have value and that potential human beings have value , therefore persuading them on abortion is usually about invoking one of those two ideas. ( There ' s actually an entire metaphorical frame that has to be invoked on either side of the debate , because convincing people to prioritize potential human beings over actual human beings requires a lot of pre-work of degrading women , but to keep it simple we ' ll leave it at that. ) But the main thing that I find interesting about Robert ' s comment is the unspoken assumption that framing works better with an audience that doesn ' t hold strong convictions on the subject. That ' s actually completely opposite of how it works. Framing works best if you can invoke strongly held convictions , and more importantly , clearly understood metaphors . </frame.v.1618><frame.v.1619>The authority of the frame is equivalent to that of the genre expectations that it establishes , whose structure is only made possible by the presence of the frame.

" An important concept that comes with thinking about framing is that of metacommunications; frames specify how to use a text or image and what to do if these expectations are not confirmed ( for example , how to switch to another generic framework ) . In other words , the way that something is framed offers cues providing instruction on how to use the medium , and these cues that alert us to what the medium is doing are references to the generic frame . </frame.v.1619><frame.v.1620>PRO SPORT RECYCLED CARDBOARD PHOTO FRAME This heavy weight cardboard frame holds two pictures , one of the whole team on the right and a picture of your star player on the left.

It requires , first , a capacity to attribute to another a capacity to have goals and plans; secondly , an ability to infer from such clues as are given what the other 's goals may be; and , thirdly , skill in framing a plan that is likely to effect the desired change in the other 's set-goal . </frame.v.1624><frame.v.1625>Frames are also used by cultural producers like social movement activists or media writers to describe social phenomena. Sociologists interested in how the media construct reality have described how media writers use frames to selectively represent certain elements of their stories ( Gamson and Modigliani 1989 ) and to emphasize some information to the exclusion of other data. Framing an issue by using a repertoire of arguments creates a dominant reading of the text , thereby reducing readers ' capacities to comprehend the text differently ( Entman 1991 ) . This framing effect serves an ideological function when the frames reinforce unequal social relations by those institutionally empowered to do so ( Hall 1982; Thompson 1990 ) . </frame.v.1625><frame.v.1626>Right ... so ... . I 've been meaning to put frames around my photos for a while now , but have been putting it off because the frames get in the way of using the pictures as wallapaper.

In the early 1960 ' s we acquired the original printing plate for this famous photographic image of 44 American U.S. Army issue , and experimental and trial carbines. Through the 1960 ' s and early 1970 ' s we sold them in our catalogs. Awhile back when clearing out the warehouse we ran across a small group of them ( the printing plate long ago destroyed ) . Printed on fine glossy stock; 20 " x 25 " . The fancy panel in center titled BREECH-LOADING SMALLARMS FOR METALLIC CARTRIDGES. Faintly lettered on the outer border is the name of each of the Civil War and immediate post-CW experimental and trial pieces.

Sometimes , it 's easy to find a custom framing store no further away than the local mall. Or , the yellow pages may offer you a choice of trades people in your town who create custom picture frames. In addition , there are numerous Web sites on the Internet that welcome questions ranging from what type of frame to buy to how custom picture frames are actually constructed. Doing a little homework ahead of time , whether on the Internet or at the local library , will allow you to ask more knowledgeable questions when you get ready to proceed , whether you want a metal frame in a matte finish to something more elaborate in natural wood . </frame.v.1629><frame.v.1630>Price is not a huge consideration to worry about on a product like this , mostly because a lot of multiple picture frames are relatively inexpensive.

Further , when considering say historical reasons for why a given nation has a Just Cause for War if disputes can not be resolved through non-violent means , it is important to understand that historical time frames are easily contrived and framed for propaganda and other purposes. For those , for example , who decry the alleged crimes of a Khomeini , would there have been a Khomeini without a Shah ?; and would there have been a Shah without the violent overthrow of the democratically elected Mossadegh regime by the U.S. CIA in 1953 ? The same question applies with respect to Saddam Hussein once a darling of the U.S. imperial establishment as was Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban who were armed and supported by the U.S. , to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan to " give them their own Vietnam " ( see Interview with Brezinski ) . </frame.v.1631><frame.v.1632>Metaphor is used to support this hegemonic discourse and frame the issues. n45 The favored metaphors include war , n46 scourge , n47 and epidemic. n48 Such metaphors stigmatize drug use and drug users , and create a climate in which informed conversation about the legal and social aspects of drug use are severely circumscribed.

Everyone has the right to free speech , and at the same time has the right to remain silent. While government can not sanction the speech of an American citizen , what citizens say can and will be used against them in a public court run by powerful media interests , which will frame perspectives based on who it benefits or harms and who should be heard , or silenced and punished. By controlling speech , the government elite and media power maintain social order , which is critical during a time of social unrest . </frame.v.1642><frame.v.1643>Discussion about end-of-life decisions are particularly difficult because of a lack of consensus about descriptive terminology. Different words may be used by different writers for the same concept , or the same terminology may be used but with a variety of meanings. In order to clarify the meaning of key words used in this report , a glossary has been included in Appendix C. Many of the terms in it are straightforward and utilized in a relatively uniform and systematic way in the literature. Other terms are used selectively to frame arguments or positions. Roy and McDonald ( 1998 ) have noted that the language used to describe end-of life decisions that shorten or do not prolong life can " signify opening moves in a moral debate " ( p. 123 ) . Two commonly used terms that frequently generate confusion or controversy are " hastened death " and " assisted suicide. " </frame.v.1643><frame.v.1644>FREE Installation.

Lyndon Johnson ' s Great Society declared war on poverty , Richard Nixon called for war on cancer and crime , and Ronald Reagan issued the call to arms against international terrorism all within the larger context of the Cold War against communism. By organizing responses to nonmilitary threats through the use of a framework of militaristic imagery and idiom ( and to varying degrees , organization ) , American policymakers have played upon the widely held beliefs of martial efficiency in problem solving ( as opposed to civilian bureaucratic incompetence ) to establish a rally around the flag atmosphere in order to foster conformity and discourage questions about any intended plan of action. An inevitable casualty of this constriction of debate is the open intellectual space most necessary for the cultivation of innovative solutions to the problem at hand. Of all of the recent declarations of war on inanimate objects , philosophies , and abstractions , nowhere is this philosophy more in evidence than in the current War on Drugs . </frame.v.1645><frame.v.1646>After selecting the four teachers , we created more complete transcripts of their interviews and reviewed those transcripts for evidence of how they framed and addressed the problem of test stress , based on Schn ' s ( 1983 ) descriptions of framing.

To begin with , he finally quit talking about bi-partisanship , and only mentioned bringing Democrats and Republicans together once ( how on Earth that formulation makes it past whoever 's vetting his speeches is beyond me ) .

Indeed , much of the news coverage emphasized the possible savings to frequent fliers if management prevailed. Thus , from a journalistic standpoint , advocating a cost-cutting strategy that undermines labor is not necessarily a probusiness bias ( although it is ) but an acceptably objective , neutral , proconsumer position , Martin writes. In other words , the consumer-oriented ends justify the antilabor means. </frame.v.1656><frame.v.1657>The problem posed by the computer , however , is worse than that posed by the human consciousness. In dealing with consciousness communication is able to rely on its own device , which is language , to both attract , frame , and manage a consciousness which is , for its part , struggling to both translate its perceptions into that language , in order to participate in communication , and keep it idiosyncratic , in order to be able to recognize itself. That is why it is so important that Edmund Husserl , via what he called logical investigations , discovered the fact that language is a feature of communication , and not of consciousness : He spoke of the " lonesome emotions " ( *einsames Seelenleben* ) of the consciousness which has to find expressions ( *Ausdr cke* ) for its perceptions , its thinking , or its ideas in a language offered to him by the communication of a society , which co-evolves with consciousness and controls itself with respect to its attractiveness for human perception , its capacity to both arouse and frame the consciousness . </frame.v.1657><frame.v.1658>Unusual spaces make surprisingly imaginative places for hanging framed art.

Like many left-liberals , he lived ( and probably still lives ) in a sort of bubble world where intentions are everything , history has no place and economics is not permitted to intrude; there was no concept in his model of politics that political issues might have meanings for voters that could not be trumped by glib reframing . This was an academic ' s sort of conceit , and reality repaid it in the usual way . </frame.v.1659><frame.v.1660>Today there are various approaches to frame construction. We choose to create our frames by hand using traditional British methods which typically makes use of the natural curves found in some timbers , although not necessarily so if you prefer the straighter lines of the American 'post and beam ' styling. There are also companies who use a large amount of automation in the form of CNC machines to cut their frames. However these machines are only able to take straight and square timbers , and have a tendency to cut inaccurate joints as no machine can allow for the idiosyncrasies of a natural material such as wood. We believe that the best frame comes from working with nature to fully utilise the inherent strength and beauty of the wood within the frame . </frame.v.1660><frame.v.1661>The model maintains that social action first of all consists in any kind of *action* occurring which is framed by a kind of *talk* which presents it with definitions of its identity , thus giving it a control of itself.

Panels ( 3 , 9 , 10 ) of the framed panels are preferably shatter-proof plastic material that includes predetermined polycarbonate. Frames ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 13 ) of the framed panels have strengths in proportion to thicknesses for predetermined storm protection by predetermined areas of the storm shield. The storm shield is a cover of a predetermined portion of a building orifice which can include a door or a window. The predetermined resistance to storm pressure and to storm-debris impact of the panels is about an equivalent to a commercial grade of polycarbonate or an equivalent thereof that is twenty-five inches square with a thickness of one-eighth of an inch and being rectangular with less than twenty-five percent deviation from being square. Strengths of the frames are predetermined by capacity to contain the panels in positions of resistance to the predetermined resistance to the storm pressure and the storm-debris impact . </frame.v.1664><frame.v.1665>The man who is perhaps most responsible for bringing the idea of framing into the political realm is George Lakoff. Until 2004 , he was an obscure but highly respected linguistics professor at the University of California , Berkeley.

Politicians debate how to frame problems , advertisers frame products to increase consumption , and some people accused of crimes before courts claim to have been framed. Though I think the word frame still provides a useful focus for discussing the process by which people construct meaning , scholars who employ frame analysis should also recognise that the term 'frame ' itself frames the understanding which readers will draw from the results of the analysis . </frame.v.1666><frame.v.1667>The importance of how prospective research is framed is illustrated by the first two polls detailed in table 16 , the first sponsored by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ( JDRF ) and the second by the National Council of Catholic Bishops ( NCCB ) . Both poll items present strong examples of just how sensitive respondents may be to question-wording effects , especially when public attention to an issue is relatively low. The JDRF poll mentions as the source of stem cells extra embryos " donated to research " and then includes as background information a list of eight high-profile diseases or injuries for which stem cell research might provide " cures. " Not surprisingly , public support for funding is measured at 65 percent. In the NCCB poll , respondents are told , " Congress is considering whether to provide funding for experiments using stem cells from human embryos. The live embryos would be destroyed in their first week of development to obtain these cells. " The respondents are then asked , " Do you support or favor using your federal tax dollars for such experiments ? " ( emphasis added ) .

These principles allow humanitarian organizations to assist those affected by armed conflicts and natural disasters alike. Humanitarian aid and assistance include feeding , clothing , educating , protecting , and healing affected peoples as an end unto itself. Although not a homogenous group , humanitarian organizations are those that uphold the tenets of humanitarianism and adhere to specific codes of conduct , such as the Humanitarian Charter and the ICRC Code of Conduct. Recipients of aid and assistance are considered equal within the humanitarian paradigm , regardless of political , polemical , or sectarian affiliations. Humanitarian principles , thus , suggest that they do not take sides in conflicts , thereby avoiding being perceived of as party to a conflict . </frame.v.1670><frame.v.1671>Richard 's introduction as a tank commander is followed by a more pastoral scene at court , a modern version of the festivities that mark the " glorious summer " of the Yorkist victory. It is literally pastoral because Richard 's gunshots are replaced on the soundtrack by a swing-age setting of Marlowe 's " Passionate Shepherd , " its refrain , " come live with me " framed by Richard 's murder of the Prince of Wales before it and images of the coughing ( dying ) King Edward after. Its harmonies are brief , and , if the vocalist herself is intended to be understood as Jewish , allegorically portentous. The scene is lush , luxurious , insincere , decadent. Lord Rivers is a heedless American roue , grabbing a feel from a stewardess as he disembarks from his plane , chain smoking throughout the ball , even as he dances with his sister Queen Elizabeth.

In some cases , however , an undertaking may not be appropriate for all prospective access seekers. This could be the case where an undertaking has been framed with certain type of access seekers in mind , but which in practice does not cater for all potential access seekers. There are two ways of dealing with such cases. The first is to vary the undertaking. This approach is discussed in Chapter 4. In some cases , however , it may be more appropriate to include a provision or contingency clause in an undertaking which allows for differences between the access contract and the undertaking with the approval of both the service provider and access seeker. Approval by the Commission or the independent dispute resolution body would usually also be appropriate to ensure that such variations do not explicitly or implicitly undermine the objectives of Part IIIA . </frame.v.1674><frame.v.1675>Then there 's the problem of framed art in general.

In Nasrallah ' s words , ' America will remain the nation ' s chief enemy and the greatest Satan of all ' ( Noe , 2007 : 54 ) . According to Naim Qassem , deputy secretary-general , ' since its establishment in 1982 , Hizballah has observed contemporary US foreign policy and positions as being ultimately geared towards supporting the existence and foundations of the Israeli entity ' ( Qassem , 2005 : 246 ) . It can be argued that the US involvement in the Middle East has created both the seeds and the fertile soil for the Hizballah ' s anti-American frames. However , they can also be seen as a ' wider symbolic extension of the Iranian revolutionary struggle against outside intervention and colonialism ' ( Ranstorp , 1997 : 53 ) . </frame.v.1682><frame.v.1683>By laminating the print and replacing the cardboard mat board , with a linen covered wood liner , we 're able to frame these pictures without glass.

I will use a model founded on Neuro Linguistic Programming ( NLP ) . It defines that the way human beings perceive any reality or events is based on the context that is built around the event in question. In other words , the meaning that we give to something ( UFOs or abductions ) is determined by how it is framed , by the frame of reference. To give an example , if a five star general says that UFOs are real , we tend to believe more than if a psychiatric patient tells us that he saw a UFO. It is the same information , only the frame of reference is different. NLP explains that by changing the frame of reference around an event , we change the meaning of the event . </frame.v.1688><frame.v.1689>The idea of this tutorial is very similar to the one called 'Square Picture Frames from Gradients'.

There is a reason why injunctions are rarely ordered in cases of contempt : the reasonably precise terms in which an injunction must be framed might lead to the erroneous conclusion that slightly different behaviour from that described in the injunction would be acceptable.65 More generally , injunctions are available only in cases where other remedies prove inadequate66 and there is nothing to suggest that remedies for contempt often prove inadequate.

The impact of this program on the students was significant , as their letters after the workshop demonstrate. By fore-grounding the violence and tragedy of the past so starkly in these times of relative peace multiple agendas can be played out , but leading these is the idea that the terror of war happened to " people we know. " The personalization of history in this context can be framed as the ascendancy of local knowledges , and can be understood as powerful storytelling in the sense that Walter Benjamin uses the term. Such initiatives demonstrate how some Kume Islanders today are negotiating aspects of their own identity . </frame.v.1696><frame.v.1697>£ 14.99 - Silvia Pankhurst print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - Silvia Pankhurst print - POSTED £ 29.99 - Silvia Pankhurst framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - Silvia Pankhurst framed print - POSTED </frame.v.1697><frame.v.1698>Welcome , and thanks for visiting our website.

In both South Africa and Rwanda , political elites initiated the process of constitutional change , provided the personnel for the key institutions , and framed the educational campaigns. Official ambivalence and continuing attempts to block the process in Kenya reveal how a participatory process initiated from perceived political necessity can threaten an elite with loss of control and incur their resistance. At the most cynical extreme , a determined elite or one that is confident of its continuing control may offer a participatory process as a charade , a democratic hoax intended to mollify unrest by granting the appearance of democracy without its substance.

Jewish women , for example , strictly speaking , do not have a biblically mandated obligation to dwell in a succah during the Succot holiday. If a woman , however , nonetheless sincerely believes that sitting and eating in a succah brings her closer to her Maker , is that somehow less deserving of recognition simply because she has no strict obligation to do so ? Is the Jewish yarmulke or Sikh turban worthy of less recognition simply because it may be borne out of religious custom , not obligation ?

The true European-American conflict is not about the erosion of the European commitment to high privacy standards. Nor are American political actors primarily concerned about increasing domestic pressure for stricter privacy standards.220 The conflict is much more down to earth. Europeans are afraid that the data of their nationals will be exposed to unacceptable risk when stored in the U.S. And U.S. businesses and policy-makers are unwilling to grant European data owners a degree of protection they would not give their domestic customers.221 </frame.v.1739><frame.v.1740>The art and science of strategic frame analysis -- issue framing -- is relatively new in Canada , though the concept of framing is not.

However , the majority of research about political candidates focuses on national and statewide elections to the detriment of local political campaigns. This investigation contributes to existing research on political candidates on the local level. In 1999 , Republican Party candidate Sue Anne Gilroy and Democratic Party candidate Bart Peterson contested for the Indianapolis mayoral seat. To many observers , Gilroy was advantaged because the Republicans controlled local politics and had easily won the mayoral office for over 30 years. The Democratic Party candidate , Bart Peterson , was a relative unknown to Indianapolis politics. In the end , however , Peterson defeated Gilroy by winning 52 of the votes.

As commerce increased in the course of years its regulation became of more and more importance , and in the end the necessity for this regulation was one of the most important causes of federalism. In fact , the convention which framed the National Constitution in 1787 was originally called merely for the purpose of regulating the commerce between the States that bordered on Chesapeake Bay; and no more important clause was placed in the national document than that which gives Congress power to " regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes.

The more time I spent with Lakoff , in fact , the more I began to suspect that his complaint about ''magic words'' was another example of framing; in this case , Lakoff was consciously framing himself in his conversations with me as a helpless academic whose theories were being misused.

In other words , frames do not exist in a vacuum nor do they occur in isolation , but instead speak to broader socio-political issues. Similar to the way one uses the picture frame , media use framing to establish the acceptable and unacceptable boundaries or parameters of a discussion and to focus the audience ' s attention , or delimit the discourse about a certain societal issue , in this case the war . </frame.v.1772><frame.v.1773>In addition to the structural , energy &amp;fire benefits SIPs offer your structure , SIP users enjoy a reduction in outside noise.

He credits Bateson with originating the metaphor of framing ( Takeshita , 1997 ) . Maher ( 2001 ) stated that Bateson described framing as a certain set of rules for making and understanding messages. Bateson ' s early concepts of how you frame versus what issues were framed did lay the groundwork for heated framer versus agenda setter discussions of today. Goffman ( 1974 ) defined framing as the meaning a person gives to a particular situation , referring mainly to face-to-face interpersonal encounters ( Goffman , 1974 ) . Takeshita ( 1997 ) explains that Goffman ' s description could be interpreted as people using different frames for different types of media content. For example , if a person were watching a television advertisement , they would apply an advertising frame , which warns the person to take the communication at face value because they are trying to sold something. The person would apply different frames to drama ' s and newscasts . </frame.v.1783><frame.v.1784>£ 14.99 - Ella Fitzgerald print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - Ella Fitzgerald print - POSTED £ 29.99 - Ella Fitzgerald framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - Ella Fitzgerald framed print - POSTED </frame.v.1784><frame.v.1785>Picture frames are used to hold the pictures.

The fight was nominally over Bush 's choices for the federal bench , but everyone knew it was in fact merely a prelude to the battle over the Supreme Court; the only way for Democrats to stop a confirmation vote would be to employ the filibuster . </frame.v.1796><frame.v.1797>[ Chicago building ] ( Large white building , possibly a house or church.

Backside of my 1/2-inch plywood shutters are framed with 1x4s , glued with Liquid Nails and screwed. Barrel bolts are typically 4 each on the left and right frame.

The main goal of frame extension is to make the frame more attractive to its potential adherents with different priorities. For instance , a group primarily concerned with environmental issues could include a platform against nuclear energy and frame its risks as environmental ones. Frame extension often comes at a cost , though , as it can weaken the appeal of a frame through clouding the essence of its contents ( Snow &amp;Benford , 1988 : 478 ) . </frame.v.1840><frame.v.1841>In the before shot of this bedroom , we ' re again faced with blank walls.

The frame is a concept , to make the people inside proud and celebrated. I went all over downtown Teheran collecting things to place around the subjects. Each subject has a very different character and I choose things very carefully according to what I felt they would want to represent them or things that would be meaningful to them.

OG is an interrogation of the conditions of possibility of the intertwining of an inward interrogation ( philosophy ) with its social-historical conditions of possibility. More specifically , Husserl tries to account for the conditions of possibility for philosophical interrogation involving intersubjective communities occupied with similar types of knowledge and the historical density of that knowledge as they become operational for a particular subject. The central bind , then , is how to address this intertwining in a mode that resolves what is thought into discrete , object-like formations . </frame.v.1848><frame.v.1849>Your grandmother might not understand your affinity for something as impractical as an old label framed in old wood hanging on your wall.

In this sense , I think it should work very well for a verbal presentation , because it will give me a chance to briefly touch on a number of interesting hits in the area -- opposition and resistance ( natch ! ) , thinking about the changing nature of governance , ulterior political motives in " neutral " policies , and the importance of embracing both history and the mundane in surveillance research . </frame.v.1850><frame.v.1851>One shows us the heroine 's house.

The first is often the poor quality paper the artwork is made of which usually contains lignin , and other potential acid sources , that cause it to gradually discolor yellow or brown with age. The second is often improper of incorrect framing. If the artwork is properly framed , then the discoloration and deterioration processes will be significantly retarded , if not entirely stopped. The best way to prevent or to decelerate discolouration and yellowing is to use conservation materials , processes and techniques to prevent acid leaching or contamination to the paper-borne artwork . </frame.v.1866><frame.v.1867>Prints can be framed without matting; however , our 100 unbuffered cotton rag mattes richly enhance the final product.

Few could gainsay the proposition that in Canada there is ' little genuine political choice.

As a consequence , opposition to this regime tends to be weaker than in other societies and the opposition which does exist is framed by the dialectic between managerial tendencies and their therapeutic counterparts ( Wegierski , 1998 ) .

The empiricism of social science invokes images of objectivity and truth and hints that the problems of public life could be overcome if only we had enough well-organized information. Readings framed by postmodern theory , on the other hand , often lead us beyond materiality and into a realm without subjects , agency , or will. In subtle ways , attempting to get empirically quantitative with postmodern thinking subverts both paradigms. Borrowing from cultural theory and engaging in rhetorical analysis suggests that discourse is the ultimate site of power. Consequently , positivist tendencies to study a state institution and the people within it are called into question. Judges can not be taken out of the picture by which AIDS and sexuality are given meaning , nor should they be given an elevated subject position in the constructive process; however , my acts of enumeration , categorization , and calculation appear to intimate otherwise . </frame.v.1876><frame.v.1877>Frame Masters Gallery specializes in custom picture framing , framed beveled mirrors , decorative wall mirror , framed floor mirrors , contemporary and abstract art , fine art painting , original oil paintings , and decorative framed wall art as well as framed art prints.

Poirier frames the struggle instead as a " kulturkampf , " or culture war , a term invoked by U. S. Supreme Court Justice Scalia in his Romer v. Evans dissent ( 517 U.S. 620 , 636 ( 1996 ) ) . The error of the first view is that the state is the proper level of analysis at which to frame the central arguments at issue in marriage adjudication.

The rise of US labour in the past century was accompanied by the call for industrial democracy.15 There was no coincidence in this , for the ideal of industrial democracy worked effectively as a simple , potent , and broadly uniting concept that accomplished some things for labour that the present-day workers ' rights formulation does not. Briefly reviewing the way the concept of industrial democracy functioned in the past helps us establish some useful criteria against which to measure any effort to frame labour 's vision today.16 </frame.v.1886><frame.v.1887>In closing , I ' d like to quote an ancient Chinese philosopher , Lao Tsu.

All participants are making strong efforts to frame the issue according to their own interests , so that even non-events can cause dismay whereas actual problems may be overlooked. Efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements meet Scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution. The American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes. This is no easy starting point for American scholars , who consequently are facing severe source problems. However some scholars have decided to take an active political role in the debate and to rally for Scientology 's bona fide status. This is yet another conscious framing effort in order to gain influence on the controversy . </frame.v.1892><frame.v.1893>It is frustrating to browse the Web and find someone talking about a great site.

This is too quantitative a formula. Instead , qualitative distinctions between different kinds of instrusions government makes on individuals are central to understanding existing practices; it is these qualitative distinctions to which the relevant ethical intuitions attach. By focusing , as many others have , on " large and concentrated losses , " Kaplow 's fairness discussion focuses on distributional equality as the relevant ethical ideal , but framed in this way , that ideal runs into the kinds of incoherences noted above regarding existing wealth and marginal income effects from policy reforms. Instead , I think fairness in this area is more a matter of government 's obligations of respect for individual dignity than of distributional equality. The individual right not to have government inflict certain kinds of harms , without at least paying compensation in acknowledgement of its obligation to respect the dignitary interests invaded , seems central to this area. But further discussion must await another day . </frame.v.1901><frame.v.1902>Digital picture frames for photos with Gimp This tutorial is a help for creating digital picture frames with Gimp.

Identities are likely to spread more easily when there are political rewards for adopting ( or expressing ) a particular identity , for example. Certain norms may have a difficult time spreading through a population if living up to those norms carries an economic cost. Conversely , norms or other ideas may be able to piggy-back on successful economic transactions. Each of these questions , though framed in an abstract manner , has obvious relevance to some very important real-world issues : When might political entrepreneurs benefit from trying to recruit followers by appealing to ethnic divisions ? Will more internal trade facilitate the emergence of a European identity in the EU ?

At times the community , planner , architect , or politician may actually prefer the direction a dispute has taken because of the prevailing frames. In general , however , the effect of frames and framing on the quality of outcomes for different stakeholders needs to be recognized. Practitioners must understand which kinds of information are useful for counteracting frames detrimental to the decision process ( in the sense of filtering situation specifics ) , and for promoting frames that encourage participation and joint decisions. And practitioners need to ponder their roles and the ethical dilemmas they face when intervening in conflicts . </frame.v.1906><frame.v.1907>News Language : News research in recent years has noted an increase in the use of technical and strategic language and framing in news discourse. This tendency , in which journalists frame their news accounts from the perspective of " insiders " in a " game , " and in which they use insider terminology and language ( e.g. " collateral damage " for civilian deaths ) has been studied most extensively in relation to election news , where strategy or horse-race framing is associated with alienation among voters ( e.g. Cappella and Jamieson , 1996 ) . However this kind of language may have its most pernicious effects in covering international crises where issues of life and death are at stake. To track this kind of coverage , and to see if there were different levels of technical , as opposed to moral , framing across international media , we coded and analyzed headlines and sub headlines for all stories in terms of technical and strategic language vs. more moralistic or empathetic language. For example , coders looked for references that suggested that the international crisis and war be seen as a sport or game ( " winning the peace " ) , a hunting event ( " Saddam 's Lair " ) , or a routine job to be done ( " Getting the job done " ) , or whether more humane frameworks prevailed . </frame.v.1907><frame.v.1908>If you have more picture than you can possibly frame , then you should consider using collage picture frames.

As well as studying how changes in teaching diffuse through and relate to other educational sub-practices ( administration , staff development , evaluation and research ) , the study will examine the points of reference university teachers use in reflecting on their practice. What constructs the aspiration and intention to change ? But aspiration and intention are framed and occur amidst the exigencies , habits and customs of political life.

The final gilding and surface toning of the replica should match the finish of the original as well.

The study suggested that the explanation for cross-national variation in the ' domestic bottleneck ' consisted of more than just divergences between national politics , culture and framing , and EU norms. Rather , it was the way in which gender was brought into these various processes the type of gender regime , how gender issues are framed and how key policy communities deal with gender issues; in other words , how Europeanization became gendered in each country.

People work with two types of frames : ( 1 ) 'domain-specific interpretative frames ' , which organise sets of behaviours and individual lifestyles; and ( 2 ) 'global interpretative frames ' or 'master frames ' which signify meaning on a broader scope and which organise sets of domain-specific frames ( Snow et al , 1986 : pp. 474 - 5 ) . Snow and Benford suggest that processes by which people make sense of issues revolve in cycles. Movements experience different opportunities to manipulate frames , and face different sets of constraints on their frame usage during different phases of protest cycles ( Snow and Benford , 1992 ) . </frame.v.1942><frame.v.1943>Framing is important. The confusions that I have talked about in this book all make an appearance. It starts with the whole controversy being framed by the Internet Threat story line from Chapter 4. Because Judge Kaplan is convinced that every citizen is now a potential infringer , a potentially infectious virus carrier , he is ill disposed to listen to claims about fair use. Civil liberties claims do not do very well in epidemics. It is only right for him to defer to Congress ' s perception of the problem and the solution , of course. But he buys so deeply into the magnitude of the threat , the extent of the potential piracy pandemic , that it is very hard for him to take seriously the idea that even here there is a legitimate constitutional fair use claim . </frame.v.1943><frame.v.1944>Double standards : Many have been made aware of the double standards through which world problems are framed and actions proposed -- or required of others. This can again be seen as a highly valuable educational process regarding a widespread modality of collective initiatives -- where such double standards typically go unchallenged under cover of a spirit of carefully cultivated decorum based on a privileged relationship to an ethical high ground. Whether it be academic , religious , corporate , voluntary or government initiatives , such an education empowers people to challenge such double standards , to require that they be recognized in practice , and to engender other modes of social action in which appropriate checks and balances are embedded in practice -- rather than by implication , lipservice or theory . </frame.v.1944><frame.v.1945>Group-centric political evaluations depend on how groups and policy conflicts are framed in elite discourse. Whether the perceptual differences are due to media framing of fundamentalist ( and evangelical ) Christians as being integral to the culture wars and Jews ( as a group ) being peripheral to ideological clashes over values and the role of religion in public life is an interesting empirical question worthy of study . </frame.v.1945><frame.v.1946>Social movements often seek to draw attention to issues they deem important by organizing public demonstrations with the aim of attracting mass media coverage. But only a small proportion of all public demonstrations receives any media attention. This article asks whether even the minimal coverage that demonstrations receive reveal any influence of social movements in shaping how issues are framed by the mass media. Analyzing newspaper and television news stories on Washington , D.C. protests held during 1982 and 1991 , we ask whether news reports on protests are framed in ways consistent with the aims of protesters. Do demonstrators receive media coverage that highlights the issues about which they are concerned , or does coverage focus on the protest event itself , to the exclusion of the social issues that movements target ? Our results support much of the surmising among media scholars , that even when movements succeed at obtaining the attention of mass media outlets , media reports portray protests in ways that may undermine social movement agendas. Despite this obstacle to communicating protest messages through demonstrations , movements engage in other forms of communication that can affect public interpretations of mass media frames . </frame.v.1946><frame.v.1947>Once the rest-length and position is adjusted , you can use rotate on frame 0 to further adjust the skeleton.

One , by Chris Bowers at MyDD , addressed the use of code words by Democratic hawks to attack other Democrats on security issues-painting them as hopelessly out of the mainstream , when , in fact , it is the hawks who are in the small minority. However , they still control the beltway debate. The other , by Booman at Booman Tribune , was an attack on framing. My first diary responding to Booman saw him repeatedly mischaracterize what framing is , over and over and over again. In this diary , I take a different approach. I discuss Lakoff 's use of framing to articulate a different foreign policy vision -- one that actually resonates with what the American people already believe ... and with proven foreign policy success. This is badly needed , because not only do advocates of withdrawal lack media access , they also lack a common framework of understanding. And that , ultimately , is what framing is all about.

His Honour ' s judgment provides a useful example of how a judge can scrutinise a media organisation ' s claim that legal action would compromise its freedom; this is exactly the kind of scrutiny that would be involved where a court needed to decide whether an organisation was engaged in responsible journalism or an abuse of press freedom in the form of trial by media. The Chappell case demonstrates that such an inquiry need not be framed in such a way as to leave a free rein to judges to make subjective and therefore unpredictable decisions.

Plywood stiffeners between the studs will help with spreading , and making sure the framing components are screwed together will help to make sure it does not come apart. Some places may need a bolted in angle iron or similar to reinforce.

Critical of the child study movement upheld by developmentalists , he relegated the establishment of children ' s interests to a factor of social organization rather than an overarching domain and similarly positioned social determination of roles as multifaceted and fluid rather than fixed. He basically upheld the hypothesis that children should not be positioned as essentialist subjects or predetermined objects , but instead somewhere in between these micro and macro perspectives. He maintained that children are not models for adult aestheticism , as expressed during the Renaissance , nor are they to be purely seen as malleable social tools . </frame.v.1969><frame.v.1970>Best Local Print : Local artist Charlie Hunter thrilled train buffs and Keene enthusiasts alike with his Art Deco rendition of the Yankee Flyer train crossing the iconic Cheshire Railroad stone bridge that crosses the Branch River in sight of Rte. 101.

It exists as a separate , discrete entity from reality. To interpret this image , contextual information provided by the accompanying news article succeeds in creating a determinate reality upon which the photograph can be based.

In essence , media gatekeepers have the power to determine the parameters of public discussion on consequential issues , like the war in Iraq , by accepting , rejecting , or muting certain perspectives from the realm of debate. If a contrary perspective is expressed publicly and perceived as a threat to the social order , it will be framed as a minority perspective ( invalid and with little public support ) and the people who expressed that perspective may be punished as a way to discourage further expression of that perspective. Consequently , the people holding that view are vilified and their perspective is portrayed as one that deserves censure instead of public discussion and debate . </frame.v.1979><frame.v.1980>Rosenbaum residence.

These institutionalised sources can be very useful and provide news at suitable intervals ( in accordance with criterion F1 ) but will frame events according to their interests those of the dominant forces in society ( Fowler , 1991 : 22 ) . Organised press conferences also ease the pressure on journalists yet only people or organisations with money and influence are able to present their perspectives and influence news frames in this way ( Manning , 2001 ) .

" </frame.v.2003><frame.v.2004>Mounting artwork refers to the process of affixing your art in place in order to display or frame it. If done correctly , the materials you use to mount your art will be hidden by the matting and wo n't be visible once the framing is complete. Since a lot of mounting materials are designed to remain in physical contact with the picture you 're framing , acid-free materials can be a good choice if the artwork is valuable to you. Mounting materials that are n't acid-free can yellow or damage your art . </frame.v.2004><frame.v.2005>Three qualities are essential for good picture framing; taste , proportion and craftsmanship in that order. In framing , it is difficult to err on the side of simplicity. Advantage should be taken of good tradition , but the needs of modern living must be kept in mind. The artist and craftsman should not be swayed by " fads'* in framing such as covering a Victorian atrocity with whitewash and calling it " smart " . The three requisites mentioned above can only be developed with time and through experience. However , if sufficient study is given to the picture before it is framed , errors will be reduced and better frames will result . </frame.v.2005><frame.v.2006>YourFramer also offer creative ideas of displaying your images.

The One God of the Jews , as generally envisaged , was not " high " at the last any more than at the first. The intervening host of angels and demons , indeed , partly saved his dignity and bore the heavier burdens of the popular superstition; but inasmuch as Yahweh remained , despite the higher ideas of some prophets or their interpolators , a tribal and sacerdotal God , he entailed a tribal and sacerdotal ethic; and though doubtless a few , helped by Greek thought , speculated at a higher level , the Almighty who " plays with Leviathan " and sits as Chief Rabbi in Heaven is not a relatively imposing conception. The first Christists accordingly were but doing what the myth-making and religion-making mind has always done in its innovations seeking to frame a rather more satisfying ethic . </frame.v.2008><frame.v.2009>There is a little trade off in making a .45 this light.

Much research on framing focuses on ways that politicians , issue advocates , and other elite news sources use mainstream journalists to communicate their preferred meanings of issues and events. The word ' use ' is important. Its dual meaning sources ' use ' the press to send information and sources manipulate the press ( ' use ' it ) while sending information captures the essence of news framing : powerful sources frame issues and events in order to make information interesting and palatable to journalists , whom they often need to communicate their frames to audience members , and journalists can not not frame issues and events because they need sources ' frames to make news informative to audiences , even as they add their own contextualization to sources ' frames news values and the like in order to have some measure of professional autonomy in light of the fact that they know they are being used by sources ( Gamson &amp;Modigliani , 1989; Price , Tewksbury , &amp;Powers , 1997 ) . </frame.v.2012><frame.v.2013>As we head into the part of winter most of us dread , the thought of sitting by the wood stove or fireplace in a timber framed home , just seems to give you that warm feeling.

The central readings area comes from the social studies of science and technology , particularly from the literature on participant observation and anthropology ( Latour 1979 ) . Also emphasized from this area are different approaches towards framing technological change and development , such as actor-network and social worlds approaches , heterogeneous engineering and the social construction of technology . Also part of the core readings for this course are readings from various philosophers in ethics , such as Kant , Mill , Locke , Rawls , Nozick , and Walzer. These readings are not meant to be an extensive portrayal of each of each philosopher 's views but an exposure to various themes in the ethics of business and engineering. The unifying theme for the readings in ethics is moral imagination , or frame shifting , because the best cases are ones that capture many different points of view surrounding a design issue. These readings are supplemented by contemporary writings of scholars who work in engineering and business ethics ( Davis 1998; ) . Finally , students read a range of case studies and supplementary writings that help them begin their research for their summer case work . </frame.v.2019><frame.v.2020>If you paint ocassionally , learning picture framing may not be your cup of tea.

Political and legal philosophers have approached the question of fit in the contexts of common law precedents , constitutional provisions , and statutes and regulations. As William Blackstone framed this issue in regard to statutory interpretation : " [ S ] ince in laws all cases can not be foreseen or expressed , it is necessary , that when general decrees of law come to be applied to particular cases , there should be somewhere a power vested of excepting those circumstances , which ( had they been foreseen ) the legislator himself would have excepted.

If you really think that the ID folks do n't engage in issue framing I would strongly suggest that it 's time to see the men in little white coats because you have slipped well over the line into the delusional category. Their entire movement is based upon framing the issue , spinning it in a certain way for maximum emotional effect . </frame.v.2022><frame.v.2023>In order to make an accurate comparison , it is necessary to compare like structures , and that is where the difficulty begins. Given structures of identical size with identical floor plans , one timber framed and the other conventionally built , you still do n't have identical buildings.

But it is framed and shaped by a series of spoken texts , mostly drawn from writings and speeches by Lincoln. These are interspersed and layered with recorded voices offering their own notions about history and identity , with autobiographical fragments from Mr. Jones , with song , and with a low-key , mostly classical score. The music is performed live by Jerome Begin , Lisa Komara and Christopher Antonio William Lancaster , who are also the composers of much of the material . </frame.v.2024><frame.v.2025>Think of this as a three-step program.

Oak framed buildings are going to make your building look like it has had a lot of money spent on it. If you own a company then you will be making a good impression on people who visit because for a start your building will look like you have paid attention to it and the finer detail that shows a lot about you as the company.

It should be emphasized that such standards will protect US workers from competition with slave wages overseas , rampant outsourcing and lax environmental standards . </frame.v.2027><frame.v.2028>Once you have bought your favorite art piece , explore unique ways of presenting it to your audience. If you have several pieces of art that you want to hang on the wall , try grouping them creatively to add a more interesting look. If the art piece is small enough , why not frame it and place it on a shelf or side table - it 's nice to be able to pick it up to have a closer look once in a while. Art does n't have to be hung on the wall. You can simply place it on the floor and lean it against a wall or a piece of furniture , perhaps against a cupboard or side table - just make sure that the art piece will not obstruct walkways , and that it is n't too large or too small that would make it look out of place . </frame.v.2028><frame.v.2029>The timber frame supply industry has expanded rapidly over recent years , driven by a steady increased demand for timber framed buildings from individual self builders as well as developers both large and small. MRT Homes was established in 2006 with the aim of offering clients not only a product of real quality , but also a level of client service that is a reality and not merely some often promised strap line in a glossy brochure.

During the second phase of planning , attention was directed almost exclusively on the five ZEMs. These have shorelines ranging from 25 to 75 km in length. Inland ZEM boundaries were defined in only general terms since the " findings of fact " policies and actions detailed in each ZEM Plan are framed by issue and not by rigid geographic boundaries. Where feasible , each plan analyzes issues and proposes actions for the watersheds that include both the coastline and portions of the associated cordillera . </frame.v.2033><frame.v.2034>This company was established in 2002 and specializes in making beautiful , hand painted frames by the best and the most skilled hands and with the latest technology in picture frame designs.

Throughout the 30 years the New Zealand women 's movement framed childcare as a way to relieve some of the burden of care placed on women and to allow them to participate more fully in all areas of life. The idea that childcare was necessary in order for women to carry out paid and unpaid work was also part of the policy beliefs of unions and sector groups in the 1980s and 1990s . </frame.v.2041><frame.v.2042>All this could change overnight if the powers that be saw a significant threat to their ascendancy; but it suggests that compelling the police to use force at the conventions this summer would be a coup , in that it would frame them as aggressors in a time when they are trying to dispel that image.

In the United States , the founding generation of intellectuals had been nurtured on the philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment and the history of the struggle against royal monopolies. They saw the arguments in favor of intellectual property but warned again and again of the need to circumscribe both its term and its scope. This is the point at the heart of Jefferson ' s letter. This is why he insisted that we understand the policy implications of the differences between tangible property and ideas , which like fire are expansible over all space , without lessening their density in any point. </frame.v.2052><frame.v.2053>[ Burch D.

Nixon was the first president to use the war metaphor in describing his domestic policies on drugs and drug use. n20 The metaphor quickly entered popular discourse and became a tool used by politicians and policy makers to frame drug abuse , which some analysts consider to be essentially a medical problem , as a national crisis manageable only by legal sanctions. n21 Thus , drug use became a national emergency requiring the ex- [ *142 ] treme measures due any war or national crisis. n22 President Ronald W. Reagan continued the modern drug war. n23 In 1986 , he gave a national anti-drug address , televised live from the White House. n24 Like President Nixon before him , President Reagan framed the attack on drug use through metaphors of war , but added a twist - he used the metaphor of illness by referring to the " epidemic " of crack smoking. n25 He also described drug use as traitorous activity that threatened the values that underlie American democracy . </frame.v.2056><frame.v.2057>We are always trying to innovate whenever possible in giving you the best custom picture framing and framed art services and products.

Quaker women had long been taught to trust their religious experience , which often was framed in the form of a mystical communication. Such direct experience might even contradict received traditions. The mystical experience of sanctification , the most distinguishing characteristic of the Holiness Movement , had several variations among the Gurneyite women in this study , but it was always a specific experience that could be pinpointed in time and space , and often the climax of a personal struggle. The women generally described their experience as either a consecration , a sanctification , a baptism of the Holy Spirit , or becoming fully saved and committed to God , and it usually included the dedication of their tongue and talents to some particular calling , moral duty , or social vision . </frame.v.2064><frame.v.2065>In particular , as a " master frame , " American social movements of the 1960s and 1970s successfully utilized the " master frame " of " rights.

Education is seen as the process by which knowledge is transferred into the learner 's minds , and teaching is seen as the packaging of knowledge for efficient transfer.

Discourse itself , Foucault and his followers argued , is a shifting structure of power : who gets to speak ? What do we speak of , and how ? What counts as knowledge ? Whose voice counts and how did it get that way ? How do such classifications as between normality and perversion , health and sickness , sanity and lunacy , lawfulness and criminality , emerge in history , not as a matter of language " capturing " by reference any " natural " distinctions but as a matter of shaping and determining discourse in an eternal play of multiple power-centers ? 46 </frame.v.2071><frame.v.2072>We offer gift certificates in any amount you like , either separate or framed in one of our photo frames.

According to a recent study that we conducted at Cornell University , although stem-cell research had been ongoing for four decades , the media virtually ignored it until 2001 , when the issue could be fit into a dramatic , conflict-oriented context. Our analysis finds that in association with a sharp rise in media attention , the use of dramatic storytelling themes also increased markedly , with a quarter of all stem-cell-related articles in 2001 featuring some reference to science fiction , popular culture , or historical metaphor. Moreover , the media framed coverage predominantly in terms of political strategy and conflict. This structuring of discourse by competing political actors and journalists so as to emphasize popular fiction , drama , and conflict continues with the 2002 debate over cloning legislation -- and suggests an obvious opening for the megacultural phenomenon that is Star Wars to have a serious impact . </frame.v.2074><frame.v.2075>[ Living room , Stanwyx Place , Louisville , Kentucky , 1936 ] ( Mrs. Henry Burnett house , Stanwyx Place , on River Road at Blankenbaker Lane , Louisville , Kentucky.

People tend to react differently to a proposed action when its expected consequences are framed in terms of losses as opposed to gains , where preventing a perceived loss is often more salient and more highly valued than capturing a commensurate gain. [ 22 ] Thus , intractable conflicts tend to reinforce a psychological barrier to resolution . </frame.v.2078><frame.v.2079>A. You will get the same or better quality.

First , wood posts are the main vertical framing element in all post-frame buildings. Without wood posts , there is no post-frame building. Second , there is no roof framing system that is unique to post-frame. Any roof framing system used in post-frame could be ( and likely has been ) placed on a light-wood frame wall ( a.k.a. , wood stud wall ) , a log wall , a SIP wall , a masonry wall , a light-gage steel-stud wall , etc. This fact became apparent when it was agreed that a building featuring 24-inch on-center trusses/rafters attached to post-supported headers , is a post-frame building just as much as a building in which all trusses or rafters are attached directly to posts. That said , it should be noted the roof of a post-frame building is framed using nominal 2-inch thick lumber or similar-sized engineered lumber components , and this makes it different from timber-framed and post-and-beam systems in which larger glulams and solid-sawn timbers are used as primary roof framing members . </frame.v.2080><frame.v.2081>Original prints in black and white such as etchings , lithographs , etc. , are usually matted in white , off-white or cream mats and framed with glass in very narrow Moldings of natural wood or black.

The members of the British Parliament received no salaries , and it seems to have been a disputed question at the time our National Constitution was framed whether members of Congress should be paid for their services. Franklin argued very earnestly that they should not be paid. The previous documents had usually been silent on this subject; but some of the constitutions of 1776 , notably that of Virginia and the Massachusetts constitution of 1780 , had provided for the salaries of the governor and other officers; and the Pennsylvania Frame of 1696 gave the members of the council five shillings a day , the members of the assembly four shillings a day , and the members of both bodies twopence a mile for travelling expenses . </frame.v.2091><frame.v.2092>Perhaps the only solution that ABC saw was to make the references of alien abductions weak so few would believe it and because of this , it wouldn ' t create general fear in society and people would dismiss abductions easily. They might have felt like they had to somehow frame abductions in a way that left most in the mainstream believe that there were other explanations. Like most , I was disappointed that Dr. John Mack was not featured , but after watching it , I know that his important work could have been damaged , just like they framed Budd Hopkins ' work in a way that makes it easy to dismiss.

Scientists should not fear the frame. After all , they frame their message all the time in professional venues and settings , whether they recognize it or not. The differences between the framing that scientists do on a daily basis and the framing that Mooney and Nisbet are in essence a matter of degree , and it is not necessary to " lie to the public , " as Larry Moran puts it , to accomplish this. Simplification to allow an audience uneducated in mathematics and even high school level science is not necessarily lying , if done correctly so that the essence of the scientific concept to be grasped shines through. The purpose is the same ( to get our message across to an audience ) , but to reach the public it 's necessary to go further at it than scientists are used to , and that 's where the discomfort seems to lie . </frame.v.2093><frame.v.2094>Aluminium is mined as bauxite and often has to travel large distances by boat and truck before being made into windows adding CO2 mileage onto a project 's carbon footprint. Metals are also very good conductors of heat which when used as an insulating material is not desired. This means that aluminium framing will transmit heat from inside a building through the frame and release it to the outside world. Thermal breaks can be added to combat this , these involve using two separate frames one internally and one externally. This forces the heat to move into poorer heat conducting air between the two frames and can give a boost to an aluminium framed window 's insulation rating by 50 . Metal frames with double glazing have a typical U-rating of 1.8 ( an energy efficiency rating of D ) . </frame.v.2094><frame.v.2095>An old painting has plenty of crackle , uneven coloration , and patina-lots of signs that show its age. To me , the best choice for an old piece such as this is to frame it with a frame that also has crackle , discoloration , and patina. There is much more continuity , and the pieces look as if they really belong together . </frame.v.2095><frame.v.2096>Even if superstructures may not be said to properly frame discursive structures , I argue that a higher level of discourse , a cultural frame , nonetheless modifies superstructures. I also take issue with van Dijk 's characterisation of discursive structural frames as ' " real-life " examples of frames'. Such frames , as van Dijk argues , depend on the point of view of the speaker , and discursive structural frames select and hierarchically organise some information , while deleting other information. Such frames would be more properly described as socially constructed rather than 'real-life ' ( in some absolute sense ) frames. If , for example , a nomadic community changes to a settled community dependent upon an economic system requiring limited movement of most families , the concept of house , and , consequently , both the 'house frame ' and the way people experience 'real life ' when they use the reconstructed house frame , would change. Likewise , in the contemporary USA or UK , the house frame can connote different meaning for property speculators and homeless persons. Supra-superstructural ( or cultural ) frames thus need not be significantly more abstract or more dependent on context than discursive structural frames . </frame.v.2096><frame.v.2097>Built at a time when apartment buildings were eclipsing single-family mansions , 810 West Franklin Street was the last single residence built on the 800 and 900 blocks of West Franklin Street.

Intellectual property rights allow the creation of state-backed monopolies , and the general tendency of monopolies , as Macaulay pointed out , is to make articles scarce , to make them dear , and to make them bad. Monopolies are an evil , but they must sometimes be accepted when they are necessary to the production of some good , some particular social goal. In this case , the evil is obviously going to be an increase in the price of databases and the legal ability to exclude competitors from their use that , after all , is the point of granting the new right. This right of exclusion may then have dynamic effects , hampering the ability of subsequent innovators to build on what went before. The good is that we are supposed to get lots of new databases , databases that we would not have had but for the existence of the database right . </frame.v.2100><frame.v.2101>As evidence of climate change becomes ever more compelling , struggles over who gets to frame its causes , effects and solutions are intensifying. In environmental and security circles , alarm is building over the prospect of ' climate refugees ' whose forced migration poses a potential threat to economic and political stability. The term ' climate refugee ' shares much in common with the problematic concept of ' environmental refugee ' so popular in the 1990s which served to naturalize the social inequalities at the root of environmental degradation , pathologize migration , and homogenize diverse populations. In the field of environmental security , ' environmental refugees ' were also viewed as a dangerous threat to national security. Today we are witnessing a similar phenomenon as a Pentagon report warns of starving waves of global warming refugees washing up on our shores and prominent environmentalists like Al Gore and Lester Brown use fear of ' climate refugees ' referring mainly to poor black people displaced by hurricane Katrina to drum up implicitly racialized alarm over global warming. This paper challenges the notion of ' climate refugees ' and addresses the need to develop other ways to view those who are placed at most risk by climate change due to pre-existing social and economic vulnerabilities . </frame.v.2101><frame.v.2102>Multiple span , straight column frames have interior columns.

Some have defined master frames as similar to paradigms in science.lxxx Others have said that master frames structure " the way in which its adherents process information coming from the environment and the manner in which they disseminate information to others. " lxxxi As a master frame , the War on Terror is composed of numerous themes; in turn , each of those themes is framed in a particular manner by both the President and the news media. Much research in framing suggests a single , pervasive frame that dominates a news story. The case study here contraindicates this , in part because the response of the news media was examined over a period of time , thereby allowing for a more nuanced look at the total response. Although the strength of frames has been examined in other studies , the idea of a frame being composed of themes -- each of which is individually framed -- has yet to be examined fully . </frame.v.2107><frame.v.2108>Our Legacy frames are constructed from 3 inch quartersawn oak stock and finished in our four step Signature process that provides a beautiful patina that will last for years to come.

Despite their emphasis on the analytical frame , these so-called scientific interpretations are also framed by a hermeneutical vision ( even if it is a secular one ) and by contextual concerns. And , as Gignac brilliantly demonstrates , these three interpretive frames are easily identified in the interpretations of non-Christian philosophers even though they view Romans as a Classic rather than as Scripture . </frame.v.2129><frame.v.2130>£ 14.99 - J L Baird print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - J L Baird print - POSTED £ 29.99 - J L Baird framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - J L Baird framed print - POSTED </frame.v.2130><frame.v.2131>rumpole !

You can see from the angled image above that the modified frame does not extend much more from the wall than it usually would if it had a still image inside. If you are wall mounting the frame you may also want to hide the unsightly power cable from view. If you have a timber framed home with a cavity in the walls the cable can be hidden within in the wall cavity with the aid of an electrician who should be able to advise you as to the best and safest method to do this.

As the ceiling paintings and the scenes these depict , movies are read as allegories as well. The paintings are still inanimate but full of a potential for movement , thus pointing towards the possibility of setting images in motion : they conjure up cinema. Their sceneries belong to a Baroque contemporary culture , to a past society and its institutions ( philosophy , law , medicine , art ) . As films recount tales of a world they emerge from , these paintings frame their society. They themselves are framed by ornamental structures , by conventions which separate the paintings from their architectural environment. The ornament as a frame , the scenes it contains thus are placed in analogy to the frame of a film. The ornament contains the urges and passions excluded from the paintings. If the ornament is removed , the passions are too . </frame.v.2137><frame.v.2138>Contributions of the various collaborators are synthesized in the final scene of On the Waterfront. The Kaufman camera continues to frame a blurred image of the waterfront site with special attention to the dingy floating shack where hoodlums bet on horses and dispense with human lives. Longshoremen line the pier overlooking Friendly 's headquarters; angry but unmoved they resemble an immense Greek frieze of noble figures incapable of action. The dockside fog , the burning trash cans , and the cold air which quickly converts each breath into mist all conspire , as the environment has throughout the film , to constrain longshoreman rage and to blur the connection between power and oppression. In such a setting , only personal rebellion is possible. When Pop casts the evil Johnny Friendly into the hellish water below , the act balances his son 's fall from the rooftop at the outset of the film. But Pop 's conversion to social rebel will require more than a single spontaneous act. Here Terry Malloy must act alone rather than as a proletarian hero , becauselike Norman Cousins ' liberalTerry has changed his mind " slowly , painfully , and by his own volition. " </frame.v.2138><frame.v.2139>Moreover , the group has framed the Israeli state as ' aggressive ' and ' expanding ' due to the frequent change of its borders.

Worse than all he had just described. Bidameh , a girl of about thirteen of whom Runakason was a bit fond was thrown down on the bank there when a soldier caught her running for the water. The man then unhooked his bayonet from his rifle while standing over her before plunging the knife into her chest. He worked the knife in his fist along her chest for a long six inches , opening her up. Runakason could see the brilliant white of her sternum , almost as one might see a bright orchid amid a nest of red roses arranged by an artist , as the man pulled it free and then cut loose her still beating heart which he held only for a moment before tossing that into the lake , to kill and kill again , leaving the young girl there to stare forever wide eyed at the improbable and open universe framed delicately by buckeye branches twirling their yellow seedpods in a moderate breeze . </frame.v.2140><frame.v.2141>frame - definition of frame by the Free Online Dictionary , Thesaurus ... frame ( fr m ) v. framed , fram ing , frames. v. tr. 1.

Mukherjee 's enormous contribution to our collective thinking about Indian writing has not been simply to have placed it at the top of the literary critics ' agenda at a time when British Literature still dominated academic circles. That would have been enough in itself. But she went further to so frame the field that we are all led to think of the extensive and delicate web of interrelated forces , factors , concerns , affiliations , allegiances , and world views that cohabit the literary imagination of recent writers.

The virtue of the MIP poll , however , is that the wording of the query has been consistent since 1935. Thus , the problem of varying query frames is somewhat allayed.

Typically posters include both textual and graphic elements , although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly textual. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and convey information. Posters may be used for many purposes , and they are a frequent tool of advertisers ( particularly of events , musicians and films ) , propagandists , protestors and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork , particularly famous works , and are generally low-cost compared to original artwork. Another type of poster are educational posters , which may be about a particular subject for educational purposes. Many people also collect posters , and some famous posters have themselves become quite valuable , collectors and vintage posters are usually framed and matted. Posters may be any size. ( definition provided by wikipedia ) </frame.v.2222><frame.v.2223>Some works by Beaux from the 1890s to the 1920s were framed in distinctive interpretations of seventeenth-century Northern European cabinet frames , with a flat plate profile overlaid with crossetted corners , gadrooned interior moldings , and outlining in both wave and ripple moldings. Although the most elaborate of these frames are actually of Flemish and German origin , they are more frequently called Dutch frames. A black or dark brown stain allows the grain of the oak carcass to show through as a subtle textural element , as there is no gesso layer. This type of frame was also available gilded overall , unlike its dark seventeenth-century models. The black Dutch frame is a daring choice in this period , when gilded frames still predominated. Dutch-style frames in black were also used at this time on Western nocturne scenes by Frederic Remington ( 1861 1909 ) , and polished fruitwood examples were often used by Dutch-inspired trompe l ' oeil still-life painters like William Michael Harnett ( 1848 1892 ) and John F.

She observes how they not only get away with operating in a sensitive area , but are even able effectively to press the government to strengthen laws and help educate China ' s court system to make judgements against abusive husbands. Keech-Marx shows how they are canny in understanding how to operate. As she notes , rather than pose themselves as independent of the government in a critical or oppositional fashion , they frame their activities and rhetoric in line with the government ' s own perceptions and rhetoric. Keech-Marx observes that in contrast to the premises of a civil society framework , Chinese popular organizations such as these do not fit into a strict segregation of state and non-state spheres . She argues that a useful perspective from which to analyze these organizations is provided by the ' social movement ' literature , which has explored how the most effective social movements have been able to adopt persuasive frames and rhetoric . </frame.v.2224><frame.v.2225>Poster frames tend to be at the lower end of the price bracket.

What do these debates tell us ? From the early days of intellectual property as we know it now , the main objections raised against it were framed in the language of free trade and anti-monopoly. In the United States , the founding generation of intellectuals had been nurtured on the philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment and the history of the struggle against royal monopolies. They saw the arguments in favor of intellectual property but warned again and again of the need to circumscribe both its term and its scope. This is the point at the heart of Jefferson ' s letter. This is why he insisted that we understand the policy implications of the differences between tangible property and ideas , which like fire are expansible over all space , without lessening their density in any point. </frame.v.2226><frame.v.2227>[ Pewee Valley Presbyterian Church ] ( A few steps lead to the main door of Pewee Valley Presbyterian Church in Pewee Valley.

The greater the number of factors that can be satisfied by the journalist ' s frame of an event , the more newsworthy it becomes.

This session aims to begin a more intentional , public conversation within the AAR about issues raised by these trends. Stories of several different types of adjunct experience will frame presentations of empirical data on faculty staffing patterns. A variety of resources , including a new statement by the American Association of University Professors , will be shared and discussed. Concerns about systematic injustice in the treatment of those laboring in what has been called the academic " sweatshop " will be articulated.

Bay lengths should be measured between upper faces of cross frames , and it is important to measure them on both sides of the building : all too often a surveyor assumes a building is square , when in fact it was designed and framed at irregular angles. Similarly it is important to check that the overall span of the building is constant. Many buildings taper , if only slightly , from one end to the other . </frame.v.2281><frame.v.2282>Garin was gloating , but it was hard to blame him. On the eve of what promises to be a historic debate over the direction of the nation 's highest court , Democrats on Capitol Hill seemed to have starkly reversed the dynamic of last fall 's election. Then , they had watched helplessly as George W. Bush and his strategists methodically twisted John Kerry into a hopeless tangle of contradictions and equivocations , using words and imagery to bend him into a shape that hardly resembled the war hero he had been. Now , Democrats believed , they had deciphered the hieroglyphics of modern political debate that had so eluded them in the campaign , and in doing so they had exacted some small measure of revenge. As one of the party 's senior Senate aides told me a few days after the filibuster compromise was reached , ''We framed them the way they framed Kerry .'' </frame.v.2282><frame.v.2283>A strong frame will actually reject facts that do n't fit the frame. The way that budget deficits have been framed is a good example. There are many very sound arguments suggesting that deficits can play a very positive role in managing an economy and smoothing out ups and downs in economic growth. But the notion that deficits are totally unacceptable with respect to government spending is so entrenched that it is the equivalent of the Teflon frame : all competing facts and arguments just bounce off it . </frame.v.2283><frame.v.2284>Our professional staff will reproduce , print , mount and frame your photos in a single stop operation.

In the 17th century , framed paintings were hung above eye-level , from the cornice and were often cantilevered from the wall so the viewer on the floor could seen them better. In the 18th century , there was a tendency to hang pictures in groups and often one picture would be hung beneath the other on a pair of chains. By the 19th century , hanging framed art became a little less rigid and pictures were hung in tiers by wire or cord. By the end of World War I , there was a clearing out of the Victorian and Edwardian clutter and fewer furnishings , and paintings , were seen in rooms . </frame.v.2285><frame.v.2286>The Metal Poster Frame offers an inexpensive , " custom framed " look !

This will be erected on site by a skilled craftsman and as such will take more time to build and be more expensive . </frame.v.2287><frame.v.2288>Matting , just like the frame is something used to aid in complimenting the contents of the frame as well as the frame itself. It can also act as a barrier to quiet or buffer the picture from the frame in the case of a picture that is really busy right up to the edge. As well the mat can also be used to better create a visionary pull of the eye to the center of the frame. Used properly a mat can impact a photo or picture within the frame greatly , but there needs to be a happy balance between the mat and the frame. Often , if the media being framed allows , a mat can be skipped by utilizing an extra wide frame. Or another idea is to replace a mat with a contrasting liner already built into the frame . </frame.v.2288><frame.v.2289>Referring to FIGS. 2 to 9 , there is shown a frame generally indicated by arrow 1.

They take on their meaning by being embedded in frames , themes which organize thoughts , rendering some facts as relevant and significant and others as irrelevant and trivial. Framing matters and the contest is lost at the outset if one allows one 's adversaries to define the terms of the debate. To be selfconscious about framing strategy is not being manipulative. It gives coherent meaning to what is happening in the world. One can either do it unconsciously , or with deliberation and conscious thought . </frame.v.2292><frame.v.2293>Being stripped of her diagnosis is a shock to Frame : schizophrenia , as a psychosis , had been an accomplishment , removing ordinary responsibility from the sufferer.

David Snow , Robert Benford , and William Gamson suggest that frames overlap and organise the values and beliefs of movement activists , and that individual people control frame production. These scholars express sympathy with many social movements challenging established orthodoxies , and link ( in my view , inappropriately ) their theories of framing with practical advise for activists. Consequently , they ( especially Gamson ) suggest that , in counting the appearance of frames used by social movements in relation to frames used by other parties to a policy dispute in media texts , the researcher or activist gains one measure of the influence or success of a particular movement . </frame.v.2300><frame.v.2301>The scuttle is framed in the same way as a floor opening.

Since you do n't need anything fancy this should be well under $ 100. Then just buy two pieces of quality , archival matte board and take it somewhere with your artwork and have them cut a window matte. They should be able to do this while you wait , at the art store I used to frequent it was like $ 5 to have a window cut. Insert matted artwork into frame and viola , you just saved yourself several hundred bucks . </frame.v.2302><frame.v.2303>" I 've had the privilege to work with the House of Heydenryk for over 15 years.

But those who survive the challenges of boot camp are said to be ready to fight and have a brotherhood that can not be broken , even beyond death. The movie 's personal side is revealed by a combination of conversations between the men and one of the characters who will occasionally tell us his mind , as background ( Joker ) . The latter is another device that journalists use to gain interest and make the public feel psychologically closer to the story according to Pan and Kosicki.

Consequently , this society to garner its position of power , takes onto itself the mammoth sense of generosity to either ' grant ' or ' dispel ' the need to let its prisoners-0f-wars a chance to compete with itself. When it finds , as in areas of agriculture that the lower class people can not stake claim to superiority in face of industrial society , it makes no issues. When it finds , as in areas of primary education or adult education , where the lower class can learn how to get empowered , ( but in reality are never so its like knowing how to draw rockets does not land one in the moon one needs to be part of a multi-billion dollar industry for that actualization ) , there is no problem either.

The overlapping of figures is carefully avoided. Rogier paints an image of Christ , radiant and facing full front , which almost resembles an icon , while the figures to the side are set back from him. John , who is actually leaning to one side like the risen Christ in the right-hand panel of the Miraflores Altarpiece , appears much less three-dimensional than that figure , and his limbs are entirely two-dimensional.

The vertical mounting is ideal for individual artists , but the guitar neck can also be mounted horizontally , and this makes the frame ideal for band photos or posters.

Smaller images can be framed by surrounding the photo with a mat inside the frame . </frame.v.2317><frame.v.2318>But there is a further problem that arises from a careful reading of these two reports. Poverty is framed in the media and understood in public opinion as internal to the person. Moreover , as George Lakoff suggests ( Moral Politics , University of Chicago Press , 1996 ) , that personal failure is likely to be judged as moral in nature - the result of moral weakness , like lack of discipline , etc. At this point , the problem definition drives even further away from policy solutions. The only relevant solution is to fix the person. And the most appropriate antidote to moral weakness , at least in the American lexicon , is work. Here we see how welfare reform becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy : it is not necessary for welfare reform to remove the individual from the condition of poverty in order to be deemed successful , but rather it is only necessary for it to prescribe work as the corrective for moral weakness. It only needs to " fix " character , not condition , since the problem has been defined as such . </frame.v.2318><frame.v.2319>Opinions in four states have recently upheld their bans on same-sex marriage : Hernandez v.

Cox first argues that the reference by both sides to " same-sex marriage " appears to be asking for a new fundamental right , one that is easier for opponents to dismiss than if the case were framed as a denial of a fundamental right to marry. She then looks at the dissenting opinions in these four cases , showing how it is these that " best protect marriage and [ how it is that ] the dissenting justices [ ' understanding of marriage ] best explains why individuals in same-sex couples seek the right to choose it for ourselves.

This last point was the only factor that determined my sources. Of course , anyone interested in frames needs to take into account the Deconstructionist approach to the phenomenon , and naturally the attention given here to the literal and conceptual periphery of Byzantine art reveals my awareness of these ideas. But the chapters in this study follow different art-historical methods appropriate to the questions that framing raises. The first chapter relies largely on iconographic analysis to unlock the relationship between viewer and object. Where textual analysis was the means to understand the visual experience , as in the second chapter , the image withdraws for some time and then emerges contextualized in a manuscript culture. Formal analysis unites the method of the final three chapters . </frame.v.2328><frame.v.2329>Three-storey steel framed structure with precast unit floors.

But at this moment the gaudy door swung open , and there stood proudly framed in the doorway , old Lyd Partington.

The language of section 409 ( a ) that the Ninth Circuit wrenched out of its context of plan-only relief ( " such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate " ) closely resembles the language of section 502 ( a ) ( 3 ) , authorizing " other appropriate equitable relief ... to redress ... violations ... . " Russell had the effect of predisposing the Court in Mertens and Great-West to disapprove relief for consequential injury under 502 ( a ) ( 3 ) , even though the holding in Russell rejected the plaintiff 's claim for such relief on account of its inconsistency with the plan-only remedial objective of section 502 ( a ) ( 2 ) , the provision under which she mistakenly framed it . </frame.v.2345><frame.v.2346>what unity of the south is he talking about when he lectures hatred framed from lies.

As humans evolved so too did their buildings. The Chinese and the Japanese were past masters at using timber with the Chinese developing sophisticated modular timber building systems over 1 , 000 years ago.

Students continue to conduct background research on the various case subjects and go off to interview practitioners. The interviewing process depends entirely upon to what extent the case issues and context can be captured by outside sources and other means of communication with practitioners , such as email. In the past the interviewing process has been as short as a single day , such as a day trip to New York to visit a company , or has lasted as long as three months , such as visiting companies , NGOs and academic researchers in South Africa. The goal of the initial visit to the sites is to come away with the main issues framed for a case.

But I digress. This is a frame house with half of it below ground in front , but framed in back , which faces the forest. The forest , itself , is a maze of downed pine trees blown over by the wind , interspersed with small saplings , vines and low brush.

After the inquiry , the charge is prepared and after the formulation of the charge , trial of the accused starts.

It sets out the offence that was allegedly committed . </frame.v.2368><frame.v.2369>[ ... ] you can practise the technique -- the Dogma technique or the idiot technique -- from now to kingdom come without anything coming out of it unless you have a profound , passionate desire and need to do so. Karen discovers that she needs the technique and therefore it changes her life. Idiocy is like hypnosis or ejaculation : if you want it , you ca n't have it , and if you do n't want it , you can. ( 8 ) A successful performance depends on the unforced will of an authorially framed subject and not on the author himself. The programmatic , indeed almost Old Testamentary restriction against crediting the director in Dogma movies pays tribute to this principle : divinity expresses itself neither in an authorial dictate , nor in personal will , nor in pure ritual , but rather in the fortuitous convergence of all three. In spite of very different religious sources ( theism in American Beauty , Buddhism in Pelevin , Judaism in Ulitskaia , cult in The Idiots ) all performatistic authors share an identical cultural-theological perspective : namely that Godliness is everywhere where wholes are created by individual subjects.

Mass media not only use framing to restrict acceptable public discourse within certain boundaries , but also to help citizens understand and perceive how that discourse functions within a broader story , event , or sociopolitical context.

Within the framework of the newly renovated building the banal messages scribbled on the walls by real people no longer have a semantic meaning; instead , they represent the violent intrusion of a history borne by human subjects into the massive , static space of German state power. ( 11 ) The graffiti on the Reichstag walls are not citations , they are real; rather than producing a nostalgic , simulatory effect , they demonstrate the materiality , subjectivity and fracturedness of history within a holistic , intentionally constructed framework. Precisely this perfomative , authorial framing of historical statements enables their renewal and keeps them from being degraded to mere quotes. On the other hand , though , performatism does not return to authenticity. The force of the original signs asserts itself only after they have been framed in another medium which is necessarily always artificial.

Clearly interpretations have always had their practical uses. Their ' instrumental ' potential , whether in defining government policies or in ethical framing , could also help to close down the elaboration of alternatives. While the Melbourne Model as one example of projected reforms of higher education does suggest that broadly conceived undergraduate courses will frame postgraduate specialisations , there are noticeable omissions in its overall conception. No doubt it is still a model that will undergo further development , but at least at this stage there have been no clear signs of a collegial framework wherein the overall significance of open-ended growth is to be discussed. That absence is confirmed by the way the contribution of the technosciences to that growth process is envisaged. As the accompanying boxed digest of the approach to ' knowledge transfer ' conveys them , the assumptions that underpin the Melbourne Model tend to foreclose the consideration of alternatives . </frame.v.2395><frame.v.2396>We have a state of the art production facility that can handle any commercial framing need.

Every time we used the term VOLUNTARY Student Unionism we were arguing against ourselves and kicking our own goals.

It was , in large part , the orchestrated public outcry by patriotic country music fans that spawned an organized boycott of the Dixie Chicks ' music largely based on the media ' s reinforcement of dominant political assumptions and the way the Dixie Chicks were framed as disruptive to the social order that contributed to the severity and longevity of the public outcry . </frame.v.2401><frame.v.2402>Frames scale well.

By 1923 they had established the building and contracting firm Vandyke Brothers and by 1926 had published their first catalogue of standard brick home designs. During the years of the economic Depression in the 1930s business slowed and Christopher Vandyke took the opportunity to develop his ideas for a standard home. In 1936 he patented a system of prefabrication known as the 'Sectionit'. It comprised of timber framed sandwich panels lined with asbestos cement sheets ( fibro ) . The panels came to site as plain sheets or with windows and doors already assembled within. The prototype was displayed at the Sydney Royal Easter Show and the 1937 Sectionit catalogue quoted costs at 168-499 pounds. The sections were keyed together with patented Tongue and Groove and the windows were frameless , with glazing placed in pre-grooved slots. The efficiency achieved by using a standard design provided a cheaper home . </frame.v.2408><frame.v.2409>H. Sign Frames.

But that is not the case. In fact , O'Reilly is using this column to frame Obama in the same violent logic that he used to frame George Soros in Culture Warrior. The link seems tenuous at first. Obama does not criticize war critics , O'Reilly claims , because Obama secretly shares the same vision as the " far-left. " As evidence , O'Reilly points to the fundraising of MoveOn.org on behalf of the Obama campaign. And MoveOn is a problem -- according to O'Reilly -- because this is one of the organizations , critical of Bush 's policies , that has been on the receiving end of money funneled by -- you guessed it -- George Soros . </frame.v.2426><frame.v.2427>Obviously these acts of knowing that draw on non-visual metaphors have different , and usually lower social status than the objective knowledge of the seen. In any official context , or in any claim for the authority mentioned above , it is visual , ' objective ' knowledge which holds sway. For this reason it is not surprising that when we wish to imply that our ideas should be treated as authoritative we tend to use visual metaphors to frame those ideas. Any politician who argued that his opponents ideas were invalid because they were ' not to his taste ' would get short shrift from those who argued that the truth of such ideas ' could easily be seen ' . </frame.v.2427><frame.v.2428>Steel plates called " clips " provide the connection points for framing components. Even a small building may use 100 or more clips. Many companies supply only loose clips that must be bolted onto the components before erection can begin. In the best of circumstances , this requires several hours ' work. If clips are missing , your job can be held up for days.

While I keep Frame Analysis close by my bedside for its endlessly interesting snapshots of reality , Goffman ' s essential contribution was in explaining how to deal with dominant discursive and phenomenological frames. A strong frame , he argued , can rarely if ever be refuted not by seemingly contradictory facts and not by logic. This is because responses to a carefully framed political discourse end up strengthening the authority of the language that defined the issue in the first place. In order to avoid being caught within a political opponent ' s language , the issue must be reframed anew. New political strategies require new rhetoric . </frame.v.2429><frame.v.2430>Legibility of the offering. Courts present conclusions about how the constitution applies to the facts of the case at hand , along with an explanation -- typically obscure to the nonspecialist -- cast in terms of legal doctrine and precedent.281 The priority-setting counterpart , by contrast , offers an account of why the problem at hand matters -- why it deserves the public 's attention -- and some ideas about how the problem might be remedied. Because the counterpart 's claim to authority , if any , is persuasive rather than legal , the body 's offering is more likely to be framed in terms that are intelligible to average citizens , and more likely to be developed through a process of public consultation.282 </frame.v.2430><frame.v.2431>The carved shell cameo depicts a female profile , complete with a delicate diamond solitaire necklace , framed by a twisted 14k gold coil.

Frames are available in a wide variety of shapes , sizes and colors. The frame that you choose for your artwork reflects your own personal style and taste. You could frame your artwork in a simple basic metal frame or choose a more ornate carved wood frame. When purchasing custom framed artworks special car should be taken to specify all details including frame style , color , size and shape as well as color of the mount and the kind of glazing to be used such as polymer glazing or glass glazing. Original artworks should ideally be framed using archival quality materials to retain their authenticity.

While pictures in commercial galleries and museums are separate and isolated from everyday life , framing pictures for the home affords the opportunity to treat them as accents in a unified and harmonious decorative scheme , integral to and enhancing with meaning the daily life of the home. To this end , our work bucks the trends of conventional framing which tends variously to showiness and pretentiousness ( the frame as packaging to sell the picture ) , the indifferent affect of gallery treatments ( thin , square frame profiles and white mats ) , or the designer custom frame shop ' s clever multi-colored matting and elaborate ( but poorly made ) constructs from mass-produced molding. Instead , the Studio has returned to a more grounded , basic approach that relies on the simple and direct presentation of pictures in thoughtfully designed , well-crafted hardwood frames.

Historical evidence suggests that given a good foundation and careful protection from the elements , a timber frame will last indefinitely. There are hundreds of timber framed structures in Europe and Japan that are approaching 1 , 000 years of age. There is no evidence to suggest that modern timber frames , when designed with respect for the joinery and techniques of the ancient frames , should expect a shorter life span. They are truly built for generations of use . </frame.v.2441><frame.v.2442>5. For first of all he framed in it formless matter , as a substance capable of receiving all forms.

Again , by means of the number three , he framed a body compounded of matter and form , and presenting the three dimensions of breadth , and length , and depth. Then , from the doubling of the number two , he devised the quaternion of the elements , earth , water , air , and fire , and ordained them to be everlasting sources for the supply of this universe. Again , the number four produces the number ten. For the aggregate of one , and two , and three , and four , is ten.

The frame has to echo the subject and convey the essence of the subject , the spirit.

Agenda-extension allows for the examination of any differences in the framing of the same issue; using an agenda-extension perspective allows the researcher to comparatively analyze news content for bias. For example , in the 2004 elections , were President Bush 's themes positively or negatively framed when compared to the themes expressed by Senator John Kerry ? For a good example of using agenda-setting to determine coverage of candidates issues see , Russell J. Dalton , Paul Allen Beck , Robert Huckfeldt , and William Koetzle , " A Test of Media-Centered Agenda Setting : Newspaper Content and Public Interests in a Presidential Election , " Political Communication 15 ( 1998 ) : 463-481. Of note is that these researchers found that no bias was seen in the papers covered simply because the papers covered the issues brought up by the candidates. This otherwise well constructed study shows a limitation of agenda-setting research. Using an agenda-extension perspective , one moves beyond frequency of reporting to examine the manner in which the papers reported the issues -- thus one may look for bias . </frame.v.2454><frame.v.2455>Frame your funniest family picture in this hilarious frame that shows everyone that you ' re anything but normal !

Bubbles will always be burst by the Truth. But we have to be careful , I think , in the way we frame the profession to the incoming professoriate.

The first were built out of necessity in the late 1400s. When the first colonists arrived , they had to work with what was available. Larger and plentiful trees , as well as the colonists ' own ship 's hull structures , were used for timber framing , carrying over the traditions they knew in Europe. In earlier times , timber framed buildings were crafted as cherished lifelong possessions. Earlier cultures viewed their buildings as heirlooms that could be passed down through generations. When the Industrial Revolution arrived , ways were adapted to do things faster and cheaper. Everything became more processed to fit quickly and generically wherever , built by anyone , and for anyone 's financial means.

In the absence of a clear meaning of the word frame , these writings can not specifically explain how the concept of framing relates to the concept of gender. Even if we were to accept that such a relationship exists , these writings can not resolve the question of whether biological features of human females and males cause them to frame the world differently , whether the social construction of separate genders in any given culture spawns gendered frames , or whether biological and cultural factors both contribute to a gendered dimension of framing. Scholars like Goffman and Berger give little consideration to how frames develop in the first place. Minister mentions the question of origin , but only with the passing comment that frames , as 'communication forms themselves conserve the values of their originators ' ( Minister , 1991 : p. 28 ) , and thus impede efforts to reconstruct gender roles. This comment , however , gives no insight into the processes by which originators generate frames , or , indeed , to the questions of who can produce frames , what conditions permit frame production , and what constraints influence that production . </frame.v.2490><frame.v.2491>Anyone tired of showing off their pictures on a tiny two-inch camera screen you ' ve got hundreds , maybe thousands , of the greatest pictures on earth sitting in that little digital box.

This other filling was often referred to as nogging and typically took the form of wattle-and-daub. Split branches or slats were woven together between vertical stakes creating a lattice ( wattle ) that was traditionally covered with a plaster-like material made of some combination of dirt , clay , sand , animal hair and animal dung and straw ( daub ) ( Photograph 3 ) . This technology pre-dates the Greeks and Egyptians. Daubers were the folks who plastered the outside of wood framed buildings.5 The ingredients yield the classic combination of binders , aggregates and reinforcement combinations that today form the basis of modern stucco.6 Wattle-and-daub panels that infilled exposed timber frames gave us the classic Tudor look - lime plaster ( white ) coatings between tar coated ( black ) timbers ( Photograph 4 ) . </frame.v.2495><frame.v.2496>In general natural walls such as cob and rammed earth will need to be built thicker to achieve the same heat insulation and strength of man made materials.

In particular , we see within the theme of the nature of the war the news media framing a negative point of view about the actions of the administration.

That harm needs to be relieved , and when that happens , the people responsible for making the pain go away are hailed as conquering heroes.

Panels of the framed panels are preferably shatterproof plastic material that includes predetermined polycarbonate. Frames of the framed panels have strengths in proportion to thicknesses for predetermined storm protection by predetermined areas of the storm shield. The storm shield is a predetermined portion of a building orifice which can include a door or a window. The predetermined resistance to storm pressure and to stormdebris impact of the panels is about an equivalent to a commercial grade of polycarbonate having a thickness of one-eighth of an inch and being rectangular with less than twenty-five percent deviation from being square. Strengths of the frames are predetermined by capacity to contain the panels in positions of resistance to the predetermined resistance to the storm pressure and the storm-debris impact . </frame.v.2513><frame.v.2514>Palin 's speech was much more than an international introduction to McCain 's surprise running mate.

Numerous studies argue that news media inadequately critiqued the President 's framing of the War on Terror following 9/11. However , the findings of our study strongly suggest that eight weeks after 9/11 the mainstream news moved beyond reporting about political opposition to the President 's initiatives and moved toward generating its own opposition. We demonstrate in this essay that , by the end of formal military operations in Afghanistan , the mainstream American news media was framing its reports in such a way that President Bush 's public statements were inaccurately transmitted to the America public. To accomplish our goal , we perform a comparative framing analysis of President Bush 's speech to the United Nations and the news media response that followed. This essay proceeds in four sections : first , we provide a brief overview of how frames work; second , we discuss the relationship of frames to the news media; third , we compare the frames of President Bush and the news media; fourth , we present a discussion of our findings . </frame.v.2519><frame.v.2520>Each sturdy wooden frame is constructed of exterior grade wood and rough cedar framing resulting in a perfect way to feature your house number tiles.

Materials such as paper , glass , foamboard , tapes , wood frames , and metals each expand and contract at different rates when they heat or cool.

Bush also linked testing with many other issues in the bill so that someone would not be able to oppose testing without also opposing increased money for disadvantaged students and other programs aiming to improve school quality overall. This valence framing and linking of issues by Bush made it very difficult for Congress people to vote down NCLB without appearing to be against improving the quality of public education. Using African-American Secretary of Education Rod Paige to promote NCLB had a large positive impact on making NCLB symbolize helping at-risk and minority students . </frame.v.2534><frame.v.2535>In 1986 Novick approached New Haven ' s mayor , former Police Chief Biagio DiLieto , with concerns about the epidemic.

It represents an important use of global media to decentralize power and shift the loci of influence away from government and military agendas. But in other ways , new war coverage in cyberspace may have crucially underwritten new imperial opportunities for Western states. By contributing to the framing of contemporary war as a pathology of under-development , new war coverage in cyberspace has allowed Western governments to engage with wars in significantly different ways , most notably through humanitarian interventionist warfare and subsequent peace building and state building. Globalized initiatives , such as the 2005 Live-8 music concerts , act to responsibilize this under-development and the conflict arising from it , encouraging the Western public to demand political action from their own states ( and the international community ) , to mitigate conflict and address looming humanitarian disasters. When war is framed as a consequence of poverty , under-development , and ethnic barbarism , Western engagement by necessity centers on humanitarian interventions that are perceived as legitimate and morally necessary . </frame.v.2540><frame.v.2541>When the doors crashed open behind her , Katherine jerked her fingers from the beloved keys and folded them in her lap.

Cargo hold 3 could also be used as a water ballast ( deep ) tank. The hull was subdivided by seven transverse watertight bulkheads , together with an inner bottom watertight tank top , which extended fore and aft throughout the cargo holds and the engine room. The main deck , upper wing tanks , inner bottom and bottom shell plating were framed longitudinally in way of the cargo holds. The single side shell plating in way of the cargo holds and upper wing ballast tanks was framed transversely . </frame.v.2547><frame.v.2548>A secondary frame at 600mm centres is supported on the ceiling and first floor beams of the longitudinal frame. This frame is constructed of three laminated pieces of 18mm hardwood , with opposed grains for reduced warping. The members are framed as rectangular portals with rigid bridge joints at the corners. These portals form a cage for all of the first floor spaces , and give lateral bracing to the structure. Further bracing is achieved with a series of lateral steel cross braces , and horizontal steel cross braces within the major frame . </frame.v.2548><frame.v.2549>I have now considered two pairs of newspaper articles on the Exclusive Brethren , discussed through the analytical tools of framing and discourse analysis. There are a great number of similarities and few differences. In both Australia and New Zealand the stories are framed in similar ways , with the strange beliefs and practices of the Brethren being prominent. They are made out to be sinister for these reasons , but also for their wealth and willingness to use it to influence politics to suit their fundamentalist agenda. That the Exclusive Brethren are sinister and a problem to be solved is also seen through discourse analysis on articles originating from both sides of the Tasman. A subtle difference is that in New Zealand the coverage is more closely tied with political parties , with the Exclusive Brethren being more of a problem for major political parties than the political system or society in general. It is the task of the next section to provide some theoretically-informed comment on why these differences and similarities exist . </frame.v.2549><frame.v.2550>Another hybrid technique is to include trusses in the design that are supported by SIPS or stick framed walls.

This paper suggests avenues for such theory building and areas for empirical research , particularly in the less explored domain of the impact of blogs and blog readers/comment threads as frame sponsors. Further , given the complex , nebulous relationships between traditional media and new media ( blogs ) , this paper focuses on the framing and re-framing dynamics between these key frame-setters. Reaching back into the work of some significant framing theorists , this paper suggests new pathways to study framing by blogs as narrative texts , schematized indicators and , indeed , a reinforcement of the frames of traditional media . </frame.v.2554><frame.v.2555>No matter who wins this year 's election , the prevalence of the " ordinary American " voter story should be a useful wakeup call : It 's time to do something similar on a much broader scale.

The system is a subsystem of a general automatic cinematography system that can also automatically control the lighting equipment used to light the user. The system can also be used with the automatic direction system to elicit actions from the user that may enable him or her to accommodate to the cinematographic recording equipment. In the video domain , this may entail eliciting the user to move forward or backward , to the right or left , or to step on a riser in order to be framed properly by the camera. In the audio domain , this may entail eliciting the user to speak louder or softer . </frame.v.2556><frame.v.2557>In essence , all that is needed to properly frame a painting is an understanding of the type of frame and covering needed and a frame that matches the size of your painting. When the painting is properly inserted into the frame , simply clip or secure the canvas stretcher or painting sides to the frame. For most frames , there is a simple paper backing that will cover the rear of the painting , which serves to protect the canvas from the accumulation of dust. A wire hanger will likely be attached to the back of the frame to allow for easy wall display . </frame.v.2557><frame.v.2558>This is the first clear statement of the Galilean relativity principle. It implied that the dispute between the heliocentric and geocentric views of the universe was mistakenly framed : the proper question about the system of the world was not which body is at rest in the center ? but where is the center of gravity of the system , and which body is closest to it ? For in a system of orbiting bodies , only their common center of gravity will be unaccelerated , and by Corollary V , the motions of the bodies in the system will be the same , whether its center of gravity is at rest or in uniform rectilinear motion. The system is indeed approximately Keplerian , since the sun has by far the greatest mass and is therefore little disturbed from the center of gravity , which is therefore very close to the common focus of the approximately Keplerian ellipses in which the planets orbit the sun. But by Corollary V , the nearly-Keplerian structure of the system is completely independent of the system 's state of motion in absolute space . </frame.v.2558><frame.v.2559>While one of the wings of the home is constructed more conventionally , the main support of the timber framed portion of the structure depends on the strength of the plate-and-rafter roof system.

Marcello was furious at the Kennedys because of their anti-Mafia campaign. Prior to the assassination , witnesses heard Marcello make threatening remarks against President Kennedy. In September 1962 , an FBI informant heard Marcello remark that if he had Kennedy killed , he would frame an individual not connected to the Marcello organization so the police would immediately apprehend this person for the murder ( 28 : 121-123 ) . Marcello added that he had already thought of a way to frame a " nut " to take the blame ( 28 : 122 ) . Furthermore , in the weeks leading up to the President 's murder , Marcello met often with David Ferrie. During this same period , Marcello lieutenants were in contact with Jack Ruby. It is worth noting that Marcello had supported the CIA 's anti-Castro efforts . </frame.v.2561><frame.v.2562>Merry Christmas.

This allows the pastel to look less like a print or poster , which commonly have a wide surrounding border. These works are attracting the attention of the canvas-buying public. Commonly , oil and acrylic paintings are displayed with a wider wood frame that may or may not have a small liner. A pastel presented in a similar fashion demands the same respect often afforded these canvas media. This is especially true when anti- or low-reflection glazing is utilized , like Tru Vue brand AR and Museum Glass. Many prominent galleries are encouraging this presentation and most national pastel exhibitions are seeing entries framed in this manner . </frame.v.2566><frame.v.2567>But that despised colonial period contains all our beginnings; and not only our beginnings , but a large part of our maturity; for at the time the Constitution was framed , in 1787 , our people had had a vast experience in constitution-making , greater and more varied , I am inclined to think , than any other people of the world. They had been living under charters from the Crown , constitutions of their own making , and some of them without either charters or constitutions , for nearly two centuries , and during the Revolution they had nearly all made new constitutions , under which they had been living for ten or more years . </frame.v.2567><frame.v.2568>Scratch Resistance  " Glass is very scratch resistant so it requires no special care.

Over half of German women use the women/gender frame , either alone ( 51 ) or in combination with the individual/gender frame. Although German men are only about half as likely to frame in gender terms alone ( 25 ) as German women are , they are still more likely to be using the gender frame only than American women are ( 20 ) . American pro-choice speakers , in contrast , all strongly prefer the individual/state frame to the gendered one. Even American women , who are twice as likely as American men ( 20 vs. 10 ) to use just a gender-based argument , are still more likely to offer only an individual rights argument ( 32 ) than only the gender-based one ( 20 ) . American men are more than three times as likely to use just the individual rights framing than just a gender-based claim ( 45 vs. 10 ) , while German men actually offer the gender-based framing alone slightly more often than just the individual-rights one ( 25 vs. 18 ) . </frame.v.2570><frame.v.2571>For the most part , we have been letting conservatives frame the debate. Conservatives are taking the initiative on policy making and getting their ideas out to the public. When progressives react , we echo the conservative frames and values , so our message is not heard or , even worse , reinforces their ideas. Progressives need a collection of proactive policies and communication techniques to get our own values out on our own terms. " War rooms " and " truth squads " must change frames , not reinforce conservative frames. But even then , they are not nearly enough.

When the performance of the whole wall system is considered , SIPs perform better than traditional systems because they are manufactured in a controlled environment characterized by uniform fabrication of components without gaps or air pockets. They are also designed for efficient field installation that reduces air infiltration , and there are few thermal breaks or penetrations in the panels that are typical of wood frame construction . </frame.v.2577><frame.v.2578>For pieces to be framed under glass , except for the most disposable and inexpensive posters or temporary displays , the glass must be raised off the surface of the paper.

Cintas. It is on a stele from the second level , where offerings were deposited from the end of the fifth century to the beginning of the third. As with most of its neighbours , the back of the stele is carefully shaped and finished with a bevel on the upper Portion. The decorated face shows a cult scene above an altar with an Egyptian gorge now obliterated. The holy place is the simplest of miniature temple facades , with two pilasters topped by a molded lintel. on which can be discerned the much worn design of a winged solar disc flanked by two uraei. This motif is framed by; a series of little slanting lines , which gradually take a curving path to the right. The right side of the temple is edged with cross-hatching , which can be paralleled in the trellising on tombs , or which is perhaps , in the convention of the stone-cutters , simply an indication of detail or decoration impossible to depict in full ( Ph. 134 ) . </frame.v.2583><frame.v.2584>Lugged bicycle frame construction goes all the way back to the early days of steel framed bicycles.

In his writing , at least , he explains framing in a way that is more intellectually complex than his critics have admitted. His essential insight into politics -- that voters make their decisions based on larger frames rather than on the sum of a candidate 's positions -- is hard to refute. And Lakoff does say in ''Do n't Think of an Elephant ! '' albeit very briefly , that Democrats need not just new language but also new thought; he told me the party suffers from ''hypocognition , '' or a lack of ideas. What 's more , when it comes to the language itself , Lakoff has repeatedly written that the process of reframing American political thought will take years , if not decades , to achieve. He does not suggest in his writing that a few catchy slogans can turn the political order on its head by the next election . </frame.v.2588><frame.v.2589>No Framing.

Invisible to the participants depicted , the blood parenthesizes the scene , as it is vividly represented for the viewer ' s interpretation of the central scene. And because parentheses frame and set off , the blood , invading the represented space of the iconoclasts on the page , belongs to the page and to the interpreting space of the viewer.

He had been ahead of the curve on climate change , while Harper had long expressed doubts about whether the issue was even real.

If frames are the underlying structures of belief , perception , and appreciation ( p. 23 ) , then when individuals or groups frame the same problem differently , agreement on acceptable actions will be particularly difficult to reach. Comparing the frames that individuals or groups use for a problem can provide invaluable insights into the reasons for different decisions. Indeed , frame analysis and its variants have been applied to problems in a wide range of disciplines ( Benford &amp;Snow , 2000 ) . However , that frames are rarely explicit makes the comparison of frames among individuals or groups especially difficult. Often , frames must be inferred from what individuals or groups say about their beliefs and perceptions or , when that fails , inferred from their decisions . </frame.v.2614><frame.v.2615>For a memorable gift , have each guest bring a flower to give to the bride.

According to the former secretary-general Abbas Mussawi , Hizballah is not a ' party in the traditional sense of the term. Every Muslim is automatically a member of Hizballah , thus it is impossible to list our membership ' ( al-Musawi , 1985 ) . The very adoption of the name Hizballah derived from the Quranic verse 56 ' And whosoever taketh Allah and His messenger and those who believe for friends ( will know that ) , lo ! the party of Allah , they are the victorious ' ( Qassem , 2005 : 76 ) . In Shia theology , indeed , there are two parties : the Party of God ( Hizballah ) and the Party of Satan ( Hizbu ' shaytan ) . Thus , Hizballah is more than just a party; it represents God on earth. Its emblem portrays a hand holding a Kalashnikov , which is a revolutionary ' s weapon , against a background of a globe with the above-mentioned verse from the Quran.

The animator specifies key images by using key framed values to set the boundary conditions of the movement. Then the animator specifies to the rendering engine , his/her assistant , how many frames to use for in between images and how closely to space those in between images relative to each other. If this sounds a bit complicated , complex and technical that ' s because it is. When you are doing key framed animation you are essentially programming the actions of the software ' s rendering engine. In Toon Boom Studio , you aren ' t writing code to program the render engine ( in Flash that is called Action Script ) but rather you are using scene planning tools and keyed frames and function curves.

Professor Sue Mangold described current federal and state child welfare laws that allowed the state of Texas to remove over 460 children from their Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) families because suspected abuse. Although some states have sought to keep children in families while investigations of abuse are ongoing , Texas has been one of a few states in recent years that have increased their rates of removal of children from their homes.

A typical example for valence framing is the description of a behavioral choice in terms of risk or gains ( Kahneman &amp;Tversky , 1979 ) : An option that is framed in terms of 75 chance of a gain will be preferred over a situation is termed in a 25 chance of a loss of the same size , even though both situation are identical.

Dan Pfeiffer , writing on the White House blog , posted an article called Still Not a 'Government Takeover ' , which activates the conservative idea of a government takeover and hence reinforces the idea. Every time a liberal goes over a conservative proposal giving evidence negating conservative ideas one by one , he or she is activating the conservative ideas in the brains of his audience.

In it , Vice President Gore attempted to articulate a norms-based foreign policy vision , but he lacked the necessary language and the understanding of how language works to do so. And the lack of language reflected an underlying lack of clarity about the nature of the vision itself. It was not deeply grounded in a clear and compelling model of the underlying logic. It had not been fully and coherently framed in Gore 's mind . </frame.v.2644><frame.v.2645>Systemic arrangements and networks create roles and role responsibilities , rights , and opportunities that affect individuals and individual activities and performance. What is less obvious is that one can take a single organization or a single individual functioning within that organization or system and apply different systems matrices to that organization with differing outcomes. What subsystems and individuals functioning within these systems focus on and the ways values and stakeholders are prioritized affect the goals , procedures , and outcomes of the system or subsystem in question. On every level , the way we frame the goals , the procedures , and what networks we take into account makes a difference in what we discover and what we neglect. These framing mechanisms will turn out to be important normative influences on systems and systems thinking , and thus on how we think about distributing or redistributing oral health care access . </frame.v.2645><frame.v.2646>Give a picture you ' re particularly proud of the attention it deserves by getting it framed for all to see.

Here , any one action is on one hand selecting its course due to distinctions being drawn , while on the other being watched by second-order observers who call contingent , i.e. ambivalent , arbitrary , and discretionary , what the first-order observer ( the actor ) thinks just evident or necessary. At the same time the second-order observer turns the actor into a second-order observer of his or her own who has to observe how he or she is observed by others in order to be able to deal with the chances and restrictions of the continuation of action , or of a change of direction , coming with that observation. Here , the contingency and thus indeterminacy stems from the second-order observer watching not only the distinction drawn by the actor but also the form , in the sense of Spencer-Brown 's calculus of indications , of that distinction , thereby discovering , and making to bear on the situation , both the contingent selection of it and the unmarked state coming with it . </frame.v.2649><frame.v.2650>Magazine article from : Telecommunications ( International Edition ) Secker , Matthew September 1 , 2002 700+ words Frame relay is one of the few network services ... an overall downturn in networking.

The nails allowed us to get rid of complex joinery no more mortise and tenon and allow relatively unskilled folks to nail together mass produced small sticks ( 2x4 ' s and 2x6 ' s and 2x8 ' s ) spaced closely together in a light frame. All this gets us balloon framing. Balloon framing using dimensional lumber and manufactured nails was so revolutionary that a balloon framed Illinois cottage was displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1867 as a display of American technological prowess.8 Site built stick framing proved to be so fast and so efficient that it dominates residential wood-frame construction worldwide to this day. The only significant changes since have been better tools ( skill saws , nail guns ) and platform framing which we got in the 1950 ' s. Oh , some of the exterior and interior linings have changed and we did begin to fill the cavities inherent in frame construction , but the fundamental structural system of walls has not changed much over the past 150 years. It ' s those linings and cavity fills that we are going to look at more closely . </frame.v.2655><frame.v.2656>In many respects Sangster 's analysis has moved distinctly into the realm of gender history , but one that measures the structured discourses within various institutional loci , namely the family , the workplace , and the union , against the sense of self-identity that ordinary workers had created for themselves as means to survive. One trajectory of this new gender perspective has been influenced by discourse analysis in so far as it interprets class and gender as unstable categories constantly redefined and renegotiated , and thus framed within historically specific linguistic structures. From this perspective , historians have demonstrated the ways in which the discursive has constrained and confined behaviour. Through their examination of a warplant newspaper Helen Smith and Pamela Wakewich demonstrate that the new work patterns for young women during wartime remained enmeshed in a " mechanism of ideological continuity.

We consider how the media have framed the debate over electronic voting and how the public perceives this debate. Election reform is rarely considered through the lens of risk analysis and trade-off. Instead , reforms are attacked by various interest groups , who typically make claims about the risks of some method of voting. This is true not only in the area of voting technology , where debates rage between those who are concerned primarily with accessibility and those who are concerned about security. Reforms such as no-excuse absentee voting , early voting , vote centers , and even reforms to voter registration systems have all come under intense scrutiny , with claims made that such reforms will somehow negatively affect the electoral process or otherwise harm our democracy . </frame.v.2659><frame.v.2660>I spent some time contemplating my own habits of being while in New Year ' s-resolution mode this past week , and have committed myself this year to discovering new frames through which to view the world.

And I ' d like to learn more science ( to atone for that bad year in college physics ) . I am especially inspired by friends who have gone out of their way to meet a recently immigrated Afghan family , and are seeing the world through some delightful new cultural frames.

Subhasis Charkrabarti , general manager ( development support ) of CRY , a non-government organisation that works for the betterment of children , points out that the bill has several loopholes. " Initially , when the Indian Constitution was framed , Article 45 said free and compulsory education for children up to the age of 14 would be a state responsibility and that it would be implemented within 10 years , " he says. " Since then , different schemes have come out with different time-frames. " The state 's responsibilities have been diluted since then , as has the time-frame , which has moved well beyond the initial , stipulated time period to 2010 , 2015 or 2020 , depending on which scheme one is looking at. Thus , 55 years after the Constitution was passed , India is no closer to achieving its initial goal of universalising education . </frame.v.2661><frame.v.2662>The criminalization of drugs and drug use has a long and complex history in the United States. n15 Starting with the Harrison Narcotics Act n16 in 1914 , the federal government has steadily moved toward defining illicit drug use as a criminal ( as opposed to a medical or social ) problem that needs a criminal law solution. n17 At the end of the twentieth century , the paradigm of drug use as criminal activity frames most drug use discourse to the exclusion of other viewpoints. n18 This latest manifestation of America 's attempt to deal with drug use among its citizens has developed some distinct themes and devices.

The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston , the Philadelphia Museum of Art , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , the Frick Collection , the Whitney Museum of American Art , the Baltimore Museum of Art , the Art Institute of Chicago , the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts , the Georgia Museum of Art , the Corcoran Gallery of Art , the Chrysler Museum of Art , the Toledo Museum of Art , the Detroit Institute of Arts , the St. Louis Art Museum , the Kimbell Art Museum , the Norton Simon Museum , Seattle Art Museum , the Smithsonian Institute , the Cleveland Museum of Art and many others used Heydenryk to frame some of the greatest masterpieces in art history. In the 1970s , the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. appointed Mr. Heydenryk as the official frame consultant to their collection . </frame.v.2702><frame.v.2703>The fourth form would be mystery . Mystery does not mean enigma. Nor does it mean mysticism. Since the age of Mallarm , it means a specific way of putting heterogeneous elements together , for instance , in the case of Mallarm , the thought of the poet , the steps of the dancer , the unfolding of a fan or the smoke of a cigarette. In opposition to the dialectical clash that stresses the heterogeneity of the elements in order to show a reality framed by antagonisms , mystery sets forth an analogy - a familiarity of the strange , witnessing to a common world , where heterogeneous realities are woven in the same fabric and can always be related to one another by the fraternity of a metaphor . </frame.v.2703><frame.v.2704>Insulated panels have proven to be much more energy efficient than stick framed wall and roof systems. In a stick framed wall , the wood studs result in a cold spot at regular intervals , since wood is not a good insulating material and has a R-Value of about 1 per inch. This means that each 2 X 6 stud provides a mere R-6 of insulation. In addition , the fiber glass batts tend to have gaps , to get crimped or compressed , and to loosen around electrical outlets and pipes. These cause drafts and greatly reduce the overall insulating value of the batts. So although the batts may be a R-11 or a R-17 , actual whole wall performance will be much lower . </frame.v.2704><frame.v.2705>Sharon contacted her supplier of UV plexiglass for help developing the five-sided cube that would house dimensional scrapbook layouts. She then coupled this conservation-grade UV plexiglass with high quality mouldings found in custom frame shops , and acid free and lignin free backing boards and framing mats. The result is a frame with the quality of custom frames that have been designed specially for scrapbook layouts . </frame.v.2705><frame.v.2706>Structural insulated panels can be used to construct a house. These panels sandwich plastic foam insulation between two layers of a wood or composite product , thus eliminating the need for structural wood framing members. These systems save energy in two ways , first by reducing the heat losses that would have gone through the wood frame , and second by reducing air leaks. Both of these changes represent significant energy savings. Just stopping the energy flowing through the wall framing could save 25 of the wall 's energy losses . </frame.v.2706><frame.v.2707>Photos frames are available in different sizes &amp;we also made as per customer requirements.

Frames have normative implications , that is , they imply that a certain type of solution is called for. For instance , a problem framed in terms of disease calls for a rather different response than one framed in terms of sin. The authors note that " It is typical of diagnostic-prescriptive stories such as these that they execute the normative leap [ from describing a problem to recommending a solution ] in such a way as to make it seem graceful , compelling , even obvious. " ( 26 ) Furthermore , " This sense of obviousness of what is wrong and what needs fixing is the hallmark of policy frames and of the generative metaphors that underlie them , and it is central to our account of the intractability of the frame conflicts implicit in policy controversies.

In essence and as its name implies , " timber frame " construction is a method of building a house which relies on a timber frame as a basic means of structural support. These " framed " buildings are often referred to in the construction industry as lightweight construction ' properties but this term can be slightly misleading and is often off putting to would be purchasers , like a human skeleton , a modern timber framed building is a precision engineered structure that is noted for its strength and durability.

View A of figure 1-44 shows typical door framing; view B shows typical window framing.

It is a good practice to place a cripple stud under each end of a sill . </frame.v.2715><frame.v.2716>The perception was given that the war was beyond question and debate and that those who did not support it held a disruptive minority opinion that , if expressed , warranted harsh criticism and scrutiny. This passive posture of mass media seems contrary to the role they should play as watchdogs of the government , providing a critical communication link , and encouraging and seeking multiple perspectives. These are things that a democratic society greatly needs , particularly during a time of social unrest. In this case , the mainstream media used framing to rhetorically silence dissident voices and to reinforce the government ' s agenda to go to war in Iraq by limiting public discourse within a government controlled and accepted framework. Although the Dixie Chicks were mere casualties in this suppressive media effort , their situation reinforced the spiral of silence for artists like Madonna who substantially edited her music video with war references before releasing it saying , ' I don ' t want to get Dixie Chicked ' ( ABC News , 2003a , p. 21 ) . </frame.v.2716><frame.v.2717>Need an 8x10 frame ?

Moreover , an " Occupation President " sounds more like a military commander disregarding the Constitution rather than a heroic figure out to eliminate global terrorism. Lakoff applies his framing devices to several other political debates , for instance , the use of the term " biconceptualism " rather than references to a moderate position since the former infers an inclusive way of thinking that balances polar perspectives , while the latter picks up on the compromising aspect of being in the middle. With the decisive Democratic victory in both houses earlier this month , the progressive community has an opportunity to gain a foothold through the reinforcement of such inclusive frames in their speeches. From that perspective , Lakoff 's primer becomes indispensable.

The latter strategy has also been framed through its own metaphor -- " spreading " democracy or freedom. The term spreading is however more commonly associated with material substances , notably those well-known to a president with a cattle ranching background. The questionable implication is that a non-material value can be appropriaterly treated in the same manner. The comparison with " spreading manure " , and the mindset and equipment required , has not been lost on some commentators [ more more more ] . Especially problematic in any such " spreading " is the spread of arms , fundamental to the American concept of democracy , as articulated by the Second Amendment to the US Constitution -- also reflected in the constitutions of individual states of the USA ( cf Arming Civil Society Worldwide : Getting democracy to work in the emergent American Empire ? 2003 ) . To the extent that " democracy and freedom " have become code for " Christian values " within the leadership of the Coalition of the Willing , the use of " spreading " in that connection is especially unfortunate . </frame.v.2724><frame.v.2725>Design the perfect photo frame for your image.

The expressive potential of framing comprises such effects as destruction or intensification of suspense , distancing of or close-up focus on facts , fabulaic comment on 'reality ' or pictorial foregrounding of context , closure or open-endedness. These effects are not mutually incompatible. " Poor Liza " is framed in a suspenseful , fabulaic , close-up , closured way; " The Stationmaster " in a suspenseful , fabulaic , distancing , open-ended way. " The Garnet Bracelet " is frameless , fabulaic , suspenseful , close-up , closured; " Gentle Breathing , " " framed , unsuspenseful , close-up , open-ended , both fabulaic and " contextual "; " Spring in Fialta , " framed , suspenseful , unfabulaic , closured , both close-up and distanced . </frame.v.2728><frame.v.2729>Torbjrn , the problem as I see it , is that some science can not be " framed " on the world view that some non-scientists have.

States ' Rights , however appealing a rationale to an interested mind , had one fatal weakness , with regard to its doctrine of secession , and that was the lack of an effective institutional mechanism. Although States ' Rights argued that the foundation of the Federal government was the States , it was a spiritual foundation and not a material one; it might be withdrawn in name , but there was no legal or institutional compulsion available. As Lincoln gently hinted in his first inaugural , for an orderly and legal secession of a part , the consent of the whole was required. And , in terms of actual law and institutional arrangements , there was no ambiguity; the Federal government , resting on its own independent bottom of revenues , administration and legal authority , could not be disestablished , even locally , by an individual state . </frame.v.2732><frame.v.2733>PRO SPORT DELUXE CARDBOARD PICTURE FRAME This heavy weight picture frame , with a gold underlay , holds two pictures.

For a state is not a mere aggregate of persons , but a union of them sufficing for the purposes of life; and if any of these things be wanting , it is as we maintain impossible that the community can be absolutely self-sufficing. A state then should be framed with a view to the fulfillment of these functions. There must be husbandmen to procure food , and artisans , and a warlike and a wealthy class , and priests , and judges to decide what is necessary and expedient . </frame.v.2734><frame.v.2735>However , the power of hierarchical systems should not be completely dismissed. While a vast majority of students in Shirk 's study felt they benefited from peer editing , authors tended to feel that professional editors ' advice was more useful and beneficial to their work than they did peer-editors'. These hierarchical editors were perceived to have more credibility than their peers during the editorial process ( [ Shirk1991 ] 245 , 249-50 ) . These feelings framed and were reflected in the incorporation of peer advice into the final products . </frame.v.2735><frame.v.2736>For thirty-seven days in November and December 2000 , while America waited to learn who would be the next president of the United States , election officials were the butt of late-night television monologues and were vilified in the media.

During this period , people also developed very distinct impressions about the conduct of elections , and three divergent views of the election took hold.

The first issue is whether the defence extends to ignorance of information relevant to the availability of any other potential defence. A defendant might believe erroneously , that a defence is available , and simply not have the information that shows it is not. It is arguable that the proposal , being framed in terms of what ' caused the publication to breach the sub judice rule ' , does not cover a defendant who believed another defence was available , but whose belief turned out to be mistaken. This is because to excuse a publication under a defence does not prevent it from being a ' breach [ of ] the sub judice rule ' . Therefore any defence should be carefully framed in order to protect a publisher who is liable only because of the failure of another defence that it reasonably thought was open to it at the time of publication . </frame.v.2738><frame.v.2739>Yes , Digg frames ethically , so your frame-busting of the DiggBar will appear to work.

Instead , German women , influential as they are in terms of authority and standing in the discourse , remain isolated as advocates of seeing abortion as a matter of women 's autonomy rather than of help for the needy. Indeed , the Social Democratic Party , the largest single institutional advocate for reducing legal restrictions on abortion , framed its approach to abortion with the slogan " Help , do n't punish " arguing that women who seek abortion are in need of the state 's help rather than criminal prosecution. The pro-choice arguments in favor of autonomy in the US , by contrast , are equally strong among all three gender groups. American women , who we saw earlier also tend to make their argument for autonomy in non-gender-specific terms , are supported in this argument by both men and institutional speakers. However , this also means that American women who are in fact needy and seeking help from the government , whether to have an abortion or to avoid one , are left without any specific group that represents them . </frame.v.2742><frame.v.2743>A twin gift. 8x10 white framed print celebrating twins. 3 spaces for twins photographs through the first year and 1 for an ultrasound.

There 's perhaps an equally important role played by framing which is motivational. Frames determine whether or not to pay attention in the first place. Frames are interesting in that they interact with preexisting values , identity , and self-interest ( much more so than offering new information that tips the balance in favor of a particular judgment ) . You have to pay attention before you 're persuaded , and attention is rooted in motivational factors like material self interest. A classic example is the time horizon used to frame global warming. At least since Kyoto , global warming has been described in the mainstream press as a far off thing - something that will happen to future generations and in other parts of the world. From a mass public perspective , I believe that this framing resulted in over a decade of superficial attention and neglect of mounting scientific evidence. Now that the press has started framing global warming in terms of implications for us today , I think the public opinion needle is starting to move . </frame.v.2745><frame.v.2746>Do n't you wish you could frame small size artwork with wide mats and a thin elegant frame around it ?

One of our customers purchased a great print of Paul Newman and Robert Redford as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid from Allposters.com. She wanted it framed in barnwood , but because the print was sepia-toned , we were worried that it would look washed-out next to a barnwood frame. The solution was to create a custom frame for her that would include a piece of ebony-stained barnwood next to the print to create some color separation between the print and the barnwood frame. When the frame was finished , we liked it so well we added the frame style to our permanent inventory and named it The Butch Cassidy. </frame.v.2773><frame.v.2774>Ferraro Builders and Woodhouse offer building options to meet your budget.

People learn to use both types of frames as they learn to competently participate in a culture. Cultural frames provide a 'common sense ' pattern that systematically shapes the way we interpret images by drawing our attention to some aspects of these images while encouraging us to ignore others. When we frame images generated during a public policy dispute , we frame an object around which the issues revolve , rather than the issues themselves. Cultural frames are flexible.

There is only so much you can frame an idea that is universally unappealing.

In 1985 , journalist Avon Lovell published a book entitled The Mickelberg Stitch , [ 18 ] in which he argued that the prosecution case against the Mickelbergs was based on questionable evidence. In other words , Lovell alleged the police had framed the brothers. With a big print run of 20 , 000 , The Mickelberg Stitch sold rapidly in Perth until police threatened to sue the book 's distributor and any bookseller or other business offering it for sale. The Police Union introduced a $ 2 per week levy on its 5000 members to fund 40 legal actions against Lovell , the distributor and retailers. The defamation threats and actions effectively suppressed any general availability of the book. None of the suits against Lovell reached trial in over a decade; they remained active despite his repeated attempts to strike them out for lack of prosecution . </frame.v.2780><frame.v.2781>We are members of the Fine Art Guild , and adhere to their standards , which means that we produce top-quality frames every time.

When framing landscapes , both historic and modern , the best choice for a frame is one with a concave profile which leads the eye into the picture. However , if the scene has less depth , for example a portrait or still life , the best shape of frame would be a convex one. Because it falls away from the image at the outer edge , a convex frame presents the picture toward you and offers the illusion of depth to a two-dimensional painting . </frame.v.2783><frame.v.2784>Framed !

What the hell do you think protecting marriage and traditional family values are ? What the hell has Frank Luntz been doing for Republicans for the past decade ? It ' s been about formulating arguments about positions. The symbolic side of politics always involves framing. It ' s about how particular arguments are produced from within a cognitive framework , that certain terms have relationships to other terms , and that they tend to be grouped together. Thus , protecting marriage draws upon people have about a decline of marriage and family life. Gay entrance into marriage is thus framed as another assault on marriage it comes from within the worldview , but it also represents a choice. While the Right doesn ' t shy away from condemning gay folks , the rhetoric has shifted in the past couple decades to the point where blatantly hateful statements are more risky than they used to be , and may actually alienate prospective voters. Thus , rather than focusing on gay people , anti-marriage equality folks focus on the decline of marriage in public debate , and argue the issue from within that frame . </frame.v.2785><frame.v.2786>The Basics St. Lawrence is framed by a border of eels and fish , beautifully executed in gold and silver foil.

A major part of this research project is to identify the influence of the main non-structural components in the most common type of domestic construction in Australia , that is , brick veneer houses. A typical brick veneer house would have plasterboard as interior lining and brick veneer as exterior cladding. The contributions of the plasterboard and the brick veneer walls are being assessed. In this investigation an extensive racking and dynamic testing program was undertaken on a single room house. This paper presents the details of this testing program. From the racking tests it is concluded that the plasterboard dramatically increases the stiffness , load carrying capacity and damping of wall panels. It was also found that there is load sharing between the diagonal cross braces and the plasterboard . </frame.v.2787><frame.v.2788>The metaphor then suggests that , to avoid activation of a range of psychosocial processes and engagement in them , radicalization should be inhibited , notably by controlling catalysts of dissidence ( such as " radical clerics " ) .

In other words , when journalists write stories , they choose what details about a particular event to include , exclude , emphasize and minimize based on what aspects of the event they determine are most important ( Griffin , 2000 , pg. 366 ) . All of these elements together frame the event , meaning the elements give the event context for the media consumer ( Price &amp;Tewksbury , 1997 ) .

The transition from the opening sequence of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN presents us with an excellent illustration of this technique. As the camera gradually zooms-in to frame an extreme closeup of the elderly Private Ryan ' s blue-gray eyes , we suddenly cut to the blue-gray sky and similarly colored water of Omaha Beach just before the famous battle scene erupts. The two images are thus graphically connected , and the transitional device of matched colors suggests that this episode from the past continues to haunt Ryan.

Snow and Benford criticise social movement theories for taking a 'static view of participation ' and for focusing on factors which give rise to grievances at the expense of studying the processes by which people define and understand grievances ( Snow et al , 1986 : p. 465 ) . 'What is at issue ' , they argue , 'is not merely the presence or absence of grievances , but the manner in which grievances are interpreted and the generation and diffusion of those interpretations ' ( Snow , et al. 1986 : p. 466 ) . Snow and Benford contend that social movements not only 'frame the world in which they are acting ' , but that they also frame social problems ( Snow et al , 1986 ) . The way a movement frames a problem plays a significant part in the propensity of that movement to shape public policy ( Snow et al , 1986 : p.466; Snow and Benford , 1992 ) . </frame.v.2796><frame.v.2797>Once stretched , framed , and hanging on the wall in an art gallery nobody is touching or feeling the finished inkjet canvas print. These consumers have absolutely no way of determining the initial weight , thickness , or feel of the inkjet canvas. Therefore , these attributes are totally worthless unless of course they somehow affect your production process. For example , an excessively thin inkjet canvas might tear when stretching over frames. An excessively thick inkjet canvas might not feed through your printer. An excessively heavy inkjet canvas might senselessly raise your costs , lower your profit margins and in turn decrease your market competitiveness as a printmaker. Therefore , using a inkjet canvas because you like how it feels or how heavy it is , is just a disorganization of business priorities. Unless your customer requires a specific inkjet canvas weight or thickness , these two attributes should be considered your lowest priority. Generally it is a plus to have a heavier , thicker inkjet canvas but should not influence your inkjet canvas evaluation . </frame.v.2797><frame.v.2798>101 A careful consideration of reliance interests is critical to this analytical process. Although legal mechanisms , such as the de facto doctrine , res judicata or the law of limitations , may mitigate the consequences of declaratory rulings in certain circumstances , they do not address every situation. Fully retroactive remedies might prove highly disruptive in respect of government action , which , on the basis of settled or broadly held views of the law as it stood , framed budgets or attempted to design social programs. Persons and public authorities could then become liable under a new legal norm. Neither governments nor citizens could be reasonably assured of the legal consequences of their actions at the time they are taken . </frame.v.2798><frame.v.2799>This awful example of Americans who violate The Constitution -- and then intimidate and threaten anyone who speaks out -- is also a good example of how a political issue can be framed so that it appears to mean the opposite of what most Americans believe.

During that time she had lived under two charters , a constitution , and an interregnum , when she had neither charter nor constitution and was under the direct rule of the Crown. Her first charter was so liberal that she had enjoyed for fifty years what was in effect independence. She elected her own governors , coined her own money , and was not obliged to send her laws to England for approval. Her second charter was just the reverse , and gave her a taste of something very near to despotism. During the Revolution she made for herself a constitution which was rejected by her people , but before the Revolution closed she made another , which was accepted. She had had a double experience of constitution-making during the seven years of the Revolution , and , taken all in all , a very severe and long preparation for her part in the national document of 1787 . </frame.v.2806><frame.v.2807>Given the way Cole has contextualized or framed the entire article in terms of power , fear and control , his attempt to rouse negative reactions by means of emotional 'buzz-words ' is obvious.

Of special interest is the word " subtly " ( ibid. ) , which allows Cole to encourage conspiratorial thinking without having to provide hard evidence; since the activity is so 'subtle ' proof can not be readily available.

However , for some special occasions like anniversaries and inaugurations these posters are framed with special materials as they serve as memorabilia.

The procedure is carried out especially in wedding , birthday and anniversary photos . </frame.v.2829><frame.v.2830>In their 1980 book , Lakoff and Johnson point out that sets of conceptual metaphors vary across cultures. As one example , they compare discussions with US students and students from non-Western countries about finding solutions to problems. They observe that their US students framed difficulties in terms of mathematical formulas. For this group , the solution metaphor implied that an answer could be found much as one might resolve a mathematical problem by working through steps toward a solution. Some non-Western students , on the other hand , viewed problems like a solution of chemicals in a test tube. One could add ingredients to make the solution more manageable , or to dilute the influence of one element or compound , but one could not eliminate all troublesome contents of the solution . </frame.v.2830><frame.v.2831>More unusual was the practice of building a bent frame hull inside out by erecting bulkheads on the keel , adding intermediate molds as necessary , installing the shelf , clamp , stringers , engine beds , ceiling and any intermediate harpins necessary. The frames were then bent over the ceiling , harpins and stringers , from the outside of the hull. This reduced the amount of temporary molds and ribbands required , allowed a larger framing crew to bend frames around a largely convex shape , and allowed pre-outfitting the hull with engines , tanks , major piping , shafting , etc. while the hull was relatively open. Using these techniques , a crew during WWII completely framed a 137 ' YMS in less than 16 hours. This was typical of the way Joe and Clair thought , always looking for better ways to build what today is called a traditional vessel. To them it was not a tradition , rather an ongoing perfection of their craft . </frame.v.2831><frame.v.2832>Now comes the conundrum ... when Progressives use logic and reasoning to explain the differences and show the way to improving our situation , we play into their hands by activating right-wing frames ! Lakoff says that embodied metaphor is central to politics and that , " Every time a liberal goes over a conservative proposal giving evidence negating conservative ideas one by one , he or she is activating the conservative ideas in the brains of his audience. " He uses only 4 lines out of the whole article proposing a solution : " The proper response is to start with your own ideas , framed to fit what you really believe. Facts matter. But they have to be framed properly and their moral significance must be made manifest. " I would love for him or others to find the frames we need to use to convince the American public of the imperatives of a liberal win. Our survival may depend on it.

Even if some are not expressed explicitly , they can be inferred from the common cultural stock. If an issue is framed as a matter of free speech , then the remedy to uphold freedom of speech is already implied , as this is a value with strong general support. Frames do not only allow the reduction of large quantities of information to a manageable size , they also allow the completion of sketchy information by analogical inference as well as the interpretation of ambiguous information . </frame.v.2834><frame.v.2835>Its advantages over a welded system is its flexibility in construction.

The results suggested that while CNN and BBC framed the Tibet crisis in different ways , there were many more similarities. The data showed that both news outlets held a bias against the Chinese government and often utilized multiple frames in one news article. Moreover , the examination of the use of the anti-communism frame revealed that both media attempted to foster anti-communism emotions in their readers.

This may have gradually accustomed the colonists to the idea that the war and peace power of a government belonged to the representative and legislative department , and not to the executive , so that , when the National Constitution was framed , the war power , instead of being given to the President in imitation of the war power of the British king , was given to Congress . </frame.v.2838><frame.v.2839>If he would have wanted to create a strong case for abductions , all Jennings would have had to do is present the interview of Harvard 's late Dr. John Mack , interviews of David Jacobs , Dr. Janet Colli , Dr. Richard Boylan , and many other researchers from around the world. Creating a strong frame of reference for abductions , which are sometimes difficult for people but are really sacred encounters when one researches a bit deeper , was not his intent. The combined testimonies would have created a frame of reference that would have presented the data in a way that would have created a meaning of more credibility , and more believable than how he only used Budd Hopkins and framed him as the artist from New York who believes in aliens and hypnotizes people . To move towards de-framing Hopkins , which means de-framing the alien abduction issue , all that was needed was to get someone on the air with a Ph.D from a well known and credible institute who explains that hypnosis wasn ' t proven to retrieve memories and that these people ' s memories were caused by sleep paralysis , etc . </frame.v.2839><frame.v.2840>Why was he framed , and sent to death row - well , all one has to do is listen to how wise , and clearheaded Mumia is to understand why the state is afraid of this great man.

His essential insight into politics -- that voters make their decisions based on larger frames rather than on the sum of a candidate 's positions -- is hard to refute. And Lakoff does say in ''Do n't Think of an Elephant ! '' albeit very briefly , that Democrats need not just new language but also new thought; he told me the party suffers from ''hypocognition , '' or a lack of ideas. What 's more , when it comes to the language itself , Lakoff has repeatedly written that the process of reframing American political thought will take years [ my emphasis added ] , if not decades , to achieve. He does not suggest in his writing that a few catchy slogans can turn the political order on its head by the next election . </frame.v.2841><frame.v.2842>The personal and existential and quasi-philosophical discussion of the first session is now to be followed by a sort of more legal and policy oriented question around the limited issue of the wisdom of advance directives.

I deconstructed globalization and envisaged the end of what others have called methodological nationalism by recognizing the delinkage of state , society , economy and culture. But all of this only makes sense if the hypothesis of the global age still stands up to inspection. It is open to the test of time.

In this controversy , competing groups of reformers battled over attempts by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to regulate Native American dances. All the reformers in the controversy framed their arguments about the Pueblo dances in terms of what they agreed was the all-American value of freedom of religion , but because they disagreed over what counted as religion , they also disagreed over whether or not the Pueblo ceremonies merited that protection. The controversy demonstrates that religious freedom debates are informed by competing definitions of religion , which are therefore crucial for understanding the history of government policies towards Native American religious practices . </frame.v.2848><frame.v.2849>Linguistic ideologies frame the Socratic method 's approach to facticity and to the relationship between representationalism and rhetoric. By pressing a certain ideology of legitimate talk , the Socratic method is performative in Silverstein 's second , " deep structure " sense , which does not merely serve utterers in performing speech acts but constitutes the language and discourse in which such performances may be undertaken. Thus all institutional , and probably all discursive talk , is performative in its meta-claim that such-and-such is the acceptable language in which to perform in the " surface " sense , where the distinctions between rhetorical , representational and performative speech may be functionally ( but not morphologically ! ) observed . </frame.v.2849><frame.v.2850>£ 14.99 - Aga Khan print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - Aga Khan print - POSTED £ 29.99 - Aga Khan framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - Aga Khan framed print - POSTED </frame.v.2850><frame.v.2851>First of all , I commend them for having such a beautiful display up so soon.

This conventional wisdom bears little resemblance to what actually occurred -- but it 's a very useful myth for conservative activists preparing for a possible confirmation battle over Bush nominee John G. Roberts. Unfortunately , reporters are now allowing these conservative complaints to frame much of their reporting. Rather than accepting this as the natural working of a system that is designed to check the president 's power to select justices , the media has decided to present this as an injustice -- using " bork " as a verb meaning " to attack a person 's reputation and views unfairly " </frame.v.2857><frame.v.2858>Gigot : Let me ask you , first , about the president 's strategy , the Republican strategy , to frame this election as a choice on national security.

Hunton House is in the American Renaissance style , three and one half stories in height , faced in smooth limestone with carved ornament. The full-width porch is supported by columns and square posts with Corinthian capitals. The porch entablature has a dentil cornice and is topped with a balustrade. The tripartite bow windows are framed by rinceaux. The second floor window is surmounted by a pediment supported by consoles.

Anti-affirmative action activists frame their efforts as a simple plea to return to a fairer time before affirmative action distorted and unfairly denied deserving whites and men an equal opportu nity. In this light , the MCRI delivers us to that past and releases us from an unfortunate and divisive conflict about race and gender preferences. Even many of those who would rather maintain affirmative action temporarily are sympathetic to the idea that its elimination will bring an end to racial and gender jockeying and the divisive politics of resentment. They may have preferred an end to come later , perhaps on Justice O ' Connor ' s twenty-five year time frame , but eliminating it now is seen to have many positive effects . </frame.v.2901><frame.v.2902>With our prints we offer a same day framing service.

Do we try to make allies with the moderate religionists and those on the fence by deliberately putting a religion-friendly face on evolution ( push NOMA; argue " methodological naturalism " vs. " metaphysical naturalism; " tell how evolution makes God even better; trot out the theistic evolutionists and hide the atheists ) ? Or do we encourage the expression of all honest beliefs openly and let the chips fall where they may ( including the belief that following evolution 'all the way down ' leads to Naturalism ) ? If atheists who *do* see science as undermining God tend to jump the gun and make sweeping and perhaps unjustified assumptions when they hear the word " framing , " it may be because they have gotten a bit gun shy . </frame.v.2906><frame.v.2907>All of this raises the question of how foreign policy framing in media is related to public opinion. Why does media choose to represent issues in a particular way , and what are the consequences of that framing ? Media is a ( perhaps the ) primary agenda-setter in contemporary democracies. Governments rely on media to not only communicate information , but to get their message across , and to act as a kind of national marketing department. Because the very nature of representative democracy implies that representatives , including heads of state , are accountable to their constituencies , it is imperative for any regime to minimize criticism and maximize support of its agenda. This is especially true in issues of war and conflict , when national publics are understandably more cautious in their evaluations of policy. Policy must be couched in terms that make it difficult for the public to question the righteousness of the administration 's decisions. The fastest way to end a war ( other than an overwhelming display of military force ) is to have a mass display of public discontent. However , both media and government gatekeepers understand that all that is necessary to keep a national public on board is to frame issues in particular ways : </frame.v.2907><frame.v.2908>Sawyer also aimed to isolate Maines as the villain in this case. Although the entire group was punished , it was Maines who made the statement and who was vilified as a result. Sawyer referred to Maines with names like , outspoken wild child ,  famously untamed , and rebel , all of which framed Maines as a woman who has always been rebellious , uncontrollable , and deviant. This radical framing of Maines allowed Sawyer to imply that only someone with those characteristics would make such a comment or hold such a perspective . </frame.v.2908><frame.v.2909>Fifty-eight years ago today , Alger Hiss -- the defendant in an emblematic Cold War prosecution once called " the trial of the century " -- began serving a federal prison sentence for perjury.

Isolating one frame as the most dominant is difficult because the most important frame , as Reese ( 2003 ) said , may not be the most frequent ( p. 8 ) .

Wittgenstein 's Philosophical Investigations contains resources that may be appropriated to better understand religious experiences despite the topic not being directly addressed. The standard , fideistic reading of Wittgenstein on religious belief stems primarily from sources that are less reliable than Philosophical Investigations for discovering Wittgenstein 's thought. In this paper , I argue ( 1 ) in Philosophical Investigations , there is no basis for the view that Wittgenstein 's thought about religion is fideistic , ( 2 ) Wittgenstein 's position on the nature of religious experience should likewise not reflect fideism , and ( 3 ) an interpretation of Wittgenstein on the nature of religious experience , in light of Philosophical Investigations and with emphasis on Wittgenstein 's remarks on pain and private languages , will instead reflect the public nature of religious forms of life . </frame.v.2914><frame.v.2915>-When a packet is sent between routers , it is framed with control information at the Data Link layer.

While some codes transmit information ( e.g. machine code , genetic code ) , others create meaning reciprocally constituting and communicating the interpretive traditions , presuppositions and worldviews that frame our outlook on the world. Such coding is accomplished ( at least in part ) through the discourses that most influence our ideas , actions and social relations with people and other animals. It is this latter use of discourse to code ( e.g. generate , enforce , contest and revision ) the meaning and ethics of human-animal relations that is the focus of these three papers . </frame.v.2919><frame.v.2920>The book has its failings.

Essential to the present research is Entman 's ( 1991 ) examination of how successful frames " cohere with an established discursive domain , a series of associated idea clusters that form a way of reasoning about a matter that is familiar to audiences from other cultural experiences " ( p. 11 ) . </frame.v.2923><frame.v.2924>But I am going to try the Plylox because the barrel bolts are very expensive now and hard to find in the correct size.

The issue is much narrower. There is no general waiver involved. The dispute is limited to the erection of a personal succah , a practice accepted as obligatory by some but not all members of the Jewish faith , and even in the case of Mr. Amselem is not obligatory where a personal succah is not available. The co-owners were entitled to conclude that when the appellants accepted the declaration of co-ownership they were indicating that the practice of their religion permitted them to live within the existing rules. Accordingly , rather than elevate the issue to one of waiver of freedom of religion , which would overdramatize the situation , it seems to me the issue is more modestly and accurately framed as whether the appellants in this case can reasonably insist on a personal succah in all the circumstances , including their contract not to construct a personal dwelling , even a temporary dwelling , on the commonly owned balconies of the immovable . </frame.v.2934><frame.v.2935>£ 14.99 - Peron print - PICK UP ONLY £ 22.05 - Peron print - POSTED £ 29.99 - Peron framed print - PICK UP ONLY £ 39.99 - Peron framed print - POSTED </frame.v.2935><frame.v.2936>I have gotten a lot of things framed at Michael 's because I live near one.

To avoid this , printmakers can test a inkjet canvas by coating piece of it , allowing it 24 hours to dry , folding it backwards , completely in half , and then firmly pressing the fold to make a crease. If the inkjet canvas does not crack in the creased area , it will most likely not crack or tear when stretched.

Recent reports suggest that children and teens increasingly drive the economy while parents put off their own discretionary expenses; and families are more apt to spend money on items that " feather their nests " in lean times. The opportunities in this category are truly endless.

The personalization of course mainly depicts the U.S. side. Watching a documentary about Vietnam , I would learn about historical aspects of it , but emotion is usually absent in those types of film; the men are not personalized. Most current war movies , including " Full Metal Jacket " want us to experience the emotional side of the war ( such is the premise for Joker 's thoughts ) , because it was not just two sides fighting , but a group of people with individual lives and experiences. Once we experience their lives on a more intimate level , their pain will be that much greater to the audience ( at least this is what the producer is hoping ) , although , I do not believe these movies are trying to trivialize the war. I think the producer is just trying to show another side to the war , a personal side , to make the movie have more feeling. The producer does a good job with this throughout the entire movie. This is also framed by the types of images which are shown . </frame.v.2942><frame.v.2943>If Jennings would have wanted to create a strong case for Roswell , all he would have had to do is cite former astronauts who have spoken out about it , former intelligence , army and civilian witnesses , etc. , many who have never profited from Roswell.

Conventional notions of leadership have typically been framed in terms of those people who are in the elite ranks of governments , business , other organizations , rather than , in terms of all of us being leaders in different facets of our lives. This has created a situation in which individuals are easily allowed to defer their personal responsibility for actions to the 'other. ' Many practiced models of leadership are still grounded in notions of authoritarianism and hoarding of power with the guiding metaphors of self-preservation and manipulation. Many of our leaders have tended to adopt and hide behind positions based on the real-politik , partisanism and cynicism , and lack the courage and confidence to take bold risks in new directions.

While movement researchers have theorized that political opportunities are important in explaining why movements emerge , the results from an examination of the emergence of the state suffrage movements show that the mobilization of various resources along with the way in which pro-suffrage arguments were framed were instrumental in stirring up suffrage sentiment. Political opportunities did little to explain the emergence of the suffrage movements. The article concludes that movement researchers need to consider that historically contingent circumstances may determine which factors bring about movement mobilization . </frame.v.2945><frame.v.2946>GL : What you are doing is writing them another frame.

To understand frames , Lakoff gives the example of the phrase 'tax relief , ' which combines two otherwise benign words to create a catch-phrase rife with ideological underpinnings. 'Tax relief ' necessarily assumes that taxes are an evil affliction from which we need relief. After all , how could anybody be in favor of taxes while using the term 'tax relief ' ? This exemplifies a basic principle of framing : avoid using the other side 's language while debating them.

You may still be frightened to see the monster tower above you in a sudden jump cut as the background music rises to a feverish pitch; you may still feel sympathy for the lost child the camera looks down on; you may still feel comradery with the friendly newsman who looks you right in the eye from a medium close up distance , like a friend across the dinner table. But at least you can pause and note some of the ways production techniques are helping to arouse those feelings in you , and you can decide for yourself if you would feel the same if the message were framed in some other way . </frame.v.2952><frame.v.2953>" America Builds on the National Mall " is part of a larger nationwide effort by Habitat that engages partners and communities to frame interior and exterior walls that are then shipped to the Gulf Coast region and eventually assembled into permanent housing.

Ask yourself why American elections hinge on certain issues and not others. The answer is that a set of individuals has chosen the particular frame. Theoretically speaking , the divisions between candidates in a campaign could be over almost any issue. The issues over which a campaign is actually waged have been determined by some entity or entities other than the electorate. Traditionally , this entity has been the party. The party has chosen the scope of political conflict . </frame.v.2954><frame.v.2955>We regularly frame my wife 's work ourselves , and so , as others have said upthread , that can be done for a fraction of the price.

The Democratic response so far is playing right into Bush 's framing. By delaying a response for fear it will be called " partisan , " the Democratic leadership is allowing Bush to frame the tragedy.

It is time to start now . </frame.v.2960><frame.v.2961>Opponents of cloning research know very well that journalists are drawn to these dramatic literary conventions in formulating news accounts. They also know that many of these popular culture and historical metaphors frame biotechnology issues in ways that favor their preferred policy outcomes. By discussing cloning and biotech research in terms of Frankenstein , mad scientists , or Brave New World , cloning opponents emphasize certain dimensions of the issue over others , limiting debate to terms that marshal support for their position . </frame.v.2961><frame.v.2962>Italian astronomer and natural philosopher. Galileo finally manages to destroy the Aristotelian theories of motion , but perhaps more importantly for what is to come in the scientific revolution he instigates the idea that mathematics can apply precisely to the world around us and that we can produce mathematically framed laws that relate to this world . </frame.v.2962><frame.v.2963>Any Democratic president who introduced health care reform was going to be met with vicious , organized opposition. The Clintons , who were white , were effectively shut down by organized business interests who framed reform as a threat to ordinary citizens. The tactics here are the same , President Obama is not being attacked because he is black , he is being attacked because he introduced health care reform that promises to end the profitable stranglehold insurance companies currently enjoy. His policies are the reason for the dissent , but the framing , strategies , language , and tone of the attacks are racialized and often racist . </frame.v.2963><frame.v.2964>Something else to look at is the area where the frame will be displayed. This is especially good if it 's difficult to determine a color from the picture or artwork being framed however keep in mind the frame color is more for the content of the frame than its surroundings. What is the theme of the room and what colors are being used there ? You want a frame that will accent the room and its d cor as well as compliment the contents of the frame. For example if the walls of the room are light in color you wouldn ' t want to use a light colored frame , instead a mid tone color might give a better contrast depending on the color of the furnishings of that room. The idea is to quietly draw the eye to the frame and its contents not to hide it or draw too much attention . </frame.v.2964><frame.v.2965>Hunter spoke of several campaigns where cutting the issues and how it was framed were critical to the outcome. In 1988 there was debate within the Sierra Club-some felt the organization should be neutral on immigration and others felt that the organization should remain neutral. Central to the discussion was the frame that " immigration drives overpopulation and increased population ruins the environment. " This frame had a coded racism to it and instead they chose to put the issue in a global frame . </frame.v.2965><frame.v.2966>Sectional frames , are usually two sides of a frame sold in pairs , usually prepackaged , and in preset sizes.

In M. v. H. , this Court held that the distinction in the spousal support regime between same-sex and opposite-sex couples was unconstitutional and that it could not be saved under s. 1. The MBOA was expressly intended to extend equal treatment to same-sex partners in a wide range of statutes. It is the purpose of the MBOA itself that determines the appropriate comparator group. What must be compared is the subset of same-sex survivors that remains excluded from the CPP survivor ' s benefits , i.e. , those whose partners died before January 1 , 1998 , and similarly situated opposite-sex survivors. The appropriate comparator group in respect of the s. 44 ( 1.1 ) analysis is survivors of opposite-sex conjugal relationships whose partners died before January 1 , 1998 . </frame.v.2967><frame.v.2968>An issue only becomes an issue when it shows up in the news.

I was interested in choreographing long shots where the movement outside the frame was just as important as the movement in the frame. During this time I made the opening credit sequence for " Move the Frame " the TV show which was one long pull back shot through a row of dancers whose hands and bodies framed the moving shot. I also made " Untitled States of America , " a solo in which the camera is sitting on the ground for most of the piece , and I choreographed the dance based on what the camera could/could n't see of me . </frame.v.2973><frame.v.2974>Using the power and convenience of the web you can frame your work from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of high street framing prices , any time of the day with YourFramer .

The second paragraph was a reality which was completely blocked from the public view.

Which do you think is the better course , the more productive course for Senator Kerry ? </frame.v.2977><frame.v.2978>Framing has been vital. Opponents of the president ' s Iraq policies should have framed the issue immediately when Democratic leaders took control in January 2007. The message should have been : Congress defines the strategic mission; the president ' s job is to carry it out. He is refusing to carry out his mission . </frame.v.2978><frame.v.2979>Polling can be an important aid and Democrats and Republican have tended to use polls differently. Democrats tend to follow polls , and Republicans use polls to push an agenda and frame the debate-they use their conclusions and data to make it sound like everyone supports their view. Polls can be useful in informing where voters can be moved to in their views. For instance , the research that Ted Nordhaus and others have done on social values data helps us to understand how deeply held certain values are so that we understand not just where people are but also where they might move to in their beliefs . </frame.v.2979><frame.v.2980>Create your Website Professional &amp;Creative ! - This Easy-to-Use program that quickly and easily renders high-quality , photorealistic , Creative frames around your digital pictures.

We do n't simply have one way of framing an issue or an event. Lakoff emphasizes two meta-frames2 or cultural themes operating in the United States , embodied in two competing family metaphors : the Strict Father vs. the Nurturant Parent. He sees these meta-frames as underlying , respectively , conservative and liberal thought more generally. But Lakoff is wise enough to recognize that we do n't carry around just one of these in our heads but both of them. One may be much more easily triggered and habitually used but the other is also part of our cultural heritage and can be triggered and used as well , given the appropriate cues . </frame.v.2984><frame.v.2985>This conference focused on the frame in America , where European models and practice initially predominated until local preferences emerged and prevailed. By the mid-19th century , frames appropriate to the ambitions of a self-defined American school of painting were devised; styles evolved along with fashions in furniture and decoration , and were also still influenced by European or exotic sources. American artists such as Church , Whistler and Eakins designed frames unique to individual artworks , viewing the pairing as a unified whole. By the 20th century , the challenge of framing Modernist artworks provoked a variety of responses. Today , if some contemporary artists dispense with frames altogether , others intently reconsider the interplay of field and border . </frame.v.2985><frame.v.2986>Perhaps you have a budding artist in the family.

It 's not that so many more U.S. citizens have the " strict father " mentality; it 's that the issues have been clearly and effectively framed from the conservative standpoint. Liberals need to articulate their values , says Lakoff. Incidentally , in his post-mortem today , Slate Magazines ' William Saletan encourages the Democrats to do this , as well . </frame.v.2987><frame.v.2988>Taking advantage of the federal racketeering act , prosecutors were able to charge the New York wiseguys with crimes that stretch to 1976.
