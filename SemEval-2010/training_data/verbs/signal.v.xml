<signal.v.train><signal.v.1>There are those who may scoff at the importance of turn signals. My very first ticket , when I first began driving in upstate New York more than 30 years ago , was a failure to signal a lane change on a divided four-lane highway. A turn signal doesn ' t tell the driver making the signal where he ' s going , nor should it be a random , infrequent courtesy offered other drivers. When used properly , it tells other drivers where one plans on changing direction , so others can plan ahead and react accordingly. But its real value is on those occasions when vehicles might be hidden from view of the driver signaling , yet those other drivers sharing the road can see the signal and avoid a potential collision . </signal.v.1><signal.v.2>Spence discovered that even if education did not contribute anything to an employee 's productivity , it could still have value to both the employer and employee. If the appropriate cost/benefit structure exists ( or is created ) , " good " employees will buy more education in order to signal their higher productivity . </signal.v.2><signal.v.3>I signal the direction of the turn by pointing my fingers in the direction of the intended turn on 3 for an outer turn and on 1 for an inner turn. I hold my partner 's hands directly in front of her face if I do not want a turn ( leading to hairbrush for example ) . </signal.v.3><signal.v.4>At the minimum you must write the routines described below. Their type signatures are defined in thread.h. For those routines that were specified in Project 1 , only the modifications to their implementation will be listed. These routines must still provide the basic functionality outlined in Project 1. Note , this project can be implemented elegantly if the threads functionality is reused for implementing itself. This was done in Project 1 , for example , where we suggested that new threads can be created by a spawner thread created by t_start and activated by waiting on a condition signaled in t_fork. Describe in your documentation the degree to which you reuse thread code . </signal.v.4><signal.v.5>From Figure 8 , it can be to determined that at most 5 " early " AUs are to be stored. If the AUs are of constant size , then this value equals 5 times the AU size. The minimum size of the de-interleave buffer equals the maximum total number of octets of the " early " AUs that are to be stored at the same time. This gives the minimum value of the de-interleaveBufferSize that may be signaled . </signal.v.5><signal.v.6>Nancy thought , A roadway , a highway , a street all have lanes. I stayed in my lane and signaled before I turned at the street the officer didn ' t mark on my ticket. The only vehicle that was affected could only be affected if that vehicle was tail-gating me. No brakes shrieked , no rubber was laid , no horn was honked at the intersection the officer wrote the alleged traffic violation had occurred. </signal.v.6><signal.v.7>If a clue contains an abbreviation for a word or phrase *that is not usually abbreviated* , then it signals an abbreviation in the answer. But if the word or phrase in question is typically abbreviated , then it does n't . </signal.v.7><signal.v.8>After it has spawned all of the processes specified , init waits for one of its descendant processes to die , a powerfail signal , or until it is signaled by telinit to change the system s runlevel. When one of the above three conditions occurs , it re-examines the /etc/inittab file. New entries can be added to this file at any time. However , init still waits for one of the above three conditions to occur. To provide for an instantaneous response , the telinit Q or q command can wake up init to re-examine the /etc/inittab file . </signal.v.8><signal.v.9>The circuit on the right in this layer is identical with that on the left. If the illumination increases , the output of cell 3 will decrease , causing a momentary increase in the output of cell 9 , thus maintaining the blocking of cell 8. However , if the illumination decreases , then the output of cell 3 will increase , causing a momentary release of the blocking of cell 8 , and the decrease will be signaled as an increase in the output from cell 8 and , in turn , a decrease in cell 10 . </signal.v.9><signal.v.10>Means of Abatement. The Secretary suggests a number of abatement measures which she claims will eliminate or materially reduce the hazard. The citation lists five feasible abatement measures. Only two of those measures were tried and briefed. The others are deemed abandoned. First , the Secretary suggests that Sinacola ensure that personnel are accounted for and positioned a safe distance away from the excavator ' s danger zone prior to allowing the operator to move the boom/bucket. Second , the Secretary suggests that Sinacola utilize only a single signalman , and require that signaling responsibilities be formally transferred . </signal.v.10><signal.v.11>in safe code might return nil ( as an implementation-defined extension ) , might never return , or might signal an error of type type-error. In unsafe code , the consequences are undefined . </signal.v.11><signal.v.12>Is signaling an error by virtue of violating interventional logic ? Clearly , people are behaving non-optimally in the examples just cited. The Quattrone and Tversky ( 1984 ) example is a case of an action performed merely for its signaling value ( to convince the participant , experimenter , or both that the participant has a good heart ) and yet the very act reduces the value of the signal ( because it is designed to convince rather than reveal the participant ' s actual heart type ) . The Shafir and Tversky ( 1992 ) study demonstrates how decisions made for their signal value can lead to nonconsequentialism. People gave up money in an obviously futile effort to gain more money . </signal.v.12><signal.v.13>I believe it 's quite possible that she did n't see cyclist Timothy O'Donnell properly signaling to turn left , because she was in such a hurry to pass all 5 cyclists in one fell swoop , making a total of 360 feet on this two-lane , double line no-passing marked lane. Except that , in her haste , she may have failed to notice the intersection up ahead , and O'Donnell signaling to make a turn there . </signal.v.13><signal.v.14>Because dopaminergic activity derives from mid brain structures , it is not incompatible with other somatic responses that are also activated by perceptual events. For example , if rapid perceptual set shifting is not perceived to be sufficient in itself in achieving an important goal , other somatic responses ( e.g. muscle tension ) may be signaled that serve as somatic markers that signal other behavioral strategies that may alter how a problem is appraised , but not how rapidly it is appraised. Thus , an individual taking a difficult test would rapidly shift between different perspectives that allow him to resolve test problems , yet may experience mild anxiety that further sharpens or attenuates his focus. Similarly , an individual may experience intermittent feelings of high alertness or high alertness combined with high anxiety , as when one is absorbed in watching an 'exciting ' football game. Because dopamine release is not locked in tandem with other somatic responses , and because subjective appraisals map to input from a collection of neural , somatic , and cognitive systems , dopamine alone is highly correlated with but nonetheless can not be solely responsible for feelings of ecstasy or bliss . </signal.v.14><signal.v.15>Various other indices of commodity prices provide some variation of this general picture but generally corroborate the central theme. The KR-CRB futures index ( which includes energy prices ) has trended down from 1995 , but ticked up with energy prices early in 1999 before cooling in mid-2000. Similarly , as shown in Chart 6 , popular indices of industrial materials prices ( which also include energy prices ) generally trended down after 1994 but ticked up with energy prices in 1999 and early 2000 before cooling in mid-2000.23 Apparently , the recent energy price increase generated some heightened inflationary expectations during 1999. Abstracting from the effects of energy prices , therefore , for the most part these commodity price indices signaled that from the mid-1990s , core inflationary pressures were benign with no significant resurgence of inflation expected. These indictors , therefore , suggested that monetary policy remained in an anti-inflation mode during the second half of the 1990s. They served as accurate forerunners of the persistent lower trends in core inflation as measured , for example , by core CPI ( as depicted in Chart 3 ) . </signal.v.15><signal.v.16>One prevailing hypothesis implies steroidal glycosides act directly upon the hypothalamus , triggering a message that blood glucose is high.5 This is an effect related to the glucostatic mechanism of weight control.6 Animal experiments found intracerebroventricular injection of hoodia extracts ( termed " P57AS3 " by Phytopharm PLC ) resulted in increased ATP content or production in the hypothalamus , which may be a signal for the energysensing of satiety. Specific receptors for the steroidal glycoside ( P57 ) have not been identified in the rat brain , but administration of these compounds into the brain reduces food intake by a factor of up to 60 percent and increases the content of ATP hypothalamic neurons of the rat by up to 150 percent. The sensing of energy input by the hypothalamus may be signaled by increases in intracellular neuronal energy , in the form of ATP . </signal.v.16><signal.v.17> 1 is much more important than 2. No matter how long you signal prior to moving , the requirement to comply with 1 is still there . </signal.v.17><signal.v.18>After practicing in parked vehicles , participants were instructed to Say Two for Thank You ( meaning use the hazard lights to blink two times as the signal for thank you ) while driving whenever they observed courteous behavior displayed by other drivers. Typically , a participant would give a signal to change lanes. If the other driver slowed or motioned approval to enter the lane , the participant would change lanes and then use the hazard light to blink twice. Some incidents occurred in parking lots where participants could signal to other drivers thank you when they were able to enter a space vacated by the other driver. No opportunities to communicate the coded messages for I am sorry ( three blinks ) or please send help ( four blinks ) were recorded . </signal.v.18><signal.v.19>It is an error for output escaping to be disabled for a text node that is used for something other than a text node in the result tree. Thus , it is an error to disable output escaping for an xsl : value-of or xsl : text element that is used to generate the string-value of a comment , processing instruction or attribute node; it is also an error to convert a result tree fragment to a number or a string if the result tree fragment contains a text node for which escaping was disabled. In both cases , an XSLT processor may signal the error; if it does not signal the error , it must recover by ignoring the disable-output-escaping attribute . </signal.v.19><signal.v.20>Returns the element with the specified position , and replaces it with the specified void*. If the position is not less than the collection 's cardinality , err_coll_out_of_range is signaled. If the collection is not ordered , err_coll_not_supported is signaled . </signal.v.20><signal.v.21>The euro 's relative strength index against the dollar , a comparison of the magnitude of gains and losses , has been above 70 over the past three days. That 's a level that signals a currency may decline . </signal.v.21><signal.v.22>If I am in a vehicle , and signal a turn onto a side street , I would expect that a following car would slow down rather than come around me in an attempted pass. To attempt a pass is to invite a collision . </signal.v.22><signal.v.23>" A passenger signaled for a stop , and Mann began to pull over , thinking she had left Miller enough clearance , according to Hull 's police report. " O story </signal.v.23><signal.v.24>As a way of apologetically excusing oneself while simultaneously communicating that the action either contemplated or underway will not be impeded ( e.g. , someone suddenly in need of a visit to the powder room will abashedly raise the finger even as she speeds off to her destination ) . The meaning of the finger raise as practiced among Baptist and AME congregations most likely falls into the third category listed above , that of the apologetic excuse , the " Whoops , I 'm sorry but I really need to be attending to something else right now , but I promise to be back in two shakes of a lamb 's tail. " It therefore signals a self-generated act , not a permission gained from another . </signal.v.24><signal.v.25>How does hCG work and what does it do ? This hormone ( produced by pregnant females ) acts very much like LH , and it even closely resembles LH ( and FSH ) in chemical structure. So , administration of hCG sends a signal to the testes to start production of testosterone ( thus , hCG can help prevent testicular atrophy during a long cycle ) . However , remember that the testosterone produced can signal the hypothalamus to stop sending the signals to turn on the testes. So , hCG can be somewhat inhibiting to the natural process of hormone release. That is why many believe that hCG should not be used at the end of a cycle , when the desire is to stimulate natural production of hormones . </signal.v.25><signal.v.26>CGCG 219-066 -- Nebular and broad HeII 4686 emission is found according to Izotov et al.

I considered adding some sort of " continue " condition attribute that could be added to the tag. I also considered creating a child tag that could signal the break to the parent tag : </signal.v.27><signal.v.28>Criminals as well as terrorists signal illegal activity either unwittingly or perhaps in some cases with disdain and contempt for those who are positioned to watch for such behavior. The ability to detect that signal from the din of constant activity intrinsic to daily operations is crucial. Recognition and collection of the signal must be complemented by a robust analytical capability to match with similar signals to discern potential patterns of activity and generate operational leads. In large measure that capability is a key component of the existing and emergent fusion centers . </signal.v.28><signal.v.29>The weekly statistics , by their nature are more slow moving than the statistics based on daily data. The chart above throws some cold water on the positive tone of the daily data. When viewing the weekly data , it looks much more like the market has barely gotten up off the floor. Though some of the moving average and Aroon up-trend analysis are now positive , it is clear that a major bull market move has not yet been signaled . </signal.v.29><signal.v.30>It is important to remember that , since our railroad is not completely signaled yet , a train crew can not rely completely on signals to identify where blocks start and end. The locations of all CP 's are shown on our Route Maps , are also labeled on the control panels around the layout , and trackside are identified by white painted ties and posts at each block boundary. As you run your train down the mainline , you must not just be on the lookout for the next signal , you also must follow your map or observe the control panels , or watch for the next white painted tie to make sure you do n't overrun into the next block , if it happens to be unsignaled. You must get clearance from the dispatcher before entering any unsignaled block. In unsignaled territory , he is your " eyes " and knows whether those blocks ahead have a train in them or not . </signal.v.30><signal.v.31>Strong leadership from developed countries with firm and aggressive emissions reduction caps in the near-term ( e.g. , 2020 and 2030 ) and strong signals that they will significantly reduce emissions in the medium-term ( e.g. , 2050 ) . The Europeans have put forward their commitment ( last December ) , but other countries will need to signal their commitment if we are going to have any chance of a strong agreement in Copenhagen. Most of this aspect hinges on when the US will cap its emissions and how deep those cuts will be in the near-term. Some hints will emerge on the US front this Tuesday as Chairman Waxman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee will put forward a discussion draft . </signal.v.31><signal.v.32>IV.

Bit &lt; 28 &gt; inhibits the message associated with the condition value from being printed by the SYS $ EXIT system service. After using the SYS $ PUTMSG system service to display an error message , the system default handler sets this bit. It is also set in the condition value returned by a routine as a function value , if the routine has also signaled the condition , so that the condition has been either printed or suppressed. Bits &lt; 29 : 31 &gt; must be zero; they are reserved for Compaq . </signal.v.33><signal.v.34>As soon as the kickout is signaled by the referee , start the watch and let it run for 20 seconds of game time. Note also that since the shot clock is reset to 30 seconds after a kickout , the period of exclusion ends if the shot clock reaches 10 seconds . </signal.v.34><signal.v.35>CProcessThreadMonitor is the thread that waits on the created by the driver event to be signaled. As soon as a process has been created or ended up , the driver signals this event object and CProcessThreadMonitor 's thread wakes up. Then the user mode application retrieves the data from the driver. Next , the data is appended to queue container ( CQueueContainer ) using its method Append ( ) . </signal.v.35><signal.v.36>Coordinated displays are widely used among animals to defend shared resources , and may signal coalition strength so that groups can assess the relative competitive ability of rivals and avoid unnecessary fights. For example , lions roar in choruses that provide information about their group 's size to intimidate rivals , as do gibbons , chimpanzees , and wolves , Hall said . </signal.v.36><signal.v.37>An independent sequence for each class is becoming increasingly common. In our example the Race Officer could have waited to signal the Warning + Preparatory signal for class B until well after the starting signal for class A. The type of sequence to be used must stated in the sailing instructions , if a continuous sequence is being used , subsequent starts may be delayed by signaling a postponement for the relevant classes This signal may , but has not necessarily be given with the starting signal for the preceding class. So the Race Officer may adjust for changing conditions ( bearing or length of the starting line ) and vary the gap between classes depending on relative speeds . </signal.v.37><signal.v.38>The Quick-term Indicant signaled sell for QID on March 26 , 2009. It is down 57.0 since then. The Quick-term Indicant will not signal buy until it contacts the bearish yellow curve , which is valued at $ 25.22 and still falling . </signal.v.38><signal.v.39>In elk , a sparring match among equals is signaled by a careful approach with lowered head , the antlers performing slow side-to-side movements. The initiator thus solicits a sparring match; he does not advance in a dominance display , but signals with intention movements. Soliciting also may include nodding , which bobs the antlers forward. Nodding probably occurs only among well-acquainted bulls. Significantly , the soliciting animal does not spread its legs noticeably or crouch as if anticipating a forceful lunge. The antlers may be engaged slowly , with weaving motions of the head; such motions may be conspicuous when the partners are several feet apart. McCullough ( 1969 ) observed these motions in elk sparring at a bush between them. Once engaged , the opponents push and twist heads. Disengagement is honored , during which one or both bulls avert their eyes , acting as if looking into the distance. Eye aversion as a temporary cut-off in sparring appears to be wide-spread among ruminants. One of the bulls may remain standing with lowered head until the other again squares off . </signal.v.39><signal.v.40>An important signal exercised by the driver is one communicating that the boat is turning around. This is most often signaled by pointing the arm up in a 90 degree angle and rotating the forearm and hand around in wide circles. Be sure to give your skier plenty of warning before you turn so they may position themselves behind the boat where they feel most comfortable. Aggressive skiers usually want to be outside the wake to create speed , and non-aggressive skiers generally stay right behind the boat for a more controlled and slower ride . </signal.v.40><signal.v.41>When an error is signaled , Emacs 's default reaction is to print an error message and terminate execution of the current command. This is the right thing to do in most cases , such as if you type C-f at the end of the buffer . </signal.v.41><signal.v.42>Pop quiz : what percentage of cyclists do you think can comfortably , safely and reliably take a hand off the bars to signal and look back for two seconds without veering off course ? Despite the fact that one can learn to do this with just a few minutes of practice , I 'd be genuinely surprised if 25 of the cyclists out there can do it , and would n't be surprise if the number is less than 10 . When was the last time you tested yourself on this ? </signal.v.42><signal.v.43>The agent in the above example signals a " ping " event asking anyone who hears this message to give a location. Then , using with-signal , the agent waits for a " ping " reply. When one comes in , the agent tests whether the sender of the reply is the same type of agent as itself. If yes , the agent ignores the current reply and waits for the next one , otherwise , the agent logs information about the reply. Notice that the with-signal is in a race condition with a five-minute timer. If with-signal completes before the timer , the timer stops. But because the race condition itself is in a loop-forever form , the agent begins listening again for another reply , and the five-minute timer starts again. If five minutes go by without a reply , the WHO-THERE procedure fails itself . </signal.v.43><signal.v.44>file_name , if supplied , should be the name of the source file containing the call to create ( ) . It is used only if an error is signaled during query analysis. Its sole purpose is to allow the resulting error message to make reference to the source file containing the code that caused an error . </signal.v.44><signal.v.45>Nevertheless , the automatic , involuntary expression of many emotions is a key feature of the biology and social life of our species , and their presence provides powerful evidence that ancestral humans spent a large portion of their time with close cooperators , as opposed to antagonists and competitors. Indeed , species ought to vary in the magnitude of automatic emotion signaling , and in which emotions are signaled , based on the social ecology of the species. Highly cooperative social species , such as canids , are expected to ( and appear to ) have a rich repertoire of emotion signals , while more solitary species , such as felids , should have fewer emotion signals . </signal.v.45><signal.v.46>The global economic recovery and surging commodity prices are fanning inflation , prompting countries from Australia to Vietnam to raise borrowing costs. Philippine growth accelerated to the fastest pace in a year last quarter , a report showed yesterday , and the central bank signaled it may require banks to set aside more money as reserves . </signal.v.46><signal.v.47>9.1 The course for each race will be signaled with code flags flown from a halyard on the Committee boat. The code flags will correspond to one of the course configurations shown as follows and will be displayed before the warning Signal of the first division to start . </signal.v.47><signal.v.48>Fashion functions , in a way , by turning what might otherwise be conventional , unreliable signals into reliable assessment signals. What clothes you choose to wear , what music you advertise liking - these things are conventional signals. However , fashion adds another layer of signaling - by making these conventional signals , you are making the harder to fake signal of " I know what is hip to signal today " . Anyone can fake the outward conventional signals , but they do n't know to do it . </signal.v.48><signal.v.49>Lines with two tracks and CTC are like two-lane highways on which passing is allowed : with the tracks signaled for movement in both directions , the dispatcher can run a fast train around a slow train without stopping either one.

Moore ( Cambridge : Cambridge University Press , forthcoming ) . </signal.v.50><signal.v.51>It might also be useful to know the velocity of a mechanical stimulus , i.e. , the rate of change of displacement or force. In order to signal velocity , a receptor must either increase or decrease its rate of discharge with increases in stimulus velocity. An example of this behavior is shown for a Meissner 's corpuscle in glabrous skin in Figure 5-3 where receptor discharge frequency is plotted on the ordinate against indentation velocity on the abscissa. The relationship between these two variables is clearly nonlinear ( this is a log-log plot ) , although the velocity of the stimulus is encoded in the discharge frequency ( 3 ) . Hair receptors also encode the velocity of hair displacement by increasing frequency with increasing velocity. It is normally assumed that a receptor that signals displacement magnitude can not also signal velocity; however , there is no evidence to support this assumption. Slowly adapting receptors , both types I and II , encode displacement velocity in their discharge frequency , and they must be considered as candidates for velocity receptors . </signal.v.51><signal.v.52>Closing the Door : This is a traffic-blocking move , designed to keep other types of traffic out of the Line. Once signaled by the Road Captain to " Close the Door " , the Drag Bike slips into the adjoining lane. The rest of the Line stays right where they are. The Drag Bike effectively closes the door against potential passing vehicles and gives the Line freedom to complete whatever maneuver required closing the door in the first place. The Road Captain initiates this technique by either a turn or hand signal. The signal is passed back to the Drag Bike , who acknowledges the signal and then performs the lane change , closing the door ' to traffic behind the line. Once the Drag Bike closes the door , the Road Captain again signals the lane change and the entire line shifts safety. As a note , The Road Captain may signal the Drag Bike ( s ) to close the door on traffic behind the Line if he intends to turn or perform other maneuvers where having no traffic behind the Line is a safety concern . </signal.v.52><signal.v.53>Not memory translate.

In 1995 , and 1997 , Oregon index signaled to recessions that did n't actually occur. While the index declines satisfied the 2 rule , several unusual influences were leading the model astray. The 1995 signal corresponded with the start of the index data series. Incorrect signals tend to occur where the model ca n't compare the current period with prior years. Second , the Asian financial crisis hit Oregon specific trading partners. From 1997 to 1998. This overseas shot did n't trigger a full-blown recession , but initial uncertainties were apparently enough to startle or announce business community and trigger the Oregon index. To avoid these sorts of false warnings , analysts use the Oregon index in light of economic trends in the state , the nation , and the international community . </signal.v.57><signal.v.58>Stochastic was near 40 i.e. closer to oversold region ( oversold region is below 20 ) .

It can be used to avoid executing any code that may cause a run-time error if an error has already occurred.

In the problem scenario , the PME_EN bit takes effect first , signaling PME on the PCI bus. Then , the event is immediately cleared by the PME_STATUS bit , and PME is no longer signaled on the PCI bus . </signal.v.64><signal.v.65>Now check out a chart from year 2000 - 2003 below.

For instance , if the period was 20 , then each time a TRUE signal occurred , then the result would be the price 20 bars ahead , minus the price of the current bar. This option allows you to peek into the future with historical data to see how your signals would perform given a specific period of time. If there are insufficient bars ahead of the signaled bar , then the profit/loss will be computed based on the last bar ( price of last bar minus price of signaled bar ) . </signal.v.66><signal.v.67>Since no firing rate can be reduced below zero , there comes a point at which the speed of the head turn exceeds the firing rate change that can reliably signal head velocity. It is also too fast for the pursuit and optokinetic systems to track the shift in the visual environment. The inaccurate vestibular data causes a transient moment of spatial disorientation that lasts a second or so with the rapid head turn . </signal.v.67><signal.v.68>NGC 4214 -- WR signatures in this galaxy were found independently by Mas-Hesse &amp;Kunth ( 1991; cf. also 1998 ) and Sargent &amp;Fillippenko ( 1991 ) . The observations of the former show a broad WR bump around 4650 and CIV 5808 due to WC stars.

The release of hormones by the anterior pituitary is driven by neurosecretory cells located in the hypothalamus. When the hypothalamus receives a signal for the need of a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary , it sends releasing hormones through short portal vessels and into a second capillary network within the anterior pituitary , where it acts on a specific hormone. Besides releasing stimulatory hormones the hypothalamus also releases inhibiting hormones which prevent the release of certain hormones from the anterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary produces and releases several different hormones with many different functions. Its hormones range from growth hormones that act on bones , to prolactin which stimulates mammary glands. A unique function of those hormones released by the anterior posterior , is that some of them act on other endocrine glands and signal them to produce and release other hormones. Tropic hormones are responsible for this , such as thyroid stimulating hormone which stimulates the thyroid and its production of hormones . </signal.v.85><signal.v.86>When you signal an error , you specify an error symbol to specify the kind of error you have in mind.

The conditions favoring signaling an emotion are hard to meet , so only some emotions out of the total species-typical set are associated with distinctive , species-typical facial expressions. There should be a larger set of emotions that have no automatic display. Jealousy , guilt , or boredom are all genuine emotions lacking distinctive signals. This changes the question from : Why are emotions automatically signaled ? to Why are some emotions automatically signaled ? When selection is neutral , the signs of an emotion should only be the byproducts of whatever is necessary to run the emotion program , without any selection to make the cues informative. When selection disfavors others knowing the organism 's internal state , selection should suppress and obscure external cues identifying internal states. Precisely because they publicly signal themselves , our attention goes disproportionately to the subset of emotions that do come equipped with emotional expressions. We think it likely that this had an impact on the history of emotion research . </signal.v.121><signal.v.122>Adds the specified instance of E to the collection for which the function was called.

This is not likely , however. First , although they were discriminable by shape , the cross and vertical-line signals were a similar color and brightness. Second , during early training , pigeons were indifferent to high- and low-probability or magnitude signals. Owing to their extensive prior training in a standard DMTS procedure with delays ranging from 1 s to 12 s , the main effect of interpolating signals in the retention interval during preliminary training was a gradual reduction in accuracy on trials where the low reinforcer probability was signaled. This suggests that any effect of the signal must be based not on its stimulus properties , but on its behavioral significance. Furthermore , in a related procedure that followed Experiment 2 , briefly reversing the signals began to reverse their effects. Thus the effect of the signal appears to be due to its ability to predict reinforcement , not due to any disruptive properties . </signal.v.126><signal.v.127>To determine whether TCR signaling improved IL-7 signaling in DP thymocytes , we initially prestimulated IL-7RTg ZAP70 / DP thymocytes for 3 h with the pharmacologic mimic of TCR signaling , PMA , and ionomycin ( P+I ) and then assessed their subsequent ability to respond to IL-7 by up-regulating expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein. Because in vitro P+I stimulation for &lt; 12 h is insufficient to signal positive selection ( 17 , 19 ) , prestimulation of DP thymocytes with P+I for 3 h in our present experiment did not itself up-regulate either Bcl-2 mRNA or Bcl-2 protein ( Fig. 5 B ) . However , prestimulation with P+I substantially augmented the ability of DP thymocytes to subsequently respond to IL-7 , as indicated by a 3 4-fold increase in both Bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein expression ( Fig. 5 B ) . Thus , TCR signaling down-regulates SOCS-1 expression and improves IL-7 signaling in preselection DP thymocytes . </signal.v.127><signal.v.128>The concept is simple : text in , signals out.

Specifically , overall more accurate performance at all retention intervals results when larger or more probable reinforcers for correct matching are signaled. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that these effects can be generated when the reinforcer signal is presented after the sample has been presented.

The I/O circuit receives the source signal and causes the source signal to be propagated to the I/O pad.

Unlike prior studies , however , the signal for reinforcer duration was presented after the sample had been presented ( like the signal in Experiment 1 ) . This ensured that differential sample responding could not occur because the signal for reinforcer duration was unpredictable at the time the sample was presented. Previously , differential sample responding had been implicated in both the signaled magnitude ( Jones et al. , 1995; Nevin &amp;Grosch , 1990 ) and differential outcomes ( Jones &amp;White , 1994 ) effects. Additionally , in the present experiment the signal was turned off as soon as the choice stimuli were presented. That is , the signal was not displayed during either the sample or the choice , and therefore the duration of signal presentation exactly equaled the arranged retention interval duration . </signal.v.144><signal.v.145>It is an error if this leaves more than one match.

Sometimes it is possible that price may have gone up or down significantly on the day of the valid trading signal. So we have a choice here : Instead of taking an immediate action at the Open price of the next day , we can wait for the stock to come back a little over the next day or two ( We call this Pull-back in prices ) . If you decide to wait , you should be aware of the risk in this choice. It is likely that the stock may not get as much pull-back as we might have expected. So for a trade at a more favorable rate , we risk to miss the profit opportunity signaled by our trading system.

If the program runs for a little longer , we shall see the wake-up cycle. The following is the History Graph window. The first tag pair ( i.e. , CY and CA ) appeared near the end of the previous History Graph window. When thread DriverThread signals condition variable Wake , thread SleeperThread1 is released , which , in turn , signals condition variable Wake , causing thread SleeperThread2 to be released. This chain reaction continues , until thread SleeperThread6 is released. It signals condition variable Wake. However , since all threads have been released , this signal is lost and thread SleeperThread6 yields the monitor. Meanwhile , all sleeper threads are inactive because they all executed a condition variable signal. Consequently , the driver thread is reactivated ( i.e. , the MR tag ) and then exits ( i.e. , the ME tag ) . This causes the monitor to become empty , and , as a result , one of the inactive sleeper threads re-enters and becomes active. The history bar shows that thread SleeperThread1 is the active one , because there is a MR tag on its history bar. After exits the monitor , the driver thread comes back to send in the next clock tick ( i.e. , the MB tag ) . </signal.v.153><signal.v.154>The return value indicates success or failure of the operation.

Recent studies indicate that most of these fibers do not , in fact , signal the static position of the limb. This is because they fail to discharge at any position but the extremes of flexion and extension. In addition , anesthetizing the human knee joint does not diminish position sense for that joint. It appears that the most likely candidate for signaling joint angle would be the muscle spindle receptors or group Ia or II afferent fibers ( these will be discussed in detail in Chapter 11 ) . </signal.v.164><signal.v.165>This statistic works identically to " Price At Last Signal " except a period is provided to allow access to the price of bars before or after the signaled bar.

For timeouts , the Game Timekeeper blows the whistle at the 45 second mark and at the 60 second mark. The Game Timekeeper signals the re-entry of players on a kickout with white or blue flags , if the player has not already been waved back in by the referee before the 20-second kickout has expired. The Game Timekeeper signals the permanent exclusion of players after three kickouts with a red flag and , if a player enters illegally at any time during the game , the Game Timekeeper signals this with a red flag and a whistle to stop play. If a coach has called for an extra timeout and the referee has awarded it , the Game Timekeeper should blow the whistle to inform the referee that the timeout is illegal. Referees will sometimes ignore coaches when they know the timeout is illegal and in such case the coach usually figures it out and stops demanding the timeout . </signal.v.176><signal.v.177>[ 0036 ] The position of the switching contact 9 on the card holder is signaled at the CCIN input 10.

History shouts , " YES ! " Chart 1 shows that a year-over-year contraction in the quarterly average LEI has heralded every recession ( vertically shaded areas ) since that of 1960 , yielding only one false signal. That false signal occurred in late 1966 through early 1967. Back then , this period of economic turbulence was called the " mini-recession of 1967. " An official recession was never named for this period but the pace of economic activity did slow. Real GDP just did not contract - perhaps because of series Fed rate cuts commencing early in 1967. Notice also in Chart 1 that after the first quarter the year-over-year change in the LEI is negative , successive quarters also are negative. In other words , the LEI has not given any " head-fakes " after it first signals a recession . </signal.v.203><signal.v.204>" There is a need to ensure that inflationary expectations are managed appropriately , " says ICICI Bank managing director and CEO Chanda Kochhar.

When an action potential is propagated to a motor neuron axon terminal , it depolarizes it , which opens voltage-sensitive calcium channels allowing Ca2+ in the extracellular fluid to enter the axon terminal. This entry of Ca2+ signals the release of ACh from the vesicles in the axon terminal . </signal.v.205><signal.v.206>It 's more expensive to install than ABS , but it has great benefits in terms of capacity and efficiency.

Subsequent price gains led the tenkan/conversion line to cross over the kijun/base line , generating a weak buy signal. Extreme gains followed ( so much for the weak buy signal ) and all pullback attempts were contained by the tenkan/conversion line on a daily closing basis. The rally eventually stalled at point E , followed by prices dropping back through the tenkan/conversion line , which then limited attempts to rally , signaling a likely drop to the kijun/base line next. The kijun/base line was broken on an intraday basis , at point F , but ultimately held on a daily closing basis . </signal.v.209><signal.v.210>Aspen Trading Group provides specific trade recommendations and intra-day commentary on the FX market.

Some of his learning disability and AD/HD problems were overlooked because society generally is more tolerant of quirky behavior in creative artists. But Roger often failed to get important contracts in projects for which his talent and creativity seemed to make him a clear choice. It seems that among Roger 's LD-AD/HD related problems was great difficulty in reading social signals and body language. He was unable to interpret the signals given in an interview or during a design presentation which signaled that the interview was over , and that he should thank the interviewer for his time and leave. In other words , Roger overstayed his welcome and often talked himself out of a job . </signal.v.211><signal.v.212>Signaling theory provides a framework for researchers to formulate new hypotheses about the communicative function of behavior. It suggests new avenues of investigation : For example , if frequent profile updating is hypothesized to signal status , then an interesting study would be to examine whether frequent updaters are more influential. The signaling model can also suggest ways of communicating concerns about the behavior. If reducing risky activity is the goal , distinguishing among different possible motivations is needed to counteract them. In the example of users posting overly revealing information , learning about the consequences can alter the behavior of those users who were simply unaware of the danger ( Lenhart &amp;Madden , 2007b ) . However , if courting risks is done to signal imperviousness to danger , exhortations from others to be careful are counterproductive , in that raising perception of the act as risky increases its value as a signal of daring ( Donath , in press ) . In such situations , making the behavior seem foolish rather than dangerous can be a better approach . </signal.v.212><signal.v.213>The British frigate Sirius ( opens in a new window ) made the signal 370 , 'Enemy 's ships are coming out of port ' , which was repeated along the chain of ships until it reached the main fleet.

This is where the synchronization between the producer and consumers is done. Init_data allocates a mutex and two condition variables. It also initializes an array of integers ( used as Boolean values ) to ensure a single access to each filled buffer. A 0 value signifies that the consumer has not accessed the buffer. Wait_for_consumers ( called by the producer ) simply blocks until all the readers have finished. Signal_consumers resets the done_flags and broadcasts to the consumers to perform their tasks. Signal_producer increments the readers_done count when another consumer is done. If all the consumers are done , it signals the producer with the write_cond. It also sets the done_flag to 1 to prevent this consumer from reading again. Wait_for_producer prevents the consumer from getting the same buffer by checking the value of the done_flag . </signal.v.221><signal.v.222>Evidently home country is not a strong predictor of disposition to initiate negotiation since Irish and German students initiated similar numbers of negotiations ( 51 Irish-initiated to 44 German-initiated ) .

I would understand if the other referrees signaled touchdown and then this referree explained the holding and it was called back , but the same referree making both calls ?

When the last skater in the pack passes the pivot line , the jam timer blows two quick whistle blasts to start the jammers. Now the jammers start their initial pass. The first jammer to get through the pack without having committed a penalty is the lead jammer , which is signaled when the jam ref blows the whistle twice and makes an " L " shape with their hand extended up in the air. The other jam ref will signal that their jammer is not the lead by waving their hands back and forth across each other with a " no " motion. For the rest of the jam , the lead jammer 's jam ref will point to the jammer with their right hand.

Any procedure operating at any Core-OMAR node ( including the local simulator ) in the network and waiting for that event is activated as a result. Signal-event-external works in conjunction with the following SCORE forms for receiving a signal : asynch-wait , with-signal , and with-multiple-signals. The simulator uses hash tables to track procedures waiting for events to happen -- the event-table for asynch-waits and the waiting-table for with-signal and with-multiple-signals. These tables , together with the SCORE forms for generating and receiving a signal , provide the mechanism for coordinating the execution of procedures . </signal.v.231><signal.v.232>Wait for a signal from the driver before beginning to cross the road.

" The ability of unselected DP thymocytes to die by neglect permits thymocytes with appropriate TCR specificities to be the only ones to survive and to differentiate into functionally mature T cells. However , the ability of DP thymocytes to die by neglect requires the absence of prosurvival factors such as Bcl-2 and glucose transporter 1 , which can be induced by signals from prosurvival cytokines ( IL-2 , -4 , -6 , -7 , and -15 ) ( 34 ) . As a result , death by neglect requires that DP thymocytes fail to be signaled by prosurvival cytokines . </signal.v.236><signal.v.237>The CPU indicates the remaining number of bytes to be transferred to a peripheral device on the data bus using SIZ1 and SIZ0.

The road was blocked by other apparatus , so the victim ' s crew began backing to an intersection approximately 300 feet away in order to proceed forward. The victim took her position on the tailboard as the Tailboard Safety Member and signaled the driver to begin backing. A Captain acting as the Traffic Control Officer guided the backing operation from the road on the driver ' s side , behind the apparatus , by using hand signals. When the Captain turned and walked into the intersection to stop cross-traffic , the victim apparently fell from the tailboard and was run over by the engine.

Posttranscriptional degradation of preexisting coreceptor RNAs was evident in signaled DP thymocytes within 1 to 3 h of stimulation and for CD8 was shown to be dependent on target sequences present in the noncoding regions of coreceptor RNA molecules. Coreceptor transcription was also affected by TCR-CD2 signaling in DP thymocytes , with transient reduction of CD4 gene transcription but termination of CD8 gene transcription. Thus , the present study demonstrated that posttranscriptional as well as transcriptional regulatory mechanisms can be signaled in DP thymocytes and that both regulatory mechanisms function in concert to effect the rapid conversion of signaled DP thymocytes into intermediate CD4+CD8 thymocytes . </signal.v.276><signal.v.277>I guess it 's not surprising that the last few quarters of mail volume data have all signaled " sell.

The neuronal mechanisms supporting action evaluation and subsequent behavioral modification , however , remain poorly understood. To investigate the contribution of posterior cingulate cortex ( CGp ) to these processes , we recorded activity of single neurons in monkeys performing a gambling task in which the reward outcome of each choice strongly influenced subsequent choices. We found that CGp neurons signaled reward outcomes in a nonlinear fashion and that outcome-contingent modulations in firing rate persisted into subsequent trials. Moreover , firing rate on any one trial predicted switching to the alternative option on the next trial. Finally , microstimulation in CGp following risky choices promoted a preference reversal for the safe option on the following trial. Collectively , these results demonstrate that CGp directly contributes to the evaluative processes that support dynamic changes in decision making in volatile environments . </signal.v.288><signal.v.289>file-reference The name of a file constant or file variable for which the ENDFILE ON-unit is established.

This includes attention to the choice ( but note that the signal was turned off during the choice in Experiment 2 ) , and to facilitatory or mediating behaviors during the retention interval. In standard signaled magnitude and probability experiments , but not in the present experiments , attention to the task as a whole might also include attention to the sample. Such an interpretation is consistent with Nevin and Grosch 's ( 1990 ) and Jones et al.

In this way , they participate in synaptic integration , and thus in the probability of generating succeeding action potentials , in a shape-dependent way. Here we test whether the different action potential waveforms produced during dynamical stimulation in a single cortical neuron carry information about the conductance stimulus history. When pyramidal neurons in rat visual cortex were driven by a conductance stimulus that resembles natural synaptic input , somatic action potential waveforms showed a large variability that reliably signaled the history of the input for up to 50 ms before the spike. The correlation between stimulus history and action potential waveforms had low noise , resulting in information rates that were three to four times larger than for the instantaneous spike rate. The reliable correlation between stimulus history and spike waveforms then acts as a local encoding at the single-cell level. It also directly affects neuronal communication as different waveforms influence the production of succeeding spikes via differential shunting of synaptic charge. Modeling was used to show that slow conductances can implement memory of the stimulus history in cortical neurons , encoding this information in the spike shape . </signal.v.300><signal.v.301>The dollar snapped seven days of losses against the euro on speculation the currency 's 1.6 percent decline over the past month was too fast as the Federal Reserve signaled it may have finished cutting interest rates . </signal.v.301><signal.v.302>any_ptr t_wait ( Condition cond ) The calling thread blocks , waiting for some other thread to signal the condition ( using t_sig below ) .

Because SOCS-1 directly binds to JAKs and inhibits all further downstream signaling events , we reasoned that constitutive SOCS-1 expression would also prevent IL-7 from signaling an increase in the cell size of IL-7RTg DP thymocytes. Indeed , overnight stimulation with IL-7 failed to signal IL-7R+ DP thymocytes from IL-7RTg SOCS-1+/+ mice to increase cell size ( Fig. 4 E ) . In contrast , IL-7R+ DP thymocytes with decreased SOCS-1 expression responded to IL-7 by increasing their cell size , as IL-7 induced the forward light scatter of DP thymocytes from IL-7RTg SOCS-1/ mice to increase by 50 ( Fig. 4 E ) . Thus , constitutive SOCS-1 expression contributed to suppression of IL-7mediated PI3 kinase activation in DP thymocytes. Interestingly , these data also reveal that the uniquely small cell volume of DP thymocytes is due , at least in part , to absent IL-7 signaling. We conclude that high SOCS-1 expression impairs IL-7 signal transduction in preselection DP thymocytes , although other factors also contribute . </signal.v.305><signal.v.306>Next , the two Timesmen go on to list some potential nominees on whom speculation immediately centered.

Here , we compare signal condition dependence in P. dominulus and P. fuscatus. We reared colonies of both species under 2 nutritional conditions : 1 ) free foraging and 2 ) with supplemental food. We predict that larval diet will not influence the development of identity signals in P. fuscatus. In strong contrast , we predict that larval nutrition will influence quality signal development in P. dominulus. Polistes dominulus larvae reared with supplemental food are expected to develop color patterns associated with signaling higher levels of quality than larvae reared without supplemental protein . </signal.v.308><signal.v.309>The Pound reversed earlier gains from a better than expected employment report as the BoE signaled more rate cuts in its quarterly report as it lowered its forecast for growth and inflation as the country is in a deep recession .

Because in vitro P+I stimulation for &lt; 12 h is insufficient to signal positive selection ( 17 , 19 ) , prestimulation of DP thymocytes with P+I for 3 h in our present experiment did not itself up-regulate either Bcl-2 mRNA or Bcl-2 protein ( Fig. 5 B ) . However , prestimulation with P+I substantially augmented the ability of DP thymocytes to subsequently respond to IL-7 , as indicated by a 34-fold increase in both Bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein expression ( Fig. 5 B ) . Thus , TCR signaling down-regulates SOCS-1 expression and improves IL-7 signaling in preselection DP thymocytes . </signal.v.319><signal.v.320>But the start of growth often depends on another signal as well.

I/O operations that access registers within PCI targets typically have only a single data phase. Memory transfers that move blocks of data consist of multiple data phases that read or write multiple consecutive memory locations. Both the initiator and target may terminate a bus transfer sequence at any time. The initiator signals completion of the bus transfer by deasserting the FRAME signal during the last data phase. A target may terminate a bus transfer by asserting the STOP signal. When the initiator detects an active STOP signal , it must terminate the current bus transfer and re-arbitrate for the bus before continuing. If STOP is asserted without any data phases completing , the target has issued a retry. If STOP is asserted after one or more data phases have successfully completed , the target has issued a disconnect . </signal.v.339><signal.v.340>The async_data is the argument to the functions async_invoke and async_free.

He resumed holding services soon after the storm , issued calls to return to his far-flung congregants , and engaged the media to alert the public to his community ' s swift return. These efforts sent a powerful signal to those who had not yet come back that the community would indeed rebound , mitigating the collective-action problem evacuees faced regarding if and when to return. The well-attended worship services also signaled to government officials that the members of this community intended to come back and rebuild. This prevented the city from going ahead with its plans to bulldoze the entire community in order to build a park.

Importantly , CD4 transcription persisted at 25 of its initial rate and increased when signaling ceased. In contrast , CD8 transcription was terminated in signaled DP thymocytes and did not increase upon cessation of signaling , accounting for conversion of signaled DP thymocytes into intermediate CD4+CD8 cells. The control regions that regulate CD4 and CD8 gene transcription have been intensely investigated and found to be highly complex ( 1 , 6-8 , 12-14 , 27 , 29 , 31 ) . Of particular interest is the existence in the CD4 control region of a functional silencer element that appears to be necessary for terminating CD4 gene transcription , since no similar silencer element appears to be necessary for terminating CD8 gene transcription ( 12-14 ) . Thus , it is interesting to speculate that the selective termination of CD8 gene transcription that occurs in TCR-CD2-signaled DP thymocytes may reflect the fact that termination of CD8 gene transcription , unlike termination of CD4 gene transcription , can be accomplished without specific activation of a silencer element . </signal.v.387><signal.v.388>Most general-purpose run-time library routines handle errors by returning a status in R0.

They become powerful when they are unanimous these conditions have always occurred together during or just prior to recessions , and they have only occurred together during or just prior to recessions. Apart from the survey measures in the fourth condition ( the ISM Purchasing Managers Index and U.S. employment ) , the most reliable evidence for an oncoming recession is based on financial market indicators. It is the forward-looking aspect of market action that produces a timely risk signal.

Several formal studies investigating the usefulness of various forms of economic statistics conclude that market price data are superior to other forms of data.21 Furthermore , they are forward-looking and can signal future changes in inflation and inflationary expectations.

Because SOCS-1 directly binds to JAKs and inhibits all further downstream signaling events , we reasoned that constitutive SOCS-1 expression would also prevent IL-7 from signaling an increase in the cell size of IL-7RTg DP thymocytes. Indeed , overnight stimulation with IL-7 failed to signal IL-7R+ DP thymocytes from IL-7RTg SOCS-1+/+ mice to increase cell size ( Fig. 4 E ) . In contrast , IL-7R+ DP thymocytes with decreased SOCS-1 expression responded to IL-7 by increasing their cell size , as IL-7 induced the forward light scatter of DP thymocytes from IL-7RTg SOCS-1 / mice to increase by 50 ( Fig. 4 E ) . Thus , constitutive SOCS-1 expression contributed to suppression of IL-7 mediated PI3 kinase activation in DP thymocytes. Interestingly , these data also reveal that the uniquely small cell volume of DP thymocytes is due , at least in part , to absent IL-7 signaling. We conclude that high SOCS-1 expression impairs IL-7 signal transduction in preselection DP thymocytes , although other factors also contribute . </signal.v.399><signal.v.400>NEVER perform maneuvers in a Line unless instructed by the Road Captain , Blockers or Drag Bikes.

In each case the first two figures indicate degrees; the last two , minutes. When making a signal , each of the two groups of figures would be joined and preceded by the letter P. P4027 , P7400 would thus indicate a position in latitude 40 degrees 27 minutes , longitude 74 degrees 00 minutes . </signal.v.401><signal.v.402>NAGWS : A discrete signal of a backrow attack indicates that the player was a backrow player. The R2 believes that the ball was above the plane of the net. If the ball is set and then legally blocked , it is the responsibility of the R1 to judge whether or not the ball was traveling in the direction of the setter 's teammate prior to going over the net. Therefore , the R2 must signal if there is any judgment required about the flight of the ball . </signal.v.402><signal.v.403>She was straddling the yellow line trying to get past them , while they were signaling left.

This is handled by having the time relate to the instant when the signal is hauled down and , if this is done smartly , the time can be checked to a split second. If the message happened to be in Morse , the exact instant would be indicated by sending a long ( 5-second ) dash after the time signal , the end of it synchronized with the exact time which the four-numeral signal expresses . </signal.v.404><signal.v.405>Finally touching the body with the hands can also express a meaning; the hand that flies to the mouth probably blocks a hasty statement. The hand that rubs the nape of the neck can be an expression of an unpleasant situation. Pulling the tip of the nose can accompany painful or incorrect statements. If the head is supported by thumb and index finger at the root of the nose , tiredness or exhaustion can be signaled. It may be that an attempt to continue concentrating is signaled if the ear lobe is taken between the thumb and index finger . </signal.v.405><signal.v.406>Tobias has a beef with those St. Louis motorists who fail to signal before switching lanes.

To check for a failure condition ( warning , error , or severe error ) , test the returned condition value for a logical value of false. The following program segment invokes the run-time library procedure LIB $ DATE_TIME , checks the returned condition value ( returned in the variable STATUS ) , and , if an error has occurred , signals the condition value by calling the run-time library procedure LIB $ SIGNAL ( Section 15.8 describes signaling ) : </signal.v.407><signal.v.408>Note that if ( typep condition *break-on-signals* ) is true , then the debugger will be entered prior to beginning the process of signaling.

The fire was then directed at the Don Antonio de Ulloa , and when it was found that she was sinking and deserted , the ship passed farther inside and opened fire upon the ships behind inner breakwater and whose masts were seen above government buildings. During the firing on the Ulloa a white flag with a Geneva cross was discovered in range with her , and I stood in further so as to get it out of range. After the first two or three shots fired through the public building at ships behind the mole , the Spanish flag was , at 12.30 p.m. , hauled down and a white flag run up. The surrender was immediately signaled to fleet and firing ceased . </signal.v.411><signal.v.412>Just as animals have two levels of signals , internal and external , there are two levels of interaction of this person+machine unit , one internal , the other external. Internal signals in a person tells of body states , but in the unit of person+machine , it tells the person the internal states of the machine. A machine signaling a person is n't really the same as a body conveying internal information to consciousness. The machine is performing a form of social communication between it and an outside agency , the person who is using or maintaining it. So the signals between machine and human have to be a combination of external , social signals and internal ones : Internal to the unit of person+machine , but external in the sense that the machine and the person are separate entities . </signal.v.412><signal.v.413>Fig. 4-10.

Under these circumstances there could be three of four row or column conductors arrange between the plate pairs AC and AB on a random engagement of the stylus with panel. On a rippling of the sense pulse through the conductors , the plate pairs AC and AB operate to select the one conductor closest to the mid-point therebetween so that a zero detect is signaled as before . </signal.v.419><signal.v.420>If pid is -1 and the user has super-user privileges , the signal is sent to all processes excluding system processes and the process sending the signal.

Because of this , biologists who use the phrase honest signals use it in a statistical sense. Biological signals , like warning calls or resplendent tail feathers , are considered honest if they are correlated with , or reliably predict , something useful to the receiver. In this usage , honesty is a useful correlation between the signal trait ( which economists call public information because it is readily apparent ) and the unobservable thing of value to the receiver ( which economists refer to as private information and biologists often refer to as quality ) . Honest biological signals do not need to be perfectly informative , reducing uncertainty to zero; they only need to be honest on average to be potentially useful [ 9 ] . Ultimately the value of the signaled information depends on the extent to which it allows the receiver to increase its fitness.

For example , DTMF is used to signal the dialed digits and the frequencies used are within the voice band ( see Table 1-1 ) . You can prove that DTMF uses in-band signaling by using a device , such as a computer , to generate the tones for each digit ( with correct pauses ) . Simply play the tones from the computer speaker down the mouthpiece of a touch-tone telephone. This allows you to dial a number without using the telephone keypad. Because the signaling is sent down the mouthpiece , you can be certain that it traveled within the user 's voice frequency range . </signal.v.428><signal.v.429>This is code processed with the safety optimization at its highest setting ( 3 ) . safety is a lexical property of code. The phrase " the function F should signal an error " means that if F is invoked from code processed with the highest safety optimization , an error is signaled.

These lower costs signaled to businesses and individuals that their current income would produce greater profits and well being. These signals induced more businesses and families to make New Jersey their home. The increase in business activity increased the jobs available in New Jersey and generated higher tax revenues . </signal.v.432><signal.v.433>Another matter requires attention. For three-quarters of a century , traffic lights have communicated the beginning of a clearance interval by going from green to yellow. Further , many lights have in the past few decades been programmed with a second clearance interval , signaled by going from yellow to red. Either way , there is a change of color. On the other hand , Kittelson 's proposal calls for changing from flashing yellow to steady yellow to indicate the beginning of the permissive turn clearance interval; this lack of color change is inconsistent with traditional signaling practice. In mitigation , Kittelson does recommend a signal with two yellow arrow sections , one strictly for flashing service and one strictly for steady; the shift from one signal section to another helps emphasize the beginning of clearance. However , we believe that this message can be delivered more simply and less subtly , as follows . </signal.v.433><signal.v.434>LIB $ SIG_TO_STOP can be enabled as a condition handler for a routine or be called from a condition handler.

Rather , they are a way to communicate with other drivers. The brake light means that the brakes are applied , which the other driver interprets to mean that the car is slowing down. Moreover , the other driver will usually search for a reason , some explanation of the brake lights. This means that the lights can serve a valuable communication purpose. On a long , normally non-congested highway , if the car in front of you applies its brake lights , it usually signals some unexpected obstruction or danger on the road , and it is usually wise to slow up and be more alert . </signal.v.435><signal.v.436>This double bottom signaled a possable end to the retracement against the stronger underlying uptrend , but we still needed more confirmation to signal a trade. At point number 2 , you have a arrow pointing to a reversal candle formation also known as a hammer formation. The psychology behind this candle is quite simple. The bears tried to make one push down and couldn ' t find any sellers and thus the price was rejected and a reversal candle formed. At that point the market now made a higher low , another confirmation point that is added to the candle formation , as well as the previous double bottom . </signal.v.436><signal.v.437>The only signal I have a question about are the ones at X.

For example , if a driver completes an IRP with an error status , the I/O Manager does not copy any data back to the user 's buffer , and it copies only the value of the Irp- &gt; IoStatus.Status field , not the value of the IoStatus.Information field. If a driver completes an IRP synchronously , the I/O Manager does not signal the event. If a driver completes an IRP asynchronously , the I/O Manager might or might not signal the event. Therefore , a driver that calls ZwReadFile , ZwDeviceIoControl , or similar ZwXxx routines should wait on the event only if the ZwXxx routine returns STATUS_PENDING . </signal.v.438><signal.v.439>This station was occupied by Capt.

They were able to establish flag signals with Taneytown but were never successful in opening flag signals with the Little Round Top station. Confederate troop movements were visible to include the initial formations massing for Pickett 's Charge. This information was signaled to Taneytown but not to the Round Top station. The signalmen at Little Round Top were clearly visible and Lieut. Fortescue sent a courier to the battlefield to tell Capt.

Though the SSI has incorrectly signaled that the GBP/USD may rally since 1.8000 , increasingly net-short positioning actually led our SSI-based currency trading signals to begin buying aggressively at 1.5430. The net-short or net-long signal is clearly important , but it is likewise important to watch for shifts in trader positioning as a signal for shifts in currency price movements. The ratio of long to short positions in the GBPUSD currently stands at -1.65 as nearly 62 of traders are short.

Again , ephemeral protein complexes attached to the relevant channels can be expected once signaling commences. The constituents of these transducons are likely to be Ca2+ receptors such as calmodulin , calmodulin binding proteins ( e.g. , kinesin , or microfilament-organizing proteins ) , and calcium-dependent protein kinases. The signaling complex can form around voltage-gated channels or the recently described cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels. Particular membrane lipids , scaffold proteins , and proton pumping ATPases also can act as nucleation sites and perhaps even as the attachment sites of microfilaments to membranes . </signal.v.447><signal.v.448>Another reason is probably that the plastic " cam " has broken a leg.

When a device has its BG signal asserted by the arbiter ( and BGACK is negated ) it asserts BGACK and negates BR. The arbiter responds by negating the BG signal going to the processor and waits for it to finish using the bus ( signaled by the processor negating BGACK ) .

What someone learns from stimuli will be greatly altered by emotion mode , because of attentional allocation , motivation , situation-specific inferential algorithms , and a host of other factors. Emotion mode will cause the present context to be divided up into situation-specific functionally appropriate categories so that the same stimuli and the same environment may be interpreted in radically different ways , depending on emotion state. For example , which stimuli are considered similar should be different in different emotion states , distorting the shape of the individual 's psychological " similarity space " ( Shepard 1987 ) .

Having the general right to occupy a lane , to move and turn left , etc. , does not mean a cyclist necessarily has the right to claim that right in a particular situation simply because he signaled. This too seems to be often not fully appreciated by many cyclists. Yet we know that when driving on a multilane road , signaling alone does not establish right of way to change lanes. If someone else is occupying that lane , or is in the process of passing you in that lane , you do n't have the right to cut into it just because you signaled; and if you do , and a crash results , it 's your fault . </signal.v.465><signal.v.466>Adds the specified instance of E to the collection for which the function was called.

This string is treated as a URI reference; the resource identified by the URI is retrieved. The data resulting from the retrieval action is parsed as an XML document and a tree is constructed in accordance with the data model ( see ) . If there is an error retrieving the resource , then the XSLT processor may signal an error; if it does not signal an error , it must recover by returning an empty node-set. One possible kind of retrieval error is that the XSLT processor does not support the URI scheme used by the URI. An XSLT processor is not required to support any particular URI schemes. The documentation for an XSLT processor should specify which URI schemes the XSLT processor supports . </signal.v.473><signal.v.474> First scenario : The system signals a trade. 1.

This signal shall be repeated by every rider down the formation but they should all hold their positions. The SWEEP will then be the first to occupy the new intended lane , followed by the second-last rider and all the way up to the capt. who is the last to occupy the new lane. This allows the sweep to block and reserve the lane for the formation , before the riders start filling the lane. Turn indicators should only be cancelled after the lane change of each rider . </signal.v.478><signal.v.479>Another major topic affecting the behavior of read and write operations is time-outs. Time-outs affect read and write operations in the following way. If an operation takes longer than the computed time-out period , the operation is completed. There is no error code that is returned by ReadFile , WriteFile , GetOverlappedResult , or WaitForSingleObject. All indicators used to monitor the operation indicate that it completed successfully. The only way to tell that the operation timed out is that the number of bytes actually transferred are fewer than the number of bytes requested. So , if ReadFile returns TRUE , but fewer bytes were read than were requested , the operation timed out. If an overlapped write operation times out , the overlapped event handle is signaled and WaitForSingleObject returns WAIT_OBJECT_O. GetOverlappedResult returns TRUE , but dwBytesTransferred contains the number of bytes that were transferred before the time-out. The following code demonstrates how to handle this in an overlapped write operation : </signal.v.479><signal.v.480>The usual effect of signaling an error is to terminate the command that is running and return immediately to the Emacs editor command loop.

This line is then plotted between a range of -100 and 100. The centerline at zero in the oscillator is considered to be a major signal line determining the trend. The higher the value of the oscillator from the centerline point , the more upward strength there is in the security; the lower the oscillator 's value is from the centerline , the more downward pressure. A trend reversal is signaled when the oscillator crosses through the centerline. For example , when the oscillator goes from positive to negative , a downward trend is confirmed. Divergence is also used in the oscillator to predict trend reversals.

Purified DP thymocytes from IIo mice were stimulated for 16 h with either medium or TCR- and CD2-specific plate-bound MAbs. The CD4loCD8 cell population was obtained from the total cell pool after signaling culture with greater than 85 purity by anti-CD8 panning and collection of the nonadherent fraction. The enriched CD4loCD8 cell population was then placed in recovery culture. At the indicated time points , nuclear run-on assays were performed and the resulting labeled large-sized RNA was purified and hybridized to nylon filters supporting immobilized denatured CD4 , CD8 , TCR , and GAPDH cDNA inserts or linear Bluescript plasmid alone. The plots represent relative transcription rates of CD4 and CD8 RNAs versus time of recovery. We expressed CD4 and CD8 transcription rates relative to that of GAPDH at each time point , with 1.0 representing the relative transcription rate of CD4 , CD8 , or TCR in unstimulated DP thymocytes at each time point . </signal.v.502><signal.v.503>After reset , all leaf nodes present a Parent_Notify signaling state on their data and strobe pairs. Note that this is a signaling state , not a transmitted packet. The whole tree identification process occurs in a matter of microseconds. In our example , the digital camera will signal the set-top box , the printer will signal the digital VCR , and the DVD-RAM will signal the PC. When a branch node receives the Parent_Notify signal on one of its ports , it marks that port as containing a child , and outputs a Child_Notify signaling state on that port 's data and strobe pairs. Upon detecting this state , the leaf node marks its port as a parent port and removes the signaling , thereby confirming that the leaf node has accepted the child designation. At this point our bus appears as shown in Figure 5 . The ports marked with a " P " indicate that a device which is closer to the root node is attached to that port , while a port marked with a " C " indicates that a node farther away from the root node is attached. The port numbers are arbitrarily assigned during design of the device and play an important part in the self identification process . </signal.v.503><signal.v.504>A change of course will be signaled near the mark beginning the leg being changed by a Race Committee Boat that will display code flag " C " , the approximate compass bearing to the new mark , and will make periodic sound signals.

A sense of closure and relief comes from the fact that , as we complete the trade by liquidating our positions , we actually realize gains which we can then officially enter in the books. Until that point , any intermediate results are only paper gains which do not really count. Long term investors know that watching intermediate results too frequently or too seriously only serves to exacerbate our emotions by getting overly excited or frustrated. Looking at interim paper gains as real acquired wealth inevitably causes disappointment when some are given back by the time a trade is closed out. Since no investment system can reliably and consistently call market tops as they occur , giving back some paper gains is inherent of any investment system , unless one sells too early . </signal.v.505><signal.v.506>International Publication Pamphlet No. WO 01/17804 ( which corresponds to U.S. Pat.

In this system , a pressure or a change in pressure in pneumatic tires of wheels on vehicles is monitored and signaled by radio. The system includes a receiver unit provided in or on the vehicle to which at least one antenna is associated , and a transmitter unit , arranged in the pneumatic tire , for measuring , evaluating and transmitting tire pressure signals. The transmitter unit does not transmit the pressure signal to the receiver unit as long as the change in pressure does not exceed a threshold value.

In fact , there are more trading signals than there are five trading-day intervals in the sample. From a statistical perspective , there is serial correlation bias because returns for some days are included in more than one signaled holding interval. From a practical perspective , a trader can not systematically act on all the signals because many signals occur while funds are still committed based on a prior signal . </signal.v.507><signal.v.508>A CAPTAIN WAS NAVIGATING his ship through the ocean waters in the middle of the night , when out in the distance he saw a flashing light sending a signal commanding him to alter his course.

Unlike condition variables or semaphores , a signaled EventBarrier stays in the signaled state until all threads ( minstrels ) that called Wait have responded to the signal ( crossed ) , then it reverts to the unsignaled state ( the bridge is up ) . To ensure that all signaled threads ( minstrels ) have an opportunity to respond , it holds back the signaling thread ( gatekeeper ) until the signaled threads ( minstrels ) have called Complete to notify the EventBarrier that they have finished responding to the event ( crossed the bridge ) . This behavior makes EventBarrier a powerful primitive for thread coordination . </signal.v.513><signal.v.514>Another way a firm can signal quality is by building a brand name.

When a firm with an established brand name does offer a poor-quality product , it usually puts a different name on the product so as not to endanger the public 's perception of its brand name . </signal.v.514><signal.v.515>Leave the track as quickly and safely as possible to report to the pit area.

The black flag may signal a disqualification due to a rule infraction such as unsportsmanlike driving , or failure to obey the starter ' s signal. The black flag may also indicate that the car may be unsafe and/or presenting a race hazard either because of its mechanical condition ( i.e. on fire , losing parts , spilling or leaking fuel ) or because of the way it is being operated ( i.e. being driven erratically or too slowly so as to impede other traffic ) . Regardless of the reason , a black flagged car must report immediately to the pit area for consultation with officials who will inform the driver of the reason for the black flag , and of the conditions whereby he may be permitted to re-enter the race according to the rules.

We will explain this problem by using the sample warehouse plans , starting with the most simple case ( Figure 4.2.1 ) . If there were no obstacles in the warehouse ( Figure 4.2.1a ) , finding the pallets would not be a problem for robots. If the size of the warehouse is relatively larger than the detection region of the robots , robots can still find the pallets by following teammates which are able to detect a goal.

One common real-time approach is that three consecutive declines in the leading index signal an upcoming recession and three consecutive increases signal an expansion.

Zahavi ' s intuition was correct in the very general sense that differences in costs can stabilize the evolution of an honest signaling system , but in sexually selected signaling , differences in costs are properly decreasing proportional ( or log ) marginal costs [ 29 ] . The mathematics can be interpreted to mean that higher quality signalers are more efficient at converting signal costs into reproductive benefits. This re-analysis undermines the idea that higher quality signalers are demonstrating their ability to waste more because the pattern of absolute signal costs across signalers of different quality remains undetermined. Depending on the specific form of the tradeoffs in any particular system , higher quality signalers might pay absolutely more or less for big signals than lower quality signalers pay for small signals. This might explain why the empirical data on the relationship between signals and costs are so inconsistent . </signal.v.535><signal.v.536>The applied mode MUST be signaled.

This would mean we again have the recession signal along with much higher borrowing costs across the board. It is humorous really , that a recession signal was denied from yield curve inversion all this winter. An excuse is offered that global savings have pushed money into the long end. So global factors negate the signal ? Here is a different view. Global factors make the US Treasury Yield Curve inversion a negative signal on a global basis. It was signaling a global recession , not just a USEconomy recession. If global factors work to invert the term curve , then global factors are ripe on implications of recession.

Second , a Bearish Moving Average Crossover ( which is explained below ) can act to confirm a negative divergence. As long as MACD is trading above its 9-day EMA , or trigger line , it has not turned down and the lower High is difficult to confirm.

The opposite holds true when the MACD is negative - this signals that the shorter term is below the longer and suggest downward momentum. When the MACD line crosses over the centerline , it signals a crossing in the moving averages. The most common moving average values used in the calculation are the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. The signal line is commonly created by using a nine-day exponential moving average of the MACD values. These values can be adjusted to meet the needs of the technician and the security.

If several threads wait on the same condition , they are woken up , one per signal , in FIFO order.

You touch a hot object and immediately drop it or withdraw your hand from the heat source. You do this so quickly you do n't even think about it. How does this happen ? Your nervous system coordinated everything. It sensed the hot object and signaled your muscles to let it go. Your nervous system , which consists of your brain , spinal cord , peripheral nerves and autonomic nerves , coordinates all movements , thoughts and sensations that you have. In this article , we 'll examine the structure and functions of your nervous system , how nerve cells communicate with each other and various tissues and what can go wrong when nerves become damaged or diseased . </signal.v.611><signal.v.612>A driver should use caution when approaching a flagperson. The flagger will be working very close to your traffic lane. Slow down and be prepared to obey the signals of the flagperson.

The control system includes air temperature apparatus for producing an air temperature control signal if conditions suitable for operation of the economizer is signaled , air quality apparatus for producing an air quality control signal , and a logic for receiving the air temperature and air quality control signals , and operable to produce a ventilating equipment control signal based on which of the air temperature and air quality control signals corresponds to admission of the larger amount of outdoor air. The air quality apparatus may include an indoor air quality sensor , which may sense carbon dioxide concentration . </signal.v.614><signal.v.615>Nevin and Grosch ( 1990 ) and Jones et al. ( 1995 ) demonstrated that the rate of responding to the sample was higher when large reinforcers were signaled. They suggested that this implies increased attention to the sample , and thus accounts for the signaled magnitude effects that they observed. The same account does not apply to the present experiments , however , because the signal was unpredictable at the time that the sample was presented . </signal.v.615><signal.v.616>Signals is a perfect title for this great album.

The initiator drives the C/BE [ 3 : 0 ] signals during the address phase to signal the type of transfer ( memory read , memory write , I/O read , I/O write , etc. ) . During data phases the C/BE [ 3 : 0 ] signals serve as byte enable to indicate which data bytes are valid. Both the initiator and target may insert wait states into the data transfer by deasserting the IRDY and TRDY signals. Valid data transfers occur on each clock edge in which both IRDY and TRDY are asserted . </signal.v.617><signal.v.618>The answer lies somewhere in between. The charge that the index predicts recessions that do not come to fruition -- and fails to warn of those that do -- is hardly a fair criticism. No forecaster , even armed with an arsenal of economic statistics , has a perfect track record when it comes to predicting recessions. It is therefore unreasonable to assume that a ten-component index can do any better. That said , the index does have some reliability problems. For example , it failed to turn down prior to the 1990-91 recession , and in 1995 it signalled a downturn that never came to pass . </signal.v.618><signal.v.619>Self-Timer Sound : Sets the sound that signals you when the shutter release is two seconds away.

All other riders will repeat this , and the two columns will merge into one. will be signaled by the Road Captain , and passed on through the group , by raising the left hand over the head and pointing up with the index finger. When single file is signaled the riders should begin increasing their distance to 2 or 3 seconds between motorcycles . </signal.v.621><signal.v.622>Since each signal had at least two heads the NYC could go one step further. Normally the only difference between a Stop signal and a Stop &amp;Proceed signal was the absence or presence of a number plate on the signal post. Again in bad weather or at night an engineer had to get close to the signal to see if it had a number plate on it or not. Reflective signs had not been invented yet and headlights were not as good as today's. To aid in determining if the signal was a Stop ( and stay ) signal or a Stop &amp;Proceed signal the NYC staggered the two heads on the Stop &amp;Proceed signals . </signal.v.622><signal.v.623>The Dollar fell to a one-month low versus the Euro on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut its 2008 growth forecast and warned of higher unemployment , reducing prospects of an interest rate hike later this year.Although minutes of the Fed 's April 29-30 policy meeting highlighted worries over inflation and signaled more interest rate cuts wer </signal.v.623><signal.v.624>Reset. Reset is signaled by a node driving both TPA and TPB to logic 1. Because of the " dominant 1s " electrical definition of the drivers , a logic 1 will always be detected by a port , even if its bidirectional driver is in the transmit state. When a node detects a reset condition on its drivers , it will propagate this signal to all of the other ports that this node supports. The node then enters the idle state for a given period of time to allow the reset indication to propagate to all other nodes on the bus. Reset clears any topology information within the node , although isochronous resources are " sticky " and will tend to remain the same during resets . </signal.v.624><signal.v.625>It just seems that some version of scenario 2 is much , much more likely.

A nickel has negligible value yet stealing a nickel remains an outrageous act , not because of its consequences but because of its meaning : It signals ( to oneself if no one else knows about it ) that one is a thief. The symbolic value of certain acts provides sufficient justification for those acts even in the absence of desirable causal consequences of the action ( see , e.g. , Nozick , 1995 ) . </signal.v.627><signal.v.628>Signals should be given distinctly and may originate with either the driver or tillerman. The signal for FORWARD or REVERSE MUST be acknowledged by a repeat of the signal before action is taken by the driver. The STOP signal is intended primarily for use by the tillerman to signal an emergency stop or a necessary stop during a backing operation. A series of short signal blasts may be utilized by the tillerman to gain the attention of the driver or to request a non-emergency halt of the vehicle . </signal.v.628><signal.v.629>An SOS is a distress call which has been internationally recognized since 1906. The use of SOS as a distress signal emerged in the early days of radio communications , when ships wanted to be able to quickly and accurately signal each other to ask for assistance. In addition to being signaled via radio , an SOS can also be signaled using lights , which can be manipulated to spell out words and code terms in International Morse Code; on a radio which allows voice communications , people may use SOS or other terms like mayday to indicate that they are in trouble on ships , aircraft , and other vessels . </signal.v.629><signal.v.630>The BoE is now forecasting that CPI will drop to 0.7 in the 3Q of 2009 and bottoming at 0.5 at the end of 2010. A weak pound is helping push prices lower as inflation risks continue to be modestly to the downside . The central bank would also state that growth risks are weighted heavily to the downside as it forecast GDP to contract by 4 in the first quarter alone. Although the committee has signaled that more easing is imminent , it stated that the impact of rate cuts have limited due to the failure of the banking system. Although Governor King would recognize that falling prices and a weaker pound is providing some stimulus to the economy it will take time for these effects and those of the recent rate reductions and stimulus to pass through the economy. If the 20-Day SMA fails to hold as support then we could see a re-test of 1.4000 on the lower interest rate expectations . </signal.v.630><signal.v.631>PL/I signals the CONVERSION condition when the source character data in a conversion to bit-string or arithmetic data contains characters that are not valid in the specified context.

According to Baranowski , the two-lens ( amber and red ) signals first flash amber , then goes to solid amber , and then to red. When not active , the signals are unlit ( off ) . At the roundabout entrance , this avoids the confusion drivers might experience , if they received a green signal only a few feet upstream of the yield control.

In early March 2002 , the system signaled an increase in diagnoses of syphilis.

The outbreak was subsequently investigated , and prevention strategies were implemented ( 21 ) ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . </signal.v.639><signal.v.640>The present study was undertaken to specifically examine the possibility that posttranscriptional , as well as transcriptional , regulatory mechanisms are activated in signaled DP thymocytes so as to rapidly alter their expression of coreceptor molecules and to promote their conversion into intermediate CD4+CD8 cells. Unfortunately , the asynchrony and low efficiency of intrathymic development make it virtually impossible to assess the presence or absence of posttranscriptional regulatory events in thymocytes in vivo. In contrast , DP thymocytes can be efficiently and synchronously signaled in vitro by antibody-induced coengagement of surface TCR and CD2 molecules ( 5 ) . Such in vitro signaling of DP thymocytes induces them to convert into intermediate CD4+CD8 cells that are indistinguishable from in vivo-generated intermediate CD4+CD8 thymocytes. Using this in vitro system , we found that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms were activated in signaled DP thymocytes to promote their rapid conversion into intermediate CD4+CD8 cells. We suggest that posttranscriptional regulation is an important mechanism by which coreceptor expression is rapidly altered at critical points in thymocyte differentiation . </signal.v.640><signal.v.641>Again , we add a convenience method setTimerSignalHandler : anObject to new scheduler.

The communication between the CAPTAIN and FIRST-OFFICER is signaled with a user-defined event , COMM-EVENT. The first version includes system-defined PROCEDURE events interspersed between the user-defined communication events ( COMM-EVENT ) such as " CAPTAIN says Landing Runway 35 Right " and " FIRST-OFFICER Landing Runway 35 Right heard.

In the event that a target requires a long period of time to respond to a transaction , it may use the STOP signal to suspend the transaction so the bus can be used to perform other transfers in the interim. When the target terminates a transaction without performing any data phases it is called a retry. If one or more data phases are completed before the target terminates the transaction , it is called a disconnect. A retry or disconnect signals the initiator that it must return at a later time to attempt performing the transaction again. In the event of a fatal error such as a hardware problem the target may use STOP and DEVSEL to signal an abnormal termination of the bus transfer called a target abort. The initiator can use the target abort to signal system software that a fatal error has been detected . </signal.v.655><signal.v.656>The reason for having both slowly and rapidly adapting receptors lies in the different kinds of information they signal. Slowly adapting receptors presumably signal the onset and offset , but most importantly the presence of a long sustained stimulus. They do adapt to some extent as indicated by the gradual waning of the sensation of the chair against your posterior as you read this. ( This probably does not represent entirely a receptor process , but involves the central nervous system as well , as is indicated by the fact that the sensation returned to your posterior as soon as mention was made of its absence. ) In contrast , rapidly adapting receptors signal the start , velocity , and , in some cases , the stop of a stimulus , but do not signal in between. On the other hand , they give very good responses to repeated stimuli , suggesting they may play a role in sensations of vibration. The time over which summation of slowly adapting generator potentials can occur is longer than for rapidly adapting ones for a stimulus of the same duration . </signal.v.656><signal.v.657>-Mar 8 SPX 1219.43 : No signals , though market appears to have backed off of a technical sell zone , it is giving no clues as to signaling a turning point or a blow off . </signal.v.657><signal.v.658>On Thursday , Mr. Trichet did not call for vigilance in combating inflation , now hovering slightly above 2 percent , even as he signaled that the bank would continue to monitor prices . </signal.v.658><signal.v.659>The fact that a college education can signal qualities to employers has raised some interesting questions about why people get college educations. A popular answer among economists has been that education builds human capital , that is , it is a way of investing in people to increase their productivity. More recently some economists have suggested that this view is wrong or at best only partly true , and that college education mostly serves as a way of signaling to future employers. If education is merely a way of signaling , if it is only a complex gauntlet that eliminates those who are not intelligent and do not have perseverance , then the social usefulness of college education may not be very great. From the viewpoint of the student , it does not matter -- the benefits are the same either way. Though most economists believe that education both builds human capital and acts as a signal , the relative importance of these two functions is still disputed . </signal.v.659><signal.v.660>During this second trade , the Pring methodology would have signaled a long entry point around $ 6.30 and generated a sell signal around $ 6.15 ( see the entry/exit points highlighted in yellow ) .

However , despite the bad timing of this particular trade , and that it generated a slight loss , the fact of the matter is that the sell signal still managed to leave the trader unscathed.

In some embodiments , the zone controller is configured to signal the dehumidification terminal to operate at a lower blower output based on the percentage of zones calling for conditioning. For example , the blower may be signaled to operate at a lower output when less than 30 of zones are calling for conditioning , or in other embodiments , when less than 50 of zones are calling for conditioning . </signal.v.671><signal.v.672>When everything is ok , you can signal so by using the classic sign.

Mistake made : Take a trade when there was no signal from the system </signal.v.685><signal.v.686>To address this question in the present study , we devised a different version of reversal learning : action-based reversal , in which subjects make choices between 2 different physical motor responses ( a sliding movement on a trackball vs a button press; Fig. 1 ) instead of requiring subjects to make choices between 2 distinct visual stimuli. No discriminative stimuli are presented to the subjects signaling such options; instead , a single nondiscriminative stimulus is presented to indicate the onset of each trial. Thus , in order to solve such a task , subjects have to rely on representations of the value of each available physical action , not on the representation of the value of different stimuli. By comparing and contrasting neural activity related to expected value in our action-based reversal task to activity found during stimulus-based reversal , we aimed to determine whether ventromedial prefrontal cortex is involved in maintaining representations of the expected value of particular actions , the expected value of specific stimuli , or both. Subjects were scanned with fMRI while they performed both action-based and stimulus-based reversal tasks in separate sessions that were counterbalanced in their order of presentation across subjects . </signal.v.686><signal.v.687>The Federal Reserve left rates unchanged at 2.00 percent , as we had anticipated , but subsequent market-wide reaction was mixed as fed fund futures had been fully pricing in a 25bp cut to 1.75 percent. Going forward , though , Credit Suisse overnight index swaps signal that the central bank will leave rates unchanged through the next 12 months - compared to expectations of a 25bp cut earlier today as the Federal Open Market Committee ' s policy statement signaled a more neutral stance. Indeed , it appears that the drop in crude oil from nearly $ 150/bbl in July down to below $ 95/bbl has helped to alleviate some of their inflation fears , since even the most hawkish member of the group Richmond Fed President Richard Fisher voted for no change. Furthermore , the Committee dropped a line noting elevated inflation expectations , suggesting they are a bit more confident that they ' ve kept the public ' s outlook for inflation in check . </signal.v.687><signal.v.688>Re " Turn Away From Selfish Behavior : Use Your Signal , " Voices , Feb. 9 : I share professor John Allswang 's irritation over self-centered drivers who do n't care enough about others to use their turn signals. Making matters worse , the antisocials are abetted by the clueless. Many left-turners waiting at a red light start to signal only after the light changes. The rest of us have been conditioned to expect this behavior and change to the right lane , blocking those who had hoped to turn right on the red light . </signal.v.688><signal.v.689>Furthermore , Long1 and Short1 entries are restricted so that the entry level has to change at least once after each entry signal before a signal in that same direction can be signaled again. This eliminates the possibility of having several trades in the same direction trigger all from the same previous entry level some time ago ( you often see this behavior during a consolidation phase ) . This also helps eliminate the possibility of a new opposite entry being based on an entry level previous to the previous opposite trade. For example , a long trade is entered and exited - the entry level from this trade is carried forward - &gt; then a short trade is entered and exited - &gt; instead of waiting for a fresh cross , the old entry level would be used for the next buy which is not really correct since it 's * highly * unlikely you would trade the system like that manually . </signal.v.689><signal.v.690>If pval is anything else , p ( ) first signals a warning and sets the message text and error number condition information items.

Although cessation of TCR-CD2 stimulation had previously been shown to result in selective reexpression of CD4 coreceptor RNA transcripts and phenotypic conversion of signaled DP thymocytes into CD4+CD8 cells ( 5 ) , the transcriptional consequences of signal termination had not been previously assessed. Consequently , we transferred stimulated DP thymocytes out of " signaling " cultures into " recovery " cultures , containing only medium , and then performed nuclear run-on assays to measure the rates of CD4 and CD8 RNA synthesis. Relative TCR transcription , which is known to increase in signaled DP thymocytes ( 16 ) , was included as a positive control ( Fig. 6 ) .

Geoffrey Aaronson , a specialist on Israeli/Palestinian territorial issues , estimated that such a border would run roughly along the existing route of Israel ' s separation barrier and would involve the annexation of about 10 percent of the West Bank ( Report on Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Territories , 5/6/06 ) . </signal.v.705><signal.v.706>FIG. 3 shows the design of a clock signal generating device CGC which contains a latch element L and an AND gate AND.

On GO trials , subjects made speeded saccades ( depicted by arrow ) to the appearance of a peripheral target to the left or right of fixation. This type of trial occurred 60 of the time. b. On STOP trials , an auditory stop signal tone was emitted after a period of time known as the stop signal delay. This signaled the subject to cancel the planned movement. Sometimes the subject was successful and sometimes failed at canceling the planned saccade. Stop trials were relatively rare and occurred on 20 of the trials unpredictably. Twenty percent of the trials were CATCH trials ( not depicted ) in which no peripheral target appeared and the subject simply remained at fixation . </signal.v.707><signal.v.708>Endocrine organs , such as parts of the brain , kidney , and pancreas , secrete chemical compounds called hormones , which are then circulated to other cells and tissues. Only tissues with specialized proteins called endocrine receptors , which are specific to a particular hormone , can be signaled by the hormone. These endocrine receptors fall primarily into two categories : those that bind to peptide hormones ( for example , insulin ) at the cell surface , and those that bind to steroid hormones ( for example , estrogen and testosterone ) inside a cell. When the hormone of the right chemical shape binds to the receptor ( think of a lock and key ) , the receptor is activated. This activation ultimately changes which proteins ( the " machines " that do most of the actual work ) are active in the cell and to what extent. Although in plants both the distribution system and the effects of the hormones are quite different from those in animals , there are several hormones of both the steroid and peptide types found in plants as well , without which normal plant growth would not be possible . </signal.v.708><signal.v.709>Returns the element at which the specified cursor is positioned , and replaces it with the specified void*.

Most of the signals the genes rely on come from molecules outside the cell , however , and many of those molecules are unable to pierce the cell 's sturdy lipid membrane. The only way such a molecule can get its message to the nucleus is by fitting into a receptor on the cell 's surface and then prompting a cascade of chemicals called signaling molecules and transcription factors to carry the message along.

The display will indicate cause of shutdown and the panel must be manually reset -- selector moved to OFF position -- before normal operation may be resumed . </signal.v.738><signal.v.739>Pedhead mounted speakers in existing installations are often mounted in positions that make the messages ambiguous. The speaker should be as close as possible to the crosswalk being signaled by the speaker and speakers should be separated by 10 feet , if possible. For pushbutton integrated devices , the speaker is in the pushbutton housing. The location of the pushbutton and orientation of the speaker can be critical to hearing the WALK indication at the beginning of the crosswalk . </signal.v.739><signal.v.740>9.1 Individual recalls will be signaled in accordance with R.R.S.

From lion-hunting Masai warriors to cigarette-smoking , drag-racing American teenagers , people ( often young ) perform risky acts to prove that they are so fit or skilled that they can afford to be daring ( Dunbar , 1996; Hawkes &amp;Bliege Bird , 2002 ) . Today , posting revealing or culpable material online arguably has become another forum for signaling imperviousness to danger and repercussions . </signal.v.741><signal.v.742>Cycle Frame is driven low by the initiator to signal the start of a new bus transaction. The address phase occurs during the first clock cycle after a high to low transition on the FRAME signal. If the initiator intends to perform a transaction with only a single data phase , then it will return FRAME back high after only one cycle. If multiple data phases are to be performed , the initiator will hold FRAME low in all but the last data phase. The initiator signals its intent to perform a master initiated termination by driving FRAME high during the last data phase of a transaction. During a target initiated termination the initiator will continue to drive FRAME low through the end of the transaction . </signal.v.742><signal.v.743>If init senses a powerfail condition ( such as termination of power to the PC signaled by an Uninterruptible Power Supply ) and the system was in multiuser mode , some special powerfail conditions are executed upon restart. These conditions usually check the filesystem for problems prior to bringing the system back up. The /etc/inittab file can contain specific instructions for these conditions , as shown in the following code : </signal.v.743><signal.v.744>On both the center and the left signal officers went into the works with the first troops that occupied them , and , signaling back reports , gave positive assurance of the absence of the enemy.

' ( The Successful Investor. p3 ) . While this seems reasonably precise , we applied these rules to the three major market indexes back to 1950 for the Dow and S &amp;P , and back to 1984 , for the NASDAQ , and found they are broadly correct but a literal interpretation generated several false downturns and also missed some important ones. We also found there were important differences between the three market indexes as to how many distribution days over what period reliably signaled a downturn . </signal.v.745><signal.v.746>A condition handler is usually written in anticipation of a particular condition code or set of condition codes. Because handlers are invoked as a result of any signaled condition code , you should begin your handler routine by comparing the condition code passed to the handler ( element 2 of SIGARGS ) with the condition codes expected by the handler. If the signaled condition code is not an expected code , you should resignal the condition code by equating the function value of the handler to the global symbol SS $ _RESIGNAL ( see Section 14.6 ) . </signal.v.746><signal.v.747>The Shot Clock is stopped immediately upon the referee stopping the game clock ( asking for the ball to be removed from the water , signaling a timeout ) . A common mistake is to reset the Shot Clock when the referee signals a timeout. Simply stop the Shot Clock and continue it when the ball is put back into play . </signal.v.747><signal.v.748>The way I read it was that the bus did in fact stop to let passengers off , and then proceed ( illegally ) the moment the light turned red. One could argue that the honk of the second driver was a reasonable warning that the bus was about to conduct this maneuver , and the " roar " and assumed speed ( I 've often found people think you are going much faster then you actually are if there is much noise and acceleration ) were to proceed through the intersection before the other drivers got a green signal and reacted to it. The reason traffic lights are designed the way they are is partially to discourage other drivers from seeing what the opposing traffic is signaled to do , as this leads to preemptive action and accidents , as almost occurred to the OP watching the Cambridge street light instead of their own . </signal.v.748><signal.v.749>The behavior of PTLDiff can serve as an additional confirmation of our trade entries. PIndex changes are based on predicted changes in the 3EMA two days in the future , i.e. , a short term outlook. Price action relative to the set of three EMAs indicates current trend and/or momentum direction. PTLDiff can confirm the signaled trade is in the direction of expected longer term price movement . </signal.v.749><signal.v.750>Raising both hands into the air and calling in a loud voice " TIME !

Indeed , we see that implied volatility on 3-month options has fallen by over two percentage points within a relatively short period of time. Yet we hesitate to call for rangebound conditions on the extremely risk-sensitive currency pair. Our range-breakout bias subsequently calls for moderate USDJPY volatility in the week ahead . </signal.v.751><signal.v.752>A similar signal appeared in March of 2007; the IBB writhed to its lows in a selling climax , while the CCI signaled bluer skies were ahead.

Experience gained : The trader will start to think hey , I m better than my system . Even if the trader does n't think on it consciously , the trader will rationalize on every signal given by the system because deep in his or her mind , his or her feeling is more intelligent than the system itself. From this point on , the trader will try to outguess the system. This mistake has catastrophic effects on our confidence to the system. The confidence on the trader turns into overconfidence. Mistake made : Not taking a trade when system signaled it </signal.v.753><signal.v.754>CAS is limited by the amount of information that can be signaled using the voice channel.

At the preparatory signal , the race committee displayed flag Z. Boat A was identified in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. After the starting signal the race committee signaled a general recall. The race committee then began a second starting sequence for that race and again displayed flag Z as the preparatory flag. After removing the preparatory flag , but before the starting signal , the race committee signaled a postponement. Later , the race committee began a third sequence of signals and was successful in starting the fourth race , and the race was completed . </signal.v.756><signal.v.757>When his system signaled a buy for Tenaris on August 24 , 2005 , the stock was selling at $ 105.

In this study , we assess the impact of CD8 coreceptor signal strength on positive selection and CD4/CD8 lineage choice using novel gene knockin mice in which the endogenous CD8 gene has been re-engineered to encode the stronger signaling cytoplasmic tail of CD4 , with the re-engineered CD8 gene referred to as CD8.4. We found that stronger signaling CD8.4 coreceptors specifically improved the efficiency of CD8-dependent positive selection and quantitatively increased the number of MHC class I ( MHC-I ) -specific thymocytes signaled to differentiate into CD8+ T cells , even for thymocytes expressing a single , transgenic TCR. Importantly , however , stronger signaling CD8.4 coreceptors did not alter the CD8 lineage choice of any MHC-I-specific thymocytes , even MHC-I-specific thymocytes expressing the high-affinity F5 transgenic TCR. This study documents in a physiologic in vivo model that coreceptor signal strength alters TCR-signaling thresholds for positive selection and so is a major determinant of the CD4 : CD8 ratio , but it does not influence CD4/CD8 lineage choice . </signal.v.759><signal.v.760>By law , any person , when signaled to stop by such officer in a law enforcement vessel using an audible signal device or flashing blue lights who operates such vessel in disregard of such signal so as to ( 1 ) interfere with or endanger the operation of the law enforcement vessel or any other vessel , ( 2 ) endanger or cause damage to property or person , or ( 3 ) increase or maintain speed in an attempt to escape or elude such law enforcement officer is guilty of either a class A misdemeanor or a class D felony , depending on the circumstances.

After reaching this area in April 05 , SSRI started a bottoming process around the $ 10 level that continued until about mid-May , at which points SSRI reversed higher and signaled that its corrective decline from late 04 had ended and a recovery rally was born. During this same period ( April-May 2005 ) the XAU index was still declining and did n't reach its correction low until about mid-May 05. The preliminary bottom in SSRI was made almost a full month earlier than the XAU 's bottom , and there were many positive divergence signals in the internal indicators for SSRI ( i.e. , higher highs and higher lows ) relative to the price line which also signaled a " heads up " that a bottom was being made . </signal.v.769><signal.v.770>After the leaf nodes have identified themselves , the digital VCR still has two ports that have not received a Parent_Notify , while the set-top box and the PC branch node both have only one port with an attached device that has not received a Parent_Notify. Therefore , both the set-top box and the PC start to signal a Parent_Notify on the one port that has not yet received one. In this case , the VCR receives the Parent_Notify on both of its remaining ports , which it acknowledges with a Child_Notify condition. Because the VCR has marked all of its ports as children , the VCR becomes the root node. The final configuration is shown in Figure 6 . </signal.v.770><signal.v.771>If there is more than one such element , an arbitrary one is picked and returned.

To form the pattern , Current bar 's range encloses or engulfs'' the prior bar 's range , thereby indicating great market strength in the direction of Current bar 's close. From a psychological perspective , Engulfing Lines indicate that the market opened in the same direction as the prior bar , but then reversed sentiment to close strongly in the opposite direction , overcoming and reversing previous bar 's assumption regarding value.An engulfing candle often warns of the approaching reversal of a Minor , or short-term , trend. The Minor trend typically lasts between three and 15 bars.

When the tenkan/conversion line crosses over the kijun/base line , it generates a buying signal. A signal to sell appears when the tenkan/conversion line crosses below the kijun/base line from above. But in ichimoku theory , all signals are not created equal , and this is where the cloud comes into play. If the two lines cross to the downside while current prices are above the cloud , only a weak sell signal is generated. If the downside crossover takes place when prices are inside the cloud , then it indicates a medium-strength sell signal. The strongest sell signal is generated when the downside crossover occurs while prices are below the cloud , essentially signaling that fresh weakness is now evident within an overall downtrend. The same guidelines apply to upside crossovers generating buy signals and the location of current prices to the cloud , with the strongest buy signal coming from an upside crossover while prices are above the cloud . </signal.v.775><signal.v.776>The time of origin of a message is considered to be the time at which a message is ordered to be made.

Certain local codes are in use which do not conform to the International Code. Misunderstanding might arise if such local codes were used without explanation. Consequently provision is made for such signals by displaying first the International NMM. This will make it clear that the signals following are not to be interpreted from the International Code book.

A few moments later the guns of the war vessel down the river were heard as her fire opened upon the woods where the enemy had been seen , and presently a couple of rounds from a field battery in front silenced the enemy 's guns. A signal message sent from the front to the mansion station asked that the gunboat down the river might cease until our forces could reconnoiter the positions lately held by the enemy. This message was sent to the flagship. It could not be signaled from the shore or the flag-ship instantly to the vessel engaged , and her fire was kept on the woods . </signal.v.780><signal.v.781>If we accept the proposition that signals emerged non-intentionally , then a sender can not control the way in which a signal is interpreted. The male stickleback 's signal to conspecific females that he is ready to mate is also a signal to himself of his having ingested a substantial quantity of high energy food , and is also a signal to predators in the environment that he is edible. He has eaten high energy food , and that fact is manifested in a change in his body color. Metaphorically , he intends to mate , and his intention is signaled in the same change in body color; he does not intend to be eaten , but he signals to some receivers that he is edible . </signal.v.781><signal.v.782>Seems like some people in FREMO got hooked by signals ! : - ) Let 's see if we can come up with a gauntlet , completely signaled by an automatic interlocking plant ( like Gary , Indiana ) ! </signal.v.782><signal.v.783>Yes , motorists must yield to transit when the bus has signaled and is reentering traffic flow.

Sharp drops in prices of major speculator and retail investor stocks caused the Instanex Retail 15 portfolio to drop 5.97 during the week ended 19th June , 2009. The Instanex DII 15 portfolio was down 3.81 even though domestic institutional investors bought shares worth Rs. 1 , 080 crores and the Instanex FII Index was down 3.79 due to FII sales of Rs. 2 , 118 crores during the week , causing the Indian Rupee to fall 48 paisa to Rs. 48.09 per US $ . Nine of the 15 components of the Instanex FII Index were down and six were up. The main losers were Reliance Ind ( -13.46 ) , NTPC ( -10.38 ) and ONGC ( -10.36 ) and the main gainers were SBI ( +5.34 ) and Infosys ( +2.50 ) . </signal.v.784><signal.v.785>Once again looking at the two-year chart of the DJIA , we can identify three examples of MACD divergence. In late 2007 , the DJIA made a new all time high and there seemed to be support forming in the 12 , 700 area. However , the MACD displayed negative divergence by not rising above the prior high reached in October 2007. This signaled that the DJIA was more likely to turn down , which it did. Since this is a daily chart , you should not interrupt that this signal was the end of the long-term bull market and the beginning a new bear market. Rather , it just indicated that investors should expect the DJIA to move down over the next several months . </signal.v.785><signal.v.786>Courses : The standard course will be a windward/leeward once around.

The probability that a signal outbreak reflected a reported outbreak ( positive predictive value of AODA ) was lower for Campylobacter spp. than for norovirus : 50 ( 6.4 ) of 781 Campylobacter spp. signal outbreaks and 2 , 115 ( 75.5 ) of 2 , 801 norovirus signal outbreaks were associated with reported outbreaks. The AODA may have triggered multiple signals during the outbreak if the threshold level was reached during several consecutive weeks ( Figure 1 ) . Of the Campylobacter spp. outbreaks , 3 ( 6.0 ) were each identified by 2 different signals; of the norovirus outbreaks , 727 ( 28.6 ) were identified by multiple signals ( 2 20 signals per reported outbreak ) ( Table ) . Furthermore , 1 signal outbreak could correspond with different reported outbreaks when these occurred in the same local area and during the same period ( Figure 2 ) . For Campylobacter spp. , 4 ( 8.0 ) of the outbreak signals could correspond to &gt; 1 reported outbreak; for norovirus , 760 ( 35.9 ) of the signal outbreaks could correspond to 2 26 reported outbreaks ( Table ) . </signal.v.792><signal.v.793>Passing the Baton A synchronization technique that is used with semaphores.

The subtlety of this mode of signaling has been valued historically , especially through multilateral summitry. One is reminded of the Congress of Vienna after the Napoleonic wars that signaled that radical political change in Europe would not be tolerated. The Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin wartime summits signaled to Hitler that the Allied coalition could not be broken. The various Camp David summits to broker Middle East peace sent signals that U.S. interest in Middle East oil is a high priority. The just-concluded Millennium Summit at the UN , where 154 government leaders gathered , signaled that globalization has virtually unanimous acceptance ( if not enjoying unanimous enthusiasm ) . </signal.v.801><signal.v.802>4511.27 Passing Other Vehicles - A driver must audibly signal before passing any other vehicle and then he or she may proceed to pass on the left.

It is an error if the string that results from instantiating the attribute value template is not a QName. An XSLT processor may signal the error; if it does not signal the error , then it must recover by making the the result of instantiating the xsl : element element be the sequence of nodes created by instantiating the content of the xsl : element element , excluding any initial attribute nodes. If the namespace attribute is not present then the QName is expanded into an expanded-name using the namespace declarations in effect for the xsl : element element , including any default namespace declaration . </signal.v.803><signal.v.804>7 ) If no obstruction is found at the signal-marker , the deminer should check the position of the indication with the metal-detector. When the metal-detector continues to signal over the area , it may be appropriate to dig more deeply. The Supervisor should decide this based on the Task assessment and any pattern of anticipated devices that may be known. Generally , when a mine is missing from an anticipated pattern , a depth of at least 30 cm should be achieved before presuming that the signal is from a benign source . </signal.v.804><signal.v.805>Maximum Loss Since Signal - The maximum potential loss based on the lowest low achieved since the signal occurred relative to the entry price on the signaled bar.

A recession signal warns that job levels could drop in the coming months , so economists use non-farm employment data to evaluate the accuracy of the index. When historical index and employment values are graphed on the same plot , correct signals occurred where the leading index turned down before the employment data followed. Over the time period covered January 1995 through September 2005 , the state economy experienced one recession that according to the Bureau , began in early 2001 and ended in early 2002. The state index signaled this decline 10 months in advance and , while the job loss that continued through mid-2003 was n't sufficient for the state to declare a second recession , the state gave a two-month advanced warning of the prolonged slump . </signal.v.819><signal.v.820>Wall Street prepared to end a dreadful year with moderate moves this morning.

Plants signal their maturation and ripening through colorful displays that attract the attention of insects and birds , the better to pollinate and propagate their seeds. These signals need not be consciously given nor received to be effective : all that matters is that there be some perceivable change of state that other organisms can make use of. Thus , the presence of snow , ice , and objects waving in the wind signal a state of weather without any conscious volition on the part of the atmosphere.

Given that the model signals , say , a downgrade , what is the probability that the signal will be correct ? This dimension of accuracy is measured by the ratio of correct signals of a given BOPEC assignment to the total number of signals of that type. For example , the accuracy of downgrade signals is the ratio of correctly signaled downgrades to the total number of signaled downgrades. The figure presents these percentages for the upgrade , no change , and downgrade signals. These percentages of correct signals are relatively high at four quarters prior to assignment and improve at one quarter prior . </signal.v.834><signal.v.835>Fashion signals are signals whose form changes over time while their referent , the quality they indicate , remains the same.

In games we signal intentions in order to deceive. Of course , our opponent does the same , and interprets our signals knowing full well they may be deceptive. Thus starts the elaborate ruse and counter-ruse , where we try to determine how other people are reading our minds. Suppose that in a game I want to kick the ball to the right. I could first pretend to kick the ball to the left , but I know that they will know that this is a pretense. But if I pretend to kick to the right , they will expect me to kick to the left , unless they know that I will think that , in which case they may realize I really intend to kick to the right. So I decide to fake a kick to the right , and then run. Except that when the actual time comes , things may happen so fast that none of the plans can be executed.

If an IO device signals more MSIs than it has interrupt vectors , its interrupt service routines will be less efficient. When multiple MSI numbers are mapped to the same vector , the interrupt service routine must first determine which one occurred before servicing it. This involves reading status registers and analyzing them , which wastes IO bus cycles and CPU cycles . </signal.v.839><signal.v.840>One important point to be remembered when analyzing a head and shoulders pattern is that the signaled reversal may be temporary.

It shows that thread SleeperThread2 is active in monitor AlarmClock. Six threads are in the monitor ( i.e. , sleeper threads 1 and 3 to 6 , and the driver thread ) and no thread is waiting to enter. To learn the details , check the Monitor window ( below right ) . We see that sleeper threads 3 to 6 are blocked by condition variable Wake , and threads SleeperThread1 and DriverThread are inactive. Thread DriverThread ( resp. , SleeperThread1 ) is inactive because it signaled thread SleeperThread1 ( resp. , SleeperThread2 ) and yielded the monitor . </signal.v.843><signal.v.844>Your next mission is to use the Nachos synchronization primitives to create an EventBarrier class that allows a group of threads to wait for an event and respond to it in a synchronized fashion. EventBarrier incorporates useful properties from both condition variables and semaphores. Like a condition variable , an EventBarrier is associated with an event ( or condition ); threads may wait for the event or signal that the event has occurred. Like a binary semaphore , EventBarrier requires no external synchronization , and it keeps internal state to " remember " a previous signal; a wait returns immediately if the event is already signaled. Unlike condition variables or semaphores , a signaled EventBarrier stays in the signaled state until all threads have responded to the signal , then it reverts to the unsignaled state. To ensure that all threads have an opportunity to respond , it creates a " barrier " that holds back the signaling thread and responding threads until all participating threads have finished responding to the event. This behavior makes EventBarrier a powerful primitive for thread coordination . </signal.v.844><signal.v.845>The Quick-term Indicant is signaling hold for 30-ETF ' s.

Wave a cutout corresponding to the parent 's outline and it will make a noise and open its mouth for food. Although superseded ( and largely diminished or perverted by mutations as a result of disuse ) , many still occur in man in the form of anxieties : sleeplessness during full moon comes from an inherited fear of danger from predators on such nights. Fear of height refers to the arboreal phase of man 's ancestry. Claustrophobia ( once an aid to survival ) developed when confined in dark caves along with possible predators.

In fact , DP thymocytes are thought to express few , if any , receptors for IL-7 or for any other prosurvival cytokine , although they do express the common gamma chain ( c ) that is unable by itself to initiate cytokine signaling ( 22 , 23 ) . It has also been suggested that the thymic cortex where DP thymocytes reside is relatively deficient in IL-7producing cells ( 24 ) . One important consequence of deficient cytokine signaling in DP thymocytes is that , unlike other thymocytes , DP thymocytes do not express the prosurvival factor Bcl-2 and the trophic factor glucose transporter1 ( 17 , 25 , 26 ) and are thus destined to die in the thymic cortex without TCR-mediated positive selection signals. The ability of unsignaled DP thymocytes to die of neglect ensures that only DP thymocytes with appropriate TCR specificities to undergo positive selection can continue to survive and differentiate. Thus , it is important for appropriate repertoire selection in the thymus that DP thymocytes avoid signals from IL-7 and other prosurvival cytokines . </signal.v.849><signal.v.850>10.

He must yield to anyone passing on his left , no matter how long he has been signaling , and if he is hit as soon as he moves ( or seconds later ) then he did not yield , by definition . </signal.v.869><signal.v.870>Movement selection depends on the outcome of prior behavior. Posterior cingulate cortex ( CGp ) is strongly connected with both limbic and oculomotor circuitry , and CGp neurons respond following saccades , suggesting a role in signaling the motivational outcome of gaze shifts. To test this hypothesis , single CGp neurons were studied in monkeys while they shifted gaze to visual targets for liquid rewards that varied in size or were delivered probabilistically. CGp neurons responded following saccades as well as following reward delivery , and these responses were correlated with reward size. CGp neurons also responded following the omission of predicted rewards. The timing of CGp activation and its modulation by reward could provide signals useful for updating representations of expected saccade value . </signal.v.870><signal.v.871>Fidelity Energy 39 , FSENX , was up 81.2 since the Mid-term Indicant signaled buy on August 16 , 2003 and the sell signal on October 3 , 2008.

In addition to a potential trend reversal , hammers can mark bottoms or support levels. After a decline , hammers signal a bullish revival. The low of the long lower shadow implies that sellers drove prices lower during the session. However , the strong finish indicates that buyers regained their footing to end the session on a strong note. While this may seem enough to act on , hammers require further bullish confirmation. The low of the hammer shows that plenty of sellers remain. Further buying pressure , and preferably on expanding volume , is needed before acting. Such confirmation could come from a gap up or long white candlestick . </signal.v.872><signal.v.873>Make sure that the turn signal switch is being fully operated when you signal for a right turn.

Each model causes very distinct behavior , yet does not change the way you interface with the rest of the library. In brief , the immediate act model guarantees that operations are performed immediately when they are signaled and the function will not return until execution is complete. The concurrent act model allows active function calls to occur in their own thread and may also store active objects in their own thread. The lazy act model receives active function signals and adds them to a queue. The actual functions which are signaled will not be called until the result is required by the user through an explicit or implicit wait . </signal.v.879><signal.v.880>At the same time , SNSs are still primitive; it is too early in their development to observe clear evidence that they have transformed society. The goal of this article is to present a theoretical framework with which to a ) assess the transformative potential of SNSs and b ) develop design guidelines for making them into more effective social tools. The foundation for this analysis is signaling theory , which models why some communications are reliably honest and others are not . </signal.v.880><signal.v.881>In the figure 8 as shown above note that from the cossove at point P , the price moved higher as the signal suggested. Point Q was practically a false signal because the crossover took place neither in over bought nor in oversold region. Crossover at point R signaled short selling as it indicated that price may fall and prices fell marginally. Crossover at point S proved to be a very good signal. The price went up heavily. Note that the lowest point at S was higher than the previous lowest point at P. This was a case of divergence. Hence at point P we got two signals , one from crossover and another by divergence . </signal.v.881><signal.v.882>When the ball goes clearly out of play the assistant referee should simply signal for the appropriate re-start ( i.e. throw-in , goal-kick , corner-kick ) . </signal.v.882><signal.v.883>While the device is busy , the qotd_ioctl ( ) routine checks whether the condition variable has been signaled or a signal ( 3C ) is pending.

Risky assets like the JPY crosses managed to stage a bit more of a recovery , though , amidst speculation that the Federal Reserve would bail out AIG , the world ' s largest insurer.

MAX 's units are formulated in terms of appearances that are relevant to eight specific emotions , rather than in terms of individual muscles. Unlike FACS , MAX does not exhaustively measure all facial actions , but scores only those facial movements Izard relates to one or more of the eight emotions. All of the facial actions which MAX specifies as relevant to particular emotions are also found in the FACS emotion dictionary , but that database contains inferences about many other facial actions not present in MAX that may signal emotion. There is some argument ( Oster et al. , in press ) about whether the facial actions MAX specifies as relevant to emotion are valid for infants . </signal.v.897><signal.v.898>Well , the short answer is , " hormones " . Hormones are the body 's way of sending signals , or information from one part of the body to another. In a computer , electrons ( electricity ) act as the signal; in the body ( which does n't have wires ! ) , the signals must be sent with chemicals , and that is the role of hormones. The term " HPT Axis " refers to the interaction of the hypothalamus , pituitary , and testes ( there are other axes as well ) . For the Leydig cells , Luteinizing hormone ( LH ) is released from the pituitary and it signals the Leydig cells to produce testosterone. Similarly , the pituitary releases FSH , and it tells the Sertoli cells to make sperm ( as well as androgen-binding-protein ) . The pituitary is a gland that produces and stores a number of hormones , under the control of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus might be considered to be the General ( as in military ) , and the pituitary would be a Colonel under the General 's command. The hypothalamus decides how the body 's organs should operate , and the pituitary gives the actual " orders " to the target organs. Some of the " signaling " hormones made or stored in the pituitary are : </signal.v.898><signal.v.899>When mechanical signals are shown , it can be assumed that the clear form will be white when the spectacle is rotated away , unless otherwise stated.

Alternate spellings listed as such in dictionaries will not be signaled . </signal.v.902><signal.v.903>Another method of expressing position is by bearing and distance from a given point. In signaling a position by this method , a certain sequence must be observed as follows : first , the bearing from; second , the distance from; third , the point. Thus X021 15 Point Blank would be interpreted as a position 15 miles 21 degrees true from Point Blank. The letter X and three figures will be recalled as expressing the bearing; the 15 group is taken to mean miles unless otherwise stated. The geographical position of the point might be given as a four-letter group from the code book.

( 1994 ) the HeII emission is only nebular and is mostly found in two regions ( their 3 and 4 ) . Kovo &amp;Contini ( 1998 ) report both broad and nebular HeII 4686 in two HII regions of this galaxy with a faint broad NIII 4640 in one of them. The nebular lines of [ FeIII ] 4658 [ ArIV ] 4711 , and [ ArIV ] 4740 are strong . </signal.v.906><signal.v.907>Pressure receptors should signal stimulus pressure in their discharge frequency. An example of a receptor that does this is shown in Figure 5-4 , which is again a log-log plot. Threshold stimulus values at each time during the maintained stimulus were subtracted from applied intensities. Each point is the average of 10 measurements. The slowly adapting receptor whose discharge is shown in Figure 5-4 clearly signals increasing force of the stimulus applied to it by increasing its discharge frequency. The increasing force will usually result in increased displacement as well , and it is not known whether any receptor signals force or displacement independently. Types I and II slowly adapting receptors are capable of signaling pressure as well as the duration of a mechanical stimulus . </signal.v.907><signal.v.908>All errors have names.

It is possible to send Morse code by several different methods : it is easily simulated by a simple electric buzzer; it may be signaled by the ship 's whistle , siren , or foghorn; or it may be transmitted by signal flag when the flag is held erect for a long interval for dashes and a short one for dots , or , more commonly , swung to the sender 's left for a dash and to the sender 's right for a dot. It is also sent with a blinker system . </signal.v.913><signal.v.914>Gene , note sure if you 're disagreeing with me or not , but when a motorist has already moved laterally in order to initiate a pass , she is moving along one line , while the cyclists she is passing , or planning on passing , are moving along another parallel line. The obligation to yield prior to moving laterally in that case is on the cyclist up ahead that she will be passing - he must not move laterally into her path. He must yield. He does not have the right to move left and initiate his turn simply because he signaled properly first. He almost must yield to anyone already moving straight into the space he intends to occupy. Again , ignoring the complications arising from this being a no passing zone. This is critical for all cyclists to understand , respect , and ride accordingly. It could save your life . </signal.v.914><signal.v.915>Then of course there was signaling SOS by radio in Morse code , or calling MAYDAY over voice radio to let the world know about your trouble.

Other examples of signaling used for control purposes are abundant. A referee at a sports event uses a whistle to signal stoppages of play to the athletes. When using a remote control with a television set or VCR , a controlling signal is sent to change the channel or play a tape.

Any procedure operating in the local Core-OMAR simulator and waiting for that event is activated as a result. Signal-event works in conjunction with the following SCORE forms for receiving a signal : asynch-wait , with-signal , and with-multiple-signals. The simulator uses hash tables to track procedures waiting for events to happen -- the event-table for asynch-waits and the waiting-table for with-signal and with-multiple-signals. These tables , together with the SCORE forms for generating and receiving a signal , provide the mechanism for coordinating the execution of procedures . </signal.v.939><signal.v.940>6.2 Postponement.

The first step is determining the likelihood that the current change in the leading index would occur during a business cycle expansion or contraction. This is calculated by looking at past data to see how often similar changes took place in expansions and contractions. For example , if the leading index increases 1 percent , and in the past this occurred 15 times while signaling expansions and only once while signaling contractions , then the probability is high that the current change is signaling an expansion . </signal.v.953><signal.v.954>The general procedure was similar to that of Experiment 1 , but with one important difference and several minor differences. The important difference was that rather than signaling different reinforcer probabilities , the symbol on the center key signaled different reinforcer durations. Specifically , a diagonal cross indicated that correct matching would result in 1.0-s reinforcement , whereas a vertical line signaled 4.5-s reinforcement. Observation by the experimenters confirmed that the short reinforcer duration of 1.0 s was sufficient for all pigeons to obtain at least one grain of wheat. Reinforcers were delivered for all correct matches , whereas nonmatches were never reinforced . </signal.v.954><signal.v.955>Figure 1. A typical signal-verified lucid dream. Four channels of physiological data ( central EEG [ C3-A2 ] , left and right eye-movements [ LOC and ROC ] , and chin muscle tone [ EMG ] ) from the last 8 min of a 30 min REM period are shown. Upon awakening the subject reported having made five eye movement signals ( labeled 1-5 in figure ) . The first signal ( 1 , LRLR ) marked the onset of lucidity. Skin potential potential artifacts can be observed in the EEG at this point. During the following 90 s the subject " flew about " exploring his dream world until he believed he had awakened , at which point he made the signal for awakening ( 2 , LRLRLRLR ) . This signal , made in non-lucid REM shows that the precise correspondence between eye movements and gaze is not an artifact of lucidity. After another 90 s , the subject realized he was still dreaming and signaled ( 3 ) with three pairs of eye movements. Realizing that this was too many , he correctly signaled with two pairs ( 4 ) .

Conversely , when the 19-day EMA declines below the 39-day EMA , it signals that declining issues are dominant.

As such , the observed effect could not be due to differential attention to the sample stimulus. A floor effect for short reinforcer trials made it difficult to assess whether the signaled magnitude changed the rate of forgetting. Given that the floor effect caused the forgetting function to become flatter rather than steeper , and given the weight of previous signaled magnitude data ( Jones et al. , 1995; McCarthy &amp;Voss , 1995; Nevin &amp;Grosch , 1990 ) , we conclude that the underlying process generates a change in the overall level of the forgetting function , not its slope . </signal.v.962><signal.v.963>The new orders index spiked 8.1 points to 41.2 , the first reading above 40 in seven months.

Unfortunately , the mother has been ill since the birth. While waiting , the characters feel the presence of someone entering their home. Characters are uneasy and want the unknown person to leave.

What we mean is whether the market sentiment is towards buying or towards selling. Suppose we are analyzing the price movement data for past 2 weeks and if the current closing price* levels are consistently near the highest price of past two weeks , it would indicate that people are still buying and the prices may go up further. Opposite to this If the current closing levels are consistently near the lowest price of past two weeks , it would indicate that traders are either not buying or they are selling the currency pair and hence the market has negative sentiment for the currency pair concerned. But only this observation is not conclusive. Stochastic indicator will also indicate about any recent change in the trend.

In the Synapse-to-Nucleus model , transport of molecules ( blue dots ) from active synapses ( blue axons ) is required for the signal to reach the nucleus. In this model , the nucleus adds up the signals from the many synapses where glutamate release and/or where plasticity had taken place. The transcriptional response , therefore , reflects the number of synapses active or plastic above a threshold number. In the Action Potential model , calcium ( red dots ) influx through voltage-gated ion channels and NMDA receptors signals the nucleus. In this case the nucleus is adding up the number and frequency of action potentials rather than the number of active synapses. The transcriptional response in this case is indirectly assessing the likelihood that plasticity had occurred.

On the surface , the Bank of England interest rate cut that prompted the rally would seem to be be negative for the Pound , since lower yield makes Britain a less attractive place to invest. On a deeper level , the relative modesty of the rate cut signalled to investors that the Bank of England is conscious of currency markets ( the record decline in the Pound in 2008 ) when carrying out monetary policy. In addition , the BOE 's proactive response to the credit crisis dwarfs the actions of the European Central Banks , which risks falling further behind the curve.

In these cases , the stimulus features may be signaled by activity in populations of neurons and decoded by comparison , addition or subtraction of their activity. It is the ensemble of cells that carries the information about the particular sensation. An example of a possible pattern or ensemble code is the coding of the submodalities of taste : sweet , sour , salty , and bitter.

This is why it is best to cluster turnouts together into configurations . That is , try not to leave small track spaces between turnouts. Try not to locate turnouts inside of tunnels. These can be signaled to avoid collisions , but the wiring is more difficult. Stub sidings are usually ignored for block signaling. A diagram of the signal blocks will be produced and approved by the customer . </signal.v.1010><signal.v.1011>Second , to set up a call requires that network nodes ( or switches ) signal one another. Some of the same kinds of events need to be signaled , as in the user-to-network case , but the signaling must account for the fact that both endpoints are machines. For example , just as a customer signals initiation of a call by going off-hook , one switch must signal call initiation to another by seizing a trunk between the two. Similarly , a switch must signal its readiness to receive digits and route the call. Finally , digits must be transferred between switches , just as between a user and a switch . </signal.v.1011><signal.v.1012>In summary , I think what you 're all assuming ( please correct me if I 'm wrong ) is that from the moment O'Donnell first signaled , Knight could have , and therefore should have , yielded , period.

Agents that can not detect any signal , simply follow the walls ( left or right , defined randomly or by given ID numbers ) . However , if a robot following the walls can not still detect any signal after a number of turns with an angle greater than a predefined value , it enters the first alley on the right or on the left , to stop a possible vicious circle.

A woman could be looking at a man standing nearby or merely looking for someone she knows. It ' s also the case that courtship is a process , not a unitary event. Courtship signaling involves repeated nonverbal indications of attraction on the part of both partners. So if a woman in a club makes repeated eye contact , while moving her body to the beat of the music , all the while laughing and touching her hair , it may just be that she ' s interested in a particular man or men. At least , that may be true for the moment. But the presence of these behaviors doesn ' t guarantee that she ' ll continue to be attracted. Each member of the courting couple gets the opportunity to decide periodically if s/he wants to move onto the next phase.

The three known secondary messengers are ( 1 ) cyclic nucleotide compounds ( cNMPs ) , cAMP , and cGMP; ( 2 ) inositol phospholipids; and ( 3 ) Ca2+ ions. After a hormone binds with a receptor molecule it via a transducer protein sends the hormones signal through the membrane. The protein receptor initiates the formation of a second messenger , whether it be it be cAMP or an inositol phospholipid , which then binds to an internal regulator. The internal regulator controls the target cells ' response to the hormone 's signal . </signal.v.1069><signal.v.1070>However , it became a rebellion that no one noticed or even cared about; I was never locked up , or threatened with deportation.

Those sequences were segmented into 500 ms epochs so that for each condition ( left hand clenching , right hand clenching , dream counting ) eight epochs were available. The epochs were digitally filtered on the alpha band ( 8-12 Hz ) . Finally , power values for 125 data points of each epoch were calculated and averaged ( for methodological details see 22 ) . </signal.v.1072><signal.v.1073>In his press conference , ECB president Jean Claude Trichet signaled an interest rate increase would probably occur in March.

However , some structurally related peptides ( antagonist peptides ) do not activate the T cells but prevent them from responding to agonist peptides. The clinical importance of antagonist peptides has been seen with HIV infection. HIV has a high mutation rate , which allows it to escape adaptive immunity. Mutant peptides have been shown to block lymphocyte activation by agonist peptides. Other peptides lead to only partial activation of the T cell and are called partial agonists. Partial agonists may signal the T cells to secrete cytokines but not to proliferate. This may happen when peptide binds TCR but co-receptor ( CD4 or CD8 ) does not bind MHC . </signal.v.1080><signal.v.1081>II Zw 40 -- Broad HeII 4686 was detected by Kunth &amp;Sargent ( 1981 ) in this well studied low metallicity galaxy.

Although their primary intent was to document greeting rituals , they observed the above behaviors in both men and women. Kendon ( 5 ) then covertly filmed a couple seated on a park bench in order to record the role of facial expressions during a kissing round. He discovered that it was the woman ' s behavior , particularly her facial expressions , that functioned as a determinate in modulating the behavior of the man. Similarly , other research ( 2 ) showed that it was the woman ' s behavior that was important in initiating conversation between strangers. Both in laboratory settings and in singles ' bars or dance clubs , conversation was initiated only after the woman glanced at the man more than once. He argued that experienced men looked for the woman who signaled her interest in them and that her glances and smiles , in essence , granted them permission to start a conversation . </signal.v.1095><signal.v.1096>Productive rearrangement of b chain is followed by its expression on the T cell membrane with CD3 and surrogate a chain , pTa ( analogous to l5 in B cells ) . Signaling through the preT receptor causes the cells to stop rearranging b chain , undergo a period of proliferation , and begin to express both CD4 and CD8 , becoming double positive T cells. Membrane CD25 is lost at this stage. Double positive cells re-express RAG-1 and RAG-2 to rearrange their a chain genes. a chain rearrangement can occur on both chromosomes and continue until the cell undergoes selection or dies , so T cells are not allelically excluded for a chain. However , even cells with two different TCR have only one which can bind self MHC with enough affinity to pass positive selection ( one functional receptor specificity ) . Double positive ab T cells move into the cortico-medullary junction , where they undergo positive and negative selection and mature into Th and Tc cells . </signal.v.1096><signal.v.1097>Some drivers and bicyclists are under the mistaken belief that motorists can not use the bicycle lane at any time; however , so long as bicycles are yielded to when a motorist intends to turn , park , or pull to the side of the road , ( such as to pick up or drop off passengers ) , the bicycle lane is available for motorist use. This means that a bus driver crossing over the bicycle lane in order to drop off or pickup passengers should pace their entry into the bicycle lane so as not to interfere with the progress of bicyclists in the lane. The best practice is to slow slightly , allowing the rider to ride through and out of the path of travel of the bus before signaling and moving over to the stop. Speeding up and then cutting in front of bicyclists in the bicycle lane in order to move to a bus stop is a violation of the law , and is certain to irritate bicyclists who feel that they have been muscled aside by the large bus . </signal.v.1097><signal.v.1098>NGC 4532 -- The presence of a weak broad WR bump has been signaled by Ho et al.

An exception to this is the Absolute Permissive Block ( APB ) system ( see below ) which in some implementations provide full safety for opposing trains. Most APB applications do , however , sacrifice a little safety for operational flexibility and therefore also needs an occupance permission system overlaid . </signal.v.1102><signal.v.1103>Finally , action in the inciting incident is signaled by the threat of something that needs to be blocked.

In fact , a number of indicators such as broken trend lines and support zones , declines of 20 or more on many indexes have already announced the bear market era. So why has our Model not signaled it with a Sell signal ? There can be conflicting trends and there can be absence of trends. Occasionally , as currently , the next intermediate market move could just as well be up as down.

The ABS ensures the safety for trains running with the current of traffic ( dark green and brown lines ) . ABS/DT is typically found between sections of CTC or CTC xMT where traffic requirements do not warrant the extra expense of bidirectional signaling. Trains can be safely overtaken on sidings in ABS/DT territory without the need for a formal Occupancy Permission System. Rules , often combined with special Leave Siding signals , ensure that the train in the siding does not enter the main track in a way that will compromise safety ( cyan line ) . Trains on such lines are only informally told to , say , take siding to be overtaken.

The Near-term Bull signaled bear and sell for most of the ETF ' s that are tracked daily. But it has not yet signaled sell for all of the daily tracked ETF ' s. This suggests some possibilities , the Near-term Indicant may have been premature in the sell/bear signals. In other words , the bear has not yet garnished unanimous support for its ambition. However , the near-term attributes continue in their support of the bear. The market can be more volatile during periods of convergence.

These reports were signaled to Lieutenant Camp , acting signal officer stationed near General Porter 's headquarters.

When a handset is picked up ( the telephone goes off-hook ) , this action closes the circuit that draws current from the telephone company CO and indicates a change in status , which signals the CO to provide dial tone. An incoming call is signaled from the CO to the handset by sending a signal in a standard on/off pattern , which causes the telephone to ring . </signal.v.1149><signal.v.1150>The " Take Up Slack " signal is given to instruct the tow pilot to begin a slow taxi forward to remove slack from the towline. The wing runner signals the tow pilot to begin removing slack from the towline by moving one arm from side to side through an arc below the shoulder. Note : Throughout the process , the wing runner should be monitoring the rope for proper takeout of the slack , the glider for further signals , and the pattern for conflicting traffic watching the towplane provides no useful information ! </signal.v.1150><signal.v.1151>In pursuit of price stability , the Federal Reserve in recent years has in effect adopted a quasi ( informal ) inflation targeting procedure , which has succeeded in lowering and containing inflation.4 With price stability the central focus of monetary policy , the policy apparatus chosen should be that which best contributes to achieving this goal. Key elements of this policy apparatus are the intermediate indicators or guides used to achieve price stability. Such intermediate indictors are essential to this effort because of well-known policy lags , the frequent need for pre-emptive policy action , and other well-known problems with direct price targeting.5 Appropriate intermediate indicators should be reliable forerunners or proxies for inflation or inflationary expectations : indicators or guides that reliably signal future changes in inflation or changes in inflationary expectations . </signal.v.1151><signal.v.1152>The Evening star formation is also a three candle formation that occurs usually at the top of an uptrend.

Early thymocyte precursors are CD4CD8 ( double negative ) , and those that have successfully rearranged and expressed a productive T-cell receptor ( TCR ) chain ( TCR ) are signaled to rearrange their TCR gene locus , to become CD4CD8lo precursor cells , and to subsequently differentiate into CD4+CD8+ ( double-positive [ DP ] ) thymocytes. As a result , most DP thymocytes express assembled TCR complexes on their surface ( for a review , see reference 18 ) . However , cell surface expression of TCR complexes is not sufficient to promote the further differentiation of DP thymocytes into mature CD4+CD8 and CD4CD8+ single-positive ( SP ) T cells. Rather , only DP thymocytes with TCRs of appropriate specificity for intrathymic ligands are signaled to further differentiate into CD4+CD8 and CD4CD8+ SP T cells ( 2 , 3 , 9 , 30 , 35 , 36 ) . Thus , each developmental step in the thymus is characterized by changing expression patterns of CD4 and CD8 coreceptor molecules. However , the molecular bases for these changing coreceptor expression patterns during thymocyte development remain to be fully elucidated . </signal.v.1155><signal.v.1156>Anyway , do n't forget that this is the lady herself that will be spinning , she wo n't need your leading help by pushing on her hands ( and not by touching her shoulders ) .

However , the indicator signaled a slowdown in growth for the third successive month from the 2.5-year peak of 7.8 percent registered last October. The All Industry Index rose slightly in January , to 58.9 , from levels of 58.5 recorded during November and December. Inflation in Russia in January 2006 amounted to 1.7 , the Federal State Statistics Service said. Inflation in January 2006 ran at 2.4 , and in January 2005 - 2.6 .

To bike on that road is scary enough , and to understand the traffic patterns and speed should tell cyclists to be overly cautious. Anytime I want to cross traffic to turn , especially out in the rural areas , I double check ... if not more , depending on the road layout. And signaling is another part of this unfortunate equation. I will wear my arm out , just holding it out to signal for longer periods of time. And doing so while looking back repeatedly. I 'm sorry for all those who knew Tim , but we all need to remember to be overly cautious in these areas . </signal.v.1166><signal.v.1167>Recently , a clue was offered by AIDA-1d ( 28 ) . When expressed in dissociated primary hippocampal neurons , eGFP-AIDA-1d was found to be chiefly localized in post-synaptic densities of dendritic spines and translocated to the nucleus within 3 5 minutes after stimulation with NMDA ( 28 ) . However , because AIDA1-d 's translocation to the nucleus was calcium-independent , this particular molecule probably signals the nucleus about synaptic glutamate release , and not plasticity per se , which would be the primary advantage of this model over the action potential model if such a feature were important for LTP-related signaling. Interestingly , AIDA-1d is not involved in transcription , but instead may have other functions in the Cajal bodies ( 28 ) . Nevertheless AIDA1d 's rapid nuclear translocation does prove the presence of railroads ' capable of quickly delivering yet unidentified immediate early gene-regulating cargo ' to the nucleus within matter of minutes. Whether such a transported signal could be speedy enough to commence transcription of a gene like arc , detected within 2 minutes , however , is less likely . </signal.v.1167><signal.v.1168>154.

It is difficult to signal hipness without spending the time to know what is hip and to purchase or find these things. In the case of cheap knock-offs , this is discouraged by brand labels and the loss of status if you are found out. In fact , the wide use of cheap versions probably increases the value of real ones in popular culture.

In the case that the declarer is playing a suit and the defender has no need to signal his count or attitude , and a suit to which the defender has no need to provide a suit preference signal , and if the defender is following with cards that are essentially equals , the defender may make his first three plays in an order , which provides the partner count in another suit . </signal.v.1207><signal.v.1208>I once got a driver 's license in Mexico City , where aggression was the rule. But even here , intentions had to be signaled honestly. Above all , it was essential to avoid eye-contact with other drivers. In the traffic circles of the city , the trick was to avoid letting the other drivers see that you had seen them. Once the other drivers knew that you knew they were there , they would proceed at high speed around the circle , completely ignoring your presence , because they knew that you knew that they were there , so they expected you to stop or slow down. And you had to , or be killed . </signal.v.1208><signal.v.1209>NOTE : Some cars do not permit the driver to extend an arm out the window. In such cases , the car 's turn right turn signal will be used to signal Pit In. Other signals may be used when participating cars are not so equipped.

Figure 4.1.1 shows the behavioral modules of an Army-ant robot as discussed in this chapter. As seen in the figure , robot behaviors are affected by other agents ' status/behaviors as well as their own sensory data. The lines define the activation caused by a specific behavior module or sensory data. For example , avoid-obstacle behavior is induced by search and move-to-goal behaviors , and is also affected by sensor data signaling the presence of other agents and/or obstacles. On the other hand , the overall behavior of the team being affected by each individual behavior to some degree , the size of the team and the environment changes as the robots operate. Therefore , Army-ant robot behaviors have to be modeled ( if possible ) as a complex dynamic system with continuously changing parameters. Although there are artificial intelligence methods to define decision systems by using behavioral models , the behavioral model of an Army-ant team will be much more complicated than a single agent case [ 26 ] . </signal.v.1210><signal.v.1211>SIGSEGV indicates a segmentation violation'' and is often signaled when a process dereferences NIL.

Using calcium-imaging techniques and calcium chelators , several groups have now proved beyond doubt that a rise in intracellular calcium is a primary event during onset of various forms of long-term plasticity ( 48 , 49 ) . Now appreciated , however , is that calcium can act in cellular locations far removed from the synapses , including at the nucleus. Such signaling to the nucleus can be thought of as taking place in two very different strategies. In the first case , calcium may act indirectly though calcium-sensing signaling molecules at the membrane or in the cytosol. The second strategy involves direct activity of calcium itself within the nucleus . </signal.v.1218><signal.v.1219>A broken white line separates two lanes traveling in the same direction.

Thus , theoretically , tumor growth can be limited or eliminated entirely. Essentially , axitinib combats tumors through attrition. The drug fits into the receptors that would normally house VEGF molecules , but does so without turning on protective genes that the normal VEGF signal would. As a result , the tumor 's vascular cells can not proliferate and the tumor has a much harder time obtaining nutrients by which to grow. Alternatively , antibody drugs like bevacizumab work by targeting the VEGF signaling molecules themselves , binding to them in a way that makes them unable to bind to their receptors; so the growth signal is interrupted . </signal.v.1228><signal.v.1229>The McClellan Summation index generally oscillates between 0 and 2000 although it can move outside of this range during extreme or unusual market conditions. Historically , major market bottoms occur after the index falls below -1000. Readings above +1600 often indicate a major top is near. Top and bottom signals carry more significance if the index is also diverging from the associated market average. According to the McClellans , the beginning of a new bull market is signaled if the NYSE-based Summation index first moves below the -1200 level and then quickly rises above +2500 . </signal.v.1229><signal.v.1230>This process includes a handwashing signal device placed on or inside a soap dispenser to assist those needing to wash their hands. Why a soap dispenser ? Sinks designated for handwashing purposes generally have soap dispensers within reach.

Presumably , the item you spend a lot of time on is important to you , and spending that time is the cost of belonging to/having status with a particular social group.

The forecasting literature has shown that combining forecasts from different models can improve certain aspects of forecast accuracy. That appears to be the case here since the two models signal BOPEC changes for different , although overlapping , sets of BHCs. Hence , another way to gauge the contribution of equity market information is to examine the additional forecast signals for public BHCs as generated by the extended model relative to the core model 's signals. At four quarters prior , the extended model signals 72 additional BOPEC changes , of which 27 ( about 40 ) were correct. The correct signals were almost evenly split between BOPEC upgrades and downgrades. For one quarter prior , 101 additional BOPEC changes were signaled , of which 44 were correct and again almost evenly split between upgrades and downgrades . </signal.v.1246><signal.v.1247>This macro checks that argument satisfies predicate.

In order to mimic actual practices , we reestimated the BOM model with and without equity market variables every quarter based on a rolling four-quarter sample of data. The estimated models then were used to generate one-quarter-ahead BOPEC forecasts. The model signals a change in supervisory rating if the BOPEC forecast is more than three-quarters of a rating grade different from its corresponding lagged BOPEC rating. ( Note that the forecasts are continuous variables and need not take integer values like the BOPEC ratings themselves. ) When compared to all the ratings in our sample at four quarters prior to assignment , the extended model 's forecasts correctly identify 70 of all the BOPEC assignments and about 18 of all BOPEC changes. These percentages increase to 76 and 36 , respectively , at one quarter prior to assignment . </signal.v.1252><signal.v.1253>The city of Las Vegas department of Public Works is responsible for the operation of approximately 472 signaled intersections within city limits.

Evidence exists that there are receptors in the hypothalamus that sense the temperature and osmolality of the blood and perhaps also the concentration of glucose in the blood. There are undoubtedly receptors in various parts of the body , including the brain , that can sense the circulating levels of hormones in the blood.

Lifting a 500-pound weight is a reliable signal of strength; a weaker person simply can not do it. " Strategic " or " handicap " signals are assessment signals that indicate possession of a great deal of some resource by wasting that resource ( Maynard-Smith &amp;Harper 2003; Zahavi , 1977 ) . A moose 's antlers waste energy; a fast sports car wastes money. Here the term " waste " is descriptive rather than pejorative the idea is that only someone who has an excess of a given resource can afford to expend it for communicative display. Zahavi ( 1977 ) emphasized that these costly signals are only reliable in the domain of the cost. The owner of an expensive car may use it to signal both wealth and attractiveness , but its high price only guarantees that the owner is wealthy; it is an unreliable indicator of attractiveness . </signal.v.1255><signal.v.1256>A.

To study cytokine effects in vivo we inject mice with endotoxin isolated from bacteria. The endotoxin we use is lipopolysaccharide which is a component of the bacterial cell wall. LPS is what signals the immune system that bacteria are present. Macrophages have LPS receptors that sense bacteria have invaded the body. The macrohpages respond by producing cytokines and the cytokines produce all of the symptoms that accompany bacterial infection such as fever , edema , etc. Instead of actually injecting mice with bacteria we use LPS which evokes much the same response. When we did this we observed that c17 expression was indeed inhibited as we expected. We first looked 24 hours after injection and saw that c17 was completely gone ! Careful studies showed that LPS causes testicular macrophages to produce cytokines but that Leydig cells themselves are not sensitive to LPS directly.

A novel procedural difference was that , unlike previous signaled magnitude experiments ( Jones et al. , 1995; McCarthy &amp;Voss , 1995; Nevin &amp;Grosch , 1990 ) , the signal for reinforcer probability or magnitude was only presented after the sample had been extinguished. This change followed Nevin and Grosch 's conjecture that the signaled magnitude effect resulted from greater attention to the sample on large-reinforcer trials , as evidenced by a greater number of pecks to the constant-duration sample. A similar account could apply to a signaled probability effect because the version reported by Nevin et al. ( 2003 ) involved the signal ( the multiple schedule component stimuli ) preceding the sample for the DMTS trial. Because the signal in the present experiment was not presented until after the sample had been presented , any signaled probability or magnitude effect found could not be the result of differential attention to the sample . </signal.v.1271><signal.v.1272>Earnings missed forecasts as the government took steps to restrain stock and property gains and consumer inflation.

There is no penalty if a player who has signaled answers before being acknowledged . </signal.v.1273><signal.v.1274>An alternative cause of the signaled probability and magnitude effects is that signaled reinforcement could affect disruptive or facilitatory behaviors during the retention interval. When disruptive events such as food presentation ( Jans &amp;Catania , 1980 ) or houselight illumination ( Harper &amp;White , 1997 ) occur throughout the retention interval , accuracy declines. Such disruptions , however , tend to have little effect at short retention intervals , and a much larger effect at long retention intervals. This results in steeper forgetting functions , rather than functions that are overall lower. According to Harper and White , this is because the effect accumulates as the retention interval lengthens. It is only when the disruption lasts for the same amount of time in each retention interval that a similar drop in performance occurs at all delays. Because it is unlikely that signaled reinforcement would affect a constant duration of disruptive or facilitatory behaviors , we conclude that it is more likely that signaled reinforcement exerts its influence on processes that are independent of the duration of the retention interval . </signal.v.1274><signal.v.1275>10.

Crossing was more accurate when audible signals came only from the far end of the crossing , rather than the typical practice of presenting signals simultaneously from both ends. Alternating the signal between ends of the crossing was not helpful. However , providing a locator tone at the end of the crossing during the pedestrian clearance interval improved crossing accuracy. These findings offer less promise for the usefulness of the alternating signal mode , especially when the findings for single vs dual crosswalks are considered. In previous studies , only one crosswalk was signaled , but this research compared signaling a single crosswalk versus two parallel crosswalks in two experiments. Errors were lower in the alternating mode than the simultaneous mode , but only when a single crossing was signaled.

In his case , it fits in with the signaling of leisure time , high status , and wealth. Fashion also differentiates sex and other societal roles. Veblen says that apparel is inextricably tied to function , but that actual functionality indicates the need to be functional , thus the difference between the practical , dark colored clothing of a laborer and the delicate , clean , restrictive clothing of a high fashion woman in a corset , high heels , and an elaborate , expensive hat. These two cases signal very different things in terms of social groupings and hierarchical status , and are strongly linked with your ability to spend the time to keep up on the latest fashions and afford to waste wealth , time , and functionality. In an interesting twist , veblen also indicates that such a woman signals these things for her husband as well as herself. The head of the family can afford these things and the number of people he can support and the less they have to labor , the higher his status and wealth in a particular society . </signal.v.1315><signal.v.1316>However , in Oregon ' s legal system of comparative negligence , so long as the fault of the injured bicycle rider is no greater than the fault of the driver , the bicyclist still receives compensation for injuries , albeit reduced by his or her percentage of negligence.

Of course , the act itself is altruistic , so how should we judge the person ? In this case , there ' s no causal link from the individual ' s conscience to their action , although the diagnostic value of the act suggests such a link.

Nevin , Milo , Odum , and Shahan ( 2003 ) found that matching at both 0-s and 3-s delays was more accurate when a higher probability of reinforcement ( 0.8 vs. 0.2 ) was signaled prior to DMTS trials. Their experiment was not directly comparable to standard signaled magnitude procedures , however , because DMTS trials were accessed by key pecking in a two-component multiple schedule. In more standard procedures , manipulations of reinforcer probability have typically focused on differential outcomes , where reinforcer probability differs for correct B1 and B2 responses ( DeLong &amp;Wasserman , 1981; Peterson et al. , 1980; Santi &amp;Roberts , 1985 ) . In these experiments , accuracy is overall higher with different reinforcer probabilities than same probabilities for correct B1 and B2 responses. Reinforcer probability also has been manipulated between conditions , where overall higher reinforcer probabilities for correct B1 and B2 responses generate overall more accurate performance ( Brown , 2003; White &amp;Wixted , 1999 ) . </signal.v.1328><signal.v.1329>Explanation : The power amplifier for the indicated motor has signaled a fault condition.

For the previous 8 years the US did n't want an international mercury treaty and things did n't progress ( to put it mildly ) . ? But at the beginning of the last negotiation session , the Obama Administration signaled that they wanted a mercury treaty. ?

Thus , the Node B could change the modulation scheme and the number of channelisation codes freely for the retransmission and this type of operation mode could be switched on/off by higher layer signaling. The problem with this proposal is that if the UE does not receive the first transmission correctly , it does not get the TBS at all ( since it may be nonsensical in the retransmissions if the Node B has changed the modulation or the number of channelisation codes ) and the TB is lost.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </signal.v.1350><signal.v.1351>The first mission of the game had me driving a school bus.

He was assisted by Erica Duncan , MD , and Tanja Jovanovic , PhD , in this research. The study used yellow , green , and blue lights , which , in pairs , signaled caution or safety. Davis first trained the subjects to associate the yellow and green lights with a blast of air to the throat. How hard the veterans blinked was recorded as a measure of their startle response to this combination of colored lights. The study then created an association between a blue-green pairing of lights and no air blast , establishing a signal for relative safety . </signal.v.1354><signal.v.1355>It is based on the observation that buying support is normally signaled by increased volume and frequent closes in the top half of the period 's range.

Then again , drivers do so as well. Or at least I see an awful lot of people who speed , roll through stop signs at close to 10 miles an hour , do n't use turn signals , etc.. Speaking as someone who was on the bicycle side of crash at NE 33rd and Broadway in 1996 which was very similar to these two fatalities , if a driver turning right does n't signal the turn they can easily sideswipe a bicyclist riding beside or coming up behind them. It 's just my personal experience , but I 'd bet either the garbage truck driver failed to signal , the biker did n't see the signal , or the biker could n't slow down fast enough. In particular , see page 76 of the Oregon driver 's manual , which explicitly requires drivers to yield to cyclists in bike lanes before turning across the bike lane . </signal.v.1372><signal.v.1373>The audible component of the pedestrian signal has a quiet , slowly repeating tone or ticking sound throughout the DO N'T WALK phase and the clearance interval. This locator tone informs pedestrians that they need to push a button to request a WALK interval , and the sound itself guides the pedestrian to the location of the pedestrian actuated signal device. The WALK interval is signaled by a much faster tone. Another option includes verbal information indicating the name of the street controlled by the pedestrian actuated signal device. One manufacturer has developed an audio-vibrotactile pedestrian actuated signal device with the WALK signal and locator tone at the same volume , except when a pedestrian pushes the button for more than three seconds. The long button press requests a louder signal during the next pedestrian phase. Thus the pedestrian who is blind has louder information available on request , but other people in the neighborhood rarely hear a loud signal . </signal.v.1373><signal.v.1374>The issue of privacy has generated considerable concern in social network sites. People give away personal identification and publish intimate and revealing stories about themselves ( Barnes , 2006; Gross , Acquisti , &amp;Heinz III , 2005 ) . They may do so for several possible reasons. Some may think of the site as a closed and safe world , where only the small audience of their friends will look at their profile. Some may seek attention and find publishing controversial and provocative material to be an effective means of gaining quick fame ( or infamy ) . In some cases , the users whose profiles feature self-portraits with bongs and tales of ripping off the boss may be unaware of the potential consequences. Others , however , may be quite aware and be signaling lack of concern. They may be indicating that their future is so secure that no social network site indiscretion would jeopardize it , or they may be showing their alienation from the sort of future where discretion is needed. For such users , the risk itself is the benefit . </signal.v.1374><signal.v.1375>This box was a replacement structure , built in 1922 to replace the original burnt by raiders during the Civil War.

There are many possible reasons , including technical ones , for long delays , but incomprehension is not the most likely of these reasons , and hearers are certainly highly unlikely to signal incomprehension by failing to respond. The MOO data bear out this intuition : there are no cases in which a response delay perceived as abnormally long was interpreted as a failure signal . </signal.v.1377><signal.v.1378>Because there are both mutual and conflicting interests in most animal signaling systems , the fundamental problem in evolutionary signaling games is dishonesty or cheating. Why don ' t foraging birds just give warning calls all the time , at random ( false alarms ) , just in case a predator is nearby ? If peacocks with bigger tails are preferred by peahens , why don ' t all peacocks display big tails ? Too much cheating would disrupt the correlation at the foundation of the system , causing it to collapse. Receivers should ignore the signals if they are not useful to them and signalers shouldn ' t invest in costly signals if they won ' t alter the behavior of receivers in ways that benefit the signaler. What prevents cheating from destabilizing signaling systems ? It might be apparent that the costs of displaying signals must be an important part of the answer. However , understanding how costs can stabilize an honest correlation between the public signal trait and the private signaled quality has turned out to be a long , interesting process . </signal.v.1378><signal.v.1379>Yet another slow moving ( glacial in comparison to Coppock ' s Guide ) indicator that was signaling a significant low in equity markets.

If a signal is sent to a condition upon which more than one thread is blocked , then the thread with the highest priority is the one that is unblocked. And , if Thread A signals an empty condition with a value x , after which Thread B with a higher priority signals the condition with a value y , then a thread that subsequently executes t_wait will obtain the value y.

This area was selectively involved in signaling a switch in subjects ' behavioral choices during action-based but not the stimulus-based reversal. Neurons in this area have previously been implicated in processes related to action-based decision making in nonhuman primates ( Dorris and Glimcher 2004; Platt and Glimcher 1999; Sugrue et al. 2004 ) . A recent human fMRI study reported a change in activity in this region when subjects switched between exploratory and exploitative decision modes , such that activity in this region was higher when subjects decided to explore actions considered to have lower value than the best available option in order to gain more information about the rewards available on those actions ( Daw et al. 2006 ) . Here , activity in this region appeared to be related to subjects ' switching their choices , but only when those choices involved physical actions , not abstract options. Taken together , these findings support an important role for this brain region in action-based decisions . </signal.v.1386><signal.v.1387>With Wall Street , Administration and Federal Reserve spinmeisters and their shills in the popular financial media putting out tall tales of miraculous cures to the economic and systemic crises , a Flash Update seemed appropriate , despite the regular monthly lull in significant economic reporting. Instead of signals of an economic turnaround , key data continue to signal deepening inflationary recession. Instead of the systemic crisis being over , what the Fed and the Administration have done and are doing is to confirm that the financial system will be bailed out irrespective of how much money has to be created. Such , however , always has been a basic component of the crisis outlook; the Fed never had the option of letting the system fail.

Since these UEs use reference signals from antenna ports 0-3 for various purposes , the following general principles may be applied for embodiments of the present disclosure. On subframes that will be used by the UEs for existing communication cells ( e.g. , LTE Release 8 ) , the reference signals on antenna ports 0-3 remain unchanged. In one embodiment , additional reference signals may not be added to these resources ( even if they are orthogonal to a current reference signal ) on antenna ports 0-3 using some adaptation of CDM. Consequently a mechanism is needed to control which subframes are used by UEs for the existing specification ( LTE Release 8 ) . </signal.v.1410><signal.v.1411>Our range-breakout barometer accurately predicted the continued surge in British Pound volatility , but a more recent moderation in implied vols suggest that GBPUSD price action may slow in the week ahead.

Coding of vibratory frequency is perhaps the most trivial example of a possible interval code and , at the same time , the least different from a frequency code. When the stimulus is not periodic , the interval code is more obvious. It is possible that in some cells , such as pyramidal tract cells , a particular short interval between action potentials , in a train where the other intervals are much longer , may signal ( code ) the start of some movements. We will examine this in more detail later. Briefly , however , this phenomenon is related to a special event called facilitation that occurs in certain postsynaptic cells only when two presynaptic action potentials arrive at short intervals . </signal.v.1436><signal.v.1437>Exaggerated rumors came in from the front that the enemy in three strong columns were advancing upon our position.

In recent years , and especially since 1995 , certain bilateral and most multilateral measures of the dollar 's value have steadily appreciated , thereby persistently signaling ( other things equal ) that U.S. monetary policy has been firm relative to that in other countries.24 In particular , as Chart 7 indicates , the dollar has firmed on ( various measures of ) a trade-weighted basis , against the yen until 1998 , and especially against ( synthetic measures of ) the Euro. Notably , this persistent appreciation occurred during a period when core CPI continued to decelerate ( as depicted in Chart 3 above ) , suggesting that ( other things equal ) these dollar movements accurately signaled a continuing disinflationary environment despite unemployment falling below NAIRU and robust ( above potential ) GDP growth.

However , the actual mechanism by which coreceptor RNAs are selectively degraded is not well understood. It presumably involves the synthesis of sequence-specific RNases that specifically target noncoding sequences in coreceptor RNAs in immature DP thymocytes. Such RNases may be related to the adenosine-uridine ( AU ) binding factors ( 20 ) that have been implicated in destabilization of various lymphokine mRNAs and whose target AU sequences are primarily present in the 3 ' noncoding regions of certain mRNAs , including coreceptor RNAs . </signal.v.1449><signal.v.1450>Admiral Graves realized that he had permitted the situation to get out of hand and now turned his ships northward , with the hope that it was not yet too late to gain the Chesapeake ahead of the French.

These experiments revealed two important points. First , they confirmed that MHC-I-specific positive selection of DP into CD8SP thymocytes was 20-fold more efficient when DP thymocytes expressed the F5 TCR transgene than when they expressed a diversity of polyclonal TCR ( compare Figs. 6C and 4B ) . Second , and more importantly , they revealed that positive selection of DP into CD8SP thymocytes signaled by F5 transgenic TCR was increased more than 2-fold by CD8.4 coreceptors compared with CD8 coreceptors ( Fig. 6C ) . Remarkably , &gt; 60 of F5 DP thymocytes were positively selected in CD8.4 mice to differentiate into CD8+ T cells ( Fig. 6C ) .

PLC is an enzyme that cuts the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) into two other signaling molecules , inositol trisphosphate ( IP3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . IP3 diffuses away from the membrane and releases calcium from intracellular storage sites. Increased calcium levels activates the calcium-binding molecule calmodulin , which binds and activates other signaling molecules. DAG remains associated with the inner side of the plasma membrane and ( with calcium ) activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , which phosphorylates still other signaling molecules.

Only tissues with specialized proteins called endocrine receptors , which are specific to a particular hormone , can be signaled by the hormone. These endocrine receptors fall primarily into two categories : those that bind to peptide hormones ( for example , insulin ) at the cell surface , and those that bind to steroid hormones ( for example , estrogen and testosterone ) inside a cell. When the hormone of the right chemical shape binds to the receptor ( think of a lock and key ) , the receptor is activated. This activation ultimately changes which proteins ( the  " machines  " that do most of the actual work ) are active in the cell and to what extent. Although in plants both the distribution system and the effects of the hormones are quite different from those in animals , there are several hormones of both the steroid and peptide types found in plants as well , without which normal plant growth would not be possible . </signal.v.1530><signal.v.1531>Figure 2.

For those recurrent situations in which , on average , it was beneficial to share one 's emotion state ( and hence assessment of the situation ) with those one was with , species-typical facial and other expressions of emotion were constructed by selection.

The belly hair ahead of the penis orifice is soaked with urine and tinted a very dark brown. It can be assumed that the more a bull bugles , the more it sprays urine , and the more the urine smells. Thus , the sheer intensity of the scent a bull emits should signal its rank . </signal.v.1540><signal.v.1541>Once again , Detroit to the rescue.

Pollick observed communications among 34 captive chimpanzees and among 13 captive bonobos , also known as pygmy chimpanzees. The researchers logged every hand gesture , facial expression , and vocal cry that one animal directed at another. They also noted the social contextplaying , grooming , fighting , having sex , eating , and so onin which each signal occurred. Individual facial expressions and vocalizations were closely tied to a single context , showing little flexibility in meaning or usage , the scientists found. But the apes could use the same hand gesture in multiple contexts , the team reports. For example , reaching out with an upturned palm while eating appeared to be a request for more food , but in fighting situations , the same gesture signaled a desire for support . </signal.v.1544><signal.v.1545>Commodity prices : Since the mid-1990s , broad indices of commodity prices have generally signaled that monetary policy remained in an anti-inflation mode. Broad indices of core commodity prices have generally remained stable or persistently trended down since 1995 with some commodity prices indices remaining below commodity price levels registered in the early 1980s. The KR-CRB spot index ( which does not include energy prices ) , for example , has persistently trended down since the mid-1990s and remains at levels below those registered in the early 1980s22 ( see Chart 6 ) . This commodity price measure , therefore , served as a reliable forerunner of persistent downward trends of core CPI inflation during the latter half of the 1990s . </signal.v.1545><signal.v.1546>Being in fashion whether via physical clothing or online linking signals fitness in the continuously changing information world.

Anyone not privy to the Internet fashion of " lolcats " would find this image baffling , but for those in the know , it was a witty play on the preceding week 's wildly popular cat picture captioned with , " I can haz cheezburger ?

That means they are beginning to discharge ( presumably signaling pain ) at the temperature at which the response rate of most warm receptors is beginning to fall off from its maximum ( see Fig. 5-10 ) . The temperature range from 38-44 C could be distinguished by the central nervous system from that above 44 C by sensing the discharge of thermal nociceptors that would be zero in the former case but not in the latter . </signal.v.1550><signal.v.1551>This specification can be used in a number of modes.

The marginal contribution of using equity market information is notable since combining the core and extended model 's forecasts increased the number of rating changes correctly signaled by about 20 . We conclude that using equity market variables in this way may have practical value for supervisors for two further reasons. Equity market data are available sooner than supervisory data from quarterly financial statements , which could assist a monitoring model in detecting sudden changes in BHC conditions sooner. Since the cost of incorporating equity market variables into a model , such as the BOM model , is low , even small net improvements in forecast accuracy could be of value . </signal.v.1553><signal.v.1554>Signal not taken and trade turns out to be a loosing trade.Outcome of the trade : Neutral.Experience gained : The trader will start to think " hey , I 'm better than my system " .

It may be that the linguistic expression of indirect signals in these studies is only one component of the information conveyed and that in fact information from other channels does some of the work of signaling incomplete communication ( i.e. , providing redundancy ) . In the MOO , there are no means other than linguistic means to convey comprehension difficulties. The burden of communication thus falling entirely on utterances , it may be necessary to preclude any ambiguity by making signals as explicit as possible . </signal.v.1556><signal.v.1557>...

It will continue to run until the ambient temperature falls below the vent fan stop ( A T FAN STOP ) set point . </signal.v.1560><signal.v.1561>However , the function FAILED will indicate an error condition after an error has been signaled. Therefore , any program logic that depends on the value returned by FAILED may be affected by an error.

At this point , we had not yet written the device driver to generate the interrupts , so we used sleep ( 5 ) to simulate the generation of the interrupts. Ldb has a feature that informs us whenever the SIGALRM occurs at the completion of the sleep; see Figure 5 , where we enable this condition. This allowed us to make sure that our application ran periodically and that for every interrupt , the producer ran first , followed by the two consumers , each of which ran only once. In fact , we discovered a bug in the synch.c module when we ran the program using Ldb. We found that for the first interrupt only , the consumers ran before the producer had signaled them. This was because we had initialized the done_flag to 0 instead of 1. Ldb helped us track that down within the first few minutes of our debugging process. Notice that we first debugged the skeleton application. Trivial as it may sound , it 's a good practice to do so before completing the final application. If you wait until examining the final code , a synchronization or an initialization bug is much harder to track down . </signal.v.1562><signal.v.1563>Listing 2 , dkunix.c , is an example of the Unix daemon killer. The daemon killer first opens the control list of process identifiers. For each process in the list , it invokes the kill function to send out the signal.

After each process in the list has been signaled to shutdown , the daemon killer closes the control list and exits . </signal.v.1563><signal.v.1564>Same as wait ( ) except if the specified amount of time elapses before the thread signals , then RW_THR_TIMEOUT is returned.

Possible exceptions include RWCancellation and RWTHRInternalError . </signal.v.1564><signal.v.1565>Channel Associated Signaling ( CAS ) is also referred to as Robbed Bit Signaling. In this type of signaling , the least significant bit of information in a T1 signal is " robbed " from the channels that carry voice and is used to transmit framing and clocking information. This is sometimes called " in-band " signaling. CAS is a method of signaling each traffic channel rather than having a dedicated signaling channel ( like ISDN ) . In other words , the signaling for a particular traffic circuit is permanently associated with that circuit. The most common forms of CAS signaling are loopstart , groundstart , Equal Access North American ( EANA ) , and E &amp;M. In addition to receiving and placing calls , CAS signaling also processes the receipt of Dialed Number Identification Service ( DNIS ) and automatic number identification ( ANI ) information , which is used to support authentication and other functions . </signal.v.1565><signal.v.1566>Both of the subcategories are very self-explanatory.

On a good day , the semaphore telegraph was not used; trouble would be signaled if significant events occurred. During the late 1700s through the 1800s , war was a ongoing issue with Europe. The first formal telegraph " brought news of the capture of Quesnoy from the Austrians " ( Coe 6 ) . In other words , a signal from the semaphore telegraph marked the end of some battle. Later on , the semaphore telegraph developed into a system which provided instructions. " The military two-flag semaphore system is still in use today , and when done by skilled signalmen is very fast over relatively short ranges " ( Coe 3 ) . Still , military personnel have no need for semaphores since they have the capability to communication through other devices such as satellite radio . </signal.v.1568><signal.v.1569>An example of a validated alert would be if a stock is placed on the " watch list " because an alert signaled that the stock has declined to its rapidly rising 50-day moving average. The confirmation occurs if the stock reverses its downward direction after touching its rising 50-day moving average ( institutional investors tend to be buyers at such times ) . The alert announces " Here is one , watch it ! " The trader uses alerts because time is money. To achieve maximum returns on his money , the trader attempts to keep his portfolio fully invested in profitable positions. Any time a portfolio has a non-performing position , that portion of the portfolio exerts a drag on the result of all the positive work being done by the performing positions. Why buy a stock just because it has a " good story " and then wait for 6 months for it to make any progress , when a simple alert system can really direct you to stocks that are about to move now. By using alerts to create " watch lists , " you can dramatically cut your wait time for performance . </signal.v.1569><signal.v.1570>Electrically operated traffic signals have been in operation in the U.S. since 1914.

New long-slit observations at several position angles were obtained by Gonz lez-Delgado et al. ( 1995 ) , confirming the presence of broad HeII 4686 in the nucleus. Nebular emission can also be suspected from their spectrum. From the same observations Garc a-Vargas et al. ( 1997 ) find broad WR bumps ( 4660 ) in three extra-nuclear giant HII regions. One of them shows a definite detection of CIV 5808; for the remaining regions upper limits on CIV 5808 are given.

They need to be analyzed in context with proper interpretation. Regardless of the indicator , you must use several correct periods to establish context. Whenever possible , you should not make generalizations about the current behavior of market indicators without first observing their behavior over an extended period of time and in a wide range of market conditions. For example , a sharp rise by the SI will signal that some up cycle is underway.

A high number of interesting , unusual links signals that the person is spending time seeking out new sites , has good taste , and knows where to look. This is interesting because the effect of good blogs is that they save time for readers. A popular blog is of high status in the blog community , but also in the popular culture.

He testified that he had backed his truck up approximately ten feet after Mr. Green discontinued signaling him before Mr. Record was struck by the wheels on the right side ( Tr. 50 ) . </signal.v.1601><signal.v.1602>Courses and bearings are signaled by three figures , interpreted as true , unless expressly designated as magnetic. For example , a course of 45 degrees true would be simply 045; if it is to express a magnetic course of 45 degrees , then the signal would be 045 magnetic. When a course is signaled in code , a suitable code group to express the desired idea would be followed by the three numerals. In the case of a bearing , the letter X is joined to the numerals to form a single group , the X preceding the numerals. X045 would therefore signify " bearing 45 ( true ) .

All signals are equipped with the Safety Services pre-emption device that activates the 4-way red and separate white spotlights ( one each direction ) signaling to traffic that a Safety Services vehicle , from the City or another community , is rapidly approaching that intersection. A pre-emption spotlight that is ' on ' facing your vehicle takes precedence over any other signal color light. You MUST remain stopped , and in place , until the pre-emption spotlight is out and the signal returns to normal 3-color operation . </signal.v.1605><signal.v.1606>Four-way stops where divided streets meet or where there are multiple lanes in each direction can be very confusing to motorists. These are not common; such intersections are usually signaled or are signed as two-way stops. A signaled intersection with non-functioning signals due to a power failure , for instance can present a real challenge to drivers and is difficult to analyze into a small number of simple cases . </signal.v.1606><signal.v.1607>In Morse Code , SOS is written out as ... -- - ... and it sounds like dit dit dit dah dah dah dit dit dit. Typically , an SOS is signaled with no spaces between the letters , creating a continuous signal , and this differentiates it from other Morse transmissions. It is also very easy to identify , even if a transmission is picked up in the middle , because by convention people repeat an SOS several times , with small breaks between the individual transmissions. Even in situations where voice communications are available , a transmission may include SOS calls so that people just tuning it are aware that an emergency is unfolding . </signal.v.1607><signal.v.1608>Returns 0 if the specified collection is empty; returns a nonzero os_int32 otherwise.

The break sign is also used in spelling double letters; the first letter is made , arms dropped to the break position , and then immediately moved to the second letter. Each word is acknowledged aboard the receiving ship by making C ( the answering sign ) , and if not so acknowledged the word is repeated. When an error is made , the sender makes a succession of E 's ( EEEEEEE , etc. ) then signals the last word that was made correctly and continues his message.

After the chip has been configured and enabled for input operation ( block 602 ) , the I/O circuit is configured to force the input signal at the I/O pad to a default or fixed logic level using either a pull-up or pull-down structure within the I/O circuit ( block 604 ) . The pull-up enable signal is compared with a Data In signal that reflects the signal present at the I/O pin ( block 606 ) . If the Data In signal does not match the pull-up enable signal , an exception condition is signaled ( block 608 ) , indicating that the signal at the I/O pin has been tampered with and that a security violation has occurred , completing the method ( block 610 ) . </signal.v.1614><signal.v.1615>The encoding attribute specifies the preferred encoding to use for outputting the result tree. XSLT processors are required to respect values of UTF-8 and UTF-16. For other values , if the XSLT processor does not support the specified encoding it may signal an error; if it does not signal an error it should use UTF-8 or UTF-16 instead. The XSLT processor must not use an encoding whose name does not match the EncName production of the XML Recommendation . If no encoding attribute is specified , then the XSLT processor should use either UTF-8 or UTF-16. It is possible that the result tree will contain a character that can not be represented in the encoding that the XSLT processor is using for output. In this case , if the character occurs in a context where XML recognizes character references ( i.e. in the value of an attribute node or text node ) , then the character should be output as a character reference; otherwise ( for example if the character occurs in the name of an element ) the XSLT processor should signal an error . </signal.v.1615><signal.v.1616>In navigation , time is expressed in terms of hours up to 24 , rather than 12 for A.M. and 12 more for P.M. In signaling the same principle applies , so that any time can be expressed in four figures. For example , 2 : 10 A.M. becomes 0210; 3 : 12 P.M. would be 1512. In signaling a coded message , the letter T would be joined with these four numerals to form a single group and indicate that the numerals express time for example , T0210 or T1512. The T always precedes the numerals. In plain language messages ( as differentiated from code ) the context makes it clear when the message relates to time . </signal.v.1616><signal.v.1617>It will be appreciated that when a detect signal is signaled on terminal 83 during either the row or column scan , the generation of the detect signal is coincident with the timing of the circuitry applying the ripple signal to the row or column conductor at that instant.

If the expected signal is absent , a message is sent and the logic is not set up. If a block has an internal turnout ( the turnout , and the track segments at its throat and continuing legs are within the block ) , the tools will expect signals at that turnout even if it 's not at the end of the block. However , at times the user may not want to signal a seldom used turnout within a block. When following track through a block , the program will skip over unsignaled internal turnouts if this item , Skip Unsignaled Internal Turnouts , is checked. It will always , however , warn that it is doing so. Use this option with caution.

The problem of explaining how information was routed from one place to another was most puzzling in such a system , because any stimulus should in theory be able to set the whole mass alive with impulses -- all identical. How could any part of the system operate on its own; how could we tell hearing from smelling , high pitches from low ?

It is therefore plausible , as argued by Nevin and Grosch ( 1990 ) , that signaling a larger reinforcer improves performance by modifying attentional processes at the time the sample is presented. On the other hand , White ( 2001 ) demonstrated that performance at a particular retention interval and not others can be impaired by omitting reinforcers at that retention interval only. This reinforcer effect appears to result from a change in discrimination processes at the time of the choice ( White , 1991 , 2001 ) .

The kernel driver then creates a named event object that is used to signal the user-mode application when new event has been fired ( i.e. process starts or ends up ) . The control application opens the same event object and creates a listening thread that waits on this event. Next , the user mode application sends a request to the driver to start monitoring. The driver invokes PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine ( ) , which accepts two parameters. One of them specifies the entry point of a caller-supplied callback routine , responsible for receiving all notifications from Windows. Upon a notification , that takes place in the callback , the driver signals that event in order to inform the user-mode application that something has happened. The control application then gets the data for that particular event from the driver and stores it in a special queue container for further processing. If there is no need for detecting process execution anymore the user mode application sends a request to the driver to stop monitoring. The driver then deactivates the observing mechanism.

Utility Exercises . </signal.v.1667><signal.v.1668>Each column of the figure represents the responses of a single taste receptor to four different solutions , one from each submodality. The height of the bar indicates the magnitude of the response that particular receptor gave when the particular solution was poured over it. Looking at the response of only one receptor , it is impossible to tell what the stimulus was. For example , receptor 1 responds equally to salty and sweet and thus can not distinguish between the two. By comparing the responses of the four cells , it is possible to detect which stimulus was presented. Salty corresponds to large discharges from receptors 1 and 3 , sweet to large discharges from receptors 1 and 4 , and so on. There is a unique pattern of discharge across the group of receptors for each different quality , even though no one receptor can signal a given quality uniquely; obviously , there are more than four taste receptors in the tongue , but a similar principle could be applied to a much larger set of receptors . </signal.v.1668><signal.v.1669>If the player who answers is a teammate of the first player to signal , the moderator will treat the response as an incorrect answer from that team , assess a 5-point penalty to the player who answered ( if the question had not been completed ) and turn the question over to the other team.

It is repeated back , but the transmitting ship does not acknowledge its repetition by the receiving ship by making the C signal ( You are correct ) because this is not part of the text of the message. Should the receiving ship fail to repeat back the BT ( break ) signal , the transmitting ship must make it again , until properly acknowledged. When the message requests a repetition , the break sign is not used before the text . </signal.v.1671><signal.v.1672>FIGURE 7. Schematic representations of findings and the kinetic signaling model. Schematic representation that CD8.4 coreceptors improve the efficiency of positive selection of thymocytes expressing the F5 TCR transgene. All preselection DP thymocytes in F5 ( RAG ) mice obligatorily express the MHC-I-specific transgenic F5 TCR. Because positive selection is inherently inefficient , only a small minority of F5-expressing preselection DP thymocytes are signaled to undergo positive selection into intermediate thymocytes and to differentiate into CD8SP thymocytes. However , the number of F5-expressing DP thymocytes that can be signaled to undergo positive selection is influenced by the signaling intensity of CD8 coreceptors , with the effect that stronger signaling CD8.4 coreceptors increase the number of F5-expressing DP thymocytes that are signaled to undergo positive selection into intermediate thymocytes and to differentiate into CD8SP thymocytes . </signal.v.1672><signal.v.1673>3.3.2.3 Signalling the Chief Referee to stop the game should any infringements occur , by giving the appropriate signal for 'stop play ' . </signal.v.1673><signal.v.1674>A.

Cars behind you know that you are turning , and cars in front of you are not moving. But , our on-the-street survey found that 47 of all drivers signaled their intentions. In permissive situations , we found that the same number turned on their blinkers without cause for delay , and the other 53 didn't. But , when it was green lights , camera , action , an additional 32 turned on their signals to alert the cars in back of them that there is a reason they were not moving , and - more importantly - the cars going the other direction , so they could plan accordingly . </signal.v.1676><signal.v.1677>However , again , enabling robots to signal their status can not completely solve the problem of finding the pallets in warehouse.

Through the covert observation of over 200 women during more than 100 hours , Moore compiled a catalog of 52 female courtship behaviors. The catalog included such behaviors as glancing , primping , smiling , nodding , kissing , leaning forward and soliciting help. In a later study ( 10 ) , Moore found that female courtship behavior was so striking that a trained observer could use its frequency to predict with a high degree of accuracy the outcome of interactions between men and women ! In addition , the frequency of signaling appeared to be the more important factor in eliciting approaches from men , overriding such attributes as physical attractiveness. Although a high signaling , beautiful woman would be the most likely to be approached by the man she had been signaling , a high signaling average attractiveness woman would be much more likely to be approached than her low signaling , beautiful counterpart. In other words , nonverbal go signals are more powerful in promoting action from an admirer than mere physical beauty alone. So , you can see that body language is a tremendously important aspect of attraction . </signal.v.1682><signal.v.1683>The pituitary gland releases hormones that control many of the endocrine system 's functions.

Indeed direct evidence in favor of the action potential model for a role in consolidating synaptic plasticity was found when neurons were stimulated artificially , without activating synapses. When axons are stimulated , action potentials can propagate in both orthodromic ( away from the cell body ) and antidromic ( toward the cell body ) fashions. Using this concept of backward propagation by action potentials into the cell body , and that synapses can be " tagged " , such action potentials were found to be able to convert a decaying form of LTP ( early-LTP ) into a long-lasting form ( late-LTP ) ( 42 , 45 ) . The same type of antidromic stimulation of action potentials was also found to induce phosphorylation of important LTP-related signaling molecules like ERK and CREB and also induced IEG zif268 expression ( 42 ) . These observations show that action potentials are sufficient to induce nuclear signaling and importantly demonstrate that signals from synapses are redundant for LTP consolidation during the time-frame investigated . </signal.v.1708><signal.v.1709>If drmaa_wifsignaled ( 3 ) returned a non-zero value in the signaled parameter , the drmaa_wtermsig ( ) function evaluates into signal up to signal_len characters of a string representation of the signal that caused the termination of the job.

When a sacral dimple is associated with a spinal cord malformation , there is a risk that the ability to empty the bladder correctly may be impaired. This in turn can lead to urinary tract infection. In other words , the sacral dimple may signal a spinal cord defect which could impair elimination of urine which in turn could cause a urinary tract infection , not the other way around. There is nothing about urinary tract infections that can cause sacral dimples . </signal.v.1734><signal.v.1735>As shown on the chart below , the Greed and Fear net pick up a major drop in the S &amp;P a day before it happened on June 5 , and also signaled the rebound a day before it happened on June 14 , 2006.

This is traditional peak-and-trough analysis applied to an indicator. With the lower high and subsequent lower low , the up trend for MACD has changed from bullish to bearish. Second , a bearish moving average crossover , which is explained below , can act to confirm a negative divergence. As long as MACD is trading above its 9-day EMA or trigger line , it has not turned down and the lower high is difficult to confirm. When MACD breaks below its 9-day EMA , it signals that the short-term trend for the indicator is weakening , and a possible interim peak has formed . </signal.v.1737><signal.v.1738>I was sure that I was traveling at speeds of well over 2 , 000 miles an hour.

In fact , signaling in its broadest sense is now a major preoccupation of plant research. To place this in perspective , we can ask how many genes are likely to be involved with the specification of signal transduction components. It is thought that a minimum of 300 genes are required to produce a bacterial cell. That estimate is based in part on deduction and in part on the number of genes contained in organisms such as Mycoplasma. Attempts are under way to construct such minimal bacteria. However , bacteria such as Escherichia coli contain 3000 genes. The apparently inessential 2700 ( 90 ! ) are thought necessary to provide bacteria with the ability to tolerate randomly fluctuating environmental variation , thereby endowing the organism with a more sophisticated capacity for response . </signal.v.1763><signal.v.1764>Once a particular fashion becomes mainstream , it signals conformity , safety , a willingness to be one of the crowd.

Divergence can signal an up coming change in trend , a change of trend in progress or that a trend should continue. A divergence signal suggests watching for a trading opportunity in the direction of the signal. Divergences may continue over many swing highs/lows so price action should confirm your trade. This can be done in many ways , some of which are : price making a higher high/low or lower high/low or price testing the last swing high/low , price trading past high or low of previous bar , many of which will correspond with the MACD histogram crossing zero . </signal.v.1766><signal.v.1767>The US dollar ended the past week marginally higher after the Federal Reserve issued a more optimistic outlook on the economy.

Monitors also have condition variables , on which a thread can wait if conditions are not right for it to continue executing in the monitor.

Brugnera , A. Bhandoola , R. Cibotti , Q. Yu , T. I. Guinter , Y. Yamashita , S. O. Sharrow , and A. Singer , submitted for publication ) . In other words , signaled DP thymocytes initially converted into intermediate CD4+CD8 thymocytes even when they ultimately differentiated into CD8+ SP T cells. Importantly , we think that it is at this intermediate CD4+CD8 stage of development that lineage determination occurs. In intermediate CD4+CD8 thymocytes , TCR-selecting signals are assessed for their dependence on surface CD8 coreceptor engagements : TCR signals in DP thymocytes that are dependent on CD8 coengagement cease on conversion of DP thymocytes into intermediate CD4+CD8 cells because of decreased surface CD8 coreceptor expression , whereas TCR signals in DP thymocytes that are independent of CD8 coengagements persist on conversion of the cells into intermediate CD4+CD8 thymocytes. As a result , lineage choice is critically affected by the rapidity with which CD4 and CD8 coreceptor expression can be altered in signaled DP thymocytes . </signal.v.1784><signal.v.1785>At present , all these indicators are signaling a deepening recession , not a miraculous , overnight recovery.

The apparent first arrival , the school bus , did not seem to be going anywhere. The vehicle in front of me could not complete a left turn , as the school bus would have required it to stop in the middle of the intersection , which did not seem a proper thing to do. The vehicle to my left could not move through the intersection for the same reason. This seemed to leave me free to execute my left turn . </signal.v.1801><signal.v.1802>Survival-reproduction tradeoffs do not correspond to sports handicaps in any simple , useful way. Zahavi ' s intuition was correct in the very general sense that differences in costs can stabilize the evolution of an honest signaling system , but in sexually selected signaling , differences in costs are properly decreasing proportional ( or log ) marginal costs [ 30 ] . The mathematics can be interpreted to mean that higher quality signalers are more efficient at converting signal costs into reproductive benefits. This re-analysis undermines the idea that higher quality signalers are demonstrating their ability to waste more because the pattern of absolute signal costs across signalers of different quality remains undetermined. Depending on the specific form of the tradeoffs in any particular system , higher quality signalers might pay absolutely more or less for big signals than lower quality signalers pay for small signals. This might explain why the empirical data on the relationship between signals and costs are so inconsistent . </signal.v.1802><signal.v.1803>OK , I 'll hold my nose and bring up a few.

During President Bush 's Inaugural Address , January 20 , 2001 , we noted that he used an Illuminati code word ( Read NEWS1464 ) by which he signaled fellow occultists throughout the world as to his true nature and intentions without letting anyone else in on the " little secret " . </signal.v.1807><signal.v.1808>Here 's Russell 's rationale : " Sometimes a belated confirmation can signal that we 're close to the end of a move. That 's what happened during the 1932-37 bull market. In that instance , the Rails hit a high in June 1933 and then sold off while the Dow continued higher. Three years went by while the Rails stubbornly refused to confirm the rising Dow. Robert Rhea ( the great Dow Theorist ) wrote that maybe when the Rails finally do confirm the Industrials , the bull market will be near its end. In July 1936 the Rails finally confirmed the advancing Dow. But the belated Rail confirmation did indeed occur near the end of the long advance. The bull market pushed a bit higher into March 1937 and then fell apart. Over the next year the Dow lost roughly half its value.

Therefore , in claiming a signal as a product you are inherently attempting to mix in a process limitation ( signaling using the light as a signal ) into a product claim. If you do this in a normal product claim the method step will not count towards patentability. Thus , you only have two ways of claiming a signal , a process , or a product by process.

The stock advanced in a strong up trend and MACD remained above its 9-day EMA for 7 weeks. When a bearish moving average crossover occurred , it signaled that upside momentum was slowing.

The rule of thumb seems to be that whenever the XAU and HUI indices along with FCX all close below their respective 90-day moving averages at the same time ( after a sustained uptrend has been underway ) then a top is signaled which is usually followed either by a downside correction or a lateral consolidation usually lasting several weeks . </signal.v.1841><signal.v.1842>Other receptors besides TCR and BCR have signal transduction ITAMs. The Fc receptor for IgG3 ( FCg3R ) on NK cells , macrophages , and neutrophils bind IgG3-coated antigen on pathogens or cell surfaces and signals the cells to kill in a process called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) .

It held that to utilize July 18 , 1980 for the cut-off date of marital property " would be contrary to the fundamental policy " underlying the EDL and would enable a spouse to commence a " baseless matrimonial action " for the purpose of cutting off her spouse 's right to a share in subsequently obtained property , which would otherwise constitute marital property , while at the same time receiving the benefits of the parties ongoing marital relationship . </signal.v.1864><signal.v.1865>With multiple processes potentially being signaled before the signaler leaves the monitor , there is the possibility that the signal condition is no longer true when a particular waiting process wakes up. Further , some other process may have entered the monitor through an interface routine and modified the condition before the signaled process wakes up . </signal.v.1865><signal.v.1866>A longer-term trader can stay with trending positions longer by following the simple guidelines for the ADX line. According to research by computer trading expert Bruce Babcock , a climb by the ADX line above 40 followed by a downturn signals an imminent end to the current trend ( whether up or down ) . When this signal is given , traders should take profits on existing positions. More aggressive traders can use this signal to consider taking positions for a possible move in the opposite direction . </signal.v.1866><signal.v.1867>An action is a type which represents a signaled operation. With a stored action , you have access to that operation such that you may wait for the function 's completion if you need the effects to have taken place prior to reaching a certain point in code. Actions also provide an indirect interface to the result of a signaled function . </signal.v.1867><signal.v.1868>2 ) You have just played the boss card of a side suit ( say Diamonds ) and pard is void and signaled his suit preference. You want to give him a chance to trump. But after that what ? He needs an entry into your hand for a second ruff. If you have AKx it 's easy. Play the King and pard will see the entry. But what if you have Axxx in a side suit ? Use a binary signal to let pard know which suit to lead after trumping. Say you have A83 and A764. You play the A and pard plays the 2. Using Odd/Even that 's a negative signal , indicating a preference for clubs. You play the 8 for pard to trump. The 8 is an even card , which is a negative signal , telling him you may have an entry in clubs. He trumps , and returns a club , which you win. Then lead another heart for him to trump . </signal.v.1868><signal.v.1869>SIGALL is an ILE C/C++ extension that allows you to register your own default-handling function for all signals whose action is SIG_DFL. This default-handling function can be registered by using the signal ( ) function with SIGALL , as shown in the example section. A function check is not a signal and can not be monitored for by the signal function. SIGALL can not be signaled by the raise ( ) function . </signal.v.1869><signal.v.1870>Actually , re-reading that bit your comment suggests the possibility that if a route is signalled from one RR to a different RR it could mean that the aspect colour could be different ? Signal systems are meant to control speed , to give the train crews advance warning of a stop. So to do that , the signal system has to know whether any of the next two or three signals are at stop. If you are signaling onto another railroad , then the signals on your railroad may not know what the indications are on the other railroad. So from your railroad ' s point of view the other railroad is dark territory . If its all one railroad , then its not a problem . </signal.v.1870><signal.v.1871>" The comments from Trichet , basically signaling that the ECB held a vote on whether to lower interest rates and the euro zone economies are poised to decline significantly ... are promoting a lower euro , " said Greg Salvaggio , vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in New York . </signal.v.1871><signal.v.1872>Earlier this week the bank slashed its key overnight rate by 50 basis points to 3.00 percent and signaled further cuts were needed , but it shied away from indicating when it would make its next move . </signal.v.1872><signal.v.1873>When the Fed signaled rate hikes in 1994 and 2004 , the stock market rally gave way to a sideways , volatile period over much of the next 12 months. On February 4 , 1994 , without a prior signal , the Fed began the first of a series of rate hikes. On January 29 , 2004 , the Fed removed the phrase considerable period referring to how long they intended to keep rates low as a signal that rate hikes were coming ( they began to hike rates five months later at the end of June ) . While peak-to-trough the S &amp;P 500 declined about 8-9 , what took place after the Fed signaled their intention to begin a series of rate hikes is more accurately characterized as a sideways , volatile environment for stocks . </signal.v.1873><signal.v.1874>In both operating systems , events are signaled by software interrupts. A signal is a notification mechanism used to notify a process that some event has taken place or to handle the interrupt information from the operating system. An event is used to communicate between the processes. Exceptions occur when a program executes abnormally because of conditions outside the program 's control . </signal.v.1874><signal.v.1875>If pid is -1 and the user is not the super-user , the signal is sent to all processes with the same uid as the user excluding the process sending the signal.

If you pay attention to those signals it becomes clear that there are certain reliable and repeatable signals your body produces to signal the onset of a cold. For most people the signal is a slight sore throat , scratchy throat causing a cough , runny nose or congested sinuses. These signals which will vary from one individual to another but will generally be recognized as the cold onset signal which precedes the actual cold by usually one day or so. The onset signal is caused by the body 's immune system attempting to counteract the virus and producing an inflammatory response . </signal.v.1876><signal.v.1877>The signaling semantics of a single-threaded process can cause problems in a multithreaded process. Traditionally , an operating system discerns a process as one system entity. Thus if some thread causes a trap , or a signal is generated for a process , a question arises as to which thread of control should be interrupted to receive the signal ? Therefore , the semantics for signaling a process need to be extended to include multiple threads-of-control within a process , that is , a multithreaded process . </signal.v.1877><signal.v.1878>, came up with a more complex system of alphabetical smoke signals around 150 BC.

You would push it up to signal a right turn , and down to signal a left turn , but it is the same switch regardless of the direction you plan to turn. Is this what you need ? If so , you need to specify whether or not your car has a tilt/telescope wheel , because that requires a different switch . </signal.v.1881><signal.v.1882>Pox 4 -- Kunth &amp;Joubert ( 1985 ) list this object as having a broad HeII 4686 excess above 0.8 of the background. This object is also included in the studies of Campbell et al. ( 1986 ) and Masegosa et al. ( 1991 ) , which signal a possible WR feature in one or two regions. The reanalysis of Pindao ( 1998 ) confirms the WR bump in one region. Broad HeII 4686 has been measured by Vacca &amp;Conti ( 1992 ) in two regions. The existence of a broad component is not well established ( e.g. Kunth &amp;Sargent , 1981 ) . Nebular HeII 4686 is most likely present in region A ( see spectrum of Vacca &amp;Conti 1992 ) .

If they are busy skiing and do n't notice , and you have to change direction , do it gently and while they are crossing the wake . </signal.v.1890><signal.v.1891>OPEC wanted to signal to traders , analysts , and governments that it is serious about defending oil prices. It wants to maintain some level of transparency , at least to the degree that it can monitor oil stocks and shape the behavior of traders. OPEC has told the market what it wants to see in the next few months and what it can do. OPEC has sent the signal but it may not act upon it , especially if traders do what OPEC expects them to do : believe that OPEC will cut production to keep prices relatively high. The implication of this episode of signaling is that OPEC wishes to act as a market stabilizer , not only through production adjustments but also through effective signaling . </signal.v.1891><signal.v.1892>Wheat has had many direction changes.

His proposal to enhance the ability of states to better coordinate and integrate all of the programs serving low-income populations-which has come to be known as the " super waiver " -clearly signaled that state efforts to think differently about how to deliver services to working families should be supported and , yes , even encouraged . </signal.v.1893><signal.v.1894>Tendencies to conceal can be signaled by hands which are held on the table , the arms of the chair , the thighs or under the table. Discussion which are run with the use of the outstretched finger usually take place from a dominant position. A fist indicates aggression or a readiness to fight , although this often is in contrast to the comprehensive and apparently receptive words being uttered. Somebody who pushes open hands away from himself , indicates that he wants to be rid of something. S. Molcho refers to a historical example of this. During the Vietnam war , President Nixon held a television interview , in which he attempted to calm the young protesters with major promises. Whilst he was saying " I promise you , you will get everything you want ! " he visibly pushed his hands forwards . </signal.v.1894><signal.v.1895>Various LEDs are used to indicate the different operating states of the device.

A boundary 34 is shown in bold in FIGURE 1 to differentiate between those cells 12 ( collected in area 32 ( 1 ) ) served by a first mobile switching center 18 ( 1 ) , and those cells ( collected in area 32 ( 2 ) ) serviced by a second mobile switching center 18 ( 2 ) . The mobile switching centers 18 are interconnected with each other and to the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) 20 by signaling links and voice trunks 24. The mobile switching centers 18 operate to selectively connect subscriber voice and data communications to the mobile stations 16 through its base stations 14. Thus , the mobile switching center 18 controls system operation through and in response to the transmission of control signals over the control channels to set-up on the traffic channels calls that are either originated by or terminated at the mobile stations 16 . </signal.v.1896><signal.v.1897>This means that an error is signaled in both safe and unsafe code.

By day , a freight train carried a red flag on the right-hand side of the last car as a marker ( italicized in the Rule Book , as apparently a new term ) , so that the engineman could determine if he had all his train with him. A red tail light was carried through the Allegheny ( Gallitzin ) tunnel as well. Every passenger train had to have a communicating bell cord on each car. Though it was emphasized that the bell cord was indispensable , freight cars had to be handled directly behind the engine in a mixed train , which would have made this impossible. The engine bell was the signal " for passengers to take their seats. " The conductor would ask that it be rung by two tugs on the communicating cord , then one tug would signal the engineman to start the train. Passengers were forbidden to ride on the car platforms when the train was in motion . </signal.v.1914><signal.v.1915>The red light signals an approaching train on the same or adjacent track to stop at once and to proceed only after the track is safe for train passage.

The fascination was increased with the release of H.G. Wells War of the Worlds , which postulated what an attack from the inhabitants of the fourth planet would wreak on our world. Space travel was also a fascination thanks to the works of Jules Verne , whose Le Voyage Dans La Lune ( A Trip To The Moon ) was one of the first motion pictures ever produced by early film director Georges Melies in 1902 , and summarily stolen by the Edison film company ( yielding a great profit ) . The cover of this march implies a friendly breed of " Martians " , who are both observing us and sending high-powered light signals our way.

A decision , again a WILLFUL DECISION with plenty of time to think about what she was doing , to cross over a solid line in direct violation of a no-passing zone , and then attempt to " get around " a cyclist who had clearly signaled a left turn , and was in the process of making this turn. This stretch of road is a long , straight line so you clearly and easily see at least several hundred yards ahead. She obviously saw what was taking place in front of her , and still decided , yes DECIDED ( no simple act of carelessness here , no " mistake " ) to break several laws and endanger the lives of 5 people , ultimately killing one.

ABS system signals are as the name suggests always automatic. In some cases special signals can be influenced ( released ) by action of train crews but ABS system signals are not centrally controlled like controlled CTC signals. ABS system signals are mostly Permissive Signals.

These stations are designed to permit DMUs to split and join. When joining DMUs it is necessary for both trains to enter the same track. This is accomplished by having the first DMU enter the track on a normal entry route and stop at a designated location along the platform. When the entry route for the second DMU is set , the interlocking automatically detects that the platform track is occupied , and it then lights the 'X'-indicator when clearing the Entry Signal.

This is the follower , or perhaps the successful wannabe. This person is involved with the culture , and can thus signal the fashion appropriately. However , they have not joined the group for whatever core ideal joins the group together. In the " acid house " example , the original members of the subculture presumably enjoyed the type of music or the drugs. As it became a media sensation , others may have joined the group without especially caring about the music , but instead wanting to be part of the cutting edge. This is an effect of media coverage that I thought the articles did not address - before media coverage and formal definition of the group , there are likely no members who joined to capitalize on the group 's cool - instead the group might be based exclusively around some common like or goal. Fashion signals do not distinguish between these two qualities , except insofar as people less devoted to the group may be less connected and receive less information about signal changes . </signal.v.1954><signal.v.1955>While the situation stimulates the inciting incident , the playwright often uses the characters to signal the consequent action generated by the inciting incident. A key question a playwright asks is " What does the character want ? " " What is the superobjective of the character ? " One way a playwright works the inciting incident to signal action is by a character 's indecision concerning what alternatives to choose. That is , a character is unable to make a choice or a decision about something , which itself is a kind of action. For instance , in Odets ' Golden Boy , Joe is unable to decide between playing the violin or prize fighting. At the beginning of the drama , Joe takes advantage of an opportunity to fight and tells his family that he has quit playing the violin for a while. However , he is reluctant to punch and perhaps hurt his hands. Moody says , " Joe 's mind ai n't made up that he fist is mightier than the fiddle. " While the situation helps clarify the inciting incident , the inciting incident connects to action by Joe 's indecision , for not only Joe , but also his family and trainer are affected by the situation in which Joe has placed them . </signal.v.1955><signal.v.1956>Returns the element of the specified cursor 's associated collection at which the specified cursor is currently located.

In addition , I think it sends a clear signal that the emergency supply of liquidity that helped fund the economic recovery is over.

TCR-signaled destabilization of CD4 and CD8 coreceptor RNAs has previously been demonstrated to be the mechanism by which TCR signals arrest the differentiation of early CD4CD8lo precursors into DP thymocytes ( 33 , 34 ) , but it has been uncertain whether posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms also participate in later developmental steps in the thymus. In this regard , the present study revealed that TCR-CD2 signals destabilized both CD4 and CD8 coreceptor RNAs in DP thymocytes within 1 to 3 h. Indeed , the very rapidity of the elimination of preexisting coreceptor RNAs in signaled DP thymocytes is itself indicative of its physiologic relevance , as its role in signaled DP thymocytes is to alter coreceptor expression more rapidly than can be accomplished by transcriptional regulatory mechanisms alone. Notably , the rapid and transitory nature of the posttranscriptional regulatory events described in the present study makes them difficult to identify in asynchronously signaled populations of DP thymocytes in vivo . </signal.v.1981><signal.v.1982>West chooses the same lead of the 4 of Spades , a discouraging signal.

When a thread is woken up from waiting , the condition mutex is automatically reacquired. If another thread holds the mutex when the thread is woken up , then it must wait until it can acquire the mutex before proceeding. Possible exceptions include RWCancellation and RWTHRInternalError . </signal.v.2003><signal.v.2004>Playback is also done via " blocks of data " . Here , your application reads a block of data from the WAVE file on disk ( for example , you may read the next 16K of the file into a 16K buffer ) . ( You must use waveOutPrepareHeader ( ) to initialize the buffer before reading into it ) . You pass this block to the driver for playback via waveOutWrite ( ) . While the driver is playing this block , you 're reading in another block of data into a second buffer. When the driver is finished playing the first block , it signals your program that it needs another block , and your driver passes that second buffer via waveOutWrite ( ) . Your program will now read in the next block of data into the first buffer while the driver is playing the second buffer. Etc. Again , this is all non-stop until the WAVE is fully played ( at which point you can call waveOutReset ( ) to stop the driver 's playback process ) . </signal.v.2004><signal.v.2005>Traffic lights , which may also be known as stoplights , traffic lamps , traffic signals , stop-and-go lights , robots or semaphore , are signaling devices positioned at road intersections , pedestrian crossings and other locations to control competing flows of traffic. Traffic lights have been installed in most cities around the world. They assign the right of way to road users by the use of lights in standard colors ( Red - Amber - Green ) , using a universal color code ( and a precise sequence , for those who are color blind ) . </signal.v.2005><signal.v.2006>Feb. 25 ( Bloomberg ) -- Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych , who has signaled he wants closer ties with Russia , used his first inauguration speech to promise a non-aligned relationship with the European Union . </signal.v.2006><signal.v.2007>Mrk 712 -- Contini et al.

A nebular contribution to HeII may be present ( Contini 1996 ) . </signal.v.2007><signal.v.2008>A telephone has two possible supervision states : on-hook or off-hook. On-hook is the condition in which the telephone is not in use , which is signaled when the telephone handset depresses the cradle switch. The term on-hook comes from the days when the receiver part of the telephone rested on a hook. The telephone enters the off-hook condition when the handset is lifted from its cradle , thereby releasing the cradle switch and signaling to the exchange that the subscriber wishes to place an outgoing call . </signal.v.2008><signal.v.2009>Most surviving Inoperative Approach Signals along the Santa Fe are one of two styles. The style shown at left is the one depicted in Santa Fe System Standards Vol.2 on p. 229 : a black board nailed to a white post , with an amber lamp. The signboard bearing the letter D is not shown in the plan; these signs began appearing about the time of the attempted SPSF merger in the mid-80 's , and may have been part of an effort to unify the two railroads ' rulebooks ( the General Code calls for distant signals to be marked with D signs ) . The particular signal shown at left is located south of the junction at Isleta , NM where the unsignaled line from Belen joins the signaled main line to Albuquerque . </signal.v.2009><signal.v.2010>The bond market is tough , it always knows when a trader misses his bonds. At the moment Jack tried to sell six lots , the market was 21 bid at 22. By the time Jack realized Robbie had missed his signal , the bonds had gone 21 sellers. Then a new roar rolled out of the bond pit , and the arb clerks signaled size was trading at 20. Jack leapt up even higher and flicked one finger off his chin again . </signal.v.2010><signal.v.2011>When signalled the " catch " resembles the " out " signal. No verbal indication needs to be given. The " no-catch " signal resembles the " safe " signal except the call of " No Catch " is clearly given. Sometimes it will be necessary to repeat this sign several times. An addition to the " No Catch " is the juggling routine which indicates the fielder did not have possession.

When his gestures worked , he thought of all the possibilities . </signal.v.2012><signal.v.2013>We do not expect rate hikes until the second half of 2010 , nor do we expect the Fed to signal the markets that rate hikes are coming for several more months at the earliest. We do , however , expect China to remain committed to loan growth in the coming months. This outlook for continued economic stimulus , combined with improving and broadening economic growth , should help to renew the stock market rally through early 2010. Nevertheless , market participants will be watching closely this week for any signs that the Fed will seek to withdraw stimulus efforts prematurely . </signal.v.2013><signal.v.2014>Market interest may be found using indicators of volume. Especially near the market low , high volume tends to signal that a new trend is beginning. Conversely , low volume may signal that investors are unsure of the wisdom of purchase at this time. The possibility of market change may be signaled by a variety of different indicators . </signal.v.2014><signal.v.2015>NGC 6764 -- Osterbrock &amp;Cohen ( 1982 ) point out the presence of broad NIII 4640 and HeII 4686 in the spectrum of the nucleus of this barred spiral galaxy also classified as LINER or Seyfert 2. Conti ( 1991 ) argues that the line at 4660 in their spectrum is likely [ FeIII ] 4658. The spectrum of Eckart et al. ( 1996 ) confirms the broad features of Osterbrock &amp;Cohen. They also signal excessive widths of HeI 5876 and which they attribute to emission from WR stars. Broad CIII 5696 and CIV 5808 lines from WC stars are reported in the nucleus of this galaxy by Kunth &amp;Contini ( 1998 ) . </signal.v.2015><signal.v.2016>This action can be useful for debugging. With the REPORT action , the SPICELIB error handling mechanism outputs error messages when an error is signaled , but does n't stop your program. So , more information can be gained from a single run of your program than with the ABORT action. Using the SPICELIB routine ERRDEV , you can direct the error messages output by the SPICELIB error handling mechanism to a file , thus creating a log of your errors . </signal.v.2016><signal.v.2017>Grammar : Verb forms and tense and conjugation. Subjects and verbs must agree according to a set of rules for forming the verb ( morphology ) . We have this agreement in order to tell who acted and when ( tense ) . We can use forms ( pronouns ) to avoid repeating the subject of a sentence every time we tell about an action. Sometimes the subject of the verb will be signaled by the verbs ' ending. There are different endings and changes in verbs to indicate the time when the action took place . </signal.v.2017><signal.v.2018>Leonard Harmon opened the queen of spades from the West hand , and I signaled encouragement by playing the deuce of spades from the East hand.

In the case of overlapped I/O , the system may return to the caller immediately even when an operation is not finished and will signal the caller when the operation completes. The program may use the time between the I/O request and its completion to perform some background ? work . </signal.v.2019><signal.v.2020>In general students will do more solo reading with easy materials than with difficult ones. However , do not push the student too hard to go solo and do n't show any anxiety over this. Some students are low risk-takers and many poorer readers have low confidence in their academic abilities. Paired Reading offers such students a safety net through paired reading. Be patient while they build up their confidence levels. Remind the student at the beginning of each session of the signal for going solo and suggest that they try it. When the first solo reading is signaled , give immediate praise and continue to praise the reading as it continues in solo mode. At the beginning of the next session , remind the student of how well he or she did reading solo in the previous session . </signal.v.2020><signal.v.2021>Your threads package will support timed conditions. For the most part , signals and conditions function the same as defined in Project 1. In Project 2 , though , one will be able to set a timeout with a condition. A thread that waits on a condition for timeout milliseconds will become ready , just as if it had received a signal with a value of NULL. If the condition is signalled before that timeout , however , then the blocked thread will behave as specified in Project 1 . </signal.v.2021><signal.v.2022>Jeremy , you 're missing my point. I have no objection with throwing the book at the driver for her obvious ILLEGAL ACT. My point is that what she did was , practically speaking , quite normal ( not unusual ) and should be expected by all cyclists , who should ride accordingly. Certainly we should not ride as if we wo n't be passed while we 're at the right edge of a lane simply because we signaled and there is a solid stripe for our direction and/or we are approaching an intersection . </signal.v.2022><signal.v.2023>I had some idea the road approached a " t " intesection. Not sure , but does n't really matter at this point for the discussion. If Knight was straddling the double line trying to pass O'Donnell , and he crossed in front of her , the most likely reason that would have happened is that both car and bike were at or in the intersection. No user of the road , excersing care and responsibility , with the exception of emergency or law enforcement vehicles with appropriate lights flashing , attempts to pass someone in an intersection when that person has signaled , indicating the intention to turn left. Except jerks and crazy people . </signal.v.2023><signal.v.2024>As the dump trailer was backing up it was flagged back by the driver of the stalled truck to a point just past his truck. He stopped signalling when the moving vehicle was clear of the stalled truck. At about 25 to 30 feet past the stalled truck and about 10 feet from where the driver of the stalled truck had discontinued signalling , the dump trailer ran over respondent 's employee who had earlier assisted in removing the cable. Respondent 's employee was fatally injured . </signal.v.2024><signal.v.2025>Germany 's Axel Weber said last Friday that even " in a tightened market there are still inflation risks that may signal the need to raise rates further as tensions progressively ease.

DP thymocytes express 4-fold more CD8 than CD4 surface molecules ( 14 ) so that the total amount of Lck associated with CD8.4 coreceptors is greater than the total amount of Lck associated with CD4 coreceptors in each CD8.4 DP thymocyte , providing an explanation for why the CD4 : CD8 ratio is &lt; 1 in CD8.4 mice . </signal.v.2028><signal.v.2029>cv_wait ( ) suspends the calling thread and exits the mutex atomically so that another thread which holds the mutex can not signal on the condition variable until the blocking thread is blocked.

The mobile switching center 18 ( 1 ) then similarly signals 122 the base station 14 for each of its served candidate cells 12 to make a verifying signal strength measurement ( action 124 ) on the traffic channel currently being used by the mobile station 16 ( 1 ) in the currently serving cell 12 ( 1 ) . It is again recognized that a determined neighbor cell 12 identified for receipt of the signal 122 may not necessarily have the service capabilities necessary for supporting the call 100 after hand-off. This is because the cooperating exchange 18 sends typically the signal 122 blindly to each candidate cell without making a service capabilities evaluation . </signal.v.2030><signal.v.2031>The installation of the new left-turn signal heads is part of a national study sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration to improve driver understanding of left-turn traffic signal displays , with the aim of reducing accidents and delays at signaled intersections.

Even when these characteristics were taken into account , ED was found to be an independent early warning sign of coronary heart disease. In fact , ED signaled a 58 percent increase in the risk of CHD. Only spillage of large amounts of protein in the urine -- a sign of extensive kidney damage -- was a stronger warning sign , doubling the risk of heart disease . </signal.v.2038><signal.v.2039>A motor vehicle engine ( 10 ) has a glow plug system ( 14 ) for aiding combustion of fuel in combustion chambers of the engine when the engine is cold and an ignition switch ( 16 ) is operated to crank the engine. A first circuit signals the cold start aid to commence operation of the cold start aid in anticipation of engine starting. A second circuit indicates a fault in the cold start aid. A third circuit , that includes a warning signal device ( 38 ) , activates the warning signal device to inform a driver of the vehicle of the indicated fault upon the first circuit having signaled the cold start aid to commence operation and the second circuit having indicated a fault in the cold start aid . </signal.v.2039><signal.v.2040>Analysis of large amounts of laboratory data will likely signal many clusters of no significance , and the work generated in interpreting signals meaningfully may be overwhelming and so mask true signals. Thoroughly evaluating and adjusting parameters such as the minimum number required to trigger a signal may be required to prevent this but at a cost of losing sensitivity. Conversely , the ability to detect clusters of commonly reported pathogens that are not routinely subtyped ( e.g. , Campylobacter ) will always be limited because the signal will be likely smaller than the variability of the large amount of data routinely submitted. One solution to this problem is to apply the algorithm to subsets of reduced amounts of data on common pathogens such as data collected by a group of regional laboratories . </signal.v.2040><signal.v.2041> In the trading environment , when you lose a trade , what is the first idea that pops up in your mind ?

The FDBU has a hot water coil attached to the discharge , and will be used to warm the supply air for either a partitioned plenum or the ducted discharge of the FDBU to the remote terminal units. When the zone temperature drops below the desired set point the PCDT will send a heating signal to the UMCB. The UMCB will then use a tri-state or analog output to signal the hot water valve to modulate open , increasing the flow of hot water through the coil thereby increasing the heating capacity of the coil . </signal.v.2042><signal.v.2043>Crude oil rose as equities increased on higher than estimated earnings and U.S. economic data signaled the global recovery is gaining momentum. There ' s a perception that the global economy is improving and demand will increase , said Tom Bentz , a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. It doesn ' t take any fundamental news to make this market move $ 10 anymore , just a simple change in sentiment is enough. The next target will be $ 80. U.S. manufacturing gained 1 percent as factories produced more consumer goods and business equipment , according to the Federal Reserve. Crude oil is trading at $ 77.45 as of 21 : 14pm , GMT , with a bullish trend. Crude ' s Pool-position is 76 Long , meaning that most Finotec clients are buying the commodity . </signal.v.2043><signal.v.2044>The ADX signals by feeder cattle and crude oil signaled the end of one trend and the beginning of a new trend. But the ADX is not designed to signal a trend reversal. It only signals the end of the existing trend. A good example of not signaling a trend reversal is in T-Bonds. The end of the strong spring rally was accurately marked by the ADX signal in June. Then T-Bonds consolidated in a coil until the upside breakout in the fall. An ADX climb above 40 and downturn in November signaled another consolidation . </signal.v.2044><signal.v.2045>This chart shows that the pure signal strategy outperforms for round-trip trading fees less than 0.30 ( $ 30 on a $ 10 , 000 trade ) , while the buffered signal strategy outperforms for fees above this threshold. A buy-and-hold strategy started on 10/27/99 and ending 5/7/09 outperforms both SMA crossing strategies , but cumulative return comparisons are sensitive to start and stop dates , and starting buy-and-hold on a signaled buy date favors buy-and-hold.

The first eight words were each signaled with a three flag hoist. Even the two letter word " do " needed a hoist of three flags. Nelson had wanted to send " confides " , but the word was not in the code book so he settled for " expects " which was. The last word " duty " was also not in the code book , and the closest words that were , " best " and " utmost " were not considered appropriate. " Duty " therefore had to be spelt letter by letter which took seven flags. Because illustrations of the signal show all the flags at once it is sometimes thought that this was how the signal was sent. Actually of course it was sent in a succession of hoists over a period of four minutes . </signal.v.2053><signal.v.2054>When signaled the " catch " resembles the " out " signal. No verbal indication needs to be given. The " no-catch " signal resembles the " safe " signal except the call of " No Catch " is clearly given.

Signals are used to alter the flow control of tasks by communicating asynchronous events within or between task contexts. Any task or interrupt service can " raise " ( or send ) a signal to a particular task. The task being signaled will immediately suspend its current thread of execution and invoke a task-specified " signal handler " routine. The signal handler is a user-supplied routine that is bound to a specific signal and performs whatever actions are necessary whenever the signal is received. Signals are most appropriate for error and exception handling , rather than as a general purpose intertask communication mechanism . </signal.v.2060><signal.v.2061>Actions can be executed at several different locations in a Web Flow : as part of a transition , in a seperate action state , as render actions in a view state and so on.

This is of course not a surprise to us as we have been tracking the ABX Indices and know liquidity is still a problem out there , along with the rising gold price naturally , discounting the need for more speed in monetary debasement rates. And now we might also be able to add the Yen to the list of indicators in this respect. As you can see below the Yen is threatening to break higher in a continuation pattern , which would signal global players are de-leveraging via a reversal in the Yen Carry Trade. This would mean they see worsening prospects for growth on a global scale , which would undoubtedly play havoc with all equity groups , not the least of which would include emerging markets ( BRIC counties ) and commodities as the perception globalization trends are played out takes hold.

If duplicates are not allowed , insertion of an element that is already present either is silently ignored or signals the exception err_coll_duplicates. See os_collection : : insert ( ) . Allowing duplicates generally increases the efficiency of insert operations , since the operations do not have to check for the presence of the inserted element , as they do if duplicates are not allowed . </signal.v.2064><signal.v.2065>On Feb 17 , 2006 , the Mid-term Indicant was signaling hold for 285-stocks and funds out of 320-tracked.

This method means that the muck loading machine ( the wheel loader for the muck loading ) operator signals with a gesture , while sounding the klaxon one time when the final loading of muck was completed.The victim who received the signal ( showing large " X " by both arms that means the completion of mucking ) also forwarded it to other two dump truck drivers ( the culpable driver and F ) . The two persons who received the signal sounded the klaxon to confirm the end of mucking in this cycle.After confirming repetition of the signal from the two dump truck drivers , the victim drove his dump truck about 40m to the pit mouth , then parked on the left side there.

Behavior in the present is generated by evolved information-processing mechanisms that were constructed in the past because they solved adaptive problems in the ancestral environments in which the human line evolved. For this reason , evolutionary psychology is both environment-oriented and past-oriented in its functionalist orientation. Adaptations become increasingly effective as selection makes their design features more and more complementary to the long-enduring structure of the world. The articulated features of the adaptation are designed to mesh with the features of the environment that were stable during the adaptation 's evolution , so that their interaction produced functional outcomes. The regulation of breathing assumes the presence of certain long-enduring properties of the atmosphere and the respiratory system. Vision assumes the presence of certain evolutionarily stable properties of surfaces , objects , and terrestrial spectral distributions. The lactase digestive enzyme presupposes an infant diet of milk with lactose. And each emotion presupposes that certain cues signal the presence of a structure of events and conditions that held true during the evolution of that emotion. Disgust circuits presume a world in which rotten smells signal toxins or microbial contamination , for example . </signal.v.2079><signal.v.2080>To obtain synchronously stimulated populations of DP thymocytes for the present study , we signaled DP thymocytes in vitro with immobilized anti-TCR and anti-CD2 MAbs. We utilized both anti-TCR and anti-CD2 MAbs because we had previously found that TCR engagement alone is not sufficient to induce alterations in coreceptor expression in DP thymocytes in the absence of other thymic elements ( 5 , 16 ) . In contrast , coengagement of surface TCR complexes with other surface molecules , which we have called coinducer molecules , does successfully signal DP thymocytes to alter coreceptor expression , with CD2 being the most potent coinducer molecule that has been identified ( 5 ) . Interestingly , CD2 and other coinducer molecules may have ligands in the thymus that normally induce their coengagement with TCR during intrathymic development , so that the requirements for signaling DP thymocytes in vitro may accurately reflect the requirements for signaling DP thymocytes in vivo. In this regard , it should be noted that the CD4+CD8 thymocytes that are generated in vitro are developmentally intermediate cells that can still further differentiate into either CD4+ or CD8+ SP T cells and so are indistinguishable from intermediate CD4+CD8 thymocytes that are the progeny of signaled DP thymocytes in vivo ( Brugnera et al. , submitted ) . </signal.v.2080><signal.v.2081>Troisi , Bersh , Stromberg , Mauro , &amp;Whitehouse ( 1991 ) taught rats that they could escape most shocks. This served to immunize the rats against later learned helplessness experiences. Serial presentations of escapable and inescapable shocks had a prophylactic ( preventative ) effect on the development of learned helplessness. This learned efficacy could be brought under stimulus control by Pavlovian conditioning so that some CSs signaled that the animals could escape the shock and other CSs signaled that the animal was likely to be helpless. These CSs acted as superordinate stimuli to elicit general emotion-related responses to each condition . </signal.v.2081><signal.v.2082>Computation tossups ( marked by text that begins " Pencil and paper ready " ) have slightly different timing rules : Teams have 10 seconds ( not 3 ) to ring in after the moderator finishes the question. If the first team signals before the end of the question , the second team will have the full 10 seconds to signal after the reading of the question is completed. If the first team signals after the end of the question , the moderator will allow whatever time remained of the initial 10 seconds ( or 3 seconds , whichever is greater ) for the second team to signal. Despite this additional time , players still have only 2 seconds to give their answer after signaling on a computation tossup. If a computation tossup specifies a different time limit than 10 seconds , that time limit shall be used instead . </signal.v.2082><signal.v.2083>A common use of a hybrid interrupt is for NMI ( non-maskable interrupt ) input , which is explained in the previous section. Because NMIs usually signal major , sometimes even catastrophic , system events , the implementation of this signaling method tries to ensure that the interrupt is valid by verifying that it remains active for a certain period of time. This two-step approach helps to eliminate spurious interrupts ( false or unwanted ) from affecting the operating system [ 2 ] . </signal.v.2083><signal.v.2084>To speak only of the body signaling the conscious mind is a great simplification. Nonetheless , simplification is a useful starting point , useful and scientifically reasonable. Moreover , the one person 's interpretation of another 's mental state really does depend upon this information. Of course the visible signs of emotion are often ambiguous , incomplete , and misleading , but so too are our judgments : our interpretations of another 's feelings and beliefs are not very accurate and often are misleading . </signal.v.2084><signal.v.2085>Figure 1.

We could look to any of three of Varonis and Gass 's ( 1985 ) primes in attempting to answer this question : to the trigger , the signal , or the response to signal. Pellettieri ( 2000 ) , who is also concerned with online , synchronous communication , opts to examine triggers , while Pica ( 1994 ) looks both at signals and responses to signals. Now , NNS triggers might give an insight into the state of interlanguage , but they need not tell us anything about what comes to be focused on in the course of negotiation since the speaker is not necessarily aware of the nature of the problem in the utterance , beyond the fact that comprehension has not been complete. Likewise , in the case of NS-triggered routines , it is what the NNS calls attention to in signaling a problem that is likely to become the focus of negotiation. In any case , in so far as it is possible to determine the problematic component of the trigger utterance , we can do so only by examining the rest of the negotiation routine and , in particular , the signal utterance . </signal.v.2087><signal.v.2088>Let me refer this evening to only one example - that of Rwanda. In his August of 1993 public report , the then Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions - Mr. Bacre Ndiaye , now head of our New York office -- signaled that the situation in Rwanda had deteriorated sufficiently as to possibly lead to an outbreak of genocide. This report , released months before the fateful 6 April , 1994 air crash and the onset of genocide in Rwanda , was not accorded due importance . </signal.v.2088><signal.v.2089>The essential idea here is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. It was articulated quite nicely by Kurt Vonnegut , in his 1961 short story Harrison Bergeron [ 16 ] . In Vonnegut ' s futuristic dystopia , the Handicapper General uses a variety of handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. A spectator at a ballet comments : it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers , for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men. Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signaling their ability to " waste " more of something important by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Veblen ' s idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth [ 17 ] . </signal.v.2089><signal.v.2090>If your stop loss triggered sell , while Indicant continues signaling hold , normal advice would be to buy again.

" </signal.v.2092><signal.v.2093>Both fleets were now headed to the eastward , and as the British Ships had the wind they were better able to manoeuvre. At 2.30 the leading British ship , the Shrewsbury , was signaled to lead more to starboard so as to approach the van of the French Fleet , the signal being repeated at 3.17 p. m. to all of the van ships. At 3.30 the ships astern were signaled to make more sail , and at 3.34 the signal was again made for the ships in the van to keep more to starboard. This lack of contact between the two vans was due to the fact that at 3 p. m. the headmost vessels of the French Fleet were carried too far to windward for a well-formed line , due to the shifting of the wind and the movement of the current. De Grasse made the signal for them to bear away two points , so as to give all the vessels the advantage of fighting together . </signal.v.2093><signal.v.2094>Surface expression of coreceptor proteins in signaled DP thymocytes. Finally , we attempted to correlate the molecular events that we identified in signaled DP thymocytes with changes in surface expression of CD4 and CD8 proteins. To do so , we examined DP thymocytes from CD8.1-transgenic mice because the transgene-encoded CD8.1 protein differs from the endogenously encoded CD8.2 protein by only a single amino acid that does not affect its protein function , but the RNAs encoding these proteins are differentially destabilized during signaling and their transcription is regulated by different promoter elements ( an endogenous CD8 promoter versus a heterologous human CD2 promoter ) ( Fig. 7 ) . </signal.v.2094><signal.v.2095>Passing Zones : Passing zones for all groups shall be well-defined at the Drivers ' Meeting.

' Perhaps these 'dreamers ' are not really dreamers , as some argued in the last century; or perhaps this 'sleep ' is not really sleep , as some have argued in this century. How do we know that lucid dreamers are 'really asleep ' when they signal ? If we consider perception of the external world as a criterion of being awake ( to the external world ) , we can conclude that they are actually asleep ( to the external world ) because although they know they are in the laboratory , this knowledge is a matter of memory , not perception. Upon awakening , they report having been totally in the dream world and not in sensory contact with the external world . </signal.v.2097><signal.v.2098>Baroreceptors can signal veins to expand so more blood can be stored in the veins and less blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries. As a result , the heart pumps less blood per beat , and blood pressure may decrease. On the other hand , when veins narrow , less blood is stored in the veins , more blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries , and blood pressure increases . </signal.v.2098><signal.v.2099>Sometimes a stock can be in a strong uptrend , and MACD will remain above its trigger line for a sustained period of time. In this case , it is unlikely that a Negative Divergence will develop. A different signal is needed to identify a potential change in momentum. This was the case with Merck ( MRK ) in February and March. The stock advanced in a strong uptrend , and MACD remained above its 9-day EMA for 7 weeks. When a Bearish Moving Average Crossover occurred , it signaled that upside momentum was slowing. This slowing momentum should have served as an alert to monitor the technical situation for further clues of weakness. Weakness was soon confirmed when the stock broke its uptrend line and MACD continued its decline and moved below zero . </signal.v.2099><signal.v.2100>As far as assessing our performance during this last signal , a good place to start is the old saying " any winning trade is a good trade " . During Buy signals our investments move up and down in tandem with the markets , unless we apply leverage with margin strategies 2 or 4 , and Trend Timing essentially delivers the same performance as Buy and Hold. As always , how much we gain depends largely on what we invest in. Looking at our three primary U.S. indices , the Russell 2000 led the way , as it has for the last couple of years , with a gain of 6.12 . The S &amp;P 500 had a very good showing for large caps by ending a close second with a 5.87 gain. Lagging at the back of the pack , the Nasdaq 100 eked out a 0.97 gain. While many of us are not quite satisfied with single digit gains ( or fractional ones for the Nasdaq 100 ) , it is worth pointing out that both the Russell 2000 and S &amp;P 500 returns represent annualized gains of over 15 , which is nothing to sneeze at ( a 15 annual return rate doubles your money in five years ) . </signal.v.2100><signal.v.2101>Last week we watched the VIX rise above 80 intra-week.

In applying the probability-of-recession formula to growth cycles in the United States and other nations , Niemira ( 1990 ) concentrates solely on the growth cycle and does not address the question of shifting from slow growth to decline. The prediction of such a shift may be above the bounds of the leading indicator approach , although it deserves some research.

However , in CD8.4 mice , the conversion efficiency of DP thymocytes into CD4SP and CD8SP thymocytes was 3 for each T cell subset ( Fig. 4B ) , revealing that increased CD8 coreceptor signaling by the CD4 cytosolic tail quantitatively increased the efficiency of CD8+ T cell positive selection to the point that it was equivalent to that of CD4+ T cell positive selection . </signal.v.2112><signal.v.2113>The qsig utility shall signal those batch jobs for which a batch job_identifier is presented to the utility.

They suggest sidelined drivers who are suspicious of their detainers ' demands should request to examine the officers ' photo IDs and ask them where they work , then place calls to 911 to verify their identities.

It has a synchronous interrupting device , one producer task , and two consumer tasks. We used two timers from the DCC20A timer card : Timer 5 to generate the synchronous interrupts and Timer 1 as a count-down timer. Timer 5 is programmed to reset Timer 1 at every interrupt. This allowed us to use Timer 1 to profile the various tasks. The interrupt service routine ( ISR ) for Timer 5 signals the producer task when the interrupt occurs. The producer task records the task response-time data and signals the consumer tasks to read the times out of the shared data. The consumer tasks execute and signal the producer when they are done. The cycle then starts all over again at the next interrupt. The objective is to ensure that all processing for a single pass be done before the next interrupt arrives and that the data integrity is preserved for the shared data. Mutexes and condition variables are used to ensure data integrity and to synchronize access to the data. The overall flow is shown in Figure 2 . </signal.v.2121><signal.v.2122>This is what you get if you do n't choose an error response action. When the error action is DEFAULT , and an error is signaled , the SPICELIB error handling mechanism outputs all of the available types of error messages to the error output device , and then stops program execution . </signal.v.2122><signal.v.2123>Stimulus intensity can also be signaled by the number of sensory neurons which are active. A gentle push on a finger tip activates some sensory receptors and sensory afferents fire a certain number of action potentials each second. A far stronger push on the finger tip introduces more energy into the tissues ( we see more tissue involved ) and stimulates more sensory receptors. Afferents receiving input from sensory receptors in the middle of the strongly touched area fire more action potentials each second; afferents receiving input from sensory receptors on the edge of the strongly touched area fire are n't as strongly stimulated but still fire some action potentials each second. They were quite during the gentle touch. So , by " looking " at the number of neurons firing action potentials and at the frequency of action potential firing , the nervous system forms an idea of stimulus intensity . </signal.v.2123><signal.v.2124>Always signalled with the right hand , each umpire develops a personalized system for signalling the strike. Some do the traditional bang-the-door clenched fist , some indicate the strike out to the side with a pointed finger. Some umpires face forward , some turn. Some call strike then signal , others do both simultaneously. One essential element is not to turn away from the action particularly in a two man system. In a two or three man system , by not facing forward , an umpire might even miss a play at the plate while going through their actions. Umpire school teaches you to keep your eyes on the ball as you make this signal . </signal.v.2124><signal.v.2125>A. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed . </signal.v.2125><signal.v.2126>You need : a TTL-level detector for each signaled block , a switch motor with one set of contacts ( SPDT ) for each interlocked turnout , and a signal circuit for each signal. The 2-color signal circuit is built into the detector in the first part of this handout. An interlocking controller circuit is needed for each turnout. For 2-color signal systems , this interlocking controller only uses two 50 parts . </signal.v.2126><signal.v.2127>The upside down signal is used , likewise , against suit contracts. It 's just as easy to signal a doubleton 7-2 with the deuce first and then the seven as the other way around. ( A singleton deuce becomes a come-on , which is sometimes helpful; but this is counterbalanced by the singleton eight , which is discouraging. Such singletons tend to offset each other . ) </signal.v.2127><signal.v.2128>Never try to overtake- if you must , do it only if the driver of the vehicle in your front has permitted or signaled you to overtake. Never try to overtake a vehicle , which is in the process of taking a turn . </signal.v.2128><signal.v.2129>Usually a flag formed after a strong up move , like the one from the November/December lows , is a sign of further gains to come. But the more dominant ascending wedge pattern suggests lower prices. A break below 1075 would signal the completion of the wedge . </signal.v.2129><signal.v.2130>Officers and enlisted men were then assembled at several small camps in Maryland where they were instructed in signaling by officers Myer had previously trained at Fortress Monroe. These men then soon gathered together in a new Signal Camp of Instruction near Georgetown , D.C. , where Cushing , once again on signal duty , was placed in charge. The installation became the signal school for officers detailed from the Army of the Potomac. For a short time , until late 1861 , it was also in effect Signal Corps Headquarters. After training , detailed officers were transferred from the Army of the Potomac to other military jurisdictions , where they in turn had officers and enlisted men detailed to them and opened their own small camps of instruction. In May of 1862 , the Georgtown facility was discontinued , but soon re-opened again the following year with Nicodemus placed in charge , who returned to signal duty by that time.

At the bottom is a light that we never seem to make. As we talked and waited for the green , we were all surprised by the explosion that signaled the failure of my front rim. Looking down , I saw a thin band of metal that had been blown out and away from what used to be my front rim. My bike was not rideable , so as I walked across the bridge over I-405 I had several minutes to remember the last two times this had happened . </signal.v.2131><signal.v.2132>They would signal the cable hoist operator in the operator shanty using hand signals. More often they used their helmets because it was shiny and could be seen easier. At night time they would use a flash light. They also hooked up the concrete bucket the same way except they didn ' t ride the platform with the concrete bucket attached. They worked on a special rail car pushed by a dinky ( a small electric power unit ) . It held two buckets. The empty one dropped in by the hoist operator. The iron workers would take the lifting cables off of this bucket and attach them to a full bucket , then signal the operator to lift away. Then the dinky operator would move the car to the concrete mixing tower and load the empty bucket then return it to the lifting site. Several times the cable supporting the concrete bucket parted dumping concrete all over. There was a tremendous strain on the cables lifting the heavy concrete . </signal.v.2132><signal.v.2133>2.

Radios and other noisy equipment shall remain off until the bus has cleared the railroad crossing . </signal.v.2136><signal.v.2137>An alternative set of monetary policy indicators appropriate for price stability goals has recently been proposed. A detailed description of the approach using these indicators has been given elsewhere and will only be briefly summarized here.20 This approach uses certain market price indicators -- broad indices of commodity prices , various measures of the foreign exchange value of the dollar , and long-term bond yields -- as guides for a price-stabilizing monetary policy. All of these sensitive market prices yield early warning signals pertaining to changes in the value of , or price of money : i.e. , relevant to movements in the general price level. Being prices , these indicators signal movements in demand relative to supply and accordingly potentially can be more useful than the above-described " gap " models. These market prices are intended to serve as informational indicators , not policy targets. Other things equal , each indicator can signal the relative " ease " or " tightness " of monetary policy . </signal.v.2137><signal.v.2138>You may implement EventBarrier using any combination of mutexes , condition variables , and/or semaphores , but do not stoop to disabling interrupts. Test your EventBarrier implementation in whatever way you think best. Be sure your implementation correctly handles threads that call Wait while the EventBarrier object is in the signaled state; all participating threads must wait until the late arrival has responded to the event and called Complete . Also , your implementation should handle the case where threads call Wait again immediately after returning from Complete; these threads should block in Wait until the EventBarrier is signaled again . </signal.v.2138><signal.v.2139>Heatherington said information on the City 's Web page indicated that injury accidents were mostly likely to occur at signaled intersections. He said that the driveway for one property owner would be adversely affected by the signal and he did not believe there would be adequate coordination between the lights at 125th Avenue and Sorrento Road. He said the signal would increase the wait time at this intersection and since he uses this intersection a great deal he did not want to have to stop unnecessarily. He said he did not see a logical justification for spending $ 225 , 000. He concluded that pollution was a global issue and stopping the cars at the intersection would create more pollution . </signal.v.2139><signal.v.2140>-The dollar is poised for its biggest monthly drop in a year-and-a-half against the euro and yen on speculation interest rates will rise faster in Europe and Japan than the U.S. The dollar has slumped as Federal Reserve policy makers including Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled a pause in their 22- month cycle of rate increases. The Bank of Japan said today consumer prices will rise for the next two years , boosting the case for the first increase in borrowing costs for five years . </signal.v.2140><signal.v.2141>1- Oscillators are used as an overbought/oversold indicator. A buy is signaled when the oscillator moves below 20 , and then crosses back above 20. A sell is signaled when the oscillator moves above 80 , and then crosses below 80 . </signal.v.2141><signal.v.2142>When an exception condition is detected by system hardware or software or by your program , that condition is signaled ( by means of a signal call ) to the OpenVMS Condition-Handling Facility ( CHF ) . The CHF then invokes one or more condition-handler routines that will attempt to either resolve the condition or terminate the processing in an orderly fashion . </signal.v.2142><signal.v.2143>A thread can wait on a condition variable until either the condition variable is signaled or a signal ( 3C ) is received by the process. The cv_wait ( 9F ) function waits until the condition variable is signaled but ignores signal ( 3C ) signals. This driver uses the cv_wait_sig ( 9F ) function instead of the cv_wait ( 9F ) function because this driver responds if a signal is received by the process performing the operation. If a signal ( 3C ) is taken by the process , this driver returns an interrupt error and does not complete the operation. The cv_wait_sig ( 9F ) function usually is preferred to the cv_wait ( 9F ) function because this implementation offers the user program more precise response. The signal ( 3C ) causes an effect closer to the point at which the process was executing when the signal ( 3C ) was received . </signal.v.2143><signal.v.2144>If signaled to stop by any vehicle other than a clearly marked law enforcement unit , acknowledge the signal , and wave the driver to follow you to a safe location ( where there are other people and light ) . Drive within the speed limit and take the shortest possible route to the nearest safe place. If you have a cellular phone , dial 9-1-1 , tell the call-taker you are being followed by an unmarked vehicle attempting to stop you , and ask them to send a marked law enforcement vehicle to your location . </signal.v.2144><signal.v.2145>I signal , then cut in if they speed up. If you 're already going in they ca n't do anything anyway. Plus 95 of drivers speed up when signaling , so you 're forced to cut in. Hate Bay Area drivers.

It means that , when using exogenous androgens , the hypothalamus is very effectively signaled ( by binding to the AR 's on the hypothalamus ) that there is plenty of androgen , and that the testes should be shut down. As long as the level of exogenous androgen is high enough , no reasonable amount of Clomid ( or other estrogen-blocker ) will be able to keep the testes functioning. So , the only reason to take Clomid during a cycle is if you are susceptible to gyno , or want to try to reduce the bloating associated with elevated estrogens. Both of these actions take place at sites other than at the hypothalamus . </signal.v.2146><signal.v.2147>Washington , Feb. 5 : US First Lady Michelle Obama has signaled that she intends to be more than just mom-in-chief at the White House by embarking on visits to her husband' 's administration agencies . </signal.v.2147><signal.v.2148>[ 0052 ] It is proposed to accomplish this by signaling additional subframes ( e.g. , LTE releases 9 and 10 subframes where the reference signal on antenna ports 0-3 are affected ) as MBSFN ( Multimedia Broadcast over a Single Frequency Network ) subframes. Consequently , these subframes may not be used by a UE employing an LTE release 8 , for example. However , in the system information ( SI ) , additional signals are transmitted to enable UEs using advanced unicast subframes ( e.g. , LTE Release 9 and 10 subframes ) to distinguish between actual MBSFN subframes and advanced unicast subframes carrying LTE Release 9 or 10 reference signals . </signal.v.2148><signal.v.2149>For the regular pattern as in this example , Figure 6 in section 3.2.3.3 shows that the de-interleave buffer stores at most 4 AUs.

Kinetic signaling model of lineage determination. The kinetic signaling model postulates that positive selection and lineage commitment are distinct and separable developmental events. In this model , thymocytes signaled to undergo positive selection make their lineage choice by assessing the CD8 dependence of their TCR. According to the kinetic signaling model , preselection DP thymocytes are first signaled by TCR plus coreceptor coengagements to undergo positive selection which invariably terminates CD8 gene expression. Note that CD8 gene expression is terminated by positive selection signals regardless of the MHC specificity of the TCR and regardless of the coreceptor used. Termination of CD8 gene expression transcriptionally converts signaled DP thymocytes into CD4+8 intermediate thymocytes , and it is in CD4+8 intermediate thymocytes that lineage choice occurs. If TCR-mediated positive selection signals persist in CD4+8 intermediate thymocytes despite absent CD8 gene expression , intermediate thymocytes differentiate into CD4+ T cells. However , if TCR-mediated positive selection signals cease in CD4+8 intermediate thymocytes , intermediate thymocytes differentiate into CD8+ T cells . </signal.v.2150><signal.v.2151>An XSLT processor will only be able to disable output escaping if it controls how the result tree is output. This may not always be the case. For example , the result tree may be used as the source tree for another XSLT transformation instead of being output. An XSLT processor is not required to support disabling output escaping. If an xsl : value-of or xsl : text specifies that output escaping should be disabled and the XSLT processor does not support this , the XSLT processor may signal an error; if it does not signal an error , it must recover by not disabling output escaping . </signal.v.2151><signal.v.2152>TABLE 1. CHX blocks destabilization of coreceptor RNAs in signaled DP thymocytes but does not interfere with TCR-CD2 signal transductiona We conclude that ( i ) coreceptor RNAs are selectively destabilized in signaled DP thymocytes; ( ii ) destabilization of coreceptor RNAs is dependent on new protein synthesis; and ( iii ) destabilization of coreceptor RNAs , at least CD8 coreceptor RNA , is dependent on target sequences present in the noncoding regulatory sequences of endogenously encoded coreceptor RNAs . </signal.v.2152><signal.v.2153>The meeting in Copenhagen is about building on the growing momentum for action that has emerged over the past year and laying a solid foundation for achieving the final legally binding agreement in months , not years.

Progress in the U.S. is shaping what we can realistically achieve in Copenhagen . </signal.v.2153><signal.v.2154>This means that the situation has undefined consequences; however , if an error is signaled , it is of the specified type.

In the corresponding dream report the participant described his experience with the hand clenching task as follows :  I gave the LRLR signal and started clenching the left hand for 3-5 times , then another LRLR signal and right hand clenching ( as practiced ) . I gave a final LRLR to signal the end of the task.

That 's why many traders watch moving averages with different timeframes at once. If a short-term MA crosses your longer-term MA , it can signal your trend is ending - and time to pare back your position . </signal.v.2156><signal.v.2157>Muscle contractions are signaled by action potentials ( electrical signals ) in the plasma membranes of muscle fibers. This signal is transmitted by nerve cells , known as neurons , from the central nervous system ( CNS ) to the muscle fiber.

According to an embodiment of the present invention , a timeout counter is activated when error signal 312 is activated. For example , timeout counter trace 314 becomes active at edge 318 when error signal 312 is asserted. In cases where power switch 100 is capacitively or inductively loaded , error signal 312 is active for a short period of time , and then goes low again at edge 320. When error signal 312 becomes active at edge 322 , however , the signal remains high , which is indicative of a true output load fault condition. When the timeout counter reaches filter limit 315 , error flag EF 316 becomes active at edge 317 signaling the fault . </signal.v.2158><signal.v.2159>Severe melena can signal acute bleeding and life-threatening hypovolemic shock. Usually , melena indicates bleeding from the esophagus , stomach , or duodenum , although it can also indicate bleeding from the jejunum , ileum , or ascending colon. This sign can also result from swallowing blood , as in epistaxis; from taking certain drugs; or from ingesting alcohol. Because false melena may be caused by ingestion of lead , iron , bismuth , or licorice ( which produces black stools without the presence of blood ) , all black stools should be tested for occult blood . </signal.v.2159><signal.v.2160>Traditional chart pattern analysis can also be applied to oscillators.

In addition to these three basic tones , G-Maxx has another advantageous feature : it can produce several different tones simultaneously for targets in intermediate categories. Your ear will eventually grow accustomed to this abundance of sounds. Certain medium-sized ferrous masses that are usually hard to identify are signaled by a simultaneous low/medium/high pitch ( except for very large ferrous masses , of course , which generate a high pitch ) . It takes a little bit of practice to accustom your ear to the various tones. If the multiple tones bother you , you can disable that mode and start using G-Maxx in the Mono-Tone mode as a conventional detector. To do so , set the DISCRI potentiometer to 3 or 4 , in order to search in the Mono-Tone mode while rejecting ferrous objects . </signal.v.2176><signal.v.2177>We have chosen the EC Futures contract because it is well known that currency futures are best traded using trending type strategies. In this example we have built a very simple trading system based upon the crossover indicator concept.

If the Crossover Momentum line crosses below the Crossover Plus Amplitude line , this is a signal to sell. Cycles-base trading in this example is ignored and the trading system is comprised of only the trending components. We could have used the crossover below as a long exit condition if we did not want to go short , but the NeuroShell Trader automatically exits a long when a short entry condition is signaled , and vice versa when there are no exit conditions specified. Traders call this a " reversal " strategy. In the training period , NeuroShell Trader finds the optimum tuning and bandpass parameters for the indicators . </signal.v.2177></signal.v.train>
