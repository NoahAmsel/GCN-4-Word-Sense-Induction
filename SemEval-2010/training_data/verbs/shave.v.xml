<shave.v.train><shave.v.1>Because I am so prone to razor burn , I wipe down my razor with rubbing alcohol ( isopropyl alcohol ) after every shave , and I often wipe down my freshly-shaven skin with the alcohol as well. Razor burn is caused by many things , including applying too much pressure , too much friction , shaving against the hair follicle , not enough lubrication , and bacteria entering the tiny nicks and cuts caused by the razor. If you apply rubbing alcohol after a shave , it kills any bacteria that might have been lingering on your razor or skin , and helps prevent irritation . </shave.v.1><shave.v.2>If men shave their heads , why is it so wrong for women to shave their heads ? It 's a persons individual choice and should not be judged. Having said that some women look extremely sexy with their head shaved ... .Sinead O'Connor for one , and some men look absolutely ridiculous bald. Britney Spears has more issues than a bald head to worry about though . </shave.v.2><shave.v.3>I 've honed my technique now and am fastidious about getting a really close shave. Not only do I not like the look of stubble , but I find myself unconsciously doing that sad-bastard scratchy-chin thing whenever I have any. Therefore there are many references below to " getting a closer shave " . If you want designer stubble ( why ? ) or six o'clock shadow ( why on earth ... ? ) then do n't do these things . </shave.v.3><shave.v.4>I shave my armpits a couple of times each summer. It reduces the sweat/smell and I think makes the deoderant work more efficiently . </shave.v.4><shave.v.5>I am sure not all girls shave their pubic hair. However , I do know a lot of girls who shave their pubic hair and that includes me . </shave.v.5><shave.v.6>I had to shave it once or twice due to working in the food industry , but I ' ve always grown it back. Partially because I don ' t like shaving ( too much time and effort ) , and partially because I think I look much better with my beard than without it . </shave.v.6><shave.v.7>The five curve-hugging blades individually adjust to stay in contact with your skin , even around tricky areas like your knees , ankles , and bikini area. You don ' t have to use the Gillette Satin Care Shave Gel to get the perfect shave , but the two products definitely work better together. ( Plus the Satin Care Shave Gel comes in some pretty yummy scents like Alluring Avocado and Lavender Kiss ! ) When I used both the Embrace razor and the Satin Care shaving gel together , I got an incredibly close and smooth shave. I can now go almost 3 days without shaving again ! </shave.v.7><shave.v.8>I shaved for years using a safety ( double edge ) razor and loved it. I ' m keeping my beard for now , but if I decide to shave it off , I ' m tempted to try straight razor shaving. It might not be for me , but you can ' t deny its manliness . </shave.v.8><shave.v.9>I just wanted to comment to you after receiving my first of what will likely be many orders for the total shaving solution. I used it this morning with my Panasonic wet dry shaver and had absolutley outstanding results. My wife too used " hers " in the shower last night and had results equal to mine. My only recomnedation would be to make an after shave based on the same formula ... .and bigger bottles ! My shave was near perfect and my skin felt fantastic ! </shave.v.9><shave.v.10>I received my order of " The Total Shaving Solution " this afternoon and just used it a few minutes ago ( I was so pleased with the product that I had to write you right away ! ) . I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU for the best ( and most amazing ! ) product that I have ever bought in my entire life ! ! ! I have one of the toughest beards on earth , and shaving has been torturous throughout my entire life. I also shave my head , so my scalp will be also very thankful when I use the TSS on it ! </shave.v.10><shave.v.11>Guys are also shaving ... ahem ... " other " parts now as well. To be fair a lot of guys have shaved their groin area for a long time , you just did n't really talk about a lot until recently. Please , I can not stress this enough; if you shave your undercarriage , use common sense and be careful ! Why shave down there ? Well , have you ever seen one of those optical illusions ? Of course you have. When you shave your genital area , it creates an optical illusion. It usually gives you at least an " optical inch " to the size of your manhood gentlemen . </shave.v.11><shave.v.12>The Norelco 6826XL seems to be the obvious preference on your web site. I am curious about its ability to shave hair that grows in every direction ( as opposed to hair that uniformly points one way ) . Foil shavers ( like my rechargeable Braun that just died after 7 years ) just do n't cut it. I often had to shave individual hairs separately because the foil would slide right over them. Do the slots on the Quadra action shavers eliminate that problem ? </shave.v.12><shave.v.13>Well , I voted yes. I sent this to Dave because halfway through my last ass-shave , I thought it might be a fun topic. I used to be among those who thought it was " gay " , or " a little too much " to shave your ass. I can tell you , once you get over whatever hang-up it is that you have , and shave your ass , my ... what an improvement. Easier , cleaner wiping , and an overall cleaner feeling. A razor is best , but a close second would be a bikini line electric trimmer . </shave.v.13><shave.v.14>I personally do n't mind guys with " some " upper body hair. If a guy is naturally smooth then ok. If he feels the need to trim or shave that 's his choice. But as long as I can tell there is skin under all that hair then I am ok with that. Smooth is ok but some of that upper body hair can be very sexy to some guys and ON some guys ! </shave.v.14><shave.v.15>It sounds like you ' re stuck under that system for a while longer. I ' ve found electric shaving much better than wet shaving , whether to shave over my throat ( nowadays ) or more ( at various times over the years ) . Also , my electric shavers have paid for themselves compared to the yearly cost of disposable blades and shaving cream . </shave.v.15><shave.v.16>The 13 ounce bottle of Palmolive dish soap has a price tag of $ 1.29 compared to several dollars for a can of shaving cream. I used only two dime size drops of dish soap. So I am guessing that I can get about 50 shaves out of one bottle of dish soap. That make my shaves cost about 3 cents per shave. Gillete Foamy shave cream is about $ 2.79 for an 11 ounces. Let 's assume for a moment that we can get 50 shaves out of those 11 ounces ( this is just a guess , but the actual amount of shaves might be less ) . The would come out to about 5 cents per shave ( maybe even more ) . </shave.v.16><shave.v.17>First thing 's first. Some women are under the mistaken impression that only porn stars shave their pubic area. Well , considering they 're just about the only women other heterosexual women get to see naked , it 's understandable why they would think this way. But in fact , most women keep their private areas prim and proper , and it 's not just to encourage their men to head down south for some home-style cat on a grill . </shave.v.17><shave.v.18>how the Fu $  do you pluck your legs ? ? ? No just get good soap , . , . , but the more you shave the faster it will grow back. , . , . , allot of girls shave like everytime they take a shower. , . , . , after moving in with my girlfriend and actualy showering with her , . , I no longer complain about the long showers. , . , she has alot of work to be done. , . , .Im glad im a guy. , . , .get under the water soap on soap off get out. , . , . , .and I pee in the shower when shes not looking. , . , heehee </shave.v.18><shave.v.19>The next morning , when I appeared after a good night 's rest , I found the family had breakfasted and Bridget was weighing and making up lunches for her brother and sister. When she finished this , she started to shave Barney; but before finishing this , had to escort her sister out to the bus. I finished shaving Barney , who was being called for later , as he went to a different day centre. A young man arrived with a child whom Bridget would take to play school , as the parents worked out. Bridget walked with me to the junction where we parted and I would go on to Glenarm . </shave.v.19><shave.v.20>I tried again a few days later and it worked great -- no soreness , really close , and very quick -- no mowing up and down , just a couple of glides across a particular spot will do it. I got the stopwatch out yesterday and shaved for an important meeting with a new client. I stopped the clock at 2 : 42. After a closer look , I realised a few spots needed closer attention , so I started the clock again and ended up with a very satisfactory job at 3 : 30 . </shave.v.20><shave.v.21>An alternative to shaping and trimming your beard by yourself is to enlist the help of a professional barber. After having a professional shape your beard , you will be able to maintain it by using your old razor and trimmer. Every 2-3 days , you will need to shave the areas you ' ve just trimmed off . </shave.v.21><shave.v.22>To soften your beard and open your pores , shave either in the shower or just after getting out , before the steam escapes from the bathroom. Use a good shaving cream that contains skin-soothing ingredients. Do n't dry shave , which increases skin irritation . </shave.v.22><shave.v.23>The key to a great shave is water as warm as you face can take it , a sharp razor , and pulling your skin tight as your glide the razor across the whiskers. Use the hot water to soften your beard , a wash cloth or the end of a hand towel works well. Get a good lather , I like shaving soap. Go over the skin in one direction , and only one time . </shave.v.23><shave.v.24>First I wash my face with Avalon Organics vitamin C face wash. I use a Merkur Futur with merkur blades ( yes I know , there ' may ' be better blades out there ) for most of my face. I shave around my goatee using DOVO Shavette again with the merkur blades. For lathering I have some lavender Taylor of Old Bond Street shave soap and a silvertip badger hair brush. After the shave I pass a wet alum block over my face and let it sit while I clean my brush and razor. I then rinse the alum off and apply some Every Man Jack aftershave lotion. I am looking forward to using the Art of Shaving line . </shave.v.24><shave.v.25>A Gel that adds freshness to your shave This shaving gel gives that fresh and exhilarating feeling. " Nivea for Men " moisturising shaving gel gives that smooth glide with an aroma that freshens the skin and air as you shave. I believe the claim from the company is true , although I respect many other opinions and senses of choice. I like this product and you do n't need to use a lot. I am still a bit of a traditionalist , remembering the old flat blade with heavier metal holder and a cup full of old soaps whisked into a larva with the shaving brush made from badger hair. Many now use a large portion of gel or foam in the palms of ... Read the complete review </shave.v.25><shave.v.26>Improper pubic shaver almost always causes side effects like pubic razor bumps , pubic pimples and ingrown pubic hair , which can be both painful and itchy. To prevent these irritations , please use the proper tools as mentioned earlier. A good way to prevent ingrown pubic hair is to apply the Gigi No Bumps before and after shaving to help the new pubic hair grow out without curling back into the skin. You could also try the Bikini Zone Cream to get rid of the razor bumps . </shave.v.26><shave.v.27>I shaved the right side of my face and turned my head to the right. Looked in the mirror. I see an old man ahead of me; that 's not what I want . </shave.v.27><shave.v.28>A friend of mine with *really* coarse hair insists he ' s gotten the best results using a woman ' s razor ( after grabbing a girlfriend ' s when he had to shave at her place ) . Contrary to that , I know plenty of girls who prefer a mach3 over lady razors . </shave.v.28><shave.v.29>Sheryl Crow even said in an interview last year that Lance shaves more often than she does. If Lance isn ' t doing laser hair removal , I figure it ' s a given that it ' s not even possible . </shave.v.29><shave.v.30>I also tried the Norelco Quadra Action , Model 6826XL ( $ 99.95 ) . It produced a very comfortable shave and did not irritate my skin , yet compared to the Panasonic Linear it seemed like it was struggling. It seemed slow although very quiet. It is also quite comfortable to grip. The Quadra Action shave was decent but the Panasonic , to me anyway , is far superior. I tried and tried to get all the stubble off with the Norelco but could not. The Panasonic took it all off admirably. The only drawback with this model of Panasonic razor is the long charge time and it can not be quick charged. Other than that it is a very fine razor . </shave.v.30><shave.v.31>God has given all of us the gift to choose. We choose wrong many times more than we can imagine. Yet no one should have this gift of a free will taken away for religious reasons. The problems with many " religious " people , not just muslims , is that they make the outward more inportant than what is really in the heart. You make a muslim shave his beard but will that keep him from sinning in his heart ? You can legislate proper " religious " conduct to anyone , but without uncondtional acceptance there will be no change of the heart. I believe the princple of free choice is important to the God who gave it to us . </shave.v.31><shave.v.32>I have to confess that I did ( long ago ) have a date with a woman who had not shaved her legs prior to the date ( hmmm ) . At some point during the evening , we decided to throw caution to the wind , that sex was indeed on the menu that night , so she took a bath and shaved her legs at my place ! </shave.v.32><shave.v.33>The best Luxury lather concentrated shave cream lightly fragranced with Marborough , a subtle blend of woods including cedar and sandalwood. It can also be used without a brush. This rich formulation will not dry the skin . </shave.v.33><shave.v.34>Sir , I have been shaving my chest with a regular razor and often get ingrown hairs. Would an electric shaver help ? Which style shaving head would you recommend ? </shave.v.34><shave.v.35>Paul did not want the Gentile Christian female prophets wearing unrestrained hair. One reason may have been that from a traditional Jewish Christian view , loose hair was a sign of uncleanness. Proper Jewish women braided their hair and and pinned it up. Paul was being sarcastic when he wrote , " any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled [ or uncovered with bound up hair ] disgraces her headit is one and the same thing as having her head shaved , " He was arguing that Christian women wearing their hair down like female ecstatics of other religions was as disgraceful as shaving their head like a man. 5 </shave.v.35><shave.v.36>In 1999 and through a good part of 2000 , I regularly shaved my head. Although I went to the skin a number of times , I settled on a one or two guard most of the time . </shave.v.36><shave.v.37>This is what the ASPCA recommends- Never shave your dog down to the skin in winter , as a longer coat will provide more warmth. When you bathe your dog in the colder months , be sure to completely dry him before taking him out for a walk. Own a short-haired breed ? Consider getting him a coat or sweater with a high collar or turtleneck with coverage from the base of the tail to the belly. For many dogs , this is regulation winter wear. </shave.v.37><shave.v.38>Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. When water boils , its temperature can not exceed the boiling point. At zero elevation , this occurs at 212 ' F ( 100 C ) . Living in Silicon Valley with an elevation of a mere 70 feet above sea level , I could expect my water to boil at about that temperature , within a tenth of a degree. However , I knew that I could do better. I would have to work harder to find the hottest water for my RISE Super Foam shave . </shave.v.38><shave.v.39>The reason many men are choosing to shave with a safety razor , however , is much more down-to-earth : the multiblade cartridge uses a tug-and-cut approach that , for many , causes ingrown whiskers , razor bumps , and skin irritation. These men turn to the double-edged blade and safety razor for the comfort they achieve once they learn how to use the instruments , which might take a week . </shave.v.39><shave.v.40>I use a Venus Razor ( the refills with the attached shave gel stuff.. ) i just do pits and legs regularly.. and only do bikini if I 'm going to be wearing a bathing suit ( otherwise I just trim ) </shave.v.40><shave.v.41>Well I 'm trying to win this for my husband and his system sucks because he 's one of the bloody savages using neon blue shave cream without a fancy brush ! ! ( I just had to say that because that line in your review made me laugh out loud. Great review by the way ! ) Thanks . </shave.v.41><shave.v.42>I want to ( belatedly ) relay my experience with attempting to find a satisfactory new electric shaver to hopefully help others in the quest for the same. I have been shaving with electrics for approx. 10 years and am currently using an old Remington XLR series screen unit and a Norelco rotary fixed head 3405C. The Norelco is more comfortable , but I must use the Remington to shave my neck hairs , which " lay down " against the skin . </shave.v.42><shave.v.43>And one Republican who grew a beard while on the campaign trail but shaved once he returned to the Hill says his recent experiment was more a matter of function than statement. With the long hours , it was easier not to shave , and a beard keeps you marginally warmer in places like Iowa and New Hampshire , he says . </shave.v.43><shave.v.44> I have no words to describe the AMAZING shave i had this morning with the Wapienica. The razors shave my whiskers so excellently that no further passes are need and especially no cuts , not bumps AT ALL. The sensation i had is like to be touched by a cashmere cloth. REALLY , I am not joking ! I do not know what is doing this razor performing so WELL but I highly recommend to everyone wants to enjoy the daily ritual of shaving. Congratulation to you for the sharpening and for putting this items on the website. I will certainly buy other razors from you. </shave.v.44><shave.v.45>I shave every single day - pits , legs , and bikini area. My hair is dark and course. To let it grow gets very uncomfortable. All of this takes me about 5 minutes. I guess practice cuts the time down. lol. I also use men 's razors. They are cheaper. I also use barbasol , which is men 's shaving cream. It is about a buck at Wal-Mart and gives me the closest shave I ever had. I would estimate my costs to be pretty low per month , $ 7 maybe ?

My grandmother used to sit down in front of the television and patiently spend a good hour running the block of dried Bonito back and forth across the blade of the shaving tool ( sort of looks like a plane ) to make her own shavings. A Samurai saga would be a good show to watch if you wanted to get a box full. I own a plane myself but all I produce is saw dust. The plane is a piece of decoration at the moment . </shave.v.46><shave.v.47>It 's best you shave ALL down there , you 'll feel more clean..lol , also most guys prefer it. I mean do n't you prefer a clean down there , in a guy ? </shave.v.47><shave.v.48>However , when the prohibition to cut one 's hair is repeated in Dt 14 : 1-2 we read : " ... you shall not cut yourselves nor shall you place baldness between your eyes , for the dead. " Since most people do not have any significant hair " between the eyes " this phrase is usually understood as meaning the hair on the front of the head above the eyes. Bearing this in mind , we learn two things from Dt 14. Firstly , we learn that the prohibition is not necessarily a bowl-cut , but making any baldness around the edges of the head. Secondly , we see that the prohibition is specifically in the context of mourning. That is , one is prohibited to make baldness in the head as an act of mourning " for the dead " . In ancient times , when someone died the surviving relatives were so distraught that they cut their skin until they bled and shaved bald spots on their head . </shave.v.48><shave.v.49>Spire Homes ' chairman , John Farrar , has shaved his beard off for the first time in 3 years for charity on the 8th. John has raised over £ 200 to help Homeless International , a charity that works across Asia and Africa to help improve the lives of some of the poorest people in the world . </shave.v.49><shave.v.50>I now get a very close shave ( closer than with any previous electrics -- about as close as with a blade when shaving with the grain ) with absolutely no irritation whatsoever ! I had to experiment around a little and have a few comments about that ... .I tried Williams Lectric Shave as a pre-shave for one and a half weeks and it did not help at all and the alcohol in it annoyed me ... ... I then tried shaving after waking but prior to washing my face for about a week and I got a better shave ( recommended by Braun ) , but still not good enough ... .I then broke down and bought the Remington Powder pre-shave you recommended and have been using it and shaving about five minutes after getting out of the shower ever since . </shave.v.50><shave.v.51>While such companies as Gillette and Schick in recent years have waged a marketplace war of adding blades to their razors -- they 're up to five now -- some consumers are subtracting blades. With double-edge razors you actually shave with a single blade edge. You then flip over the razor to use the other edge , saving rinsing time . </shave.v.51><shave.v.52>Though it is not heard anywhere , it is true that women in Japan are now going to barber shops to get facial shave with blade and cream. The facial shaving services are normally offered in almost every barber shop through out Japan. The women in Japan are mostly relying on facial shaving with the blade rather than other hair removal options like lasers or mask treatments etc . </shave.v.52><shave.v.53>I definitely find that being hairy is problematic. I do n't feel as sexy for my boyfriend ( who is cool with the pit hair ) unless I have smooth legs , despite that I HATE taking the time to shave them; they do n't shave well; and he 's said he does n't notice the hairiness unless it 's pretty long . </shave.v.53><shave.v.54>So while some women shave themselves silly on Jan. 20 , I plan to enter this new era with a tailored modern mini-bush and a reclaimed sense of womanhood. Maybe , if the bikini line theory plays out , we 'll all go back to the Telly Savalas sooner or later. But the promise of a new America under an Obama administration gives me greater optimism. I envision a country where we can one day have it all -- a booming economy , national security , a healthy respect for sexuality and even a little bush. I say , Yes we can . </shave.v.54><shave.v.55>This is a short one minute video I found on youtube of a few different women who have shaved their head. I don ' t think they did it for hair loss , but still they all look great with their new bare scalps. I often look online for images of other women who ' ve taken the plunge for whatever reason , to hopefully get the strength and motivation to do it myself . </shave.v.55><shave.v.56>Though it might not get the kind of enthusiastic endorsement reserved for the higher-end English made creams from the discerning wet shaver/hobbyist crowd ( shave geeks ) , Proraso is a quantum leap in quality compared to the canned stuff on the drug store shelf. For the uninitiated , a tube of Proraso cream is an excellent first step in the journey toward a vastly improved shaving experience . </shave.v.56><shave.v.57>I , realizing what she was going for in this situation , said , " as soon as dad teaches me to shave. " He kind of laughed it off and told a story of how he learned to shave by watching his older brothers shave and by trying it himself. I quickly reminded him that I was the oldest child and that I had no brothers . </shave.v.57><shave.v.58>I should add , I know the right way , but I want to try the brushes and razor. I use disposal Gillettes , Barbasol cream , Nivea after shave balm , then Bumper Stopper 2. No matter what I do , I always get razor burn/skin irritation of some sort. Bumper stopper 2 is the only cream that has worked the best for me . </shave.v.58><shave.v.59>The biggest problem with back hair removal for men is the process of removing it. Shaving presents the obvious problem of reach , it ' s nearly impossible to shave your own back , and it can be even more frustrating and embarrassing to find someone to do the job for you. Waxing back hair and depilatory creams also offer their own sets of problems. Like shaving , hair removal depilatories can be hard to apply to your own back , and waxing can be extremely painful , especially for men with excessive back hair. Unfortunately , more hair translates to more pain. In recent years , the simplest solution for removing hair from the back and shoulders has become advanced laser treatments . </shave.v.59><shave.v.60>Let 's jump to January of 2008. While gearing up for No Shave February , an entire month without shaving , something I complete with a few of my roommates , I trim my beard down to the shortest length , while still barely keeping a " beard.

It provides a very smooth shave and the menthol additive will keep 'burn ' down plus it reduces any rash even on a first shave. You can get King of Shaves in most decent chemists like Superdrug and Boots and most supermarkets stock it as well . </shave.v.65><shave.v.66>" This is simply the best shaving product I 've ever had the pleasure of using. I reverted back to wet shaving about 3 months ago , as electric shaving just did n't give me the super closeness I like. Every wet shaving product I have used up to now ( i.e. high street foams , gels etc ) have left my skin sore , cut and irritated after a wet shave , no matter how careful I am - and that is using a good razor. I tried this product based on other reviews and the difference is amazing in my opinion - a really close shave with none of the soreness and tenderness of the skin I have experienced with anything else. It seems expensive at first , but you only use a little bit , and the tub goes a long way. Highly recommended !

I recently shaved my head ( thanks to Male Pattern Baldness ) but had been unable to get a really close shave.

I used to use hair removal cream but they caused skin discoloration and smell awful , so I switched to using razors. Over the past few years I ' ve stopped shaving my arms and now my arm pits because I realized I generally don ' t wear sleeveless clothes or wave my arms around showing everyone my under arm hair . </shave.v.73><shave.v.74>" I think the number of responses here speak volumes. As with many others , I hesitated for weeks before finally taking the plunge. With dry/sensitive skin , I feared my face was in for a gore fest.

I am not as concerned with the environmental impact of my current shaving choices . </shave.v.77><shave.v.78>Post shave : Once the shave is complete , simply rinse the face with warm to cool water. If you have oily to normal skin you can apply an after shave splash to hydrate and replace lost moisture if using something without alcohol. For sensitive skin products without alcohol are much more skin friendly. If you have dry to very dry skin , you can use a non-alcohol splash followed by a balm , lotion or cream , or just use a lotion or cream on its own. Generally , splashes are the least moisturizing and creams are the most moisturizing , with balms and lotions being in-between. Look for products that have ingredients that are beneficial for skin care. Post shave can be simple and make you feel , smell and look even better . </shave.v.78><shave.v.79>" I have read some great and some not so great reviews of this razor. I was very nervous about using such a sharp implement but was surprised how easy it was to use. I initially started on the least aggressive setting , as advised and only nicked myself once. After a couple of weeks I have gradually increased to the setting and find I can get a very close shave with no irritation ( used to have problem on my neck ) . The secret is to be as gentle and as careful as possible. Be patient and you will be rewarded with probably the best shave of your life !

" Talmudic tradition explains this to mean that a man may not shave his beard with a razor with a single blade , since the cutting action of the blade against the skin " mars " the beard. Because scissors have two blades , some opinions in halakha ( Jewish law ) permit their use to trim the beard , as the cutting action comes from contact of the two blades and not the blade against the skin. For this reason , most poskim ( Jewish legal deciders ) rule that Orthodox Jews may use electric razors to remain cleanshaven , as such shavers cut by trapping the hair between the blades and the metal grating , halakhically a scissor-like action. Some prominent contemporary poskim [ who ? ] maintain that electric shavers constitute a razor-like action and consequently prohibit their use . </shave.v.88><shave.v.89>Two days later , Kainudy was back in Lan O'lin 's warehouse.

Also , because I get a 5 o'clock shadow before I finish my morning coffee , I have to shave every day. I am certain to have a face made of leather by the time I am 40.

Even stranger was his reaction to discovering spies be that he cut off their beards. Bearing in mind that ancient peoples shaved off their beards as an act of mourning " for the dead " , it becomes clear why Hanun 's advisors doubted that David 's comforters had come to pay condolences. Presumably Hanun and his cronies sat in the royal court with torn clothes , cut skin , and shaven beards. When David 's men arrived with full beards Hanun 's advisors assumed they were not coming to mourn the dead king but to spy out the land.

The first thing I would ask is 'have you replaced the heads on your Philishave HS890 shaver ? ' Shaver heads do not last forever. If I recall right , your model uses the Philishave/Norelco HQ4 replacement heads. As for a lotion you can use for shaving. I would recommend using a pre-shave lotion formulated to work in conjection with electric shavers. The pre-shave allows you to shave with a minimum of friction so the shaver glides on your skin. I use a pre-shave powder stick which does the same thing. I 'm sure the Philips DAP customer service people have their own ideas on what to use , but I do n't know what they recommend that 's available in the United Kingdom. I would suggest going to the Philips DAP web site I have linked elsewhere and click your mouse to the area marked " Feedback " on the top of their home page.

However to manage hair that a person already has and speed up the growing process just a bit is to go in and have regular trims/cuts. You do n't even have to take off more then an inch if you do n't want to ( Hair growth is different for everyone but rounded down it grows about one to two inches a month ) , but as all hair ages it gets split ends which can go up to the root in some case , and actually -slowing- the hair growth process. It also splits hair 's and very easily makes it fall out , and/or feel rough or dry. It 's good to trim these split ends once every two months or so to keep you 're hair healthy and at it 's best and most radient.

I had it shaved at the end of my junior year at Stanford. Through the summer , it was short and growing , growing through my trips to Boston and to Japan with my friend , John Blake. And boy , did it grow slowly ! I am fond of using the quote , " Like a plant , it 's growing , but you ca n't see it growing ! " By the time I graduated , however , it was well on its way to getting long again. Unfortunately , it was long hair short-lived , as I was compelled to cut it for an important family wedding. After all , I had to be respectful in front of all the relatives ! I put up a little fight , but at the end of the day , family duty and honor prevailed , and the locks were chopped off once again . </shave.v.144><shave.v.145>To use it , all you need to do is wet it with hot water , dab it directly in the shaving cream , and lather it up directly on your face by applying pressure with a circular motion. It  s that easy. You will be ready to get the best shave within seconds and afterwards you will be so smoothest , softest and most nourished skin you have had in a while.

I tried the Phenom and it gives a damned good shave , but Schick 's Quattro probably does a reasonable job , as do the many cheaper three-blade options. But then I can get two months of shaving for $ 5 out of the safety razor I started using last year. There 's a recession on , you know . </shave.v.146><shave.v.147>Here 's the non-answer I finally got from Jennifer Manno. I am going to send Panasonic my two Linears. Unless I am completely crazy , your Mr. Steel Beard fans who purchased Linears about a year ago should begin to see failures. If they do not , it could be because their beards are not as heavy as mine , they never shave wet , they purchased better products or have much better luck than me . </shave.v.147><shave.v.148>However , if you did nick yourself while shaving , put on an alcohol-based after shave , such as Aqua Velva. Using alcohol-based aftershave too frequently can dry out your skin , but it 's great at stopping a nick from bleeding quickly. And , the sting of this type of aftershave is a nice change every once in a while . </shave.v.148><shave.v.149>Gillette Foamy Sensitive Skin has a thick , extra rich , creamy lather for a close , comfortable shave.

That makes a bad impression . </shave.v.150><shave.v.151>I find that using the Edge brand shaving cream to be the best.I shave before showering and then hit any missed spots while in the shower.I then moisturize my scalp with Clinique Post Shave Healer.You can get it at the same Clinique counter where your wife or girlfriend buys her cosmetics.It works great and a little bit goes a long way . </shave.v.151><shave.v.152>Think back to the first time you shaved your legs. What kind of an experience was that for you ? It was a rite of passage. I was in Boulder at the time , it was the fall of 2001 and I was thinking , " Alrighty , this is it ! I 'm going to be a reeeeal cyclist now. " Probably a good half hour later , I was silky and smooth . </shave.v.152><shave.v.153>Firstly , I would be remiss if I did not mention that TSS is the best shaving oil , which is to say the absolute best shaving medium , in existence. I first tried Somersets shaving oil , because it was sent to me as a free sample from an estore I bought soap from. I set these free samples on the shelf and vowed never to use these un-Christian oils to shave my face. I would have just thrown them away , but I am just too damn frugal. After a couple of weeks , I finally tried the oil as a pre-shave , and it worked incredibly well. Eventually I cut out the middle-man and tried it solely as a shaving medium; the first couple of shaves were awful , but after that it worked fairly well. The Somersets kept my skin moisturized and conditioned , but it still was not that great of a shaving medium . </shave.v.153><shave.v.154>SOMERSETS SHAVING OIL provides the best shave or your moneyback - GUARANTEED.

I do believe every woman should be able to shave or not shave , but I do n't think shaving has anything to do with individual choice currently. If shaving were merely a choice , there would n't be so many of us on this board who are embarrassed to show are unshaven body parts. There would be many more women who would dare expose their hairy bodies. We have n't chosen to shave; we have been coerced into it. It can not really be called a choice until women can feel free to not shave without having to worry about being embarrassed or considered unattractive . </shave.v.155><shave.v.156>It has been a great bond one that left me greener ( no more aerosol cans of gel or shaving cream ) without giving me a green face ( much smoother shaves , with automatic healing because of the Skin lotion ) . But the issues I have is the clean-up the gunk from the lotion + hair is very resistant to flowing away with a hot water flush; and the lack of satisfaction of looking at my lathered mug . </shave.v.156><shave.v.157>" Is it OK for me to use an electric razor ? Positively not. A blade cuts flush against the skin , while an electric razor leaves an imperceptible - but still present - bit of stubble on your leg. You think that stubble does n't have mass ? You think that stubble does n't cause aerodynamic drag ? Darn straight it does. Shave with a razor , you sissy . </shave.v.157><shave.v.158>iim 22 now. i have been shaving my chest since i was like 15 and i still shave my chest still and i do n't get any bumps or anything cause my chest is use to it.

Nor did they permit oaths. Shaving was discouraged as well , and the male Perfects ( two-thirds of the total , only one fifth of whom were gentry ) had long beards often forked in the Syrian/Coptic/Irish style. This contrasted with the Catholic monks , who were gentry and were tonsured and shaved . </shave.v.159><shave.v.160>Even though she was late for work , or would be if she had trouble finding a clean enough corporate outfit , Molly sighed and washed the hairs away.

Do we American women shave our armpits because we really think it 's nasty or because we 've been programmed to think it 's nasty just like we 've been programmed to buy chocolates and flowers on Valentine 's Dumb Day ? What is Valentine 's Day and who says I have to celebrate my love for anyone on that day ? Most historians ca n't even agree on which St. Valentine we 're celebrating and what he did or did n't do. But back to hairy armpits ... </shave.v.164><shave.v.165>A. I applaud you for wanting to find out if this practice is harmful. The short answer is it depends on the dog. In my shop , we never shave a Northern breed such as the Husky , Samoyed , Norwegian Elkhound or Keeshond down close to the skin or a Labrador Retriever or German Shepherd Dog either because their double coats can be irreparably damaged in the process . </shave.v.165><shave.v.166>Formula 103 - Formula 103 is a unique razorless shaving cream especially formulated for the needs of African American men and women.

I shaved my aussie every year , just short enough so she looked like a smooth coated breed. Not so short as to expose the skin. She was MUCH cooler and clearly happier after her haircut , and I did this most every summer of her 16 year life. We lived in a tick infested area and she was a major poofball , clipping her short was the best solution . </shave.v.169><shave.v.170>Many designers who offer signature colognes like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein also offer a line of other mens grooming products that include shave creams and gels. ( I personally think American Crew has one of the best line-ups of mens grooming products and I have used them for years ) . I have also come across shave creams by both Neutrogena and Aveeno , which might prove helpful to men with particularly sensitive skin. In any case , find a shave cream that best fits your needs because most of us spend 3 , 000 hours of our lives shaving before its over . </shave.v.170><shave.v.171>Now , I do agree that it is stupid that society pressures women to shave. Surely that should be up to us women , right ? Feminism is about women being able to control their own bodies , yes ? So if a woman does n't want to shave , she should n't be made to feel bad or unattractive. Men do n't shave their legs or pits ( well , some do but the overwhelming mainstream attitude toward that appears to be that they are therefore effeminate and not real men ) , so we women should n't either , right ? </shave.v.171><shave.v.172>i say this because if you wait for amazon to have a sale on it the cost is only $ 4.00 each and when you clean daily you feel like you are shaving with a new shaver each and every day . </shave.v.172><shave.v.173>I 'm a sometimes-shaver , but i 'm invariably too lazy to do it every day.

They declared : ' O Prophet these People of the Book do not wear shalwars and loin cloths ' .

Oddly enough , these same artists often portray Adam without a beard.

I can not picture Adam strolling down to the stream each morning , lathering up his face , and shaving by his reflection in the water. Even if I picture him using a clam shell or a flint knife , the idea of Adam shaving in the Garden of Eden seems too unnatural to be real . </shave.v.179><shave.v.180>I noticed that many of the comments on the forum involve preparation of the beard prior to shaving.

Now as I begin to lose body fat , shaving is important so that I can see each particular muscle , vein and fiber to make sure I am preparing correctly. It also helps in tanning evenly.

But I think it ' s important to at least be aware of why we make the choices that we do , and to question advertising of all kinds before buying in to it.

In fact anything over an inch was deemed long and there was a new trend for products.

When you shave , a remnant of hair is left in the hair follicle. As this starts to grow out of the follicle , it may immediately curve round into the surrounding skin , because there is nothing to keep it straight. The ingrowing hair irritates the skin and can cause a lumpy reaction , especially in black skin ( Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology 2002; 46 ( 2 Suppl ) : 5113 9 ) .

So each time you use it , less hair grows back , and the hair that *does* grow back is much finer and easier to shave. Eventually , though , your hair will stop growing down there and you really wont have to shave at all.. A word of note : this stuff really DOES work. I 've been using it for a month now and it 's really working. each time i use it , i 'd say 10 of my hair is not growing back. the hair that does grow back grows MUCH slower and is more fine. so rub this creme onto your legs and privates , and other spots , wait 15 minutes and then apply it again . </shave.v.200><shave.v.201>i barely shave during the winter ( maybe 1 or 2 times ) . whats the point when your legs are always covered ? when it warms up , i shave my calves but i am personally not a fan of short shorts or skirts so my thighs may not be completely shaved. rarely am i ever beach ready.

Goes on slick and a wonderful surface for your razor to glide. The price is great because you only need a small amount for a couple passes. Wonderful wonderful stuff. Cheers . </shave.v.213><shave.v.214>3. I would guess that the Syncro , because it has two foil heads and one slotted head , would take longer to use than a Philishave. Philishave shavers shave faster because the slots on the heads catch the whiskers faster than the holes on foil shavers.

But wait , let me begin at the beginning. I used to have a full beard and moustache. When I began working in New York , I kept the beard trimmed , but it had its bad days. Then I shaved and had a moustache for a while. Pictures from that short era are truly bad. Then it fell victim to the razor. Meanwhile , my hair was over the ears and straight. I got it cut shorter as the 80s came on and then there was that hair gel. I blame Michael Douglas and Wall Street. So for a while , I actually bragged that I could comb my hair one morning , go about my day , sleep , and wake up with exactly the same do.

It works equally well on women and men and slows hair growth on legs , arms , face , upper lip , back shoulders , abdomen , underarms and bikini lines.

I already use Trumpers rose shave cream which works very well with this. If you take your time , after a hot bath or shower you wo n't be disappointed , I promise you. The shave makes your skin look super smooth and acts as a brilliant exfoliator. I ca n't see why people are so negative about cutting their face. I have used this with care for a couple of weeks now and have n't cut myself once.

First , if your hair is longer than whiskers ( on any of the place mentioned above ) then get yourself some clippers and trim yourself up before trying to shave. It will make it easier and allow more shaves out of your razor blade. Second , make sure to use some sort of good shave cream or shaving soap. It helps soften the hair and makes it a lot easier to shave. After you shave , you guessed it , moisturize ! Why ? because remember those layers of skin we just talked about ? You just took part of that first layer of protection off with a sharp instrument ! It also helps to reduce itching and shaving bumps ( ingrown hairs ) . </shave.v.239><shave.v.240> I remember that well because my son was 4 years old , and he asked me how I looked without a beard , continued the principal.

They can damage the skin as well as allow for the penetration of viruses and bacteria into the skin. For example , warts seem to start from injured or broken skin. Common warts usually grow where skin has been irritated or shaved , such as where fingernails are bitten or hangnails pulled. In adults , warts tend to grow where hair removal procedures have damaged the skin. This is the beard area on men and the legs on women. The other concerns for many are bumps after shaving , which can also be reduced by caring for the skin properly . </shave.v.242><shave.v.243>A good investment for anyone shaving their head is a fogless shower mirror.

I do n't understand all the comments about nicks and cuts , I used it on the closest setting ( by accident ) from the first shave and did n't get nicked for three days - and then because I was rushing like mad !

Hair removal has no real benefit at all other than society finds it more attractive. Nothing in the human body is without a purpose. Yes , there are things , like body hair , appendix , gall bladder , that we can do without but there IS a reason we have them in the first place. If Mo'Nique chooses not to subject herself to hair removal then more power to her. Personally , I absolutely HATE having to shave.

I have been using it for 10 weeks and my underarm hair has been reduced by about 50 . I would say about 30-40 on my legs. It does not work well on bumpy places like knees. I have burned myself with it a few times on my knees. I have noticed that it does slow the hair growth down a lot. I use to shave everyday and now it takes about 3 days to get enough hair growth to merit a shave. I would recommend it if you are patient and commited to using it for months to get great results. Also the booklet it comes with says not to use it on the face. I got several burns on my knees and I think it would be hard to use to on the upper lip or chin and you would probably get burns because of all the angles on the face . </shave.v.253><shave.v.254>I have a dark and heavy beard , and thanks to my ancestory , I 'm also blessed with frequent ingrown whiskers.

So the pressure to shave pubic hair appears as a strange porn-inspired kind of trend to me , because I remember when it wasn ' t a mainstream trend at all.

The tagline said something like " See , much better. " That pissed me off so much. To pluck Frieda 's paiting of herself as she wanted to be portrayed , it 's way worse than just manipulating a photograph of her. Is nothing sacred ? Frieda could have shaved , but she did n't feel the need to. They were acting as if she came from some society where razors did n't exist.

Once you are dripping , don ' t towel off using the moisture from the water beneath your lather will help you get good coverage and assure that the gel or lather will adhere nicely to your facial fur. Be sure to lather up thoroughly in all areas of your face you want to shear. If you want a really relaxing and thorough experience , using a shaving brush to work the lather in will help to get those follicles standing on end.

The toner helps to protect you against cell damage. It helps eliminate dirt and grime while balancing out your mug. Next , I am going to talk to you about double wire stand. Now , you may ask what is a double wire stand. Well , double wire stand holds the brush , the shave brush , and the razor. Most guys when they 're finished shaving , take their razor , throw it to the side of the sink. What that does , it basically exposes your blades to all sorts of dirt , grime , build up , cleaning products , old soap whatever. Then , the next day when you are using it on your face , it 's definitely going to break you out or create some sort of irritation . </shave.v.284><shave.v.285>Does your daily shaving routine feel like a slap in the face ?

" I 've never heard of these awards , but I 'm hoping they are somehow hair-related; otherwise it would be odd for him to list them on his card. Apparently , they justify charging $ 40 , plus tip , for a shave . </shave.v.287><shave.v.288>" Yes , twin-edged razors take some getting used to.

The shorelands will quake when your seamen cry out. All who handle the oars will abandon their ships; the mariners and all the seamen will stand on the shore. They will raise their voice and cry bitterly over you; they will sprinkle dust on their heads and roll in ashes. They will shave their heads because of you and will put on sackcloth.

But , for men who do not have clotting issues , medication-induced or otherwise , try using either a shaving cream called Coochie ( found online and at some adult product stores ) or better still , save your money to buy a heavy-duty conditioner like one you would use after shampooing your hair.

When I started getting better shaves with brushes and good creams , she ported them over to her gams and did her own research into the matter. Some things she found : a shaving brush isn ' t really needed for a woman ' s legs , and a single-blade DE or Injector razor takes ages to shave a pair of legs with and doesn ' t really give better gamshave than a good twin-blade. But she did find that the better creams ( her favorite is Cremo Cream ) really did protect her skin better and let her shave more closely and comfortably without nicks. Fortunately for Cremo , she ' s not as bothered by the pansy-ass Pina Colada scent as I am ( memo to Cremo : when you come out with a shaving cream that smells like bacon , or Dogfish Head 120 Minute , or ( dare I dream ? ) both of them as you chew a huge mouthful of beer and bacon , do a brother a solid and tweet me . ) </shave.v.313><shave.v.314>I do not totally remember how I started.

The rude comments stopped. I got one bad side effect. I got some hair growing in the wrong places , and have had to shave a lot , really hate that , but hated the wasted body worse.

Your first few shaves with Feathers are amazing because your chin feels absolutely hairless , like a cue ball. But you ' re also left with a lot more nicks and blood than usual , and that tingly feeling you feel for the rest of the day isn ' t the mark of a great shave. It ' s your skin telling you to back off , you overheated geek , you shaved off too much skin along with your whiskers.

After reading the other reviews for the Norelco 1050cc Arcitec , I decided I had nothing to lose. First , the shave is FANTASTIC. No more than 3 minutes gets me a fantastic shave. Second , the head design is much more flexible which makes it easier to follow the natural curves of your face. Third , the ability to wet the heads ( lightly dampen them ) and shave makes for an unbelievably smooth shaving experience. Norelco , my skin thanks you.

He then ordered Baazaan , who was his governor main , and under whose governorship they considered all the Arab lands to be , to have this person - Rasulullah arrested and brought to his court. Complying , Baazaan dispatched a group of army officers under the leadership of Khar Khusru. To study and investigate the conditions of Muhammad an additional officer by the name of Baanuyah accompanied them. When these two officers appeared in the presence of Rasulullah , they began to tremble and shiver due to the overbearing spiritual character of Nabi .

I hope you 've been reading the survey page results from past months , including last month 's brand preferences and this month 's brand preference broken down by product lines. The latest thing in foil shavers I noticed is that they add slotted heads to straighten whiskers before cutting. The Remington MicroScreen 3 TCT is one example. With my current shaver , the Philishave ( Norelco ) Quadra Action , I 've learned it 's better to use both circular and back and forth motions for more effective shaving. Shaving with foil shavers typically would be with a back and forth motion. For a more comfortable shave , do n't press down too heavily while shaving.

I 've been shaving in the shower with manual Gillette Atra razors for years. I figured I 'll try an electric razor again and see if it really is more convenient. I looked at the two most popular razors. First I purchased the Panasonic 8000 series and went through the facial break-in period. True , it did consistently give me a close shave , but not without more passes than a manual razor. I found that I had to use it in a circular motion to get the closest shave , and the screen razor is just not designed for that. Like you said in a previous comment , getting neck hairs on with a screen razor can be difficult. I found myself having to use the trimmer often to take a first crack at neck hairs before using the razor head.

It 's a shame , as it was the best shaver I have ever used. Anyway , I swapped the last shaver for the Philishave Coolskin. It 's not very comfortable. The Quadra Action is far superior. Do you ( or anyone else ) know if the heads are interchangeable ?

There are several theories as to why the military began shaving beards. When World War I broke out in the 1910s , the use of chemical weapons necessitated that soldiers shave their beards so that gas masks could seal over their faces. The enlistment of military recruits for World War I in 1914 precipitated a major migration of men from rural to urban locales. This was the largest such migration that had ever occurred in the United States up to that time. The sudden concentration of recruits in crowded army induction centers brought with it disease , including head lice. Remedial action was taken by immediately shaving the faces and cutting the hair of all inductees upon their arrival . </shave.v.398><shave.v.399>DW : Preparation is the key to a perfect shave.

A few guys have already shaved their heads , and they , along with several others who plan to follow suit , are laying one hell of a guilt trip on the rest of us to shave our heads , too. I have absolutely no desire to do so , and while several others on staff say they do n't want to , the guilt trip is working , and none of them wants to risk offending the co-worker when he returns.

You put in a new blade and experience the silky smoothness of shave 1. Your inamorata comes along and thoughtlessly scrapes her gams with the selfsame razor , using up the equivalent of shaves 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5. The next morning you pick up the razor expecting shave 3 and instead what you get is the equivalent of shave 6. Being psychologically unprepared , you gouge divots out of your face , straining the bonds of affection and causing you to wonder whether this relationship is really worth it.

On the seventh day of his purification he shaves off the hair of his head. On the eighth day , he brings the sacrifices of a Nazir who becomes Tamei and begins counting anew the days of Nezirus that he accepted upon himself. The sacrifices he brings are two Torim ( turtledoves ) or two Benei Yonah ( young common doves ) , one as a Chatas and one as an Olah. He must also bring a yearling sheep as an Asham.

My parcel came ( simple joy arrives in small packages for me ) , I set up the new environment and I gave it a shot. Absolutely incredible. Besides being a much better shave for my face , it ' s a wonderfully relaxing experience - almost spa-like. I definitely recommend the bargain Proraso shaving soap ( it came highly recommended to me , and I can see why - the Eucalyptus oil and Menthol provide awesome tactile and aromatic sensations ) . The act of shaving is , in fact , completely different with a safety razor because rather than jamming a cartridge razor ( I ' m a Mach 3 convert ) against my face and dragging , the razor is weighted and meant to glide ( much on its own ) over the skin , taking your beard with it. I had no irritation , bumps , burning , or dryness and much fewer nicks than even I had imagined . </shave.v.441><shave.v.442>Apply pre-whipped lather to face in a light , circular or back and forth motion as lather is further created by aeration on the skin. Another method when using shaving cream is to simply apply to the wetted bristle tips , brush a pre-layer over face and then start with the semi-vigorous brush action to create lather directly on the shaving area. Dip tips in more water as needed and continue the lather action. You can control the amount of lather created by how much moisture is left in the bristles when applying the soap or cream and the scrubbing action on the shaving area. The faster you create lather the warmer it is. The lather application does not need to be dense to provide a great shave. Badger bristles generate better lather when more moisture is left in the bristles , however neither boar nor badger hair should be dripping with water. Use a slow , light touch with the razor as you let it glide over the prepared shaving area . </shave.v.442><shave.v.443>I would love to invest money to try the 4 Elements of the Perfect Save by Art Of Shaving.

I do n't think it makes them more able to withstand hot summer days here in Virginia. Heat tolerance is a complicated thing -- to me it has more to do with fitness , acclimation , general health and common sense. I like to leave a coat to do what it does best , like hold in temperature , shield from direct sun , and when wet , help cool a body by evaporation. Dogs do n't sweat , we all know that.

A machine made shaving brush is garbage. The shaver who purchases a machine made shaving brush will always regret having done so. Having dissected numerous shaving brushes over the years , all acquired from a broadest range of producers , I can attest to the vast and important differences between the two types. At the same time , it is not surprising that nearly all brushes are machine turned. The creation of the hand made shaving brush is a difficult and tiring undertaking. Tying knots causes the joints to ache; specific errors of construction are never revealed until the entire brush in completed. When done properly , it is impossible for one person to accurately tie more than a few brush knots in a single day. Ultimately , any attempt to automate the process of brush making is pointless. Even the best machined brush is little more than a cosmetic tool. It is for this reason that brush manufacturers today load their brushes with standard knots , pre-made in China . </shave.v.462><shave.v.463>" I am a Muslim and I know that no one can force me to shave or not to shave.

By tearing up against the grain at any time , the hair will drop beneath the skin 's surface thereby making the pore susceptible to bacteria , pollution and irritation from shirt collars. Tiny crusts will form forcing the beard hair to exit from underneath. Now we have acute directional growth and a huge potential for coiling , hence a thick beard and/or ingrown hairs.

Actually waxing is VERY common for backs , not just body builders ( acording to the person that did me ) . So you might consider back waxing and shaving the other parts ... Whole body shaving takes about 15 minutes every third day ( once you become proficient ) but anyone you rub against the second day will not care for the prickly feeling. If the shave is just a one shot ... you 'll be uncomforably itchy for about 5 days during the grow back . </shave.v.473><shave.v.474>In several Ahaadith already quoted we see that to shave the beard is the way ( common ritual ) of the Mushrikeen. And in just as many Ahaadith we have been taught be different and oppose their ways and ritual practices. A very important. matter to which attention must be drawn here is that many regard shaving the beard as wrong and therefore they do not shave. They do not however regard shortening the beard as equally incorrect and indulge in this wrong act. Just as the Shari'ah commands the growing of the beard , so to does it prescribe the length to which it has to be grown. Therefore to grow a beard other than that which is specified is also incorrect. The Shari'ah has commanded that the length of the beard should be one fist full , when held from below the chin. According to the consensus of the Ulama it is not permissible to have a beard shorter than this. They do differ on whether a beard which is longer than required , should be shortened to this fixed length or not . </shave.v.474><shave.v.475>Do you all normally shave " down there " before birth ?

I have ordered myself a straight razor or throat cutter as they are sometimes called and have used them before. As to not having my shaving gel ( which is a gross waste of plastic , aluminum , and butane ) I 'm fine with that but instead of heating the cream I just use a hot washrag applied to my face before I shave which works great for loosening my pores and facial hair.

This close a shave usually lets me go 2-3 days before my next one. I replace my Fusion blades at about 8 months ( about 100 shaves ) when the white stripe is almost worn off in some spots. I rinse and shake dry my blades , leaving the in the bathroom without any other treatment in a fairly dry climate . </shave.v.495><shave.v.496>Second , get up a bit earlier so that you have time to do the job properly.

This means that you need about 7 treatments ( spaced out ) to see a significant difference. So , it does take time. But you DO see a great difference. I considered myself pretty hairy before and now I have very ''normal'' looking arms , and legs that need shaving only now and again. If I do n't shave , you can really only see the remaining fine hairs if you take a good look. ( The hairs that remain after laser hair removal are only the most light/most fine hairs ) . </shave.v.497><shave.v.498>&gt; I saw your e-mail on the Electric Shaver Page. I recently purchased a Panasonic 8068 and I love it so far. It gives the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had - and I have a very heavy beard. I have one question about charging the shaver. Should I leave it plugged in all the time or let the battery run down to 20 and recharge.

On the second pass , All of the above against the grain Prior to shaving I use : " Shaving Secret " Oil , very inexpensive at Wal Mart store lasts six months at least , then apply the shaving cream lather. The shave is much closer than the Mach III that way and I am not cutting myself ( Except when I start to hurry ) .

They ' re more common along the bikini line than on the legs or underarms , and these painful lesions can lead to scarring , so it ' s important to try to prevent them from occurring in the first place. An ingrown hair is caused by a hair curling back into the skin after it ' s shaved off or growing back sideways. This can lead to a localized infection that looks like either a red bump or a whitehead that appears to be a pimple. To prevent ingrown hairs , use a gentle scrub before you shave to get the hairs pointing in the right direction . </shave.v.510><shave.v.511>Acne &amp;Shaving Use the right razor. If you can , use an electric razor. The shave won ' t be as close , but you probably won ' t break out. If you prefer blade shaving , use a new single-blade razor each time you shave. Why single ? Double-and triple-edged blades lift the hair out of the follicle for a shave that is actually below the epidermis. As part of the skin ' s natural healing process , the epidermis grows over the opening of the follicle. Then , as the hair grows back , it has to fight to get out of the closed follicle causing an inflammatory response . </shave.v.511><shave.v.512>Poodles and schnauzers are not double coated breeds , they have hair not fur. This is what you can shave any hybrid poodle mix or spaniel and most terriers. As a groomer and from experience , I know first hand shaving a double coated dog is and can be very harmful to there well being. Even if you shave them once and nothing happens , shaving any TRUE double coated breed it increases shedding , can cause heat stroke , skin condition , hair loss or the hair not growing back , and other majorhealth issues. If you do n't want shedding then dint get a dog that sheds get a non-shedding breed. If you 're worried they 'll be too hott , do n't ! It 's there natural insulation and protection. Just give them water and a shady or cool place to stay. Shave them can actually over heat them. : ) Amanda , San diego , CA </shave.v.512><shave.v.513>I shave my legs too and have never regretted it.

Even if you are happy with your razor , the Panasonic used in addition will provide an even closer shave than the razor alone. My only problem with the Panasonic is that if you let your beard grow for a few days and then try the Panasonic alone , it can be irritating and sometimes even ineffective.

As for shaving under the eyes on terriers , that is incorrect ... often what the clients want when they ask for this is LONGER hair which because it lays flatter , looks shaved to them. Shorter hair has a tendency to stick up in front of the eyes , thus looking longer. If this area is NEVER shaved it will lay flat &amp;not cover the eyes at all. Correct eye brows on a Schnauzer do not block the eye either , but rather expose it with the length being all in the center of the nose and not over the eye or on the sides which should be scissored close to the face . </shave.v.525><shave.v.526>How It Works : Using a razor , the tip of the hair shaft that has grown out through the skin is cut off.

Some experts do not recommend automatic re-excision for basal cell carcinomas because of the superficial nature of these tumors. The electrosurgical shave excision technique also removes additional cells from the wound base , and this may prevent recurrence when the margin of the initial shave excision specimen margin is positive. Results from several studies have demonstrated that re-excision of basal cell carcinoma specimens with positive margins produces a high frequency of second specimens that have negative margins for malignancy.

Are you wearing any type of face gear or sweating more than usual at basic training ? Sweat can irritate freshly shaven skin , especially if you are wearing face gear that can trap oil and dirt into the skin. Try shaving at night.

By that reasoning , by the time I kick the bucket , I should be shaving with a razor that is actually larger than my head , containing some eight or nine blades , all pulling , pushing , shoving , ripping , teasing , cavorting , and eventually getting around to the actual business of cutting my beard hair. I will need mechanical assistance to hold the thing up , and my shave will be smooth to a level of precision only found in the finest optical glass , such as is today found only in the Hubble Space Telescope 's mirror.

The best way to avoid this is to shave when the skin is warm and the hair totally wet , like after a shower.

I find that shaving in the shower is helpful. The hot steam makes shaving that much better. I have often thought about going with the classic shave with the old brush and suds on the face. I actually have my Dad ' s old double sided razor that he carried in WW2 !

It is a razor ! It is no different from a Mach3 , a Fusion , or a BIC disposable. If you have spots or a rash , you will cut the top off and bleed. If you have smooth skin as long as you do not slide the blade from side to side you should not see blood. So my review is simple , TAKE YOUR TIME ( women take their time to get ready in a morning ! so why do we try to do it all in a second just to kick our heels waiting for them ? ) make shaving a real job not a chore. Use the right shaving oil or foam for your skin , always try to shave in or just after a shower , warm up the skin to open the pores. Change the blade when it is blunt. After shaving use a moisturiser that suits your skin. It is not rocket science , but it is your face. Take your time , give shaving the time it deserves and you will reap the benefit regardless of what blade you use.

As the stated reason for growing the beard is to be different from the non-believers , it is similar to the matter of dyeing gray hair in order to be distinct from the Jews and Christians; it is known that some of the Companions of the Prophet did not dye their gray hair , signifying that it was commendable rather than obligatory. Similarly , growing the beard may be regarded as commendable but not obligatory , and , accordingly , shaving it would be classified as Makruh rather than Haram. It is true that none of the Companions was known to have shaved his beard. Perhaps there was no need to shave , and perhaps growing the beard was a custom among them.

Any organic oil suitable for skin can be used but be sure to avoid oils that have been combined with the following ingredients known to be carcinogenic : cyclomethicone , laureth-4 or tBHQ . </shave.v.644><shave.v.645>The Beatles , notably John Lennon ( see Abbey Road cover ) , George Harrison , Paul McCartney ( during the sessions for Let It Be ) , and Ringo Starr who also had a beard during Abbey Road and through till the present , sported full beards in the last days of the band.

This tainted the " upper hairs " , for their energies of constriction and limitation were to be the channel only for exclusive belief in HaShem. Since the Levites were strongly connected to the constricting energies of the " upper hairs " , they were able to maintain their focus solely on HaShem and remain loyal to Him. Therefore , the Levites were the only ones who did not sin with the Golden Calf and , in fact , they helped Moshe to destroy it. However , the sin of the Golden Calf severely damaged and polluted the holy constricting energies of the " upper hairs " . As a rectification , since the Levites ' spiritual essence is integrally related to the " upper hairs " , when they were sanctified to serve in the Tabernacle and assist the kohanim ( priests ) , they were commanded by Hashem to shave off all of the hairs of their bodies . </shave.v.649><shave.v.650>Definitively got my parents to allow me to shave.

I was even more skeptical when I read the directions and saw how little of the product to use. What normally for me turns into a ritual of cuts and irritation was actually a fast , close and utterly irritation free shave. Hours after shaving I still have not even a bit of irritation . </shave.v.655><shave.v.656>Here 's how it works : An average man spends 3 , 350 hours shaving , according to Remington.

Some will use an alum block. They say that it will tell them how good the shave was. I guess the eventual nicks and stubble spots are n't enough proof of a crappy shave. Your skin has to suffer even more from the burning inflicted by the alum block to convince you that your shave sucked. Joking aside , an alum bloc is a very good way of closing the pores and sanitizing your freshly shaved face. Next , you can apply the -- sometimes extremely expensive -- balm or aftershave splash. I would n't use aftershaves that are very heavy on cologne and alcohol ( some alcohol is OK though ) . This for the simple reason that it will dry and harm your skin . </shave.v.659><shave.v.660>One method is to shave with a new single-edge blade in the direction of hair growth. Do not repeatedly go over the same area in a back and forth motion in an effort to get a closer shave. If the preferred shaving method involves an electric razor , try a traditional barber ' s trimmer , called a T-edger or liner , which gives a closer , more precise shave that larger clippers. Avoid rotary shavers that cut beard hair at different angles , seriously compounding the problem. The skin should never be stretched to obtain a closer shave. When the skin bounces back , newly shaved hair will be situated , and later trapped , below the skin line. The same principal applies to twin , triple and five-blade razors; the first blade stretches the skin , while the second ( third , fourth and fifth ) blade shave way too close . </shave.v.660><shave.v.661>That new hair in the bikini line versus underwear pinch. ...

You shave every morning , and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side , until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw , it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my m tier , and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us.

You are right it takes a lot of work. Some of the downsides include nicks and cuts , bumps , razor burn , ingrown hairs and itchiness. Perhaps you might want to look at the reasons you feel compelled to do this , as hair around the genitals is something that every person who has been through puberty has to some degree. You mentioned an upcoming doctors appointment ... Do you feel a little embarrassed because of the hair ?

Do not , despite what your father told you , apply cologne or after shave to your face at this time as they have high concentrations of alcohol in their formulas. Yes , there is a reason why it stings , particularly on open pores , as this habit will result in the drying and aging of your skin.

I ' m sure this can work for some , probably those with lighter color hair . </shave.v.705><shave.v.706>Solution : Your skin is constantly losing moisture at a rapid rate resulting in dryness and itching. Also shaving strips more moisture as one uses hot water when shaving one s face. Use lukewarm and not hot water when you shave. Soap-free foams or gels or foams or gels with moisturising agents minimise the damage.

It is a natural hair wig that is hand tied and I hope that after wearing it for a while it will feel like my own hair. I am still shaving my head on Wednesday at my Salon in Red Wing with my favorite stylist and some great backround music.

The Extra Sensitive ( XS ) trimming comb is specially designed for the groin area and underarms , while the Extra Large ( XL ) trimming comb works best in large areas like the chest and abs , legs , back and shoulders. You can also choose from five lock-in length settings for trimming without completely removing hair. When you 're done , the attachments simply rinse clean for easy care.

I was walking down St. James Street in London ( a swanky area we were just cutting through on our way somewhere else ) when I noticed an entire display of beautful old-school shaving gear in a shop window. I swear that the clouds parted and God himself spoke to me. I had stumbled upon Truefitt &amp;Hill , home of the Guiness-certified oldest barbershop in the world. Their tagline is grooming men for greatness. Truefitt &amp;Hill claims that its barbers have given shaves to Sir Winston Churchill , John Wayne , Charles Dickens , Fred Astaire , Cary Grant , Alfred Hitchcock , and Danny Kaye.

Well I can deal with the shaving , but I 'm tired of the black marks. I have long hair and sometimes I would like to wear my hair up , but because of the black marks on my neck I am insecure. Can anyone tell me what I need to do to get rid of theses marks ? I 've read some blogs about acne , but it 's not acne. I am so confused. I have started using peroxide and baking soda yesterday.

Personally I use an original 1920s Gem Safety Razor. I found it at an antique shop for $ 20. The Gem Company still makes the blades too ! So the trick to a good shave ! If you have time , most men don ' t. Run a wash cloth under hot water , steaming hot , the hotter the better. Then place this hot wash coth on your face , the heat will draw out the hairs a bit. Then shave with a single blade. Multiple blades foul too easy , causing cuts. Perferable a safety razor ! When rinsing your blade use cold water. If you rinse with hot water it make the metal expand , causing cuts. Simple as that .oh , one other thing. What if you cut yourself ? Thats why you always shave before a shower. The heat from the shower will stop the bleeding and it makes for easy clean up. Good luck gentlemen ! </shave.v.736><shave.v.737>Oh , and for some extra fun , once you know how to shave fairly well with a straight razor , you can grab nearly any sharp blade and give yourself a decent shave.

A little hot , steamy water will help to soften the hair and skin , making it easier to shave. Again , shaving cream helps.

You are going either with the grain that means with the direction of hair growth. That is what we advice you do first and after your done going with the grain then if your skin allows and it is prepared for it is used to going close then you go against the grain. So you see how easy it is with shave oil.

[ 10 ] Why has a high priest [ to cut his hair ] on the eve of every Sabbath ? R. Samuel b. Isaac said : Because the Mishmar changes every week. Whence can it be adduced that an ordinary priest [ must cut his hair ] once in thirty days ? It is to be adduced from the analogous use of the word pera ' in connection with the Nazirite [ and the priests ] . Of the priests [ it is written ] , Neither shall they shave their heads , ' nor suffer their locks [ pera ' ] to grow long; [ 11 ] and of the Nazirite it is written , He shall be holy. he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long [ pera ' ]; [ 12 ] as in the case of the Nazirite the period of growing his hair is thirty days so too must it be in the case of the ordinary priest . </shave.v.746><shave.v.747>If you just don ' t feel like you ' re going to get a close shave without a cream , they have an All Natural Shaving cream for you.

So far , I have had laser hair reduction on my underarms. I started in January 2009 and had an appointment about every six weeks to follow the natural hair growth cycle. So far I think I 've had seven treatments on my underarms , and there are only a few noticeable hairs left growing under each arm. I may have one or two more treatments just because I 'm perfectionistic. The important part is that I do n't need to shave my underarms anymore , and have n't in months. This is great because I do n't spend as much money on shaving razors , and my sensitive underarm skin does n't get irritated anymore. I also save time and energy not having to worry about my underarms. Overall , I spent about $ 750 on these treatments , and though expensive , I think laser hair reduction is worth its cost. Not having to even think about shaving gives me great peace of mind . </shave.v.750><shave.v.751>Bikini Kitty recommends using the spray on day one to exfoliate , the brush and spray on day two to soften and on day three shave. If you don ' t have three days to wait use the body brush before your shower or bath on the targeted shave areas. Then shower and bath accordingly. Don ' t shave until the end. That way your skin is warm and the hair has been softened. Then you apply the shave gel to you and the razor oil to your razor , then shave away.

I would think that the mineral buildup would occur over time. I give my shaver ( a Philishave rotary ) a through cleaning every month or so using an electrosonic head cleaner designed for this shaver which I got a few years ago. I believe that mineral buildup is more of an issue with a wet/dry shaver which gets more frequent contact with water.

To randomly input number combinations ( following the Visa or MasterCard standard prefixes ) for on-line store purchases wo n't work unless there is a name associated with that number. Do n't merchants ' Web sites automatically freeze failed attempts beyond the third consecutive one , as well ? I 'm not " buying " how culprits devise working credit-card numbers via experimentation. I think one has to purchase valid numbers from illegal lists sold , or write down those from a valid card ( along with the cardholder 's name ) that one might have the opportunity to see first hand. Again , with the shaved numbers and cut-n-paste story , the NAME on the card has a huge role to play , has it not ? Is the cardholder 's name not important for the purchase , along with the number ? Why bother signing for the purchase ( over $ 25 ) , if it is n't important at all ? </shave.v.789><shave.v.790>Once ingrown hairs have been nudged free , consider using alternative methods of hair removal if shaving continues to cause problems. You can either opt for an electric razor to control how closely you shave or you can try waxing or chemical depilatories. For a more permanent method of hair removal , consult your doctor about the use of laser technology . </shave.v.790><shave.v.791>The Chest ... If you have never shaved your chest before and have a thick growth , start by taking a look in the mirror and trimming your hair close to the skin , you can do that one of two ways 1 ) a scissors , or 2 ) a buzzer. Then get in the shower and let warm to hot water run on you for a few minutes. Lather up , wash normally and rinse. Then step out of the water stream and put shaving cream on your chest. Take a clean , sharp new razor ( I use the Gillette Sensor razor with the pivoting head ) and shave your chest , slowly and carefully avoiding the nipple area. Nothing is worse then knicking a nipple. Now , the question is do you shave with the hair growth or against it. I personally shave against the growth for a closer shave but , everyone 's hair texture and skin is different so experiment. Rinse the razor constantly to keep the blades unclogged , and reapply the shaving cream as often as you need to. NOTE : it is not necessary to bathe in the shaving cream , that too will clog the razor , just apply enough to cover the skin and lubricate the razor . </shave.v.791><shave.v.792>The greatest tip I can offer is to try and treat shaving like a hobby , not a chore.

I tried several razors and found that this one worked the best , especially with the power turned on. " With the grain " generally means in a downward direction. Start with your sideburns , then your cheeks , then your neck , then the area around your mouth and chin. Take smooth strokes -- long strokes on big open areas like your cheeks , short strokes for small areas like your chin. Rinse off the blade after every stroke or two with warm water . </shave.v.797><shave.v.798>Gillette ' s new ad campaign is probably one of the worst campaigns I ' ve seen in a long time , due to content and message.

It works with the softening your beard undergoes in a nice hot shower , and further prepares your whiskers for the blade. When you are still learning the touch of a straight razor after growing up shaving with cartridge razors , it can make all the difference between turning your face to something resembling ground hamburger , and getting a passable shave out of it . </shave.v.799><shave.v.800>I had mine shaved by a local upholstery shop.

" - Terry Millar </shave.v.806><shave.v.807>For looks , your best bet is to just shave in the direction the hair grows. It feels a lot smoother if you go both ways , but you 'll have more trouble with possible ingrown hairs. It 's worth a try when your skin gets used to shaving , though. Definitely use a new razor - it will cut whereas a dull razor will tug a bit at the hair before cutting and that will cause irritation. A soak in the tub for a bit before the first time or if it 's been a while will soften the hairs and make things easier. It 's also easier to get a good view of things if you 're already lying on your back . </shave.v.807><shave.v.808>But Mirick says McGrath 's study has major limitations.

I would however advise anyone with spotty or problem skin to take caution as the blades are incredibly sharp and will not move over bumps or spots.

When I was finally able to locate a closeup photo of an ES8003 shaver on one of the shaver shop web site , I noticed that there were no lift strips on the edge of the shaver. The lift strips are intended to lift up either flat or curly whiskers before cutting. Because the current Survey Page questions ask favourite and least favourite shavers broken down by product line , I used that as my guide as to which is better. Of the 13 people who mentioned a Panasonic shaver as their favourite , nine of them or 69 of responses preferred an 8000 series shaver while only one preferred an 800 series shaver. Of the nine people who had their worst experience with a Panasonic shaver , five of those hated the 8000 series and no one hated an 8000 series shaver. I could see no obvious difference between the shaving action of the two product lines. From all those people who liked the 8000 series , that would be the slight choice in my book if there was no price difference.

Protection of one 's life , safety , livelihood , and religion all qualify as such , and in some countries military service is unavoidable except at unbearably high personal cost.

I have found that the oil tends to degrade the performance of a shaving brush over time and unless you shampoo the brush frequently , it really can get fouled up.

Recently my uncle ( who shaves with a 30-year old electric shaver , a Schick perhaps ) gave me a Remington Microscreen 2 , corded , that he kept as a spare. To my surprise , I like it better than the more " high-end " brands. I 've only been using it for about 10 days , but so far it gives a decent shave without a lot of irritation.

Women are not allowed to shave ( with a razor ) any Jewish man 's beard or peyot , i.e. side locks ( Ibid. ) . According to some authorities , men are permitted to trim or completely shave their beard with either a scissors or an electric shaver that employs a scissor-like cutting mechanism ( Ibid. 181 : 3 , 10 and Har Tzvi , Y.D. 143 ) .

If you are such a purist or have such concern with the animal rights , you would n't wear a wool sweater , you would n't wear leather shoes , you would n't drink milk , you would be against killing cows for meat or whatever. Then obviously a badger hairbrush is not for you. But there is no cruelty to the animals. They basically get shaved.

I shave my pubicPubic lice area and bottom so I no that it is no big deal. you will be fine , just put some lotion or cream on it . </shave.v.926><shave.v.927>Deb , congratulations and my full support. it sounds like it is all about the look for you , which is very understandable. When you shave it all off completely , try to enjoy the feel , the convenience , the freedom , the taking of matters into your own hands , and take your confidence from that and the joy of good looking a clean bald head. And if it would ever fall off , no big deal. Just smile and be confident , knowing many men would find you attractive without your wig. All the best . </shave.v.927><shave.v.928>Although I pledged to avoid the widget this year , I am failing -- for the widget 's size belies its magnetic pull. As soon as I addressed that male shaving quandary , women -- and men who shave outside the beard region , and men who love women who hate to shave , and so on -- wrote in by the pound asking your selfsame questions . </shave.v.928><shave.v.929>SHAVING has always been a pain for Adrienne Cohen. She ' s a make-up artist working in the film industry and developed her own product that prevents ingrown hairs ( and the nasty bumps that go with them ) because she found there was nothing available for use by the men she kept on having to tell to shave daily for continuity purposes. She now exports her own product , Fino , to Canada and Mauritius and is in negotiations with a distributor in the UK . </shave.v.929><shave.v.930>I 've always hated shaving too. Until the day I tried my husband 's Schick Extreme triple blade razor in the shower. So fast , so smooth , so painless and easy. Now I shave all the time . </shave.v.930><shave.v.931>It is evident from the words of this Hadith that some Muslims of the Ansar were following the People of the Book in some of their practices thinking that they were obligatory. Besides other things , they thought that it was necessary to lengthen the moustache and shave off the beard. The Prophet ( sws ) told them that this was no religious directive. On the contrary , this was a religious innovation; so if they wanted , they could lengthen their beards and clip their moustache instead. Similarly , refraining from dyeing one ' s hair was no religious requirement. If they wanted they could dye their hair as well. In other words , this Hadith is not asking men to grow beards; it is merely saying that keeping beards and clipping moustaches is not a condemned religious practice as certain people are contending. It is perfectly allowed in Islam. So , just as dyeing hair , wearing socks and shoes while praying have not become necessary directives as per this Hadith , keeping a beard as an obligatory directive can not be deduced from it as well . </shave.v.931><shave.v.932>Shave after shower , use a in shower face cleanser like King of Shaves. Warm towel on face , apply with brush direct to face ( Prorasso in between is nice ) shave slowly holdling lightly and clean razor in running water after each stroke. It ' s simple . </shave.v.932><shave.v.933>Yeah , I ' m 16 , and a girl. I ' ve never shaved my legs , and don ' t plan on it , it ' s too time-consuming. The hair on my legs is pretty darn thin , and I wear a skirt once a month , so I just use a pair of $ 0.33 knee-highs if necessary. I ' ve used the same pair for the last year. I wear shorts nearly year-round , but I ' m friends with a lot of guys , and none of them have ever mentioned anything ( even my boyfriend , who I ' ve been dating a year ) . Underarms , I use my dollar tree conditioner , and 5/ $ 3.00 razors which I replace about four times a year. I use dollar tree cshampoo as well , and go through 6 bottles a year. So between shaving , and washing my hair , I use all of about $ 5 a year. You got ta admit , that ' s pretty frugal . </shave.v.933><shave.v.934>In urban circles of Western Europe and the Americas , beards were out of fashion after the early 17th century; to such an extent that , in 1698 , Peter the Great of Russia ordered men to shave off their beards , and in 1705 levied a tax on beards in order to bring Russian society more in line with contemporary Western Europe. [ 13 ] </shave.v.934><shave.v.935>its expensive starting out but you can find forums and get a quality razor and strop and lots more information. i have been doing this for a while now and its better , cheaper and relaxing. like Jon said done try to hone it yourself if your just learning how to shave you will ruin the edge of the blade. good luck to anyone wanting to learn how to do this. all i can say is take your time and dont get in a hurry ! </shave.v.935><shave.v.936>Among the Jews , as among most Oriental peoples , the beard was especially cherished as a symbol of virility; to cut off another man 's beard was an outrage ( 2 Samuel 10 : 4 ); to shave or to pluck one 's own beard was a sign of mourning ( Jeremiah 41 : 5; 48 : 37 ); to allow the beard to be defiled constituted a presumption of madness ( 1 Samuel 21 : 13 ) . Certain ceremonial cuttings of the beard which probably imitated pagan superstition were strictly forbidden ( Leviticus 14 : 9 ) . These usages which we learn from the Bible are confirmed by the testimony of monuments , both Egyptian and Assyrian , in which the Jews are invariably depicted as bearded. The Egyptians themselves commonly shaved , and we are told that Joseph , on being taken from his prison , was made to shave before appearing in the presence of the king ( Genesis 41 : 14 ) . </shave.v.936><shave.v.937>Rikku was so cute when we shaved her. At first , she fake sleeping then she kept on sitting ^-^. But , all in all , she did well. Enjoy </shave.v.937><shave.v.938>He was woken some time later and found that two of the women who had been at the party had shaved his hair off. He woke as they tilted his head to do the same to his eyebrows. He then went home. This was between 8 and 9 in the morning. He told the court that he was wearing a pair of dungarees , Blue Deer sandals and a brown T-shirt. When it was put to him that he had said grey to the police , he said it was the same thing in his mind . </shave.v.938><shave.v.939>In Garrett ' s beard feature , he reveals a fundamental mechanism for getting caught in the shaving trap. He and other high school students who are among the first to develop facial hair are frequently required to shave because of school dress codes. So they shave and the shaving habit easily becomes entrenched , almost automatically. What ' s more is that these early shavers set an example for those who develop facial hair later. So they may be more inclined to follow the trend and conform , even if it ' s after they are out of high school . </shave.v.939><shave.v.940>The context of the passage is explicitly defiling oneself for the dead. In this case the Kohanim are forbidden from various mourning practices. Not only are they forbidden from coming in contact with the dead bodies of their deceased friends ( vv.1ff. ) but they are also forbidden from defiling themselves by making bald spots on their heads , by shaving their beards , and by cutting their skin. We see here that three of the prohibitions found in Lev 19 and Dt 14 are repeated in Lev 21. In all three passages both the implicit and explicit contexts are that of mourning practices. Every ancient person knew that one cut one 's skin or shaved one 's head as an act of mourning and it was these acts of mourning that are being prohibited in Lev 19. While the mourning connotation of cutting flesh and shaving may not be obvious to the modern reader , we have seen that the Torah itself as well as the later prophets take it as a given that cutting one 's flesh and shaving one 's head are characteristic acts of mourning along with crying and wearing sackcloth . </shave.v.940><shave.v.941>haha , shaving , what a chore. To be fair electric razors do sort the problem of cutting yourself , although i find they ' re not as accurate as a wey shaver and miss important bits of hair. Unfortunately my facial hair is also rather sporadic , and therefore the idea of growing a beard is not at all suitable </shave.v.941><shave.v.942>I just got my head shaved down to a stubble. I look like a Tibetan monk. I keep grabbing a phantom ponytail and trying to tuck hair that does n't exist behind my ear. I can feel everything -- sunlight , breezes.

A few of my favorites tonight were Hurricane , Margarita , Fuzzy Navel , Ice Cream , Cotton Candy ... ok , so they 're all bloody amazing. I recommend a mix of Fuzzy Navel and Ice Cream ... delicious . </shave.v.943><shave.v.944>What about shaving cream ? Yet again , this is a personal preference. There are literally hundreds of shaving creams and soaps out there. They are just as varied as regular soap. Find one that you like and is right for you. Personally , I use a natural menthol shaving soap that I mix up with a shaving brush and almost boiling water. It gives a thick , rich , tingly , and relaxing shave . </shave.v.944><shave.v.945>I refuse to date people who shave ( underarms , legs , pubic region , etc. ) . I think it is absurd that any self/body-respecting woman would feel the need or take pleasure in removing her body hair ( almost of all of which is not usually seen anyway ) . I do n't mind that other people do , and I am in no way implying that women who do shave are in any way anti-feminist , but I think we all need to be aware of the sexist implications of shaving imposed and enforced by a patriarchal society . </shave.v.945><shave.v.946>I tried to shave my head and just broke a sturdy pair of scissors getting started.

Those who refused to comply were punished by having their beards shaved with a dull razor or plucked out with tweezers , and it is reported that " Peter gleefully did some of the shaving himself " ( Krumholz 8 ) . Nicolas I of Russia , as well as other rulers in history , ordered Jews to shave their beards ( Encyclopedia Judaica 358 ) . Americans have also suffered persecution for their beards. In 1830 , Joseph Palmer of Massachusetts was sentenced to one year of solitary confinement for resisting attempts by his fellow-citizens to shave him ( World of Knowledge 197 ) . </shave.v.949><shave.v.950>So here is the best method I 've found to shave your entire body hair quickly and fully. If done properly , this can be completely in about 15 minutes total and results in a perfect close shave. Most importantly , if done correctly you wo n't have the typical problem with those anoying " bumps " from in-grown hairs . </shave.v.950><shave.v.951>Shaving my head ( the result of numerous threats toward my gray and thinning recalcitrant head fringe , which did no good ) turned out to be harder than I had thought. Gillette tow-blade disposables work fing , and even uin the shower where you ca n't see -- can you see even OUT of the shower -- it works pretty well because you can shave with one hand and feel your progress with the other one. You still have to check in a mirror when you get out. I sometimes get a headaache when a cool breeze blows over me right after a shave , but it 's worth it. A Norelco works well on a flat surface , but it only makes contact at one very small point at one time ( No jokes , please. ) The only drawback is when I shave there is always a zit forming somewhere and is is naked , for all the world to see. I did think of renting out the back of my head ( where I ca n't see ) and tattooing Coca-Cola or something. It would call attention away from my zits.

I have been shaving with a razor for 8 years and this is my first electric.

Now , I find the Bic Plus razors work very well. I lather with shaving cream and being left handed , shave with my left hand and follow behind with my right hand to feel for missed spots. I never use a mirror to see the back of my head while shaving. I have become very good at this and very rarely miss a spot. Lots of people , men and women , ask how I shave my head.

About a month ago I noticed a sudden drop in performance - it started taking a lot longer to shave - so I put in a new set of cutters and microscreen. Normally I 'd expect a sharp improvement with new cutters/screens , but it did n't help at all. I used it with the new cutters/screens for a few weeks , and then there was another drop in performance. Now it is as if the cutters are worn out. It really grabs the beard , but does n't cut hardly at all. I 'll have to keep going over the same area. Normally the screens will wear out long before the cutters will. I 've never had the cutters wear out this much on this shaver even after over a year of use , much less just 2 weeks ! I tried a silicon lubercant spray today but it did n't help. But I noticed that when I ran it without the head sembly , the cutters randomly twitched around erratically , especially the middle one. Is that normal ? Any ideas what could be wrong ?

I have tried battery-operated electric shavers but they have never quite reached the grade. I have dark hair and strong bristles meaning that by lunchtime I look as if I have n't really shaved at all that day !

Obviously shaving can cause irritation , but nair has chemicals that help the hair come out easier , and if it gets inside , it could be dangerous.

Because of design differences between the Philishave/Norelco Quadra Action and Reflex Action models , I do n't think the heads are interchangeable. Philips does make a waterproof shaver with the Reflex Action heads , the Philishave Cool Skin ( called the Norelco Advantage in the USA ) . This is a wet/dry shaver as opposed to the Quadra Action models which are intended for dry shaving only. The only down side to the Cool Skin/Advantage is that the shaver only operates as a cordless. The Quadra Action is the first waterproof shaver designed to be plugged into a mains or power outlet.

Of course we care what others think ! Why else would we wear deodorant , bleach our teeth &amp;shave our legs ? The first step to stop feeling guilty is realizing that vanity is not a bad thing.

I have a large hand but find that holding the shaver is occasionally awkward. The Clean &amp;Charge unit takes up counter space ( about a 7 inch base x 10 inches high ) which could be a drawback to some users , plus it needs a convenient electric outlet. Nonetheless , I was blown away by the quality of the shave. Not only is the shave closer , but it appears to last longer ( i.e. , whiskers do n't grow out as fast ) . Comparatively speaking , I would rate the Syncro shave far superior to the rotary-there 's a magnitude of difference. As well , the speed of shave is noticeably shorter : I 'm at about 4 minutes ( plus ) without feeling rushed. Those comments are without using a preshave -- Braun does not recommend using a preshave.

That being the case , we 're going to start at the top and work our way down. Start by shaving the area directly above the penis , however high up it goes. In most people , hair in this area grows in many different directions , so give it several once-overs with the razor. Upon completion of each once-over , run your hand over the area in each direction , touching up with the razor wherever you feel or see hair and stubble. To get the area at the very base of the penis , push and hold your penis downwards between your legs. This creates a plane which makes shaving the area much easier.

The biggest misunderstanding here is that the forms themselves only make up half of the shaving process. The forms are designed to be a systematic reduction process that works efficiently without any regard to beard grain pattern. Learning to cut them gives you the ability to get the beard reduced to its lowest point without the guess work of grain shaving. This works very well to a point. Once you finish , you could leave your shave at that and achieve a well groomed look. But , to the touch there will still always be that last bit of small stubble that all wet shavers seek to eliminate. Personally , I recommend to people new to the DE to stop after the 3x forms for the first few weeks to get adjusted to the angle and technique of DE handling without risk of serious blood shed or blade irritation . </shave.v.1051><shave.v.1052>Due to the many tribal customs African hairstyles were many and varied and usually signified status.

Philips ' main rival in terms of best shaver popularity is Panasonic and their BIG winner is the Linear 8000 series of shavers. The claim to fame with these shavers is a much faster motor which may be of help to you. I hope this helps . </shave.v.1066><shave.v.1067>I find I get a more even shave using the shaving creams from eShave. The White Tea has a pleasant aroma and and helps the razor glide over my skin while still giving me a close shave . </shave.v.1067><shave.v.1068>In the times of the Chatam Sofer ( Rabbi Moshe Sofer ) , some Jews in the high society used to shave with a razor , disregarding Jewish Law. Now , the Torah prohibition against shaving with a razor does n't apply until the beard stubble has grown somewhat ( approximately two or three days ' growth ) . So the Chatam Sofer said that it was better for them to continue shaving on Chol Hamo'ed so that the hair would not have time to grow to that length , rather than letting it grow during and shaving after the festival , which would entail the violation of hundreds of Torah prohibitions , one prohibition for every two hairs shaved. Many people misunderstood this , mistakenly thinking that the Chatam Sofer was lenient regarding the prohibition of shaving on Chol Hamo'ed . </shave.v.1068><shave.v.1069>Since my parents got a divorce and my mother did not allow us to see our Dad , I taught my brother ( one year my junior ) how to shave.

( : </shave.v.1069><shave.v.1070>I just shaved with it for the first time today and was surprised that I liked it right away. I shaved " dry " and got a very close , fast shave with little irritation. I also liked the pop-up trimmer but it really seemed powerful to me.

I said it before but my impression was that it was powerful and really making short work of my normal beard . </shave.v.1070><shave.v.1071>L is in the Police Academy and is forced to shave every day.

I have never shaved my somewhat hairy rear because ( a ) there is n't all that much hair , ( b ) I despise stubble , and ( c ) I do n't have that much poop stickage on my hairs ( at least , that I can tell ) . Leaving well enough alone has a lot to be said for it . </shave.v.1073><shave.v.1074>" If you have very hard facial hair like me definitely give this a try. A lot less irritation when shaving every day ( using mach 3 or disposables I could only shave every other day ) " - Silviu Rusu </shave.v.1074><shave.v.1075>Years later , I do n't care what other women do. Since I am not down with others lecturing me on how to prepare and present my body , I learned that preaching to others was equally unappreciated and wrong. At the same time , I also continue to avoid shaving whenever possible. This is no longer because I care as much about the ideological underpinnings of body hair ( although I still find the topic fascinating ) , but because I am flat out lazy. ( It is also why I still do n't ever wear make-up. Too much effort. ) Shaving takes time , money , and effort. Ignoring my leg and pit hair , on the other hand , is the epitome of convenient. However , it is not professional to show up at work with hairy legs and arm pits. If I want to indulge in breezy summer clothing , I have to shave. That 's the price one pays for wearing comfortable clothing , an option not open to men during the hot summer months . </shave.v.1075><shave.v.1076>I use a lanier panasonic electric shaver and it is super.

I shave my face and head all at once each day . </shave.v.1076><shave.v.1077>Personally , I find that I get a closer shave with less irritation if I shave before I wash my face or get into the shower , rather than after. I think that it reduces irritation because my skin is not puffy and my pores are tighter , allowing less debris to interfere with my pores and causing fewer nicks because any bumps on the skin are not as pronounced. I wet my beard and neck with cold water prior to the lather to entice follicles to stand up , but the basic rule of thumb is : No exposure to heat or hot water prior to the shave . </shave.v.1077><shave.v.1078>R &amp;B singer Cassie recently shaved one side of her head !

Single-edged razors shave at the skin level. Double-edged razors will shave at slightly below. If you can tolerate them , you can skip a day between shavings by using a double-edged razor.

Originally the only razors available were straight razors. Today straight razors are mainly used by barbers , but are very rarely seen. Safety razors made their way to the market by the 19th century. Safety razors are still the most commonly sold razors on the market. Electric razors debuted in the early 1900 's and are still popular today. Original electric razors could only be used on dry skin , however modern razors are readily available that allow the use of shave cream , soap or water . </shave.v.1094><shave.v.1095>However , even as little as a week 's growth of hair can begin to obscure the mascara line , hiding one of the most unique features of a Silver Persian.

The biggest thing that helps me , I think , is to keep pressure the number of strokes to an absolute minimum. It doesn ' t allow for the closest shave , but it ' s worth it for the lack of neck irritation . </shave.v.1098><shave.v.1099>The dilemma that we face is that despite that need , we do n't seem to be clear about the story. We are not even clear about what happened that third day. In Matthew 's gospel the two witnesses were Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , and he appeared to them. In Luke 's gospel it was the women : suggested to be Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James and others. They returned to the disciples to tell them ... the men ... thought it was an idle tale. I remember one Easter when the Luke passage was used , I watched in amazement when from the pulpit a fellow pastor , took out a bowl of water , shaving cream and razor and shaved off his beard. Saying if you think that anyone would believe what he had just done on Easter , then they would understand the uncredible thoughts the eleven had when these women returned from the tomb . </shave.v.1099><shave.v.1100>I use a Mergress razor , Polo 8 brush by Simpson , a scuttle by Georgetown Pottery , Taylor of Old Bond St , Mr Taylor ' s shave cream or Proraso , Derby blades and Armani Acqua Di Gio after shave balm.

In reality , if you keep your blade dry and properly stropped , you won ' t have to hone it that often. Most good blades can go 6 to 8 weeks between honings. You ' ll know you need to hone it because stropping won ' t sharpen it anymore . </shave.v.1103><shave.v.1104>I now regularly shave for several reasons. First , my best friend used the toilet after me at the John Mayer concert last week. She remarked about the pubic hair I left on the seat and how much time she had to wait after I took a shit and wiped. I must have wiped 20 times ( yes , I was getting sore from the paper contact ! ) and the fact that I used most of the half roll that was left and still had skid marks on my underwear when I got home. Large moist stools , especially in public places like concert arenas are not easy to clean up after and hair does n't make it any easier ! Secondly , a lot of hair does n't make sitting on cold public toilets any easier either ! I just do n't see any other options . </shave.v.1104><shave.v.1105>... a traditionalist , remembering the old flat blade with heavier metal holder and a cup full of old soaps whisked into a larva with the shaving brush made from badger hair.

I like it much better. I change it up from time to time from bald to a strip to a little more. As long as a bikini will hide it , it works for me. No one likes to see bush in the water. LOL there is enough seaweed around . </shave.v.1106><shave.v.1107>Today , the last day of Kartika , all sannyasis and brahmacaris should shave their heads and cut their nails. This is called mundan or shaving. These days some people don ' t like to perform mundan because they think , How can I shave my head if I have to go to the office tomorrow ? Actually all should shave their hair and nails , even householders , according to their ability and faith. What is the benefit of this ? All the sins , offences and anarthas in our body come out in the form of our hair and nails. By cutting them we become free from all these things. In our previous society , we used to see that at the time of births , brahminical sacrifices ( any ritual for which brahmanas were invited to chant mantras and perform fire sacrifices ) , marriages , funerals and all other religious ceremonies people would shave their head for that reason . </shave.v.1107><shave.v.1108>neversaynever , i used to shave too but the hair grows thicker and coarser and then repeated shaving damages my skin.i would rather say waxing is the best option . </shave.v.1108><shave.v.1109>If you ' re going to be shaving , SkinMilk Shaving Milk ( $ 5.59 ) will protect your legs from razor burn by forming a moisturizing barrier between your skin and that scary blade.

Do n't like body hair - itchy and unsightly. Shaving my armpits takes about 30 seconds per pit and does n't really hurt. Shaving my face on the other hand , that hurts plenty. Wish I only had to shave my armpits. LOL BTW - armpit hair on women is pretty gross in my book. I do n't even like it on me ( nor does my wife ) . I 'd say if you want to shave , then do so. If not , then don't.

After all would you try to cut your own hair ? </shave.v.1114><shave.v.1115>The second function the brush must simultaneously perform is to divert the compounded mix outward , away from the core of the brush itself to the outer periphery. This outer periphery is called the brush gutter. This dual process of compounding the mix and then diverting it smoothly and efficiently out to the brush periphery is simply astonishing. It is also a maddeningly difficult function for the brush manufacturer to effectively create. Invariably , one function overpowers the other. It is for this reason that all shaving brush companies ( except mine ) shear their gutters. Indeed , it is easier to simply shear off the gutter than build it. I disagree; the shaver will know the difference soon enough . </shave.v.1115><shave.v.1116>I do it all in the shower.

How do you combat itchyness ? ? </shave.v.1122><shave.v.1123>* In the UK ( don ' t know about the US ) Palmolive shave sticks are a fave of mine. They cost pennies , can be found everywhere and being small are great for travel. Also bars of Palmolive soap are cheap ( 4 pack for a £ 1 in most places ) and great for prepping your face. Rub and load a wet brush with soapy-goodness . Then either proceed to your shave cream/soap or scrub your face with the loaded brush to get rid of any dirt/dead skin before you shave . </shave.v.1123><shave.v.1124>Post-Shave - After you ' ve finished shaving , lightly rub an ice cube over the skin you shaved to close up your pores and then pat the area dry with a clean towel. Apply a unscented moisturizer to the area to help soothe the freshly shaved skin. When you are first getting used to shaving you should shave only once every few days wait for the irritation from the last shave to heal before you shave again. With every successive shave , the irritation should lessen until it stops altogether. After shaving , wear a long shirt or boxer shorts to let the area breathe only wear loose , breathable fabrics. You will find that a close shave will last anywhere from 1-3 days and will begin to itch as it grows back if you don ' t shave it regularly. Not everyone has the skin for shaving , if you find that you have a real problem with irritation or ingrown hairs then you should consider a close trim instead. It will still look and feel clean but without all of the pain . </shave.v.1124><shave.v.1125>73. Ok ladies , I 'm sure we all HATE to admit that we skip a shave/ waxing every now and again.

But I 'll still admit , when I 'm not getting any , I do n't shave every day ! ! Its actually kind of freeing. Keep in mind women have ALOT ALOT ALOT more to do when it comes to beautifying ... its actually pretty unfair. Geez I hate all you negative posters out there , Beyonce is HOTTER THAN YOU you ugly b*tches so get a life and leave her alone </shave.v.1125><shave.v.1126>Brushing your teeth first versus shaving first prevents you from getting any shaving cream in your mouth that you may have missed wiping off. Letting the hot water run slowly while you brush will get it warm enough for when you are ready to shave. The warm water you use while shaving will soften the hair and make for a better shave. And lastly , most homes have a common hot water pipe that connects the bathroom to the hot water heater. So when your ready to jump in the shower you ' ve have nearly instant hot water which will save you time. Showering last has the added benefit of washing away any last trace of toothpaste or shaving cream . </shave.v.1126><shave.v.1127>Thank you so much !

As you rinse , use the credit card as a squeegee and scrape lightly with the grain of your hair.

Be sure to do you best to squeegee your backside and other hidden areas ( back of leg , back of knee , etc . ) </shave.v.1128><shave.v.1129>When shaving , make sure you use a gentle hand. If your problem is simply razor burn , you need to make a few adjustments to your shaving routine in order to reduce irritation and inflammation. To start , soften the hair by soaking your legs for several minutes in warm water. Invest in a moisturizing shave gel-soap does n't cut it-and lather the shaving area completely. Let the lather sit on the hair for a minute before proceeding . </shave.v.1129><shave.v.1130>as obvious as it is i find myself doing it far too often cause i need to shave and am in a hurry ( or dont feel like waiting ) .

During that time I probally had more compliments than any other time with hair. What I would do is every night shave with a razor blade , getting it baby butt smooth. In the morning , I would quickly run an electric razor over it after the shower. Then again in the afternoon when I returned from work. This might sound alittle extreme , however , the results were worth every minute of it. Also , the women in my life all loved it. They agreed that there was nothing compared to the feel of a perfectly shaved head . </shave.v.1143><shave.v.1144>After showering is one of the best times to shave , but if you shave without showering , place a hot wash cloth over shave area for about 10 seconds , wash the area with warm water to soften up your beard , opening pores and making your skin supple but avoid soaps they will dry your skin. Thoroughly massage your natural shave oil or cream into shave area. Splash hot water onto face and regularly , while shaving , swirl razor in a partially filled sink of hot water to activate lubricants. Shave with the grain of beard.

For your back you will need help , have a friend or partner use the buzzer to remove any patches of hair you may get on you back. I personally do not recommend waxing for the back. I only get a small dusting of hair at my lower back and center lats so it has not been that much of an issue for me but with the rest of my body smooth it is more obvious so I just remove it all. Your back is the oiliest part of your body and is the most difficult to clean. Waxing your back removes a layer of skin , and could cause bumps and irritation. It also exposes your back to bacteria and dirt that could cause breakout. Although it maybe more difficult and more time consuming to shave the hair off , I have gotten the best results for years just doing what I am doing . </shave.v.1145><shave.v.1146>Go With the Flow When you are ready to get razing , always start by shaving with the grain. If you aren ' t sure what this means , run your fingers across your stubble to find which way is smooth and which is rough. Shave in the smooth direction to start , and for a really close shave , re-lather after the first pass and shave against the grain. Use a sharp razor to avoid nicks and cuts , but don ' t rush through. Taking your time while shaving can reduce the time you spend blotting blood with torn corners of TP. A normal safety razor should do the trick just fine , but if you are feeling extra hardcore , you can try shaving with a straight razor , it can actually be better for your skin , and its more environmental friendly.

As for any plating the foil has , that 's supposed to make the foil surface glide along the skin surface. The problem I see with electroplated surfaces is the electroplating wears out over time and you 're rubbing your face with it while shaving so I would favor a foil surface that 's not electroplated.

Damn it all , they got paid. I 'm not shaving with it for them. I 'm shaving with it for me , and in memory of Parkie , and it 's a private moment of contemplation each day as I watch the old face slowly succumb to gravity and life - tempus fecit - and to be reminded that I am a consumer is simply intolerable at such a moment.

It 's was just as much about looking clean than being vain. I was a very conservative person so it was n't about growing up and looking good for boys , it was about looking nice in myself and not being a hairy monkey. I have a sis in law and her family did n't let her shave until she was 17 ! She is Greek so you can imagine the balck long hairs and she says how she was made the butt of many a joke. It should n't get to that point. Let your daughter shave and feel nice about herself. It 's not like wearing a mini skirt or makeup , it 's just about hygene.

I encounter it constantly. Questions about shaving brushes typically come in three forms : What exactly is a shaving brush ? How is it used ? Which is the best brush to own ? That individuals new to wet shaving remain incessantly mystified by the proper role of the shaving brush is not at all surprising. Indeed , I frequently encounter very experienced wet shavers who are equally confused about shaving brushes. In the last ten years , we have enjoyed much success establishing the best principles and practices of wet shaving. At the same time , we have performed less admirably when it comes to specifically explaining the central role of the shaving brush. I personally confront this failure nearly every day in the calls I receive from frustrated wet shavers struggling to master their own brushes . </shave.v.1170><shave.v.1171>Over the years I have tried all manner of shaving products ~ including a Rolls Razor ( remember them ? ) I discarded electric shaving in my youth , and for many years now have used brushless gel.

Last night I had my first shave using my new brush &amp;cream. What a splendid experience. Until you try it , you would n't believe what a difference a decent brush makes.

Also , the Braun will not move over your skin if it is oily or micro-moist from a warm bathroom , even with shaving powder. It was returned.

I had to use an electric razor to shave my head for 5 years because I did n't want to walk around with unsightly razor rash ( when I say unsightly I mean unsightly two week of rash unsightly ) . I bought your product about three months ago and was scared and skeptical about using the product. Well after my electric razor gave out I had no other alternative but TSS. You were right.

Second , I tried The Art of Shaving which provided a decent smell and minimal effort in achieving a drag-free shave , but in the end I did not feel that it was worth spending so much money on these " fancy " creams. Finally , and like all great finds , it took the third try to find Proraso. This stuff is great ! I use it every other day because I am able to get such a close shave. It is priced at a point that I find to be a steal , it gives me a drag-free shave , and it smells classic , not to mention it does what no other fancy shave cream does and that is give you the icy effect when rinsing it off your face.

The procedure is ideally suited for pedunculated lesions raised above the level of the surrounding skin. It consists of repetitive , unidirectional , horizontal slicing of a cutaneous lesion with a no. 15 blade followed by electrosurgical feathering to smooth out the wound edges. A smoke evacuator is used during electrosurgery to prevent inhalation of heat-disseminated viral particles. The procedure is followed by histologic evaluation of the shaved specimen. Suspicious pigmented lesions should not be shaved because the long-term prognosis of a malignancy may depend on the thickness of the lesion on histologic analysis. Administration of adequate local anesthesia should make this a painless procedure. Basic general surgery skills are required , and formal training in electrosurgery is highly recommended.

The average man will get around 5 or six shaves from a disposal blade. A shaving blade edge will oxidize or corrode when exposed to moisture , so a good practice would be to press a towel against the blade after shaving to remove any moisture. Store your blades and razor outside your bath area to minimize exposure to moisture.

The hand angles are a bit awekward at first , but take your time at first , and you will figure out how to put the blade properly on your face.

For a long time in high school I did n't shave my legs at all- it was sort of a protest. Removing hair never felt right. My body clearly did n't like it.

Until my early 20s I literally that I would basically never have sex , because even if I could get a guy to like me despite the hair you could see , I 'd never take my clothes off and show him the rest of the mess.

Now , this is a dream product. This is the mack daddy of all products. Now , if you remember , the first thing I applied onto my beard was a shave oil. The shave oil as I said gives you perfect slip , it oxidizes , so it helps lift up the hairs and it gives me a smooth surface to shave with. So there is no razor drag and it prevents me from cutting myself. It lets you see what you 're shaving clearly . </shave.v.1265><shave.v.1266>Your instincts were right the first time. The rituals women go through to please males are barbaric. Men do n't shave their stinky pits much less their legs. In fact , lately a lot of them have decided that chin stubble is attractive.

Everyone had the hair cut to the skin , to the ears. How were we dressed ? Well , we had those clothes -- some of theirs. We barbers had gray clothes. There were other clothes , too. There were some [ taken ] from the Jews , so they would give to us. We had gray long coats. We barbers were cutting the hair of the prisoners and of them [ the guards ] .

A year ago I plunked down the cash and tried laser hair removal on my lower legs at a local specialist. It was expensive , it was moderately painful , but holy cow , it worked ! I was a believer. Goodbye shaving ! Adios waxing ! I bought more packages. I was thrilled. Until the place went out of business , taking my money and my dreams of being silky smooth with it. ( Darn you economic downturn ! ! ) Then , I heard about TRIA. An at-home laser hair removal system. Yes , at home. Could it really be ? Did it work ? I had to try it for myself . </shave.v.1269><shave.v.1270>Actually , every couple of years I decide to shave my legs and do for a month or so until I remember what an incredible pain it is.

I am a dog/cat groomer , no longer working , but for many years had people dealing with the same issue. And all in all , I have to say , that the ones that opted for a shave were always real pleased and said " wow why have we not done this before " . I totally agree with a previous poster , look out for sunburn. But the skin condition overall will imporve if you shave , rather than having a dog that is too warm or when in water a lot and maybe not get real dry into the skin.

It 's the quietest Philishave/Norelco model I 've come across as the noise I mainly hear is from the whiskers being sheared off. The shave is pretty close and comfortable and my only complaint ( a mild one at that ) is I need to use the trimmer more for my sideburns and for reshaping my beard. The heads follow the contours of my bald head ( with the few hairs I use this shaver to shave off ) . Last , but not least , is the easy cleaning under the faucet.

Let your partner see your legs unshaven , or maybe stop removing some of your less public hair in the winter or at times when only YOU need to know what 's going on under your clothes. That way you can get used to the feeling. When I stopped shaving I did it in winter , because I live in Canada so I was bundled up constantly for a few months ... by the time summer came around , I was so used to the hair that it did n't even occur to me to start shaving again ! And people were less of jerks about it than I thought , even when I wear tank tops and show off my awesome hairy pits. AND you know , my partner , he likes it. He actually really likes it. He thinks it 's a total waste of time to shave and he likes the softness of the hair instead of weird unnatural smoothness that VERY QUICKLY turns into sharp stubble.

My wife asked me a few years back if I would let her shave the hair off my chest , which was n't a lot to begin with. I let her do it , and this is what I learned. First , since I am a workout nut , I had no idea how the hair actually hid my pec development. Second , it made me look much younger. I already looked young for my age so that was an unintended result. Last , if you do it , you need to either shave it regularly or just trim it. It is not only about how you look , but how you feel to the touch.

Shaving soaps are broadly grouped into the cold process soaps , like the Col. Conk , and the milled soaps. Most of the higher quality shaving soaps are triple-milled. Using any shaving cream or soap with a quality shaving brush is far superior to using foam from a can. So , the choice of any product will be a significant step up from that. However , a high quality milled soap , like our Vintage Blades Brand Triple-Milled Shaving Soap , or a premium shaving cream , like Castle Forbes and Penhaligon ' s are significantly better than their lower priced counterparts. However , you would not know that unless you had experience with the lower priced brands , like those from Taylor of Old Bond Street . </shave.v.1296><shave.v.1297>It was quite a while before I tried a Method Shave , and when I did , I was stunned at what a good shave I got.

It should be almost gone if it ' s not , do an XTG pass the other way. Before the ATG pass , you want the stubble reduced as much as possible. Then , when you ' re ready for it , re-lather your wet beard and do ATG just on your cheeks. That ' s the easiest and gives you good practice without getting into the difficult curves and challenges of chin , jaw , neck , etc. After a few shaves , when you ' re happy with ATG on your cheeks and are comfortable with the ATG razor position , do your chin as well , then your upper lip , and finally your neck and under the jaw.

I have shaved with a blade for the last 5 years or so ( I currently alternate between the Gillette Mach 3 and Sensor Excel ) , and I am wondering if you could recommend a particular model for me. I shave everyday , but do not have a particularly heavy beard or thick whiskers , but I do like to keep sideburns and a goatee. The skin on my face is not overly sensitive , but does have a tendency to dry out in the winter. My main concern about purchasing an electric is that the hair on my neck and jaw line grows in different directions than the hair on my face and chin. This has always made for painful and difficult shaving with a blade , but the one time I tried my father 's rotary electric in high school , it was the most painful experience ever ! It ripped the hair out of my neck rather than cut it , and I was left with terrible rashes and an un-even shave . </shave.v.1333><shave.v.1334>As a collegiate swimmer I used to shave everything not covered by a speedo.

It ' s extraordinarily refreshing , but the sort of thing ( like coffee ) that appeals to adult tastes : in the case of the alum block , a tingling and slight stinging. The alum block ( at the link : what it is and where to get one ) is held to glide over the freshly shaved part of your face while it ' s still wet from the cold-water rinse. ( I don ' t wet the block , just glide it over my wet face. ) This is non-abrasive : the block gently glides over your freshly shaved face. The block is then placed on its little wooden rack to air-dry. ( I have read where some have inexplicably attempted to use a styptic pencil as though it were an alum block , rubbing the side of the pencil on the face. This is very misguided. The styptic pencil is not the same substance. Get a real alum block . ) </shave.v.1337><shave.v.1338>The opposition to shaving for me is quite simple. I like regular sorts of guys.

Before shaving , prepare yourself : wet your face with warm water; apply a hot towel , apply a pre-shave oil , then lather liberally. Shave with the grain , across the grain , across the grain in the opposite direction , and then shave against the grain ( if necessary ) . Each pass shortens the hair follicles , causing less irritation and producing a closer shave. Once done shaving , wash your face with warm water ( no soap ) , then wash again with cold water to close the pores. Then apply a non-alcoholic , rather simple after shave balm to help heal your skin. Wait a good 15 minutes , then apply a more preferred after shave product.

The kind that included the single row trimmer/cutter that would pop up on the side of the razor 's handle. I basically used that part for all my shaving needs as I could never get the main head the top part , to shave very well. The only problem is that the cutters would get dull , and I would end up buying a new razor because locating just a new cutter part proved impossible or very costly. I would supplement at times with a blade razor and can of aerosol foam or mass-market bar soap and didn ' t like that very well either. Especially , the foam was cold and I found shaking the can to be a nuisance. And when I used off-the-shelf soap it was n't lubricating and did n't smell all that great. All I can say is those products shaved the hair off , but wasn ' t anything I enjoyed.

Because I also have a goatee , I have a similar problem. How I deal with gradually increasing beard area is to use a beard trimmer without the guard to reshape my beard now and then.

Enjoy your stay . </shave.v.1508><shave.v.1509>What about pre-shave oils ? Some men with especially heavy beards or sensitive skin also use a pre-shave oil. In this case it is applied just before the lather. It only takes a small amount massaged onto the shaving area. Apply lather on top and shave as usual. The oil will be removed when shaving , Just be sure to apply the oil with your non-razor hand , or that no oil remains on the hand that holds the razor as that could be slippery. Brush bristles are compatible with pre-shave oils , however in this event they can benefit from a brush cleaning as discussed above to avoid any residual buildup . </shave.v.1509><shave.v.1510>My skin never did get used to frequent shaving , like some say it will. In fact , mine just gets worse and worse until I back off. As a cyclist , I shave my legs. And as a pain-in-the-butt habit I developed , I shave my chest and stomach , too.

I 'll then use it again either that evening or the next morning . </shave.v.1510><shave.v.1511>The answer varies by person , but for me it is the sheer pleasure that the morning shave now affords. Shaving has moved from a routine at best , a chore more often , to a wonderful ritual from which I emerge feeling truly pampered.

How many guys can say that ? </shave.v.1511><shave.v.1512>Unlike the rest of the body , the facial skin is very delicate and exposed to the environment.

The following techniques can be used on any unwanted hair , but is especially good for thick , coarse , hair . </shave.v.1512><shave.v.1513>Shaving seems to have not been known to the Romans during their early history ( under the Kings of Rome and the early Republic ) . Pliny tells us that P. Ticinius was the first who brought a barber to Rome , which was in the 454th year from the founding of the city ( that is , around 299 BC ) . Scipio Africanus was apparently the first among the Romans who shaved his beard. However , after that shaving seems to have caught on very quickly , and soon almost all Roman men were clean-shaven; being clean-shaven became a sign of being Roman and not Greek. Only in the later times of the Republic did many youths shave the beard only partially , and trimmed it so as to give it an ornamental form; other young men oiled their chins to force a premature growth of beard.

The company did so even though her position required aggressive behavior and , as the success of her male colleagues illustrated , did not require make-up or pastel suits. PWSA adherents argue that if Price Waterhouse could not discriminate against Ann Hopkins for failing to wear lipstick or pastel suits then other employers can not discriminate against male or female employees that fail to look like the employer , or perhaps society , think a man or woman should look. Such employees might include women who refuse to shave their legs , wear a bra , wear skirts , wear makeup , or wear their hair long or styled and men who refuse to cut their hair or want to wear jewelry . </shave.v.1515><shave.v.1516>Ofelia kept her head shaved , she said , because her hair interfered with transmissions.

Some people choose to shave because they feel uncomfortable and self-conscious about having hair on their legs. Your mother 's position , I am guessing , may have to do with the fact that she may think that you are too young - and she may also want to be protecting you from this extra. When making a decision to shave your legs , I would invite you to consider both your reasons and the reasons that your mother has. I wonder if you have spoken to your mother about why she is so uncomfortable with you shaving your legs ? </shave.v.1526><shave.v.1527>An electric shaver would be the best. You can use a regular one as well , but of course you must be very careful not to cut yourself. That should not be such a problem now as they make safety razors and also razors with aloe to make the skin more smooth. Some women do not experience much hair growth in the radiated axilla ( underarm ) , so you may find that the need for shaving is less in the radiated area compared with the opposite side.

Then they watched the hair growth over 9 days. You can clearly see that the waxed side has much less hair than the shaved. I suppose we all knew that though. But The Beauty Brains always like to give a little publicity to real science being done in the cosmetic industry . </shave.v.1541><shave.v.1542>Raising funds for Charity is great , but Shaving Your Heads isn ' t necessary.

Mark talked me through the history of shaving; the barbers pole ' blood and bandages ' to signify the presence of a guy who would cut you open , pull out teeth , cut hair and give you a shave; the fact that Gillette set the standard for the angle of the cutting blade at 30 degrees around 109 years ago and LOADS more fascinating facts. Next I learnt all about skin types , growth , the theory behind the perfect shave , then we got to work on a very nervous but somewhat trusting model called Rob . </shave.v.1544><shave.v.1545>Now when we talk about hair we are not referring to the styling , conditioning and shampooing of the head , we are also talking of the beard and moustache. There are products made for specific jobs. Man will find products such as shaving blades and razors in every price pack - and these include electronic shaving and hair removal gadgets too. There are very good razors that will give one a closest shave and without any discomfort either. Moisturizers and aftershave products are very common these days. We have somewhat of a choice when it comes to conditioners of the hair and hair styling creams. What we do need is some sort of protection against falling hair and dandruff. Most of the present dandruff products do little more than paste the stuff down preventing it from falling allover and causing embarrassment . </shave.v.1545><shave.v.1546>That ' s what WAXING is for ! ! ! The hair grows back baby fine and the results last somewhere in between 3-4 weeks depending upon individual hair growth. Plus waxing is a great exfoliate which means even smoother skin ! ! ! I work at a waxing salon and get waxed head to toe and I can honestly say that I will NEVER go back to shaving anything ever again ! ( But make sure it ' s a hard wax ( not strip ) and they actually take steps to protect the skin as well. ) So no , don ' t shave. If you want it gone , WAX ! </shave.v.1546><shave.v.1547>I started shaving my legs ( and arms ! ) when I was competing in bodybuilding , and the stubble was why I continued , combined with a healthy dose of vanity ! I didnt care for waxing ( mainly because you had to wait too long to re-wax ) , and depilatory creams we sort of hit and miss. I personally found that every time I shaved , it became easier. I shave daily now ( sometimes twice a day on my arms ) and razor burn is no longer an issue.

If you would have seen my first husband 's back hair , I would not have to clarify , but seeing as how you have not had that fuzziness thrust upon your eyes , I thought I 'd punch it in. ( Which also makes sense. ) Shaved a little airplane and a heart into it once , but that 's neither here nor there anymore. Back hair grows back . </shave.v.1550><shave.v.1551>You know , as a woman , I much prefer waxing than to shaving. There ' s a bit of an upfront cost to buy the necessary equipment ( wax , wax warmer , cloth strips , etc ) but I ' ve noticed that my hair is growing in finer and that I ' m having to wax less often than when I first started. It also doesn ' t hurt as much as you think it would. I ' ve been waxing my legs ( and underarms ) for about 2 years now and I haven ' t shaved since.

This is related both in 'Bukhari ' and 'Muslim'. Rasulullah has sternly commanded this to his followers. Wherever Rasulullah gives a command then that act becomes compulsory ( Waajib ) , and to neglect this Waajib command is totally prohibited , ( Haraam ) . Thus it is forbidden ( Haraam ) to shave the beard and keep long moustaches. This is further elaborated in another Hadith in which Rasulullah has said : 'whosoever does not cut his moustache is not of our group'. This has been related by Ahmad , Tirmizi and Nasa'ee . </shave.v.1573><shave.v.1574>The Panasonic ES7109S Vortex triple-blade shaver features independent floating triple heads that follow your facial contours for an ultra-clean shave every time.

I am looking for some advice and you seem to be the one with the expertise. I have been shaving for the last 11 years and have had nothing but problems. Since I can remember I have had sensitive skin. I have done anything and everything ... including going to a dermatologist. I have even considered getting the hair on my face permanently laser removed. I suffer from very , very sensitive skin. I have tried washing my face with soap , shaving in the shower , using after shave , special creams , but nothing seems to work. I tend to get very bad razor bumps on my neck due to shaving. The only thing that I have not tried yet is a quality electric shaver. I was wondering if you had any suggestion as to which electric shaver would remedy my problem. To be honest , at this point , money is not a concern. If I can find an electric shaver that will give me a close shave without the irritation , then I am willing to spend the bucks. If you could get back to me I would appreciate it. Thank you.

He started going into detail about how much easier it made shaving and that he didn ' t have the razor burn he ' d come to think of as being normal . Next minute the bunch of them became engrossed in each other ' s shaving nightmares , swapping tips and giving advice like old fish wives having a natter over a cup of tea. The moment I looked up and saw the rugby game was already 5 minutes into the first half , the idea to create a shaving and skin care forum for every day men ignited an enthusiasm in me I hadn ' t had since I decided to blow all my money at the Beer fest.

It comes in a small can ( see pic ) and can be found in just about any decent-size drugstore. Locally I usually pick it up at Target. This product is actually designed as a face shaving alternative to razors for black men , which apparently suffer from a higher risk of razor bumps. It is incredibly cheap and goes a long way. The product comes ( typically ) in powdered form and must be mixed with water and then applied to the beard . </shave.v.1580><shave.v.1581>Hi - I also live in TX and completely understand the heat issue.

We have now had it done 3 times ... she is SO happy when she comes back from the groomers ... she rubs all over things and is so affectionate. BUT the Kuvasz also has black skin , so the sunburn thing is n't much of an issue for her. Another amazing thing is when we let her coat grow in over the winter it was just georgeous ! You could always start with shaving underneath and then just trimming the legs and back -kind of blending it ... </shave.v.1581><shave.v.1582>I only have to shave once every 5 or 6 days , so my razors last me a while.

My hair was too long again , and the front hung black and coarse to just below my ears. I would need to have Dad cut it over the weekend. It had only been three weeks since last time.

I shave between epilations , and I can usually go a month or so . </shave.v.1586><shave.v.1587>The biggest take away from the site is not to use a razor.

You have issues with authority in your life , basically you don ' t like being told what to do or what to wear in general. The shirt and shaving are just an outward manifestation of other feelings you have about being part of a group that places conformity as important to fitting in . </shave.v.1588><shave.v.1589>If you believe that shaving serves another purpose aside from " fitting in " , or there are other reasons for shaving , then you 're completely correct that it should n't be assumed that you 're being a " weak woman " by shaving. If you like shaving , then shave . </shave.v.1589><shave.v.1590>If you work in a very smart place , you may want to make sure the stubble is very precise and neatly trimmed , and neck beard part freshly shaved , so it looks like a clear conscious grooming decision , rather than you just got up late.

I distinctly recall a bullyish boy in seventh grade approaching me in gym class and asking why I did n't shave my legs. ( Not yet a feminist , I think I responded , " because I 'm eleven. " ) But I think there is quite a difference between looking critically at motives and writing off all women who do X thing that gender norms encourage them to do because they must feel this overarching need to do it. Perhaps I internalized one aspect of that encouragement but ignored the part that suggests keeping the hair on my head short is masculine . </shave.v.1597><shave.v.1598>Before I start I 'll say up front I am no lover of shaving gels , I find them gunky , over reliant on chemicals and harsh on the skin , if you are going to use one grab something like Clinique ' s M Shave Aloe Gel , I ' d avoid store own brands and dodgy market stuff as many of them bear ingredients lists that have little resemblence to good quality products that you ' d want to put on your face , if you are still using the thick white foam you get from an aerosol then stop now !

The first electric I tried was the Norelco Advantage. Boy had shaving with an electric changed ! The Advantage gave a good shave and I particularly liked the fact that it was wet/dry , easy to clean and gave comfortable shave. After 8 weeks with the Advantage I decided to try the Panasonic Linear 8067. I liked Panasonic Linear even more because it shaved even closer than the Advantage with nivea lotion and like the Advantage it was wet/dry.

A lot of reports swirling among the bloggerati tend to suggest that Britney wanted to make sure she would n't be nailed in a drug test via a hair sample ( which , you have to admit , fits in nicely with the shaved privates displayed to gratified paparazzi during the lack of underwear incident ) . Hair can carry traces of drug use for long periods of time . </shave.v.1606><shave.v.1607>So my best shave tip ( I ' ve only been shaving with a safety razor for about 3 months ) is to pull your skin a bit tight , that way you avoid the skin moving as much and ( for me at least ) this results in less nicks and cuts. Also if your beard happens to grow in multiple directions , as mine does , rather than the down across against method I often find its more helpful to just go down and then against as it has led to less irritation . </shave.v.1607><shave.v.1608>At first I toyed with the idea of offering straight razor shaves as everyone seemed genuinely interested in seeing this lost art reinstituted. But I knew that I wanted my concept to be current and meet the skin care needs of today ' s shaver. The only way to sell them product they could use at home would be to demonstrate it real time using tools they were familiar with.

In easy regions cheeks , upper lip it excels , rivaling a decent blade shave. But like all electrics , it just ca n't get those tricky sub-jaw zones. Under the chin ? Forget it. Neck cowlicks ?

This last decree was incorporated in the text of the canon law ( Decretals of Gregory IX , III , tit. i , cap. vii ) . Durandus , finding mystical reasons for everything , according to his wont , tells us that " length of hair is symbolical of the multitude of sins. Hence clerics are directed to shave their beards; for the cutting of the hair of the beard , which is said to be nourished by the superfluous humours of the stomach , denotes that we ought to cut away the vices and sins which are a superfluous growth in us. Hence we shave our beards that we may seem purified by innocence and humility and that we may be like the angels who remain always in the bloom of youth. " ( Rationale , II , lib.

I now am not hairless in these areas but do have very thin , sparse hair that is really easy to shave and/or wax. I probably need a couple more sessions but it is costly and I 'm pretty satisfied with what I have for now. Also , I do n't want to deal w/ any more discoloration . </shave.v.1691><shave.v.1692>I have to shave , I get all itchy if I don ' t , but I never shave higher than my knee.

I 've never clipped any part of my dogs except for hotspots or injuries. Groin clipping ( except around tatoos ) is even non-essential to me for the wicking the hairs do to remove moisture from sensitive underparts . </shave.v.1696><shave.v.1697>I started getting just enough fuzz to shave when I was in 7th grade. I started with an electric razor with three heads and only had to shave once a week. When I started using a real razor my beard started to come in thicker. I think its because the way I was taught to shave. You shave with the grain , then against it. For the first few years I did n't do that with my mustache. I had a little mexi-stache so a year ago when I started going against the grain and I grew my first handlebar last winter. This process will get the bulk off in the first pass , then get close to the skin on the second. I have a pretty thick beard and only have to shave once every two days. A lot of people say shaving does n't make hair thicker but they are wrong.

While people should teach their children to respect others despite physical appearance , they are n't and often times subconciously reinforce their children 's reaction. It 's heartbreaking to me to see a six year old girl cover her arms because she caught an adult staring. As a child , getting teased is hurtful and it shapes you as a person. My mother did n't allow me to shave as a child ... up until my early teens really. By this point , I would wear long sleeved shirts about half as often as short sleeved shirts and I NEVER wore shorts. Instilling confidence in our daughters may be helpful to an extent , but kids are naturally sensitive to comments and when those comments are repeated over a period of time , they tend to stick. Perhaps if there were more people those found on this board , we could find that our daughters do n't have to experience the harsh teasing we have . </shave.v.1698><shave.v.1699>Thanks a lot for the shaving solution.

Quick tip : Don ' t shave before your date. British researchers learned that women found men with light stubble more masculine , mature , and attractive than clean-shaven men . </shave.v.1705><shave.v.1706>In ancient Egypt head hair was often shaved , especially amongst children , as long hair was uncomfortable in the heat. Children were often left with a long lock of hair growing from one part of their heads , the practice being so common that it became the standard in Egyptian art for artists to depict children as always wearing this " sidelock " . Many adult men and women kept their heads permanently shaved for comfort in the heat and to keep the head free of lice , while wearing a wig in public. In their graves we find combs and hairpins. They thought thick hair was best and used hair extensions and wigs made of real hair or sheep 's wool. They dyed their hair and wigs a variety of colors with blues , greens , blondes and gold colors being among the preferred colors though black wigs hued by indigo were the favorite. Wealthy Egyptians had personal barbers who would come to their homes. They also used cosmetics and body oils. Women 's wigs were often long and braided , adorned with gold ornaments or ivory hairpins. Men 's faces were generally clean shaved , but stiff false beards were sometimes worn . </shave.v.1706><shave.v.1707>I just started riding and I have very little hair on my legs anyway , but I shave what little is there now as I hate it when the hair goes through the shorts and gets pulled.

The natal cleft is about as easy to shave with a standard razor as the bikini area is -- which is to say that it ai n't easy. The only sane way is if you have someone else to do it for you , since the usual results of self shaving are nicks , cuts and razor burn from hell.

We can not see the love a person possesses in his heart for someone except by his actions. We have been guided to judge people according to their apparent and visible actions. The Prophet has repeatedly said , I have not been ordered to cut open the hearts of people. ( to see their intention ) When a disbeliever recites the Shahadah , he will be classified as a Muslim , despite of what his beliefs are in reality. Thus if a person shaves his beard it can not be judged that he loves the Prophet . Nowadays we see the love people possess for celebrities and football players , which is evident; people are ready to dress the way they dress , live the way they live; emulating them in every way possible , so why is it that people are not ready to accept the Sunnah of the Prophet ? </shave.v.1720><shave.v.1721>While better shaving creams and shaving oils will leave your shave area moisturized , a good after shave balm or skin cream with natural ingredients can be applied to your entire shave area further fortifying and protecting your skin.

Over the years I have tried the Norelco Reflex Action ( not as close as the Quadra and a bit more irritating ) , the Braun Flex Integral ( close shave but irritated my face ) , the Panasonic Linear ( conformable , relatively close shave , but works best with shaving cream , which sort of defeats one of the purposes of using an electric shaver ) , and the Grundig Roltronic Pro ( not a great shave and very expensive to boot ) , as well as a blade. The Quadra Action is the best of the lot , in my opinion. The shave was pretty close from day 1 , and I anticipate it will get better as I move through the three-week adjustment period. Also , my dermatologist once told me that Norelcos were easier on the skin than other electric razors ( I have extremely sensitive skin ) . I do n't know if this is a commonly held opinion in the medical community , but I think this guy is a great doctor , so I thought I 'd pass it along . </shave.v.1723><shave.v.1724>Invest in good razor designed especially for women. Razors come if different forms  there are standard razors and electric razors. Always use shaving gel or cream as this will prevent the razor cutting your skin and will make it easier for you to shave the hair. Shaving sometimes may scrape the natural oils off your skin and that s why using a shaving gel is essential. The gel will allow the razor to glide easily and not nick or cut your skin . </shave.v.1724><shave.v.1725>As a treatment for inter growth of hair in folliculs , a antibiotic is used and even suspension of shaving for some days can be better. The rashes and itches can be cleared by using clindamycin , a antibiotic medicine. To prevent these problems from occurring there are several tips in shaving. The hair is cut without causing much irritation to the skin. The hair becomes easier to be shaved when it is wet , so hair is sprayed with water for 5 minutes before shaving. The shaving is done in the direction of the hair growth which is most probably facing downwards. Repeated shaving for one day makes irritation and also creates rough skin. The skin is kept in relaxed position without stretching so as to avoid cut by blades. Always use Shaving jell to form a smooth and irritation less shaves. The shaving jell should be foamy like liquid with a viscosity to create frictionless shaving . </shave.v.1725><shave.v.1726>As mentioned , I shave my entire body and have for years.

Some parents introduce shaving to their sons with autism by taking them to the barber. This is too expensive for an individual who must shave every day , but the barbershop strategy has worked for some families. Their son gets a shave twice a week and a hair trim when needed. The predictability of the event , the familiarity of the sounds and smells of the barbershop , and the interaction with a patient barber in a public forum are sometimes better than a home experience . </shave.v.1727><shave.v.1728>FWIW , I ' ve never had anyone ask me to shave or to wear a white shirt , in the Church or out. And my wife likes me better with a beard. And , frankly , I ' m at a point where I need to look older than I look. So the beard stays. Until , of course , I get bored with it . </shave.v.1728><shave.v.1729>Yeah , or you could just not. Why would you ? If you 're worried about visibility when wearing a bathing suit , then trim where you need to. If you 're worried about what men will think then I pity you. Do you really want a partner that does not accept you the way you are ? Why is this even an issue ? I find it really sad that women feel the need to shave their legs. To think that women are self conscious about places that only they and people intimate with them will see frightens me. If you are shaving/waxing for your own personal pleasure , then rock on , but if it is for someone else or because of what you think people will think of you , do n't do it. That 's a terrible reason. Think about it . </shave.v.1729><shave.v.1730>What a girl or woman uses to shave her legs is also a personal decision. What may work well for one girl may not work well for another girl ( as you seem to have learned. ) . When it comes to using a razor to save your legs , some girls and women choose to use a specific shaving gel ( designed for women ) or shaving cream. This plus making sure that you put moisturising cream on afterwards works to ensure that your legs stay moisturised; this will also prevent them from becoming dry and itchy . </shave.v.1730><shave.v.1731>" I was born in Petrov Gaj , near Prijedor [ Serb majority area of Bosnia ] in 1918.

I worked like that , on my own. I would take my briefcase with tools and go to cut hair and shave people. I learned to play and sing. Most of all I played guitar.

I am in my 40s and have shaved my legs very infrequently -- I have little leg hair , I didn\222t want to become a slave to the razor , until now I have worked at jobs where unshaved legs were not unusual and , most of all , I object to the cultural message that leg hair on a woman is unacceptable. Well , that\222s changed - I still resent the expectation that I will shave but I now have a job that has an unwritten dress code and I am therefore self-conscious about my leg hair. So , I will cave to the norm and shave. I want to know what\222s the most effective way to remove leg hair , one that will not take up too much of my time , cause me undue pain , or cost too much.

Then Halleluia my first shave with your oil , who would have thought that such a little bottle could make a grown man smile at six thirty in the morning.

After a few weeks , it 's like your face ( only for the men , that is -- I hope ) and the rash goes away. Of course , here at work the ongoing fascination with my metamorphosis into a competitive bodybuilder compels colleagues to ask me about things they would otherwise never ask . </shave.v.1776><shave.v.1777> Unlike gels etc , you need to work up a lather , like you would with a bar of imperial leather , and apply where you need to shave , which in my case was the bottom half of my face. Initially it does feel a bit strange , especially if you are use to using gels and foams but you get over that fairly quick. The covering is obviously less thick than with gels and foam and this actually makes seeing where you need to shave easier. Might be handy for the likes of George Michael or Derren Brown with their fancy chin attire. It also provides a nice clean shave and if used with a good razor shouldn ' t irritate even sensitive skin , which I actually have.

Indeed , most Method Shavers know this practice as notorious " fourth form " reduction. Shavers with very long memories may even recall my preaching on this score : " the gods of shaving have given us three forms; why , then , do you insist on adding a fourth ? " Over the nearly ten years I have taught Method Shaving , the strict caution against all forms of south/north reduction has always been strenuously enforced. And , until quite recently , I have made every effort to restrain new shavers from any tendency to adopt the practice. However , new developments in MS products and technique have made cutting the south/north line less problematic. This is particularly relevant where new shavers are concerned. In making this admission , however , I do n't wish to leave the false impression that I am somehow miraculously converted to the efficacy of n/s reduction; I am not . </shave.v.1785><shave.v.1786>A shave will greatly reduce shedding. This is not only true when the cat has just been shaved , but will continue to be true while the fur grows back. Shedding typically occurs when there is too much fur for the cat to be comfortable.

Changing the Way Americs Shaves </shave.v.1831><shave.v.1832>Many men were fortunate to have a father , grandfather or other figure head that showed them how to have a comfortable shave , and others have stumbled on how to get a decent shave on their own , or were lucky enough to talk to others who get a good shave. But for many , this is not the case. And it is to those that have been flailing in this area , or have sensitive skin , that I dedicate this article. First let me say there is no right or wrong way to shave. There are many who espouse a regimented routine , but really it 's not an exact science and too much regimen is not fun. And I want you to enjoy your shaving experience. Every person is different and has their own unique whisker pattern and beard texture. Therefore it is more about paying attention to best practice ideas and incorporating them into your own style of shaving. So let 's get started : </shave.v.1832><shave.v.1833>Havin never really used shave creams having tending to stick to the usual Gillette gels i decided having recently acquired a Parker 89r razor i should back it up with an appropriate brush and cream. My Proraso cream arrived this weekend , so thought i would test it out. The shave was far smoother , and closer to the skin. The razor just flowed across the skin with the Eucalyptus leaving a slight tingle on the face. Hardly any cream is required on the brush to create a good lather , so i would highly recommend this product at a fantastic price </shave.v.1833><shave.v.1834>If you have a very important event at the end of the week , and you need your face looking clean and smooth , wet shaving is the way to go. Many men , however , worry about getting razor burn , cutting themselves , or marring their skin the day of. For great recommendations , read any of the above comments as they ' re bound to be full of good commentary. However , here are my best two tips for an EASY and CLEAN shave . </shave.v.1834><shave.v.1835>The best time to shave a cat 's nose is immediately after bathing. With the cat wrapped in a towel and happy to be over the ordeal of a bath , the nose shaving is usually an anticlimax and can be done very quickly with the cat raising no objection. This is also a good time to remove any plaque from the teeth . </shave.v.1835><shave.v.1836> Were you paid by the word for this piece ? Yes , some people are dumb enough to watch Fox News. So what ? Nice try with the cloak-and-dagger stuff , as if anyone would care that a writer for a minor free paper was there. They probably sent out a press release about the meeting , because they were afraid of media attention. Good thing you shaved to avoid detection . </shave.v.1836><shave.v.1837>Shaving or derma-planing is why we men look so young. Just kidding , but men who shave tend to have fewer fine wrinkles than women because we are constantly removing older skin and rejuvenating our skin by stimulating the skin to recycle . </shave.v.1837><shave.v.1838>How should I shave ? How should I ... shave ? - it was Leo Hickman in his book A Good Life , who gave the me the idea of going back to an old fashioned safety razor.

KU has made an exemplary start here at King of Shaves Senior School. From the first day of term he has made an instant impression on the entire class.

I know and I agree completely. I shave because I want to , not because anyone else wants me to , not even my fiance ! It 's fine for a man to have his preferences , but to be SO focused on tiny little details is beyond me. Sex ( if you 're any good at it , that is ) is about a lot more than some hair. Sex is not supposed to be neat and ordered and regimented , and neither are women ! If a guy freaks out over some hair ( which is a sign of a sexually mature woman ) then you know for sure he is going to be an uptight lover , and those are no fun . </shave.v.1840><shave.v.1841>Im using gillete cream gel with the shick shaver along with a brush to apply the gel and I use a Electric shave to get the whiskers standing.

Cool young dudes no longer use hairdressers , preferring traditional barber shops , where they will be shorn and shaved. There is , I start to see , an exquisite luxury in having someone do it for you. In the old days , barbers were tiny havens , gentlemen 's clubs in all but name , where peers might toddle off for quiet afternoon naps. Now they have morphed into rather snazzy emporia furnished with funky retro kit . </shave.v.1847><shave.v.1848>For the first pass , shave downwards ( possibly at a slight angle ) . This will remove a majority of facial hair. With a good double-edge razor , you should apply no pressure. The weight of the razor itself is enough to do the job.

Though it 's debated , I see no comfort or convenience advantage to these. ... One thing I 've found with the Slim is that it 's really necessary to soften the hairs first. Since shaving typically follows a wet steamy shower anyway , this is a non-issue.

From using the Mach3 , this is a big improvement. I shave everyday , and not only my face I shave my head with this razor also , everyday. The blades do last , I get 3 weeks easy on a blade.

Avoid , at all costs , the " hairy boxer shorts " look. For myself , I no longer have a single hair on my body. I go through six razors per week. I look forward to the day when science gives us a pill that suppresses the hair-producing gene . </shave.v.1854><shave.v.1855>If for some reason you used your puny mach 3 to shave against the grain , the friction would cause it to heat up and explode in a giant fireball.

This time around ... I highly doubt that I will be making this request of him again . </shave.v.1856><shave.v.1857>Is learning to shave difficult ? Yes , it is must more difficult that you might believe. I also know a Texas licensed Class A Barber and she told me that she was practicing shaving on blown up balloons. If that sounds weird - think about it. A close shave that doesn ' t cut the client can be pretty tricky. If you can literally shave a blown up balloon without popping it , will chances are good the barber can do a great shave without any nicks or cuts . </shave.v.1857><shave.v.1858>This transparent shaving cream allows you to easily shave and style your beard.

They wo n't shave quite as close as a razor , and it takes several passes to get all the hairs , but they are gentle enough to use every day. I currently use the Panasonic ES8092 Pro-Curve Pivot Action shaver , and love it. It has a micro-screen covering over the blades , and a pop-up trimmer on the back that is great for the bikini line. It 's worth the investment . . . finally I can wear capris and tank tops more than once a week in the summer.

Hate to Wait </shave.v.1862><shave.v.1863>In the eighth year of Hijri , the Prophet sent a letter with Hadhrat Abdullah Ibn Huthafah to Feroz , the king of Persia. Feroz tore the letter apart and ordered Bazan , the king of Yemen to send two officers to the Prophet to kidnap him. They arrived in Madinah Munawwarah , on seeing the Prophet , started to shiver. However the Prophet asked them , Who ordered you to leave your moustache and shave your beard ? They replied , Our Lord ( referring to their King ) . The Prophet declared , But my Lord orders me to trim the moustache and lengthen the beard . Those who shave their beards should decide for themselves whether their Lord is Allah or someone else ! Just imagine how much pain the Prophet must be going through due to all of those people who shave , as these two men were fire worshippers , but never the less , the Prophet could not bear to look at their faces . </shave.v.1863><shave.v.1864>I shave my ass for a number of reasons. One- it gets sweaty and after a rigorous hike it gets pretty rank down there ( and in the middle of the wilderness there are no showers ) . Two- it makes wiping easier , especially for pee , because girls have to wipe off the pee and do n't have a winky to shake off. Three- I hate " pube pull " , when my hair gets caught in a pad or underwear elastic. Finally- During my period I ca n't stand the way all the clots get stuck in the pubes and take forever to get out. I really do n't have the time or the desire to deal with a rug in my crotch . </shave.v.1864><shave.v.1865>Today is the 3rd anniversary of the day a rebellious , clinically depressed and by all accounts bat $ h ! t insane Britney Spears rolled into a salon and shaved her head . </shave.v.1865><shave.v.1866> nydailynews.com Singer Cassie shocked fans this weekend when she showed off her dramatic new look on Twitter.

Then one day I needed shaving cream while I was up at my cottage. You can imagine cottage country is not exactly the place to find high end beauty products ! I went into a chain drug store and just picked up something cheap that caught my eye. It was eos. I am now hooked. I don ' t think this stuff costs more than $ 4-5 , and I love it.

The debate as to the best shaver can go on forever. I hope you 've been following the survey pages as well as this forum. Everyone knows my personal preference is one of the Philishave/Norelco Reflex Action shavers. Mine gives me a very quick shave. The new Philishave/Norelco Quadra Action shavers are getting higher marks in the survey pages currently. The Quadra Action line is waterproof for easier cleaning. Otherwise , some people find maintaining rotary shavers to be a chore. But they are sturdier than foil shavers which can make maintaining them less expensive. Rotary shavers are better at shaving long whiskers as well. If you want a corded version of either one of these shavers , they are not available in the USA , but they are available in Canada. ( Good thing there are on-line shaver shops in Canada. ) If other people have their own opinions , please let me know.

Get a good lather going ( have a look at the videos by Mantic on lathering on YouTube ) , then when you shave , use as little pressure as possible. I would recommend just a single pass the first time you try , to get your neck used to it ( you ' ll probably still have some stubble , and may nick yourself ) . Leave it a day or two then try again , adding a cross-grain pass. Keep this up until you ' re ready for an against-grain pass as well , and you ' re home free . </shave.v.1878><shave.v.1879>I don ' t really shave all too often maybe 2-3 times a week.

I hope this helps . </shave.v.1887><shave.v.1888>Some boys may be comfortable asking to shave and others may feel awkward talking about it. When your son begins sprouting facial hair , do n't be afraid to broach the subject. If you are n't sure how to bring it up , keep it light to show your son that shaving is n't something to be embarrassed about. A good opener is to ask your son if any of his friends have started shaving . </shave.v.1888><shave.v.1889>I hate shaving ! Thankfully I do n't have the same problem as some other men which requires me to shave every day , but even at every second day it 's a hassle.

Also , I ca n't wear shorts/skirts/bathing suit on days 4-7 because my hair is so dark &amp;thick.

Combined with a good shave prep , shaving becomes quite an enjoyable activity. There is a steep learning curve but if you 've got the time , go for it and leave the fusion at the back of the bathroom cabinet. I used my merkur for 3 months and have some very good shaves. However you have to shave very carefully , and adjust your strokes and angle of the blade for the contours of your face. Something that a sensor excel does for you. Furthermore , my skin looks more refreshed after a shave with a multi-blade probably because it shaves closer etc. Honestly , buy this because you have time to learn how to use it and if you have tough mature skin that can take the sharp blade. I 'm 21 , my skin is still supple and sensitive so I do n't think I 'm quite ready for the merkur. Back to the sensor for me !

When a man wears a beard , you can not see his face. Thus , if you are ugly , as I am , and you wear a beard , as I do , your uglyness is disguised by your beard.

Keep a small tupperware container filled with rubbing alcohol to a depth of about 1 inch. Immediately after shaving , dunk the head of your razor in the alcohol and swirl it around for a few seconds.

I have noticed no reduction in hair yet or slower growth , I am using it every day as you would if you were to shave but I 'm hoping after the second months I 'll see some results. I would never compare it to laser though , when you do laser the hair falls off immediately and you are left hair free for at least 3 weeks , plus the reduction in hair density is experienced the first time you do it.

There is nothing effeminate about moisturising. I always moisturise after shaving. This soothes any aggression the skin faces in its tryst with the razor. After all , these are really keen blades running over your skin. Men with oily skin do not need as much moisturising as men with dry skin. Don t assume you automatically need a moisturiser because your face feels taut after you shave it. Wait half an hour as it takes your facial skin some time to restore lost moisture.

Men once went to the barber for a shave until , in the late 1800s , the safety razor arrived. The safety razor was a thing of beauty , an indestructible chrome weapon that sat snugly in the hand. Replacement blades were pennies for a dozen. Then something very sinister happened. In 1895 barber King Camp Gillette -- yes , that was his real name -- figured that he could make millions by marketing a disposable razor. The razor would n't shave any better than the safety razor -- in fact , it would be considerably worse -- but what difference did that make ? There were holdouts , however. I remember seeing a safety razor in my grandfather 's house , and my oldest brother used one well into the early 1970s.

If you 're happy with the way you are shaving , I 'd stay with what you 're doing. The shaver companies have been promoting wet/dry shavers to those who want to try electric shavers but want to retain the experience of wet shaving. Both Panasonic with their Linear 8000 series and Philips with their Philishave Cool Skin and Norelco Advantage shavers have been very successful in their marketing of wet/dry shavers. But those of us who have been using dry electric shavers for several years like the convenience of not using water while shaving.

You should come to some agreement with him on a kind of haircut that does not resemble kaafir women , because if you leave it long , it will be a lot of trouble to wash it and comb it. So if the hair is very long or thick , and the woman cuts it to reduce its length or volume , that doesn ' t matter.

The legendary brilliance of King Gillette was to sell razors below cost and blades above way above cost. Today , a Fusion razor with one extra cartridge is only $ 10 , the magical amount at which most middle-class Americans will make an impulse purchase. A new safety razor from Merkur , one of the few remaining manufacturers in the category , is around $ 30. And whereas Gillette ' s Edge shaving gel goes for $ 2 or $ 3 a can , a tube of Italy ' s Proraso shave cream is $ 9 , and many other shave creams come in tubs priced at $ 25 or more. A good badger-hair shaving brush does not , it turns out , have to cost three figures ( though there are plenty of merchants who will happily sell you one for that amount ) , but it will not be less than $ 40 . </shave.v.1979><shave.v.1980>Well , you know I am.

For example , in the Book of Jeremiah we read about a group of pilgrims mourning the destruction of the Temple : " There came certain men from Shechem , from Shiloh , and from Samaria , eighty men , having their beards shaven and their clothes rent , and having cut themselves , with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring them to the house of YHWH. " ( Jeremiah 41 : 5 ) . We see that these pilgrims were mourning and therefore tore their clothes , cut their skin , and shaved their beards.

However , they do n't even come close to The Total Shaving Solution in terms of ease of use , closeness of shave and comfort. Also , I really did n't expect the Razor Mate to work , but it has increased the useful life of my Mach Turbo blades from 1.5 weeks to almost a month.

I 'm resigned to having to use my beard trimmer to reshape my goatee twice a month as I have not found a way to shave around my goatee without my beard growing in physical size over time. The same principle applies to sideburn creep as the sideburns grow longer unless the trimmer is used to keep the sideburns from growing too long. You can tell if you 're shaving too close to the beard when you feel the shaver pulling on the edge of the beard.

After dropping the political cause I formerly applied to not shaving , I am actually embarrassed when I go out in public looking like I am a trained monkey who escaped the circus. Since it no longer is an act of rebellion , it just advertises that I am a slob. I feel the judgments more keenly. Not only the shocked glares passerby throw at me for violating social norms , but also at those who appear with me. While on the phone with a friend in Ft.

If you still find yourself with razor burn despite taking preventative measures , you can soothe irritated skin with aloe vera gel or a cortisone cream like Cortisone-10 Plus ( $ 8.99 , walgreens.com ) , which contains anti-inflammatory cortisone along with aloe , vitamin E and other skin-soothing ingredients . </shave.v.2003><shave.v.2004>There is a great demonstration by a world famous sharpening expert ( whom I greatly respect ) of him taking a dull , double-bitted axe and honing it to razor sharpness in minutes , and shaving a full beard off his face.

She 's half Italian , half Welsh ( that 's means from Wales you tarts ! ) . There 's two things about being an Italian. First , they got some big thighs. Big thighs mean big butts.

They got hair on their back , they got mustaches , leg hair , maybe some hair in some other places , but let 's stop the damn list there. The main thing is they have leg hair. It 's just that most girls shave them. Yes , she shaves her legs. If she did n't shave her legs , she 'd probably look like a grizzly bear , since she 's 50 Italian . </shave.v.2014><shave.v.2015>The growing of beards is also related to our topic. Al-Bukhari , on the authority of Ibn 'Umar , reported the Prophet ( peace be on him ) as saying , " Be different from the polytheists ( mushrikeen ) : let the beard grow and trim the moustache. " The purpose here , as the hadith states , is to be different from the polytheists , who , in the particular instance cited , were Zoroastrians , the worshippers of fire , whose practice was either to clip or shave their beards. The Prophet 's command to be different from them was intended to train the Muslims in developing an independent personality , distinct in its inner reality as well as in outward appearance , in substance as well as in form. At the same time , shaving the beard is an affront to the masculine nature , as it is an attempt to resemble women , while the beard is an integral part of masculinity and a distinctive feature of the male sex . </shave.v.2015><shave.v.2016>I ca n't tell you enough how much I love your shaving oil !

It was a really great experience for Jen. Not that I think she needs make up to look beautiful , but it was great to see her with these other cancer paitents. There were six women there , four were breast cancer patients and two were lung cancer patients. It was an amazing process to watch her with her newly shaved head and how strong and bold she was in the group. As I watched Jen talk to these other women about what she has been doing from shaving her head , the music the loaded to empower her self , to the caribou peppermints that have been helping with nausa.

Art of Shaving makes a very good one , though it is expensive , but there are others out there as well . </shave.v.2024><shave.v.2025>Eventually , I decided to do away with the canned gels and go with a shaving brush , oil , and cream setup.

Try using Skintimate with Aloe Vera , and shave either against or with the hair. Go slowly , and try standing in the shower or sitting- whatever is easiest.

Shaving should be a pleasurable , if not cathartic experience if done right. Men ' s facial hair is often coarse , difficult to manage , and downright itchy , so it is important to know how to get rid of it in a way that will make you feel refreshed. In the interest of improving men ' s skin care , The Body Shop is happy to present these 3 steps to the perfect shave in order to make your face-shaving experience the best it can be. Ladies , hopefully you won ' t need these tips , but feel free to share them with the guy in your life . </shave.v.2052><shave.v.2053>Shave after you shower : Apply a Shave oil first for extra lubrication : Only use a sharp razor : Rinse your blade in hot water only : First Shave with the direction then across your hair follicles , which do vary , so analyse your whole facial beard growth : Use a clear Gel if you have problem skin or cream if normal. Do not use alcohol based foaming gels. Do not shave backwards against hair growth. As this only causes ingrown hairs. Use a Face scrub once a week to exfoliate and prevent blackheads or ingrown hairs. Rinse face after shaving with cold water. Apply a soothing natural Shave Balm to soothe and calm irritated skin. Do not apply an Alcohol Cologne to any recently shaved skin area ( face or neck ) Make these changes and you may actually find shaving becomes an enjoyable experience rather than a X-Men nightmare. Just to keep you motivated , recent surveys ' stated that 99.8 of females preferred their man to be clean and smoothly shaven , so forget any ideas about the Miami Vice look ! </shave.v.2053><shave.v.2054>Shaving soaps from Col.

( 2 1/4 " in diameter ) </shave.v.2054><shave.v.2055>Shaving does have its advantages though. Face shaving is an invasive activity. Applying a sharp metal blade to your face cuts hairs. Using your shaving brush , lather the face in a circular motion. This ensures that you lubricate the skin and get under the beard stubble. Don ' t shave as soon as you get up. Shave with the grain of the hair on your face. Shaving your beard stubble against the grain can cause redness , razor burn and rashes. Rinse the head of your razor in warm water after every stroke. All razor strokes should be slow and deliberate. After you have finished your shave , rinse your face in warm water and apply an after shave balm or mousturiser , to sooth and protect the face. Don ' t wash your face with soap. Soaps are usually very drying on the skin and coupled with shaving . </shave.v.2055><shave.v.2056>My beard is quite unruly at this point. People put their money away when I walk in a room , I leave a tip and the waitress chases me out to the street telling me I forgot money , hitchikers put their thumbs down when they see me approaching. 6 weeks , it looks bad. My girl looks at me like I 've got 6 months to live , but her curiosity is so strong she does n't want me to shave , and I ca n't bring myself to shave because at this point I feel like I 'd be cutting off an ear or something . </shave.v.2056><shave.v.2057>Then she is on a search for the wigs she bought years ago , when chemotherapy followed her mastectomy.

She is now eleven and is five feet four inches and walks with a dancer 's grace. Jan enters the room first , and Anna whispers , " Do n't tell Lindsay. " Jan says , " I already did. " Anna makes a face , but when Lindsay rounds the corner , she stares at her mother for a second and says , " I thought Dad shaved it off ! " Then she sees it 's the wig. Anna yanks it off her head -- " Ta-da ! " -- throws it to her daughter , who laughs loudly along with her . </shave.v.2057><shave.v.2058>it is a taboo for a woman to shave her head ? I thought it would be like a tattoo or piercing , just not permanent. Just the couple people I mentioned it to and an internet search let ' s me know that this is going to get a big reaction. Anyways I researched and then listed all the reasons I could find for a woman to shave her head. I am not saying any are right or wrong , justing listing what I found . </shave.v.2058><shave.v.2059>uhh i shaved mine and these little red dots appeared like immediately..how logn till they go away ? also how fast does it grow back cause its growing back kinda sharpish and the hairs are all pricky and it hurts like a mother . </shave.v.2059><shave.v.2060>Most of the major points have been stated several times but one that ' s worth stating slightly differently is take a day or two off every week. I have to shave for work , and by Friday , I feel like the skin on my face is .well , razor thin . </shave.v.2060><shave.v.2061>Which brings me to a realization.. I was going to shave just to make society happier. Meaning Everett , meaning anyone else that would ever make me feel unconfortable or ugly or gross for my decision. Because in the end , it would make me happier to be accepted. Well screw that. I am not going to bow down and fucking shave just because it will make me more " acceptable " and therefore " happy " . I should be able to make a minor decision like restraining from use of a razor without all this heartbreak . </shave.v.2061><shave.v.2062>Well , I have never had a girl shave my face. I think it could happen though. Myself , I want to be able to shave her legs right back. I think that would be a very nice moment. : ) </shave.v.2062><shave.v.2063>A note about aftercare : You should continue with the lotion and baby powder for the next week or so , or until you shave down there again , whichever comes first. I 've found that 10 days is an appropriate amount of time to go between shaves. And yes , for the first few weeks it will itch. This is true with any body part that you 've never shaved before after it 's been shaven. It can be remedied with anti-itch cream , lotion , or powder. Or you could just live with it . </shave.v.2063><shave.v.2064>It ' s all over the news , so I won ' t bother peppering you with details of how Britney Spears shaved her head. Instead , let ' s look at how we can look at this tragic event , as Britney ' s manager Larry Rudolph was reported to have put it . </shave.v.2064><shave.v.2065>At the end of the day , however , you have to realize that hair is just a collection of dead cells sitting on top of your head. Do what you want to do with it , grow it out , keep it short , or shave it off. Express yourself , have a ball , and do n't be too concerned about it. After all , it 's all good ! </shave.v.2065><shave.v.2066>Aside from the luxurious , cushioning lather one can make using a decent badger hair shaving brush ( highly recommended ) , Proraso 's strength is also its drawback. The cooling , tingling sensation of menthol and eucalyptus oil is a pleasurable experience for many , but harsh for those with highly sensitive skin ( and noses ) . So be forewarned if you think you may fall into the latter category. Being in the former category , my experience with Proraso has been like a dream come true. Where Proraso really shines , though , is in the post shave; the moment after the last bit of lather has been rinsed away. A cold water rinse follow-up truly ramps up the invigorating pleasure of this cream ... a bracing wake up call for those groggy , early morning shaves . </shave.v.2066><shave.v.2067>In some families , family members or friends all shave their heads for their loved one as a sign of support. I do n't know if I 'd want my family to do the same. Have n't been there and hopefully wo n't have to. Do n't think that I 'd want them to . </shave.v.2067><shave.v.2068>Next myth soap. As I explained earlier soap is drying to the face , it 's got very harsh astringents in it that strip away all the moisture on you face. So the goal is always wash your face and cleanse before you start to shave and you do n't want to use the same soap that you just use cleaning other body areas , other private parts or things like that. Why would you put that on your face ? So what I recommend doing is using a cleanser. So soap is bad , targeted cleanser is good . </shave.v.2068><shave.v.2069>The kit is definitely a great starter , but shaving technique is ultimately what will result in a great shave and solve your/your boyfriend/spouse/husband 's shaving issues.

As ridiculous as it sounds , the ensuing rush on razors , brushes , and creams created a worldwide shortage of shaving goods -- vendors reported doing a year 's worth of business in a few days. Overnight , funky vintage razors caked with hobo whiskers and soap scum that used to go for a few bucks on eBay suddenly began climbing to well over $ 100. Up had become down , cats began dancing with dogs , and the handful of online devotees who 'd been beating a lonely paradiddle for traditional wetshaving all these years , beseeching the masses to throw down their Mach3s and pressurized cans of goo , nonetheless began loudly grumbling that the "  $ yuppies " were now storming the gates. Ai n't populism grand ? </shave.v.2070><shave.v.2071>The Art of Manliness is a big proponent of the classic wet shave. There ' s something almost ritualistic about a traditional shave. Between lathering up with a badger brush and guiding a double-edge safety razor across your face , it ' s possible to reach a state of zen. Unfortunately , most men shave with cheapo disposable crap that costs an arm and a leg and gives you a crappy shave. Safety razor shaving , on the other hand , is much cheaper and provides a far superior shave . </shave.v.2071><shave.v.2072>The photo above is an ad from the May 1915 issue of Harper ' s Bazaar , reported to be the first time that women were encouraged to shave their pits. According to The Straight Dope , within three months of the ad appearing , the once-shocking term ' underarm ' was being used. A few ads mentioned hygiene as a motive for getting rid of hair but most appealed strictly to the ancient yearning to be hip. ' The Woman of Fashion says the underarm must be as smooth as the face , ' read a typical pitch. </shave.v.2072><shave.v.2073>Here 's one customer who wo n't wait long to reorder , I just plain love the stuff , it shaves well , and I swear my razor rash is disappearing , although some of that is due to using " Tend Skin " , but still , it was not healing this quickly until your product is applied , now morning and nite.

It allowed me to pose as just a bald headed guy by choice in hopes that I could avoid undue concern ( I work in a restaurant ) . As it turned out I had not the wit to reaize that my mouse protein treatments do not cause hair loss ( nor gain ) and it is impossible to keep secrets when so many people live at the periphery of your life.

I had electrolysis on the bikini area , which is coarse and would otherwise cause lots of problems. Also , I definitely shave carefully with a sharp razor , and in the opposite direction that the hair grows ( eg sideways on the bikini area ) . you should n't really be getting lots of nicks. Oh , unless you 're also getting goosebumps in the shower. I have to close the door and window and let the steam build up , because if I get a little chill I end up shaving off goosebumps. You might try different women 's razors till you find one that works , and you might try either making sure you 've got lots of soap later or use a good shaving cream. And do n't ever shave dry.

I used less pressure and tried it dry this time. It performed better and I got a reasonably close shave on parts of my face , particularly my cheeks , but it again failed to closely shave my neck. What was worst is it would shave patches of my neck reasonably closely , but leave certain small patches virtually unshaved , so I 'd have these isolates tufts of long whiskers. What was most disturbing is that repeated attempts to shave off those whiskers , simply failed. I went back and forth and tried coming at them from every conceivable angle , but the shaver refused to cut them . </shave.v.2085><shave.v.2086>Remember the great shave you received from your barber ?

If you want your junior people to follow the regs and do the right thing when no one is watching ( Committment ) then I beleieve you should shave prior to coming to work , period. By not doing so gives the impression I do n't abide by the rules except when on duty and that to me is unacceptable.

With the use of magnification it will be seen that some follicular bundles are absent ( and there are wider spaces between remaining bundles ) and that some bundles are significantly miniaturized. It will then be possible to place new recipient sites in the place of absent bundles and alongside miniaturized bundles to recreate the density. This can also be done in a uniform manner so that if the pre-existing hair eventually disappears , due to progression of hair loss , the hair transplant can still look reasonably natural. If the recipient site is not shaved the hair restoration surgeon must part through the hair again and again looking for any empty spaces and trying to fill the spaces as best as possible. This is not really as exact a process but much more hit or miss . </shave.v.2131><shave.v.2132>Phytomer Homme Rasage Perfect Shaving Mask - 150ml PHY-501067 Phytomer Homme Rasage Perfect Shaving Mask - 150ml This exclusive shaving mask formula is more effective than traditional shaving mousses.

Hadhrat Hasan Basri reports a Hadeeth that the nation of Lut was punished for 10 sins they committed; the Prophet mentioned ' trimming the beard ' from the 10 sins. These sins then resulted in severe punishments from Allah the Almighty as mentioned in the Holy Quran in numerous chapters. Gradually other nations also started to trim and shave their beards but were less in number. However in the 17th century , the King of Russia , Patrice propagated ' shaving of the beard ' in Europe and was successful in his mission. In the 20th century , the Ottoman Empire collapsed and modern influences swamped nations. By the mid 20th century , these influences had penetrated the Muslim world , which has gradually resulted on corrupting Muslims.

Perhaps the second opinion , that it is makruh , is nearer to the truth and more moderate. As the stated reason for growing the beard is to be different from the non-believers , it is similar to the matter of dyeing gray hair in order to be distinct from the Jews and Christians; it is known that some of the sahabah did not dye their gray hair , signifying that it was commendable rather than obligatory. Similarly , growing the beard may be regarded as commendable but not obligatory , and , accordingly , shaving it would be classified as makruh rather than haram. It is true that none of the sahabah was known to have shaved his beard. Perhaps there was no need to shave , and perhaps growing the beard was a custom among them . </shave.v.2156><shave.v.2157>Good looking dog ( in the before picture LOL , but you did a very good job w/ the shave down ! ) .

However , I am not a newbie; and I do know a thing or two about wet shaving. Another thing I also know as a living fact is that if a newbie buys the wrong brush he will probably never learn to wet shave properly. Saddled with the wrong brush he will either overcut , undercut , crush the brush breech , crack the brush casing or create the conditions for both wet and dry rot within the shaving brush itself. This is not to suggest that learning to wet shave is something too difficult for the average person to undertake. Such a notion is utter nonsense. If someone can fry an egg , brush his teeth and dress himself , he can also learn to wet shave. At the same time this does not suggest that every wet shaver will be able to execute a perfect four minute gloss cut with a new Feather platinum blade.

On arriving in Delhi , he was informed that this poet has gone to the barbers. He proceeds towards the barbers and what does he see ? The poet is having his beard shaved. He cries out ' O ' the one who claims to love the Prophet , you are shaving your beard ! The poet replies yes , but I am not hurting anyone ' s feelings , they continued their debate. Finally , the Iranian exclaimed , you claim that you are not hurting anyone ' s feelings , I warn you that you are hurting the feelings of the one who is the leader in this world and the hereafter , the Prophet . On hearing this remark , he fainted , when he regained consciousness he accepted and admitted his mistake , repented to Allah , The most forgiving and thanked the Iranian for guiding him . </shave.v.2185><shave.v.2186>" Hmm ...

Old-school shaving is also called " wet " shaving , and the best way to do it is to keep your face as wet as possible. I picked up the Merkur. If you 've spent most of your life using disposables or even the higher-end Sensors and Excels , the switch back to single-blade can be a real adjustment. For one thing , the razor is heavier. With a decent safety razor you do n't push the blade much; you simple let it glide down the face. I tried to remember all I had learned from the websites : always shave with the direction hair grows; shaving against results in razor burn. Do n't force the blade . </shave.v.2198><shave.v.2199>" I have no doubt that this razor is n't to everyone 's taste as it can slice you up pretty well in double quick time if you do n't give it some respect !

In fact , it left me with a certain degree of abrasiveness on top. It also hurt quite a bit. I then switched to the mach 3 razor that Gilette makes. I prefer the mach 3 to other razors because it has a longer head- it 's more stable and less likely to shred up your scalp. Good luck , and clean shaves !

Cut. Which blade ? You have choices between single , twin-edged , triple-edged or even quadruple-edged. ( See Cecil 's report on single vs. twin blades. ) The act of shaving actually pulls your whiskers up slightly from the skin , so that a second blade about 60/1000ths of an inch behind the first blade can indeed cut the whisker again before it has a chance to recede. Thus , in theory , multiple edges give a closer shave.

This way , if the contributor wants me to make any alterations to the posting , I can easily do that. As for your actual questions , while I have n't had any experience with Parks products , I can give my experiences with similar shaving aids. A good cleaner/lubricant I believe should be used on an electric shaver about once a month. As I use a Philishave ( Norelco ) Micro Action or Reflex Action shaver , I use the Philips spray lubricant recommended for those models after I use their electrosonic head cleaner. The instuctions for the Philips spray lubricant says to use the spray while the shaver is running. As for pre/aft lotion , I would prefer using it before shaving as this lubricates the skin and helps to make the whiskers stand up to aid in shaving. On summer days like today when the weather is humid and sticky , a pre-shave is highly recommended to make the shaver glide better on the skin.

It is HUGE . </shave.v.2259><shave.v.2260>secondly , it is a myth that hair grows back darker and coarser. hair grows in cycles , and when it is unshaven , each follicle is in a different part of the cycle. when you shave , all the hairs start over at the same time , so to speak. the hair is coarser only in that the end is now blunt from the razor 's cut ( the next strand of the cycle will bring a softer tip , if not shaven or cut ) . the hair itself is not coarser. nor does it come in any darker. let it all grow out for a few weeks after shaving , and you will see that it is EXACTLY the same as it was before shaving. even if it did change , i hardly think shaving is something an 11-year-old must " commit " to . </shave.v.2260><shave.v.2261>" I was quite nervous about using this for the first time after reading some of the horror story style reviews. So with some trepidation I massaged in some pre-shave oil , brushed on the shaving soap , called for an ambulance to be on standby , and went for it. The first thing I noticed was the sound. It sounds like a proper shave should , with a satisfying rasp the blade moves over your skin. I tried it on level 1 which did n't give me the closest of shaves , but nevertheless I enjoyed it. The best bit of advice I read was not to apply any pressure but to let the weight of the razor do the work , I thoroughly agree. Going to try level 2 next time and wo n't bother with the ambulance. If you buy this i recommend you take your time and enjoy. Thanks Merkur.

Everybody says use unscented soap , or hydrating soap , etc. but the truth is - forget soap ! There are special shaving gels just for that - not general , but meant for the bikini area. Mine is called Bikini Zone Anti-Bumps Shave Gel and it does miracles ! Of course it takes a couple of shavings until your skin gets used to it and heals ( if you had bumps already ) but I 'm telling you , this thing + a new sharp razor make my skin soft and smooth without pain , even down there , and yeah even inside the labia.

This means using a high-quality , multi-blade razor and shaving in the same direction that the hair grows. To do this , " map " your face with fingers or a credit card to feel or hear the direction change. Typically , hair will grow downward from your temple until about your Adam 's apple. However , it 's around that area that hair growth direction will vary from man to man. You 'll need to find out exactly where your hair growth changes so you can shave in the proper direction.

I look forward to using better blades in the future. I finish with splash of Florida water followed by Nivea after shave balm. I have read about the Art of Shaving line and would love to try some of their products . </shave.v.2288><shave.v.2289>Rebecca says : Next , you need a single-edged razor. Double-edged razors shave VERY close ... and pull hairs ... and cut it under the skin line. People with sensitive skin will often break out ... because their skin closes ... and the growing hair will irritate the skin as it tries to find it 's way to the surface again. Some will even have the skin heal quickly , then end up with ingrown hairs. So the double-edged razor ? Give them to Dad for father 's day. And buy single edged for your private bits. They can be cheap razors ... but they should be new and clean . </shave.v.2289><shave.v.2290>A better way to go would be to use a moisturizer or shave balm after you finish shaving. There are many on the market , both men 's and generic. Think about it , shaving takes its toll on the epidermal , do a little repair work after you are done. If you use cologne try and find an apr s shave balm or moisturizer from the same designer , otherwise try and find an odorless balm. When you do splash on the cologne I suggest you aim low on the neck and the back of the neck . </shave.v.2290><shave.v.2291>OK.OK. I know that cats probably do n't want to be shaved , and there are those out there that would might even consider it cruel. But they sure do look funny when they 've got a nice shaved pattern in their fur. Seems to take some of that " cat attitude " out of them . </shave.v.2291><shave.v.2292>Competition is fierce. Why ? Because the market for non-disposable razors in this tiny country of two million men is worth about $ 30 million a year , Dave McLeod , the New Zealand manager of market minnow King of Shaves , told the Sunday Star-Times last year. The separate shaving preparations market is worth about a third of that. In the US the male razor market tops $ US2 billion. Gillette claims about 70 of the market here , which is typical. Schick-Wilkinson Sword , now owned by Energizer , the batteries people , is probably its fiercest rival , with others like Super-Max and King of Shaves biting at their spring-loaded heels. Lawsuits frequently fly over intellectual property shavers are some of the most patented consumer products around . </shave.v.2292><shave.v.2293>Several others have mentioned the hot towel and for times when you shave without a hot shower first , it really helps.

I had read all about their authentic ice-shaving machine and unique syrup flavors and was pretty excited to try this place. A word of warning : do n't go to NOLA Ice expecting to find something comparable to the snoballs you can get in New Orleans - the ones here are smaller , pricier , and somehow do n't hold the syrup as well ( I do n't know if it 's that the ice has a different texture , or if the syrup has a different consistency ) . </shave.v.2295><shave.v.2296>hi , i have really long dark gorgeous hair but I am absolutely dying to shave it all off.

I have always felt a woman with unsahaven legs was a sexual turn on. Under arms ? Not so much , but still OK if unshaven , but squeaky clean. For what it 's worth , shaved private parts are mcuh less attractive as compared to a full bush . </shave.v.2298><shave.v.2299>Tips : If you have sensitive skin , you might want to avoid actually shaving that crease between the upper thighs and the abdomen. Every time I shave that , I get terrible razor burn , and the prickles that grow back itch like crazy , 'cause they poke every which way into both the abdomen side and the thigh side. Personally , I only trim that area and the labia area with scissors , rather than shaving there , 'cause I 've found that it 's almost impossible to shave those areas without creating painful prickles , ingrown hairs , and an uneven appearance. Perhaps I 'd be able to make that work if I had an electric shaver , but I ca n't afford one right now . </shave.v.2299><shave.v.2300>Solution : High-end products. Newly shaved skin itches if it has tiny cracks and bacteria. Chemicals used in shaving products irritate it further. I ditch basic razors for razors with aloe vera strips that sooth while I shave. Razors with rubber strips that stretch you facial skin while shaving too are also a good solution. For immediate relief , try creams or lotions made with natural ingredients. Benadryl creams , which contain antihistamines , also provide instant relief. Use a skin repair serum if you are over forty . </shave.v.2300><shave.v.2301>OK I am a hairy guys except my head which I was balding and started shaving. I personally like hairy or Natural men. On the other hand I think the Bear community my have gone too far sometimes and shuns the naturally hairless. I have had many guys ask me if I mind if they are smooth. It is a non issue to me if the guy is a good man. Now if they shave pubes I find it too prepubescent and turns me off although I have shaved my nuts or others for fun a couple times. I think we should accept who we are but if you want to change for your self fine but NEVER do it for anyone else . </shave.v.2301><shave.v.2302>Anyway ... she said that when she was in labor ... they shaved her..

What suggestions do you have to minimize the neck irritation I can expect following years without shaving ? Can I expect less discomfort if I have the beard removed by a pro using a straight razor ? Once I am back on the electric , it appears that there is no concensus pick for sensitive necks. You have recommended both wet-shaving and , more recently , slotted heads. I would appreciate any ideas on how to decide what would be best for my VERY sensitive neck. Also , any reason not to return to using my old ( 10yrs+ ) Norelco Rototract 950RX ? It did an OK job , but it regularly bothered my neck. I would certainly buy any shaver which would give me pain-free shaving. Thank you ! </shave.v.2306><shave.v.2307>The biggest no no is to use a mens razor. Yes people do try but only once ! ! ! While a razor may work for your face your lower extremedies are a whole different matter. The best thing to use is a personal grooming tool.

As an impressionable twelve-year-old kid , I quickly fell in love with the sport ' s adrenaline surges. As much as I enjoyed my kid ' s race on that first night , the real fun was watching the elite race. Those men and women flew around the course , flowing like water over rocks and roots , whipping their bikes down the singletrack and sprinting to the finish. Those muscular athletes were the first real bike racers that I ever saw. They all had shaved legs , which I thought looked very weird.

So , no it is not for wimps , it can be though for men to please their women ! I buy the shave cream , and always get him one with skin conditioners.

The main differences between the two product lines are that the Quadra Action shavers add holes to 33 of the shaving surface to get the shorter whiskers better with the rest of the surface being slots , while the Reflex Action heads are all slots which have a slight microgroove on them.

However , having tried this method for several months , I don ' t recommend it for shaving the face. Hand soap doesn ' t lather as well as shaving cream , so it doesn ' t lubricate as well and you may have to reapply the soap in the middle of shaving.

With a 2-3 day growth all my past Norelco 's would have taken 4-5 minutes for a shave and I 'd still need a steel-blade razor on my neck for it to be as smooth as my face. The 1050CC had my face and neck shaven smooth in about 2-3 minutes and that was with a 3 day growth. My last Norelco was a Spectra 8865XL , which I purchased 2 years ago and is still working fine ( I replace the cutting combs-heads every year ) but it could never get the neck area as close as the face.

In order to get a good close shave , the most important product to use is hot water. Everything you do , you want it to be in a way that you maximise the effect of hot water. For example , we call our shaving product , " Water activated shaving product. " When you take a shaving brush , you run the warm water , it soaks up the water right away , and it warms up instantly. When you dip it in your cream , it instantly warms up the cream , and helps generate a rich lather. The more water you use , the better the lather. The better the lather , the more hot water , and the better the shave . </shave.v.2362><shave.v.2363>To be sure , I have been out of circulation since before shaving or shaping pubic hair became stylish , and I have never experienced a woman who shaved it all off.

My first real boyfriend in high school also implored me to shave , which upset me. Now , I 'll trim it up , especially if there are bathing suits involved , but other than that ... it goes free. I do n't know if I just ca n't be bothered with it since it 's not visible to anyone but myself and my husband who does n't care ... or if its more political than that.

Oddly enough , I 've only met one other girl who did that and she was also very myopic -- I think its probably something that occurs more to people who super good close up vision , because otherwise you ca n't see it well enough to bother you or to pluck it easily without a magnifying mirror.

I am a hairy person ( brown hair ) and have what I consider a moderately heavy beard that I could shave twice a day. I sun burn easily but do not have sensitive facial skin. I have used blade razors ( including an occasional straight razor ) for about 35 years. About 2 years ago ( 1998 ) I noticed that I was not getting a close shave in certain areas ( particularly around and below the corners of my mouth ) without cutting myself. Maybe that 's a result of aging skin/whiskers.

No wonder it was impossible to demat him after six weeks ! When people want me to save a matted mess , I just look at them and tell them I ca n't because it hurts their dog. Then I ask them , " you do n't want me to hurt fluffy , do you ? Let 's just shave him down this time , then I 'll show you some brushing techniques and we 'll keep him maintained as it grows back out. " Her anger was her problem , you did the right thing. I agree , those type of people are not good customers , no matter how much they spend or how often they come. Trust me , no one else is going to demat a dog in that condition , whether it be for love of the dog or not wanting to take the time . </shave.v.2372><shave.v.2373>i find it rather sad that the valued ideal perception of a man , is to be beardless and that this is started as early as high school. Young men and women in high school are learning to become men and women and high schools should foster personal growth and learning , not repression of beards. They should be allowed to choose whether they want to be bearded or clean shaven and discover what works for them.

The Merkur razor , forged of implacable stainless steel , will last several lifetimes. There is simply nothing in it to wear out. The shaving brush will last a decade or more. Replacement double-edge blades range from inexpensive ( Merkur ' s fearsomely thin and sharp blades are 45 cents each ) to dirt cheap ( at Wal-Mart , which sells perfectly serviceable blades ) . A year ' s supply of Proraso is roughly three tubes $ 27. So in the first year of wet shaving , a frugal wet shaver might spend $ 120 or so. But a customer who follows the siren song of Gillette marketing up the brand ladder to the Fusion will spend $ 150 on blades alone. In succeeding years the wet shaver , already equipped with the razor and brush , can indulge in the ridiculously luxurious Trumper ' s English shave cream two tubs , a year ' s supply , are $ 50 and still be spending only half as much as his Gillette-addled counterpart . </shave.v.2399><shave.v.2400>I will skip over the to shave or not to shave argument , because if you want to get serious about cycling , you have to shave your legs.

VERY easy to make and I always have all the ingredients on hand. The only change I made was to the choco chips -- I finely chopped up a large bar of chocolate instead. Next time I will make a few changes 1 ) Add only 1/2 tsp vanilla 2 ) add about 3/4 tsp peppermint 3 ) will shave the chocolate rather than chop it ( so the chocolate will actually melt in your mouth when you eat it ) ... and these changes are for personal tastes only. Even as the recipe stands it really is a refreshing , minty ice cream. Super after a heavy meal ... or any time really ! Update : I attempted to decrease the fat by using 1/2 and 1/2. Wo n't do that again. It makes it gritty and grainy and not a good texture. BUT by shaving the chocolate it literally will melt in your mouth ( must use milk choc tho ) and deceasing the vanilla to 1/2 tsp and mint to 3/4 tsp makes it mellow minty -- YUM !

Many have found a decrease in occurrence when using an electric razor ( electric razors are also available for women ) due to the fact that although the shave may not be as close as that of a blade , the close cut resulting from the blade may be the cause of the end of the hair shaft becoming so sharpened and easily re-entering a hair follicle.

Read More </shave.v.2432><shave.v.2433>So I decided this past year when I turned 30 that I wanted to learn eventually how to shave with a straight razor. Knowing that the investment was going to be rather large , and not wanting to make a mistake I decided to wean myself into it by first purchasing the DE razor and basic shaving brush and working my way up to it. One of the marked best decisions I ' ve ever made. I ' m still a bit reserved about making the move up to the straight razor ( I ' ve got sharp jaws that are a pain to work with ) , I ' m hoping the next transition will be a good one. One question : The care of the razor ( sharpening/honing/stropping ) I ' m nervous about. While learning , is it possible to ruin the blade ? Is a introductary straight razor needed before purchasing the final one ? </shave.v.2433><shave.v.2434>If left unshaved , the hair would eventually cover the entire black liner. To control the growth of the hair covering the mascara , we will shave the hair away from the edges of the nose leather.

When this happens grooming can sometimes seem endless to the owner. Some owners will choose to clip or shave if they can not keep up with the more intense grooming. Also , the older Samoyed 's skin may get more tender and sensitive making usual grooming more difficult. In these cases what may work best versus shaving your Samoyed is to invest in a good cattle dryer or other type of strong dryer. You can use the dryer to get down to the skin versus comb. This will need to be done on a regular basis so that the coat care does not become overwhelming to you. And , so that matting and hot spots will be prevented . </shave.v.2435><shave.v.2436>Continuing downwards , start on the scrotum. Usually hair that grows on the scrotum grows in every direction , making this the trickiest part of the male body to shave. The best way I 've found to do it is to pull ( gently , of course ) the scrotum downwards toward your knees , and make equal downstrokes and upstrokes with the razor. To get the back of the scrotum , pull the entire unit , shaft and all , up against your belly. This exposes the underside of the scrotum , allowing for relatively easy shaving from the scrotum to the perineal area. This may seem like an awfully delicate operation , but there 's not much cause for alarm. I 've been shaving mine for over five years and I 've never cut it , not even with cheap , single-bladed plastic razors. Every nutsack is different , though , so do n't get too careless . </shave.v.2436><shave.v.2437>My hubby has a good electric razor , but I hear a lot of ladies say they still need a 'blade ' for that close shave.

You can buy it separately in shops , colour it , shape it , mould it , curl it , straighten it , grease it , wax it , gel it , spray it , cover it or just ignore it.

I am certain some people do it , I am just not certain if this would be something YOU would want to try. Once you shave that hair it will feel coarser and rough as its growing in again. Unless you are prepared to do this on a very regular basis this could be more than you bargained for. I am wondering though why you feel you need to shave it , as everyone has hair on their arms; some is darker and thicker than others but its part of being human.

The Philishave/Norelco shavers have always had slots which are great for shaving longer whiskers. The manuals advise stretching the skin to straighten whiskers before cutting. The unique feature of the new Quadra Action shavers , such as the 6826 , is the addition of holes to go with the slots. This is for cutting shorter whiskers and is supposed to add the advantages of foil shavers to the Quadra Action shavers. Users of Philishave/Norelco shavers have a habit of shaving in a circular pattern which allows users to shave whiskers which grow in every direction. That 's the habit I 've developed over the years. Foil shaver users , including Braun shaver users , tend to shave in a back and forth motion. That was how I shaved when I used a Remington many years ago.

The shaving oil does help. It keeps the hair follicle moisturized/supple so it can grow out of the skin immediately after the shave.

She didn ' t believe us when we said it , but having a clean-shaven head highlighted her good looks. We went on and on about it , but I think that kind of made her dwell on the loss more.

Aside from being much cheaper ( e.g. 100 razor blades for &lt; $ 20 ) , traditional wet shaving turns shaving from a chore to an activity that you enjoy and look forward to each morning ( that produces a much closer and comfortable shaves , with no irritation or razor bumps ) .

Finally , a radical idea that I would like peoples opinion on. I am thinking of seeing if any surgeon would produce a couple of smaller , irregular scars in my balding areas near the original donor scar ( ie closer to the crown ) , so that I can shave my head , and if someone asks about the scars the three of them look more irregular than a single normal HT scar , thus passing off better as an accident. Does anyone have an idea on whether any cosmetic surgeon would do this.I have actually enquired to a HT surgeon who said he would implant hairs into the donor area by taking irregularly cut strips from the donor area to hide the original scar and make the other scars look like an accident. I would consider doing this , but Im thinking that if I decide to shave the nogin then a couple of small scars outside the donor area may even fool hairloss sufferers such as ourselves . </shave.v.2518><shave.v.2519>2008 : Hybrid Shave Oil launch.

We ' ve got the solutions . </shave.v.2539><shave.v.2540>TIP 1 : CHOOSE YOUR RAZOR No matter what you do , you will always want a good clean shave and a smooth face when you ' re finished shaving. Why not do a little shopping around and see which razor is right for you ? Once you choose a razor , stick to it ! If it has disposable heads , buy a whole bunch at one time. Don ' t get tempted by new commercials. If you choose electric because it ' s faster , you can still use a good cream with some wet models. A man ' s razor is the first kit item in any toiletry kit. If cords are necessary , always keep them with the razor. Don ' t mess around with too many shaving heads. My suggestion : the more blades the better. The less used , the better . </shave.v.2540><shave.v.2541>For me personally I found one unexpected benefit of dish soap. The way I shave may be a little unorthodox. You see I first shave my face with a down stroke. That way I shave off most of the hair going " with the grain. " Then I make a second pass with an up-stroke. By going " against the grain " I find that it gives me a much closer shave. Shaving creams and gels do leave some residue on my face after the first pass so that the second pass is still lubricated. With bar soap and liquid hand soap , there is not enough residue to lubricate the skin on the second pass with the razor. The dish soap , however , leaves enough of a soapy film to lubricate my skin for the up-stroke. I would say that the second pass is just as well lubricated , if not better lubricated , than the second pass using normal shaving cream. I did not get razor burn , and my face came out feeling as soft as baby skin . </shave.v.2541><shave.v.2542>c There are many methods , viewpoints and preferred tools used for traditional wet shaving and Em 's Place has compiled what we believe to be some " best practices " for achieving the most comfortable shave. Keep in mind that we define wet shaving first and foremost as shaving with a brush and quality lather. Men who wet shave in this fashion all seem to agree that it takes shaving to a whole new level of comfort , smoothness and enjoyment. This information is based on that shaving concept . </shave.v.2542><shave.v.2543>You say you " choose it " because it 's a hell of a lot easier than saying " I 'm giving in to societal pressure.

Finally shave with short strokes and shave with the grain not against ( normally with the grain will be down ) but run your fingers over the hair to see if it grows up or down and once you have established this shave with the hair growth NOT against it. This may mean a less smooth shave but decreases irritation . </shave.v.2552><shave.v.2553>Because shaving creams will produce quite a bit of ( unprotective ) lather even if you use too little shaving cream , experiment to make sure you ' re using enough. Perhaps initially you should try using a dollop the size of a large Brazil nut instead of an almond , then in later shaves cut back a bit until you find the right proportion. The lather should be dense enough and contain enough water to do a proper job . </shave.v.2553><shave.v.2554>Jaffer It ' s what I do , Jaffer. You know that !

Anyway , I used to want it to be perfectly shaved with no stubble or missed spots , but of late ( say , the past six months or so ) I just do a quick pass once a week ( with a dry safety ( face ) razor in the shower ) . This allows the desired effect of seeing the muscle ( and looking much better ) without getting obsessive about " smoothness " . It may seem silly and perhaps not a bit masculine , but it DOES look better ( in my case ) and I 'll never go back to the monkey look.

As to why the Quadra Action is a waterproof shaver but NOT a wet/dry shaver , I was told that this shaver works better when used dry. If you look further down , a posting dated November 29 does compare a Philishave/Norelco Quadra Action shaver with a Braun Syncro shaver and he prefers the Syncro.

' These were the double-sided blades that were designed to be inserted into a handle , which was then cranked down until it was snug upon the razor. The blade was then used as a double-sided axe , to shave away with one side until it was dull , and then to be flipped over in the hand and used on the other side. This was considered to be an advancement over the centuries-old 'straight-edge ' razor. The blades could be taken out of the metal box they came in with little difficulty , and would cut the dickens out of you with very little manipulation. In some cases , my dad might use a bare blade to scrape stray paint off of a glass surface , or remove sticky goo from where a price label had been. I believe such blades can still be had at the hardware store for just such purposes. The blade was incredibly sharp , but fragile. It did n't take much pressure to wreck the edge , and the blade itself could shatter if used too enthusiastically on things other than faces . </shave.v.2602><shave.v.2603>I 've always been fond of Edge Advances Gel for Sensitive Skin , but then again I only really shave once every few weeks.

I 've had no trouble with this razor ( apart from cutting the top of my thumb off when picking it up , which I guess has made me shave very carefully ever since ) treat it with respect and you wo n't cut your face to bits. take your time , do n't scrape ( the weight of the razor is enough pressure ) and you 'll be fine.

When this coat is clipped , the hair will appear to grow back softer because you are seeing only undercoat as it grows back. This hair is thick and will matt easily and possibly result in patchy , uneven growth until the guard hairs eventually regrow.

I was surprised when I read elsewhere that an electric shave should not last more than 5 minutes since mine were longer although not more than my shortest blade times. Eventually I used a pre-shave ( Williams ) that I think improved the quality of the shave. I also used a spray lube on the cutters. I got my shaving time down to about 5 minutes but always felt as if I were trying to beat the clock.

If you 've never done that ... ... it 's total pain . </shave.v.2645><shave.v.2646>Another wierd thing about me is that I shave my legs , bikini area , arms , and other areas , but not my armpits. When I was in my first year of college and an armpit-shaver , I suddenly started getting HUGE cysts in one armpit which I was told were caused by ingrown hairs from shaving. The doctor 'd give me antibiotics and said the only way to keep them from recurring would be to stop shaving that armpit. Finally , after one giant cyst the size of a golf ball had to be painfully drained by a doctor , I said frig it - I 'll just stop shaving them. Nowadays I have short , groomed armpit hair which I am unashamed of ( unless I am wearing short sleeves to some event and I suddenly realize I forgot to trim them ) . People sometimes say something like " pardon me for asking , but why do you shave your legs but not your armpits ? " And then I tell them my story , which I doubt would be their first assumption of a reason . </shave.v.2646><shave.v.2647>My suggestion , wax the back and shave the rest unless you find being less hairy a state you want to maintain. Or have a friend shave the back and any other portion you 're comfortable with ( this can be quite fun ! ) . Trim all the body hair with an electric trimmer before actually shaving ... buy a " Lady Sensor " or the Shick equivalent and use a good " softening " liquid body wash rather than shaving cream. Shaving , you may end up with a couple of ingrown hairs and you wo n't be as " smooth " as with waxing . </shave.v.2647><shave.v.2648>Here 's the problem , where do you draw the line when your " employment policies " violate another persons basic and civil rights ?

Beyond basic hygiene it is my own personal business how long I wear my hair. If there are men working there with shaved heads then this is an outright case of sexual discrimination. If more people would stand up to this sort of thing it might actually stop happening. I for one refuse to spend my hard earned money anywhere that discriminates based on hair length , style , or color , choice of piercings , sexual orientation , or religion. Yes , I really do and the businesses that do get my money appreciate that . </shave.v.2648><shave.v.2649>How is it in actual use ? Terrific ! I had tried before several formulae , from soap to super-engineered creams and never come across something like this. In fact , it took a promotion for me to return to the old shaving cream tube -- thinking that I would need a brush , etc. And I am glad I did for I only need to squeeze very little on my palm and work it into foam. The net effect is a smooth and close shave with an old time flavor to it , nothing more , nothing less. Both the blade and my skin seem to thank me for this shaving cream . </shave.v.2649><shave.v.2650>When it comes to razors , the big dogs are Gillette and Schick. A big innovation came in 1971 when Gillette offered the Trac II with disposable twin parallel blades , prior to that the twin blade " safety " razor was the norm and the device your father taught you to shave with if you are a baby boomer like me. It took many a bloody and nicked face to master the technique of shaving with that style of blade . </shave.v.2650><shave.v.2651>It may seem like a great idea to shave all the hair off. Sure , no more hair all over the house ! Well , shorter hair all over the house anyway What you are doing when you shave your double-coated dogs is actually interrupting the natural shedding process. You are cutting into the top coat , possibly damaging it , and causing the undercoat to grow uninhibited , as the undercoat grows much more quickly than the top coat , or guard coat. Also , this undercoat acts like a sponge. If you want to shave your dog because he/she is in the water at the cottage all the time leaving this undercoat in will take it twice as long to dry as the guard hairs are harder and repel water . </shave.v.2651><shave.v.2652>I 've heard lots of people say Britney is having a breakdown , which I think is nonsense.

It was one courageous step in the fight to conquer cancer , raising money and awareness for the cause. Sabrina said she was looking forward to explaining her new look to community members and acquaintances who might not be familiar with the St. Baldrick 's Foundation and the head shaving movement to raise funds and express solidarity with cancer patients all over the world . </shave.v.2677><shave.v.2678>I ordered this as my first shaving soap , along with the Merkur HD , when I first started wet shaving several weeks ago. Now that I 've been using it for some time and the pot is almost empty , I can highly recommend this to everybody. A few swirls of the brush generates mountains of smooth and wonderfully-cushioning lather. The fragrance is very pleasant and clean , and does n't linger after the shave , and the soap has a cooling sensation on the skin , especially with the cold-water splash at the end of the shave. This product is widely-recommended and touted as one of the best available for good reason. Try it out . </shave.v.2678><shave.v.2679>But the secret fear is that I am no good at being feminine.

When frequently shaved the hair becomes thicker. Using an epilator on that hair is a torture. It will be less painful if you start using the epilator after your hair has been waxed at least once. Epilating makes your hair thinner and easier to remove , thus causes less pain in the future . </shave.v.2682><shave.v.2683>I usually shave as quick as I can before showering with a Philips Norelco 7110x.

I have the aftershave cologne which I splash onto my cheeks and neck , then I put some of the cologne in a spray bottle diluted with water and sprayed it on the rest of my clothes.

I wouldn ' t be opposed to trying a safety razor though </shave.v.2692><shave.v.2693>Many of the pictures that I have posted on this site were taken when I shaved my head or had really short hair , mainly because that 's when I bought my first camera. For most of my life , however , my hair was a little longer than shaved , but it was most certainly not long. In short , it was normal , short , and conservative hair. When I was a kid , I had the classic Asian bowl cut. In middle and high school , I began parting it to the right or left side ( I changed it from time to time ) . My first year at Stanford , I kept it the same length that I always had in high school . </shave.v.2693><shave.v.2694>I first took a lady Schick to my bikini line sometime during the second term of the Reagan administration. The process guaranteed unpleasantries : razor burn and in-grown hairs , not to mention the constant and necessary repetition. But in time , with increased skill , the invention of the gazillion-blade razor and ladies-only shave gel , I gave the task little thought. Until I moved to New York City , of course , where highlights from a New Jersey mall and a " natural " brow were the sartorial equivalents of hate crime. Eventually , seduced by the city 's indulgent carelessness , I let Sonya and her thick imported Brazilian wax have their way with me. My lady garden -- once lush -- now lay nearly bare. And for years , that 's how it stayed : a tiny patch of hair , not dissimilar to Hitler 's mustache . </shave.v.2694><shave.v.2695>My best advice for doing a good shave is to take your time.

I was sooooo wrong ! ! The razor is such a wonderful shape -- so comfortable , so easy to use. It was actually fun to shave the bikini area , whereas I usually dread it.

I usually go for 2-3 passes , alternating the direction of the cutting . </shave.v.2698><shave.v.2699>I just started shaving my head about 2 months ago. At first it was a real pain. I have sensitive skin to begin with ... I was going to give up on it , but I decided to see what I could find on the Internet. After doing some research I came across your web site. I was a bit skeptical about all of the praises the Total Shaving Solution was getting. But I figured to pay $ 1.00 for a free sample was worth it. After the first shave ( both head and face ) , I got out of the shower , turned on my computer , and ordered a full bottle. I could n't believe it ! ! ! ! It was the best shave I ever got. I would n't shave my face for days because it was more comfortable to shave the longer stubble. But after I got my full bottle , I started shaving everyday. My face ( especially my neck ) no longer hurt to shave everyday. And it works great on my head ! ! ! Anyway , that 's my commentary.

But for women who have sudden , rapid hair growth , or other signs of hormonal imbalance , here are some suggestions to help get you started : </shave.v.2702><shave.v.2703>I only shave once a week but when I do I always use lotion after. It keeps my face from drying out too much and keeps me looking like I ' m in my 20s still . </shave.v.2703><shave.v.2704>I still think you should try the slicker brush as it removes more than the normal brush however you seem to be more inclined to the shaving. if you mean shave right down to the skin No but if you mean clipped out leaving about an inch all over thats okay. We actually clip our Pekes out because of the intense heat we have and by winter they are back in full coat trailing to the ground . </shave.v.2704><shave.v.2705>It was not for many years that the makers of shaving products figured out that they could apparently make a shave even better by adding yet another blade to the stack. Not one , not two , but three blades would be optimal. And once again , the advertisements showed how the first blade ripped the hair right up out of the skin , then the second blade pulled it even higher , and finally , the merciful third blade delivered the coups de grace and put that wretched hair out of its misery . </shave.v.2705><shave.v.2706>A : Dan , you said you shave your head , but how often do you shave ? We ask because in our opinion , the fully shaved look ( aka the Savalas ) as a can't-miss cure for baldness is ultimately about as can't-miss as Rogaine or Propecia -- it does n't always work as advertised. If you 're Michael Jordan , go for it. If not , well , just look at Jack ( top ) -- suddenly one of the world 's coolest dudes looks like a bigger toolbag than Joe the Plumber . </shave.v.2706><shave.v.2707>Shaving itself , meanwhile , is having some serious problems. The market for electric shavers has collapsed - some in the industry say that they 'll soon be as obsolete as video recorders. Meanwhile the razor has taken over , driven by aggressive product innovation. The introduction of the Gillette five-blade razor this year means that hairs can even be cut away beneath the skin 's surface , leaving the face free from regrowth for longer . </shave.v.2707><shave.v.2708>Similarly in the grave when the deceased is asked , one of the questions is , What would you say about this person ?

How do you think the Prophet will react when he sees a person who has shaved his beard ? </shave.v.2708><shave.v.2709>Would she look really bad with her belly hair shaved down ? She really needs a sanitary clipping , the hair around her back legs is really long and gets wet often. Also a good clipping between the toes. I will try and find my good scissors . </shave.v.2709><shave.v.2710>Finally , my suggestion to guys ( heck , even girls ! ) is this : if you have n't shaved it once in your life , to grab those clippers and cut it all off ! </shave.v.2710><shave.v.2711>Step 2 : Shave right after a hot shower in the morning. Hot water softens the hairs and makes them easier to cut. It also opens pores on your skin and helps to reduce irritation . </shave.v.2711><shave.v.2712>Today , Lisa begins by repeating her maxim that the relative lack of pressure on men to spend money on beauty and grooming products is " a triumph of gender ideology over capitalism. " Consider that men are still not usually expected to wear make-up in their daily life; that they are not considered asexual or over the hill if they choose a short , wash-and-go hairstyle; that they 're encouraged to take masculine pride in owning only two pairs of shoes to cover all occasions; and that nobody calls them dirty feminists for leaving their legs , armpits or groins au naturel. And then consider how much money there 'd be in changing their mind about such things. Philips Norelco has apparently done just that , hence their new ad for the " Bodygroom , " featuring two kiwi fruits in nuttastic proximity to each other , one pleasingly de-fuzzed. Tag line : " The ONLY way to shave your balls. " In case the kiwi thing was too subtle . </shave.v.2712><shave.v.2713>I am a huge fan of eShave and their shaving sets. I wanted to review one item , but could n't limit myself to just one. Their system is the best in the industry.

Maybe I should do an instructable on it </shave.v.2718><shave.v.2719>_In response to Double Flush post on 8.23.2006 ... .I worked for a Dermatologist and we did laser hair-removal. We had a couple of strippers who would come in and get EVERYTHING lasered. I think they liked the fact that they did n't have to shave ALL the time and they were very smooth all over. It is costly and time on the table in consuming. I can tell you from having my underarms done. It is worth it ! ! ______ </shave.v.2719><shave.v.2720>You 'd be surpised a the lengths some women go to have no hair at all in that region ( google : brazilian bikini wax ) ! As for shaving , it depends on the girl. Some just trim and others go for the full fledged bare skin. It is possible to shave the outside part of the vagina as well as inside the labia ( not inside de vagina of course ! ) . All to say , every hair that is on the exterior can be shaved. This being said , be careful ! If you decide to shave make sure you use a good new razor , take your time and use hydrating soft ( unscented if possible ! ) soap like Dove. The skin around that area is extremely sensitive and when it is not used to shaving it can irritate easily. Also when the hair starts to grow back it can itch , irratate and cause ingrown hairs that make little red itchy bumps. One does get used to shaving down there but it is n't for everyone. It does n't hurt to shave in itself but the soap can cause irritations and even yeast infections ( argh ! ) . </shave.v.2720><shave.v.2721>The star plays a woman whose hair is starting to fall out , so she decides to shave it all.

I do n't think it was in the same place but the same area. Is this folliculitis ? I have had that before higher in my pubic hair that looked like a hole rather than a bump , but that was after I picked at a blackhead that was indented already. If I looked REALLY close-I did-I think I could see the hair follicle next to the crater. Is this normal ? I do still get paranoid about std 's from time to time like herpes . </shave.v.2723><shave.v.2724>I 've been using your product since it appeared in the Freebie Magazine which was at least eight years ago and I have used nothing else to shave with in that time.

Seriously , that thing looks like a multi-functional torture device. But , I ' ll take your word for it that it works. I ' ve been looking for something that doesn ' t cost an arm and a nicely shaved leg AND for something that doesn ' t mean I have to undress and sit legs akimbo for some stranger in a torture chamber full of hot wax and screaming women. Perfect timing , too. I have some swimsuits to wear this summer after a bit of weight loss and those around me don ' t need to witness red , bumpy scariness . </shave.v.2725><shave.v.2726>By now , you 've decided to shave your legs. Excellent. But you still have questions. Luckily for you , I have anticipated and answered all of your questions , below . </shave.v.2726><shave.v.2727>Well , I got a new Quadra Action and have been using it for a few weeks without the spray lubricant and am once again happy with it. It does not shave as close as a blade ( I do n't think any electric can ) , but it is a pretty good shave and pretty easy on the skin , especially if I remember not to press too hard. So , the end of the saga ( for now ) is that I 'm keeping the Quadra. I am not going to use the lubricant; if it means the heads wear out a little sooner , so be it . </shave.v.2727><shave.v.2728>Update : I tried the oil and was surprised at the results -- compared to shaving cream it feels like you have nothing on your legs , yet the shave is smoother and longer-lasting. The next time I used both the oil and shaving cream ( old habits ... ) and have never had a closer shave. Now I will keep a bottle in my travel kit AND in the shower. The Pacific Oil and the DERMAdoctor Body Scrub ( January 16 ) are two Grommets that have permanently changed my daily routine. Thanks ! </shave.v.2728><shave.v.2729>And there is the issue of shaving cuts , those tiny lesions that can bleed for half an hour if not staunched with a styptic pencil or a bit of tissue paper. I never once got a shaving cut from my electric razor it buzzed innocuously over my face , its blades well sheathed. The latest cartridge razors , the Cargo editor ' s experience notwithstanding , are indeed designed to minimize the number of cuts , and they do tolerably well at it. A safety razor , on the other hand , looks anything but safe when you are loading a skinny double-edged blade into it for the first time , and in the hands of an inattentive or inexperienced user it is indeed capable of harm. This , it seems to me from my anecdotal polling of family and friends , is the core appeal of the cartridges and electrics that have driven wet shaving from the general market. They are easy , and they are safe. That is the way we want our lives or at least , in the fog of the early morning , our shaves . </shave.v.2729><shave.v.2730>I took to shaving in the shower a few years ago , and I ' ve done it ever since. It helps , but still with the ingrown hairs and the red rashy neck. About five years ago I switched to an electric , which I used exclusively for a year or so. It was good in all regards except that I just couldn ' t get a close enough shave . </shave.v.2730><shave.v.2731>I didn ' t have to make the choice to shave it off. The drugs were so strong that it all fell out almost immediately. Mike </shave.v.2731><shave.v.2732>I dont recommend that anyone shave the vagina. Get veet , or nair. Or get a wax. It hurts for a few seconds and then your smooth for weeks. Think of it this way , what happens if you accidently slip and cut your clitoris , or your vaginal lips ( it happened to me ) . It hurts like hell and takes forever to heal. If I do have to shave I get my boyfriend to shave me , but even with that you have to have a lot of trust and make sure he/she has a steady hand. and oh yeah just because you have never had a razor bump , you can always develop one , and how terrible does that look to have bumps on your vag ? Might ruin the moment for a guy/girl to see a bump in between your crevices . </shave.v.2732><shave.v.2733>i am a guy and i used to shave my legs when i was a teenager. People thought i was gay , but i feel it is always nice to have shaved legs . </shave.v.2733><shave.v.2734>I have been using a hair/beard trimmer/clipper in lieu of a razor to obtain a " not-so-close " shave. Whereas , however , an electric razor provides TOO close a shave , trimming does not provide a shave that is close enough. Using a trimmer is also messier and more time consuming than using an electric razor. I have been looking for an electric razor that shaves not quite so close to the skin , but just above it , leaving about one or two days growth of hair . </shave.v.2734><shave.v.2735>In the United Kingdom , the Royal Navy allows " full sets " ( beards and moustaches together ) but not beards or moustaches alone. The other British armed services allow moustaches only. Exceptions are beards grown for religious reasons ( usually by Sikhs or Muslims ) , though in the event of conflict in which the use of chemical or biological weapons is likely , they may be required to shave a strip around the seal of a respirator. Beards are also permitted for medical reasons , such as temporary skin irritations , or by infantry pioneer warrant officers , colour sergeants and sergeants , who traditionally wear beards. Any style of facial hair is allowed in British police forces as long as it is neatly trimmed. Beards are also permitted by special forces when not on base , i.e. covert intelligence operations or behind enemy lines . </shave.v.2735><shave.v.2736>Shaving not only makes a man look well groomed , but younger , too. When you shave , you 're exfoliating the skin by getting rid of dead cells. Here 's how to do it correctly . </shave.v.2736><shave.v.2737>Now , a couple of things were not stated , and I sometimes wondered about them. For example , how did the first blade 'lift ' and 'pull ' the beard hairs , but the second blade did not ? Were they somehow different ? And did n't all this pulling and yanking result in considerable pain on the part of the face being shaved ? If the barber had cut my hair ( I had hair back then ) by grabbing it and pulling it good and hard , I think I might have objected . </shave.v.2737><shave.v.2738>Well , I shave my Saint Bernard in the summer.

But there are some other shaving-related shaving conditions that can produce more serious and uncomfortable symptoms . </shave.v.2743><shave.v.2744>Solution : Proper lubrication , changing blades. Razor burns is basically a mild pimple-like rash that appears a few days after shaving. It often disappears quickly and is almost always caused by a dull blade or insufficient lubrication. Lubricate well before you shave. I use a gentle cleanser every day and avoid soap. Here , too using lukewarm water is important. Also , finish with cool water rinse to seal pores after shaving. Never shave over a pimple or cut as this only aggravates the skin . </shave.v.2744><shave.v.2745>The best after shaving lotion I ' ve tried is from the Art of Shaving. The lemon scented is amazing.

But with so little exposure in porn and in the media to what an actual average female looks like what can we say really ? Who knows how many women shave ? As far as I know , nobody ' s done a poll or drawn up statistics. No one seems to be talking . </shave.v.2746><shave.v.2747>" For little reason other than paternally inspired nostalgia , I decided to go 'retro ' and ditch my electric shaver. The Merkur 'Futur ' was recommended by a friend and in terms of build quality and anthropometric appeal - it 's second to none. Is it easy to adapt to , probably not if you 're an electric-convert like me. Expect two weeks of bad starts to the day and a couple of blood transfusions. Invest in a block of Geo F Trumper shaving alum to calm things down and be patient. I am sure that I 'd have awarded a full 5-stars if I was writing this a couple of weeks down the line.

I use it now too and the one tiny bottle has lasted 6 months already between the 2 of us . </shave.v.2748><shave.v.2749>I have decided that the major skin-sense phenomenon on removal of a beard is best called the insulation aftereffect. Later on the same day I first shaved , when I went to kiss my son 's cheek at bed-time , it felt uncharacteristically warm against my skin. Even now , if I breathe though my nose really hard , I can still feel coolness on my top lip. Sometimes when I walk outside , I can feel coolness on chin from the wind. When I put my mouth under the tap , to rinse it after cleaning my teeth , I notice the coolness of the water on my chin . </shave.v.2749><shave.v.2750>Get a fogless mirror and do everything in the shower. after washing your hair and body. save the shave for last. i guess the only other way to get a top quality shave is to find a good barber with steady hands. just make sure he uses real lather and not barbasol out of a machine . </shave.v.2750><shave.v.2751>So I regularly shave my ladie ' s area with a razor , and it would be so nice to find something that is more gentle on the skin ! Nothing like razor burn on your crotch ! </shave.v.2751><shave.v.2752>But , the day my husband could n't stop lauging at me is what I came to share. We had just gotten back from work. I was wearing a skirt , and there was a gentle breeze that evening. I was reaching into the back seat to get the baby out of the car seat , when I felt something crawling up my leg. I jumped , screamed and danced around , certain it was a spider. The light creepy , crawly feeling went away , so I bent back down to get her out of the seat. The breeze blew through my skirt and the spiders were back ! It was at that time that I realized the hair on my legs was swaying in the breeze. My husband almost fell off the porch and I was mortified. Needless to say , I shaved that night. I think it took me an hour to trim down the forest that had cropped up when I was n't looking . </shave.v.2752><shave.v.2753>The Intimate Area Shaver can be used on the entire bikini or crotch area , and serves to touch up legs , underarms and anywhere you have short , new hair growth or stubble ! It 's great for men who want to get rid of 5 o'clock beard shadow before leaving work or women who need to touch up. It also shaves the face and other sensitive areas better than any other shaver because it never bites , nicks or pulls and shaves extremely close. Men , you will love this shaver and so will your partner ! </shave.v.2753><shave.v.2754>4. A Tupperware container for your shaving soap is also great idea. Glad ( I believe ) makes these nice round threaded-lid containers that are about 3 inches deep by 4 inches wide. Perfect size for your soap , and can easily be sealed for travel ( with just enough room for your brush inside ) . You should , of course , keep it open between shaves to let it dry out a bit. You don ' t want it all gooey the next time . </shave.v.2754><shave.v.2755>The Levites were commanded to constantly shave all the hair off their bodies.

To eliminate that possibility , the Levites shaved . </shave.v.2755><shave.v.2756>E-mail Britney Spears checked into a rehab facility and then abruptly checked out , a source confirms to PEOPLE.

And I said but I ve seen plenty of guitars [ made from ] well seasoned wood that were built in the past that have warped necks , and there s nothing you can do except pull the frets out and shave the fingerboard down. And even then it doesn t necessarily [ solve the problem ] . And unlike industry today where you have planned obsolescence , I m building my instruments to last a lifetime.

I kept forgetting about it and seeing my reflection was shocking.Then I became really liberated. My hair-care routine was a shower ! I had never known that freedom before , being accustomed to going monthly for a marathon hair appointment to colour roots then put in streaks , then cut and blow. Interestingly , all my young male friends were somewhat embarassed , whereas my bolder male friends thought it fab. My French friends called it " Tr s Anglais " while my English friends called it " Typical French chic " . The most extreme reaction was from a lady in her 60s. She said she felt sick when she looked at me. I did do it when feeling either depressed or just desperately in need of a jolt. It certainly worked. Maybe that 's exactly where BS was when she took metal to skin. Well , you know , hair grows. Britney - you will be amazed how soon you have a full head of hair again and THEN you can choose.

I started with dry shaving but this was uncomfortable so I began shaving in the shower using a little soap-free facial wash and the results are good and fairly fast. As an added benefit cleaning the shaver is an integral part of shaving in the shower so it is always clean and relatively sterile. There has been no skin irritation even though I have sensitive skin and because I no longer scrape away layers of skin my face feels much less raw.

Shoot , I chopped off all my hair ( not shaved , but near close ) because I was sky high and pissed about something or the other. I think those ppl who so easily accept her mental illness claim have not been high out of their minds on drugs. Brit is just upset that now her life is structured and regulated and she wants to be able to let loose once in awhile. Unfortunately , for an addict , you usually don ' t know or even have a limit so you have to be able to restrict yourself or be restricted at all times. All recovering addicts have been where she is.

Because it stirs up a warm lather which can coat a large area in a hurry. Then you can sit the brush on the counter or shower shelf , and simply pick it up and apply more lather as needed. Many brush styles , especially upper end ones , hold a lot of lather for several applications. Because women have more body mass to shave , we recommend using the badger grade bristle.

If you ' ve never shaved ' down there ' before then it ' s almost guaranteed that you will experience some irritation. Your skin is not used to coming into direct contact with anything due to the hair that acts as a buffer between you and your clothes. On top of that , a close shave will irritate the skin until it has been conditioned to the practice. In most cases it only takes a month or so to get your skin used to shaving , but depending on your particular physiology it could be less time or more time. Listen to your body and don ' t rush this isn ' t a race. You will need : A new razor , hair conditioner or shaving cream / gel , a bowl of steaming hot water , and an unscented moisturizing lotion. Not needed but nice to have : A freestanding or hand mirror for those hard-to-see areas . </shave.v.2804><shave.v.2805>I ' ve been shaving using a Merkur Classic and shaving brush since last summer and I haven ' t looked back since.

It lathers well , a little thicker than an English cream , but it gives , in my opinion , the best cushion you can ask for. No need for a pre-shave oil with this stuff. You could probably shave with an ice scraper without irritation . </shave.v.2814><shave.v.2815>I do n't have a very hairy chest and what I did have looked kind of dumb so I started shaving it.

It doesn ' t give you a better shave. I heard Gillette is introducing a 5-blade razor to combat Shick ' s 4-blade. That ' s ridiculous.

It 's the perfect method for men to remove the beard hair on their face , using either a wet razor or electric razor. The essence of shaving is that it cuts the hairs , all of them , where the razor is used at skin level. But by the next day , because hair is growing continuously , there is stubble , there is re-growth. For men on the face that 's fine because they expect to shave , if they are clean-shaven , on a daily basis. But for women who are shaving their legs or their underarms , they may well have to shave on a daily basis , which they can find quite tedious. It does not affect the hair growth at all. It can't. It makes finer hair feel stubbly. There is a myth that shaving makes the hair coarser. It doesn't. It simply makes the hair which is there more easily felt because of the surface level being cut off squarely. You have the stubbly , bristly effect from shaving. The hair growth is n't changed in any way , shape or form . </shave.v.2829><shave.v.2830>remember , you cant shave it when it is plugged in , because it is a wet/dry shaver , and no one wants you to electrocute yourself shaving , that would be just silly.coming to the wet/dry part . </shave.v.2830><shave.v.2831>" But I would have difficulty shaving in the morning , unless I could shave without looking in the mirror.

Here are some razor-saving shaving techniques : </shave.v.2840><shave.v.2841>I have come across substances that actually retard the growth of hair- they are mostly used by bodybuilders , etc. but can also work on the scalp. One such substance called Hair No More is used by my trainer and he told me that it really helped to keep the hair away ( he keeps his whole body shaved ) . You have to use it right after shaving and with regular use slows the growth and ultimately results in hairless skin. Then you are addicted to it like Rogaine. There are several products like this that are available over the internet. Another is called Hair Away and it works in a similar fashion . </shave.v.2841><shave.v.2842>There 's much more to it than just looks. I really do hope no one is going to be looking at my butt , but shaving it would make it cooler and less itchy. Plus , after a shower , body hair takes for-fucking-ever to dry , while water just rolls right off of smooth hairless skin. On a final note , it just feels really nice to be shaved . </shave.v.2842><shave.v.2843>The first step I took at this massive endeavour was to use the mustache trimmer on my electric razor. This trimmed everything down to short stubble that could be reasonable dealt with using an actual razor. Next , I shaved my abs and chest with the same type of razor I use for my face. Then I shaved my legs with the same type of razor that my wife uses for here legs. VERY BIG DIFFERENCE ! Buy the lady razors for your body , you 'll be glad you did. Immediately after shaving I took a shower and after the shower I used Johnson 's baby lotion ( not the oil ) to soothe it a little ( another rec from the wife ) . And , no I did not oil up to pose , but hey it did n't look all that bad . </shave.v.2843><shave.v.2844>I first started wet shaving for a couple of weeks using my normal mach 3 razor just to get used to the process , and finally moved to the safety razor this week. I ' m happy to report that I ' ve shaved successfully without any nicks with the safety razor , and my skin seems to generally be much happier with the wet shaving. Even the fun neck bumps ( ingrown hairs I assume ? ) are starting to go away. It does take a lot more time for me to shave this way , but I limit it to a few times a week in the evening. I ' m also getting a much closer and longer lasting shave , and my face doesn ' t feel like it ' s on fire after shaving. Actually with the Proraso shaving soap it ' s quite the opposite it has glycerin menthol in it which feels nice and cool . </shave.v.2844><shave.v.2845>When possible , I prefer to shave in the evening so that I can keep from putting clothing on for a few hours after shaving. It really minimizes the bumps. If I did need to shave in the morning , I find baby powder works best for me. Some friends swear by cocoa butter - it was a disaster for me . </shave.v.2845><shave.v.2846>Just like it 's nobody 's business if a woman does n't shave , as ZoBabe said upthread , it 's really nobody 's business what I do with my pubic hair , including remove it.

It is great ! All these years I have been shredding my face , not any more. I am one of those red headed , fair skinned , heavy bearded guys who just ca n't get a decent shave. Every time I shaved I was reminded of the old Bill Cosby routine , " All I wanted was a close shave , not a self-sacrifice ! " I took your advice and switched to a Mach 3 and the shaving solution and realized there is a God in heaven ! What a difference ! I have already placed an order for a large bottle for myself , and a small bottle of " Hers " for my wife. I 'm a convert , and I 'll bet she will be too. ( For her legs , not her face !

The blade loading mechanism is very secure and inspires a feeling of confidence. ( You must listen to that awesome 'clunk ' when you snap the head cover back on - typical German engineering ) . The adjusting mechanism feels very solid and enables you to tailor the razor for your perfect shave. After lathering my face and commencing my shave , I thought 'Wow ! This thing shaves super close ! ' I have sensitive skin so I am unable to shave against the grain , but this gets SO close I do n't need to do that anymore. One thing you need to bear in mind when using this razor is NOT TO APPLY ANY PRESSURE - LET THE WEIGHT OF THE RAZOR DO THE WORK. This razor is worth its weight in gold and I highly recommend it. Its initial outlay is expensive but it will save you money in the long run and it makes shaving a pleasure , not a chore. " - J.

The lotion works really well and leaves me smelling great as well as feeling soft and smooth. One reviewer said he preferred it to wet shaving and I 'd have to agree. One word of warning though. It does n't cope too well if you leave your stubble for 3-4 days then try to shave it all off. The heads are also a little flimsy , but then you have to expect that when you 're buying a product that has a head that contours to your face as much as this does. So if you 're a butterfingers , be warned ! </shave.v.2852><shave.v.2853>The Legs ... If you choose to shave your legs with a razor , just follow the same procedures for shaving your legs as you would your chest , described above. But how I personally shave my legs is different then I do my chest. I went to a professional beauty supply store and bought what they call a " number 1 " buzzer. To my knowledge it trims closest to your skin. The one I have shaves so close that it looks as if I waxed or shaved with a razor. Now for me , that may be because I do not have hairy legs to begin with. I can get away with shaving every 3 weeks where as with my chest I shave once a week . </shave.v.2853><shave.v.2854>If you want to freak your mates out try this ... get about 40 people into a room , tell them they are gon na see something really cool , and show 'em " the Big shave " Watch 'em squerm and freak out , now you 've got something to talk about for weeks ( either they walk out or laugh their ass 's off ) also : try this with the " singing in the rain " rape scene from a " Clockwork Orange " ( even better with women present ! ) Ps.

However , its a relatively small can and a bit pricier than other gels , so I do n't use it regularly anymore because I just ca n't afford to being a stay at home mom with two kids.

Until the popularity of the Brazillian wax came along , I never even thought of the possibility that my butthole was hairy. Out of curiousity , I tested the theory that we are hairy from front to back and I shaved back there. There was n't much hair , but what I had was long !

To that end , we need to retain only the dimension of malchut [ i.e. peah ] , but this applies only to the head of Zeir Anpin [ man ] . However , Nukva [ woman ] does not shave her head. The reason is that since she corresponds to Nukva , and since all the judgments are in Asiya [ related to Nukva ] , were she to remove the judgments from the head of Nukva , there would not remain any judgments in the world.

I primarily stick to a Van Dyke ( often incorrectly labeled a " goatee " ) , so I usually still have some facial hair.

The shower is like a steam-bath for your whiskers , and really helps them soften. It took a couple of weeks for me to stop nicking myself when shaving without a mirror , but by carefully studying my face in the mirror afterwards I memorized my problems and went more slowly and now I get a consistent , close , no-nick shave.

The old barber , played by Cedric the Entertainer , seizes the tools from the youngster and takes over. Shaving is an art , he explains.

So I do ... .I shave it everyday , in order to keep it 'puuuurtie ' for hubby , not to mention it just feels better ... </shave.v.2880><shave.v.2881>Women may want to shave at night , rather than in the morning. If women do shave in the morning , wait at least 20 minutes after waking so fluids in the body can redistribute and not be swelled up around the hairs , making it impossible to cut them closely . </shave.v.2881><shave.v.2882>Now , a trimmer is great if you have facial hair that 's a little bit thicker , and you want to keep it trimmed or what not for those of you with a beard or a goatee that you want to trim down and for those of you who have beard goatee everyday. This is a great tool because you can attach guards to it , and it helps trim down the hair. The other thing that 's great for is , as you can see it 's very quiet , but you can also use it to line up side beards and get them evenly and perfectly match or give it to your significant other to help shave your neck and clean up your neckline. So it 's a really , really great tool . </shave.v.2882><shave.v.2883>First let me say that I have a physical condition with my hands that makes shaving with a any type of manual razor a real headache. Using a manual razor is near impossible for me and I always would end up with nicks and cuts because of my inability to properly handle the razor. To that end , I have even had my face lasered to decrease hair growth on my face so I would not need to shave as often. It certainly has helped cut down the hair growth , but no solution is 100 . </shave.v.2883><shave.v.2884>Now for swimmers , shaving down has always been a tradition and is both physically and psychologically beneficial. Physically , most swimmers , men and women remain as hairy as possible throughout the most intense part of their training usually during the winter months. That ' s right , women too specifically their legs. After a proper taper in preparation for a major swim meet , the swimmer will shave his/her legs , arms , back , and men will shave their chest and even their head. The removal of the body hair is said to reduce drag or water resistance allowing the swimmer to slip through the water and thus swim faster. But the real fact is , shaving for a swimmer is primarily psychological. I have shaved my chest , arms , legs , and even my head twice and only a true swimmer can understand the feeling of diving into a 76-degree pool completely shaved You feel immortal . </shave.v.2884><shave.v.2885>These three gradessilver tip ( or super as it is also known ) , best and purecomprise the general declension of hair quality for nearly all premium shaving brushes manufactured today. However , the shaver must always be alert to the fact that the distinctions between these various grades of hair quality are distressfully elastic. I have encountered many so called silver tip brushes loaded with best. Conversely , I have seen best brushes loaded with silver tip. These distinctions are so vague that even the manufacturers themselves are sometimes unsure of the hair they use . </shave.v.2885><shave.v.2886>At the beginning of summer , I have her shaved down completely , except for her tail and ears. I guess that is dogscaping. And she does n't have a choice . </shave.v.2886><shave.v.2887>I shave my pubic hairs , legs , armpits &amp;sometimes my arms. Unless I 've been on holiday as they go blonde. I never get shaving rash on my legs or arms , but i get it on my vagina , mainly bikini line and my armpits. I only really notice this happens when I shave day after day. I hate the stubble though , moisturiser helps abit , not much. Do n't use soap , it dries out the skin , your better off using a cream ( shaving cream ) . </shave.v.2887><shave.v.2888>So , Whats up with , " the whole shaving the legs thing with cyclists " . This question comes up often when I am speaking with Newbies and old hands a like. Some have embraced the idea and others havent. A year or so ago I was on an airplane reading my copy of VeloNews. The guy next to me starting talking with me about bikes and the question came up , " Why do cyclists shave their legs ? " . Without much thought I gave him the pat answers of : </shave.v.2888><shave.v.2889>A final word about hair quality and shaving brush performance : beginning shavers are always confronted by a virtual barrage of conflicting claims regarding the relative quality of various shaving brush brands. These claims are invariably based on the relative quality of the badger hair used to produce the shaving brush knot. Since badger hair used in shaving brushes is harvested from various parts of the animals pelt , the hair itself displays characteristic differences depending on precisely where on the animal the hair is procured. The process by which this fastidious culling process is done is maddeningly vague. Nothing in the entire process is conducted with convincing clarity , transparency or consistency. Complicating matters further; nearly all badger hair comes from China; however , wet shaving is not a Chinese indulgence . </shave.v.2889><shave.v.2890>I have a Corgi and she 's double coated so I 've heard many different sources which say " DO N'T SHAVE ! " One is that their undercoat actually keeps the heat out , and the other reason is that if you shave them , instances of them getting sunburns or other skin problems might arise . </shave.v.2890><shave.v.2891>I am very concerned about all the women who go get laser on their face ... especially with Doctors orders. Most technicians will shave the entire area even if only a few hairs are dark and stubbly due to tweezing. I am also ALARMED at how uniformed clients are about the effects of laser and going into the sun. People should be fully aware of the importance of sun block and sun exposure 3 weeks prior and 3 weeks after a treatment. Many laser technicians also recommend shaving between treatments which usually changes the composition of the hair. The main " danger " is that while the laser might lesson your " pain " with those few hairs in a year , to a year and a half , the rest of the hairs on your face may have turned into a FULL BEARD . </shave.v.2891><shave.v.2892>I was glad I had requested the gas for V as her veins and arteries were fragile. Dr. Hague gently shaved her right leg to find a site for the injection since the veins in her left leg , where her IV had been , were far too fragile and could not hold the needle.

It really makes a difference. At first I felt like a porn star. Now it 's just the status-quo. It also really does make your unit look bigger or at least more pronounced. Although she finds things hard to pronounce with her mouth full . </shave.v.2894><shave.v.2895>I like the feeling of my own freshly shaved underarms and legs , and smooth legs on other women are nice too. I always loved touching my girlfriend 's legs when she had n't had time to shave though. There is just something so intimate about it . </shave.v.2895><shave.v.2896>Anyway , the shaving was terrible and reminded me that the reason I got a beard in the first place was that I hated shaving. However , it does look smarter to be clean shaven , for me , anyway. But the annoyance and time of wet shavin ! It took about 15 minutes , but I opened up the same cuts every time , so had lots of scabs on my face -- and it hurt , too , when shaving off the longer hairs of a 4 day beard. I had even started using women 's disposables as they are hyoallergenic and only one blade ( the double and triple blades seem to get clogged up with each stroke ) , which were a definite improvement but still no fun . </shave.v.2896><shave.v.2897>I know 2 people who shave their cats. They look really tough , you can see their muscles. Lot less fur deposits and fur " tumbleweed " . If you leave their legs furry it looks like they have on cool leg warmers. And of course for that " lionesque " look , do n't shave the head. You probably would n't want to shave the head anyway . </shave.v.2897><shave.v.2898>From the looks of it , it 's a Merkur " Hefty " ( or " HD " for " Heavy Duty " ) double-edged razor. It 's a fantastic way to shave , and the blades are less than 50 cents each . </shave.v.2898><shave.v.2899>It is this propensity to shed ( and re-grow ) the undercoat without shedding the guard hairs that makes such a strange coat if they are shaved , as the undercoat gets longer than the guard hairs ( since the guards are n't in an active growth phase ) , and it is the guards that keep the coat from matting and give it some texture. So for years you have to wait for the guards to come back. They should , eventually , it just takes nearly forever . </shave.v.2899><shave.v.2900>The new Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 features 50 more shaving surface for a fast close shave.

However I remember slicing myself pretty bad the first few times I tried , as my skin was weak and soft from putting girly creams on it ( shaving cream ) . Perhaps the baking soda could help avoid that. I now think shaving cream is one of those very well-marketed products : a thing people think they really need , but appears to be ( secretly ) completely useless with modern razors ! If I do try a straight razor someday , though , I think I 'll use the proper soap and brush. No sense slicing my face off by accident . </shave.v.2901><shave.v.2902>Even if infrequently , the occasion arises where technology has actually caused quality in a particular facet of life to deteriorate. This is indeed the case with shaving. After enduring years of irritation , razor bumps , burning skin and dryness , not to mention the inability to shave daily as a result of these problems , I researched and have found a solution : shave like my great grandfather did. I did some reading , some research , and headed to classicshaving.com for some supplies. I purchased a Merkur Futur razor , a Vulfix super-badger Brush and some Proraso Italian shaving soap then waited for it to come ( please exhibit some pride towards me for being patient ) . </shave.v.2902><shave.v.2903>Come along and shave or colour your hair.

I recommend the tub rather than the tube for a beginner , as you can lather the soap inside the tub itself for convenience. The tube is still great , though , and I use it often. Another great option is any of the soaps from Taylor of Old Bond Street. They ' re a bit more expensive ( though more dense ) , and come in a number of interesting scents. Good soaps are glycerin-based , and unlike modern shave gels/creams , they don ' t create huge mountains of lather you only need a thin , opaque layer to shave well. Any more is just wasted . </shave.v.2907><shave.v.2908>The method to accomplish this is always the shave the hair on your arm trick. They even call it " popping the hair off your arm , " or claim the edge " just pops the hair off. " This may be based on the concept that the hair is so terrified that it leaps off the arm in fear when it sees the knife blade coming , rather than suffer the certain severing with ultra-keen steel that will undoubtedly occur . </shave.v.2908><shave.v.2909>I ended up deciding on the safety razor , since I want to be able to shave more quickly than a straight razor would require. I ' m also hesitant to plop down $ 150 or whatever it would cost for a straight razor without knowing if I ' d even like it . </shave.v.2909><shave.v.2910>I ' ve never looked at shaving , waxing , or whatever with your pubes as being unfeminis; it just depends who you ' re doing it for. If leg hair drives you INSANE [ like it does with me ] or you ' re a swimmer going for aerodynamics or you ' re sexually active , then that ' s fine , you ' re doing it for yourself. We may be feminists , but we have lives too. If you want to look like porn/movie stars or just let society tell you that good normal teenage girls shave their legs , then I think it ' s unfeminist then. You ' re doing it for society , not yourself . </shave.v.2910><shave.v.2911>I always shave with two blades not three or four. Tried switching before and always ended with bumps and rough legs. So from then on , I always stuck with two bladed razors with a moisture strip. If you use disposable make sure you clean it good after use. Be sure no build up of hair , soap , or shaving cream is on the blade. These would cause the razor to rust faster , and throw it away after two uses . </shave.v.2911><shave.v.2912>For the first-time body-hair shaving experience , taking most of the hair off with electric clippers or the " hedge trimmer " on an electric razor makes a world of difference compared to doing it all with a razor. And , why do cyclists shave their legs ? Well ... a practical reason is that if you crash and get road rash ( or deeply grind the skin off your kneecap ... ) , it is so much easier changing dressings if you do n't have hair for tape , bandaids , or scabs to stick to ...

I ' ve been using it now for about 6 years , the hairs on my legs are so fine the ' plucker ' can ' t even grasp them so they remain and I have to shave my pits about once every other week or so.

I did n't shave my legs for years for the " feminist " reason , or so I thought , but what it actually was , for me , was that I wanted to ignore my body , and not make it beautiful.

The whiskers somehow seemed softer and my face was maybe a bit more slippery. Have you had any similar experience , or comments from anyone else , or is this just my imagination ?

I tried shaving my legs once with a straight razor and , although it did feel great , the stubble was back in about 12 hours. You can buy a pair of clippers for about $ 15- $ 20 at Wal-Mart and they 'll last a long time if you take care of them. Good luck ! One other thing ...

Lower caste men were either clean shaven sported a beard. During the period from 1850 to 1950 , men kept moustaches as a symbol of power and to display of their robust personality. During the 1930s , Mahatma Gandhi 's Swadeshi Movement against British rulers advised Indians to have beards so that imported shavers and blades could be stopped.

So , no no shave November for us , although I was interested . </shave.v.2990><shave.v.2991>One important point , especially with large-knot stiffish brushes like the Shavemac 220 : brushes hold a lot of water , and if you fail to work all that water into the lather at the outset , you ' ll find that in the second and third pass the lather has become thin and worthless. So , especially with these larger , stiff brushes , you need to pump the brush ( and this is where a lathering bowl is helpful ) , combined with the usual swirling and rapid stirring motions. You pump the brush by working it up and down; this ensures that the water at the base of the brush gets worked into the lather. Don ' t pump it so vigorously as to break or damage the bristles just enough to work the lather fully into the brush and the brush ' s charge of water fully into the lather. Experience will be your guide. Brushes that hold a fair amount of water may therefore require a bit more shaving cream or shaving soap for a proper lather . </shave.v.2991><shave.v.2992> Hi Steve , I bought a straight razor and a strop from you some weeks back , and I 've just bought two of each for my brothers , for Christmas. . . .

In addition , electric razor heads can dull over time making it even more difficult to get a good or non-irritating shave. And the older you are , the more sensitive to shaving those particular areas can become. On the other hand , wet shaving with canned foam or non-lathering shaving gel can go on cold and are often filled with harsh ingredients. If you are looking for an alternative or already wet shave with water and some form of soap or cream then shaving with a brush and quality lather my be right for you.

If you can still find the Philishave Reflex Action shavers with the closeness/comfort adjustment , I would go for that because I would think they would be at a good price now. This is because the newer Reflex Action models do not have this adjustment. With both the Philishave Reflex Action and Quadra Action models , the entire head assembly adjust to the contours of your face in a three-dimensional manner to give you closer contact to your face. One way to minimize irritation is to start with a dry face. If humidity prevents you have having a dry face , I found that the pre-shave powder stick helps me to shave with fewer strokes and the fewer strokes you make , the less irritation. I 've been impressed with my Quadra Action shaver. I still use my Reflex Action rechargeable shaver with the adjustment when I 'm away from home. So if you ca n't find a Reflex Action model with the adjustment , I would go with a Quadra Action model.

If it does , then it 's worth trying out again. First , make sure the heads are still in great shape. Otherwise , a new set of Philishave/Norelco HQ4 heads would be needed. Also check to see that it runs OK. A shaver repair shop can lubricate and tune up the shaver if that is needed.

Soft whiskers , I repeat , soft whiskers ! There are many ways to soften whiskers and the most popular are in the shower , using a damp , hot towel or splashing warm water on the face. The question is , how do you know , or do you already know , when your whiskers have reached optimal softness for the best shave. Before softening , most growth will feel like steel wool or sandpaper. However once you adequately soften the stubble it will go from feeling coarse to feeling more like a terry towel texture , indicating it is supple and ready to shave. Use water that is as hot as your hand and shave area is comfortable with , but not hot enough to scald or burn.

For women most of the hair is fine and pale , not usually visible to the naked eye but for some women the hair is darker and coarser in places we do n't like or expect like on the face , neck , abdomen , breasts , or arms. These unexpected areas may prevent us from wearing the clothes we enjoy or participating in certain activities such as swimming. For men , shaving or trimming your facial hair may be a regular grooming habit but the excess hair on your back , shoulders , around the ears , or between the eyebrows seems to grow back faster than you can pluck or shave it. Regular shaving of body hair becomes a tedious chore. Hair has no vital function in humans yet its psychological importance is enormous. In cases like these , it may be time to consider long-term hair removal . </shave.v.3045><shave.v.3046>I have shaved off all my lovely long hair. Did it last night !

When the hair is not shaved it needs to be combed through ( hundreds of times ) by the physician who makes the recipients sites and again by the technician who places the grafts into the sites. This repetitive trauma of combing through the hair again and again will result in hair shock , a shedding of the existing hair. When this hair falls out in 2 to 3 weeks there will be a 2 to 3 month wait before it returns. Whereas if the hair were buzzed it would grow from day one 1 and keep growing. A number 3 buzz cut often will look good at 10 to 14 days post operatively and blend in with the recipient site well . </shave.v.3052><shave.v.3053>My biggest discovery with shaving was skin mosturizer; I recommend this to men for daily use too.

Softens and lifts the beard off the skin while allowing the razor to glide effortlessly over the skin , avoiding nicks and cuts and delivering the cleanest , closest shave possible. Leaves the skin exceptionally smooth . </shave.v.3096><shave.v.3097>( REAL NAME ) Proraso Shave Cream is the best bang for the buck in hi-end , non drugstore shave creams. I 've tried them all and keep coming back to proraso. The texture , consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate - and you do n't need a badger hair brush ! I initially missed using a brush at first , but do n't miss all the product I wasted that were left behind in the bristles. Couple proraso with a good safety razor ( may I suggest Merkur ) and you 'll get a shave that trounces anything a Mach III can throw at you. Trust me . </shave.v.3097><shave.v.3098>I recommend shaving as being fastest and easy. After years of plucking my chin and upper lip , which takes way too long [ a half-hour daily ] , hurts , and causes bumps , I turned to shaving. Much faster , easier , no bumps. I had laser 1 or 2 times 10 years ago , which helped; now I need to shave only every other day. I do n't have PCOS but have hormone imbalance and am postmenopause. this is a very common problem , many women of color suffer , and in some , it can be related to diabetes or pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome . </shave.v.3098><shave.v.3099>62.

He only sent us one email , saying " From the MRI it seems that the mensical problem is relatively minor so that you should have that fixed before the ADR , which of course is a larger intervention " . That was a reply to an email where Anastasia says she is " still unable to walk or stand very long " . In the surgery , Dr. Toft not only did a 'Lateral Release ' and a 'thermal ablation ' to the Medial Meniscus , but he also shaved the Patient 's Retro-Patellar Cartliage . </shave.v.3100><shave.v.3101>When I ' m done shaving , I always pat the razor thoroughly dry with a towel , and will occasionally oil them with a few drops of a light household oil ( 3-in-1 oil works well , though I suppose olive oil or canola oil would work just as well. ) If you have a small cup or container you don ' t mind parting with , you can also use that as an oil reservoir to store the razor , cartridge down , in between shaves . </shave.v.3101><shave.v.3102>" To shave off the beard and to trim it more than the legal length is impermissible and forbidden ( haraam ) .

Thanks ! </shave.v.3103><shave.v.3104>As to the shape , that 's really your call unless someone else will be checking it out. Different guys will have different preferences; some , like myself , are n't that fond of the obviously shaved look , as it 's reminiscent of strippers trying to look pre-pubescent; some will be into it for a variety of reasons. So in the end ( no pun intended ) you need to please yourself. Be aware that if you 're overweight , shaving will probably make that more apparent . </shave.v.3104><shave.v.3105>You should NEVER shave your double coated dog ! EVER. The fur that keeps them warm in the winter also acts to keep them cool in warmer climates. Not only that , but there is no guarantee that the coat will grow back the same.

It can be bought quite easily nowadays , from bigger Boots stores and most department stores too. Hell , Stafford even has it !

I ' ve read comments along the lines of , I like Brand A it tugs a lot , but when I ' m done , I have a nice , close shave. Keep looking until you find a brand that gives you a nice close shave without tugging. Look for a blade that gives you a smooth , easy shave , without any tendency to nick . </shave.v.3109><shave.v.3110>When I use the Venus Embrace razor and the Satin Care shave gel together , I get an incredibly close and smooth shave every single time.

The safety razor is really easy to use , so do n't be put off. The only real trick is shaving in the direction of the hair growth AND not applying any pressure on the razor head ( use the weight of the razor ) . Also , once you go over each area gently - reapply lather and gently repeat to ensure a close shave . </shave.v.3118><shave.v.3119>Blades are generally printed with the manufacturer ' s name , etc. , and the two sides top and bottom often look different in terms of what ' s printed. But there ' s no difference in function , and you can put the blade in the razor with either side on top : it makes no difference. Since you use both sides of the razor as you shave when one side has collected enough lather , you switch over to the other side for a while before you rinse the razor the two edges are worn down simultaneously . </shave.v.3119><shave.v.3120>Now you 're ( both ) ready : Moving around him as you work with his razor , shave with ( not against ) the hair growth. Start at one sideburn and shave down to the neck , slowly working around his face. Repeat the hot-towel routine , then shave again this time against ( not with ) the growth and from the neck up. One more hot towel , please , and then a cold one to close the pores and perk him up. End with more conditioning cream or a splash of aftershave.

( Especially if you 're spending any time at the beach. ) Invest in a clipper with a guard like the one 's a barber may use. You should shave the hair short ( cropped ) but do n't shave it off ( unless you are in great shape and have the pecs and abs to show off ) No shiny bellies or man boobs please ! Use the 3 guard on the chest and 1 on the back. Waxing is an option for your back , but it can be painful , expensive and cause irritation resulting in in-grown hairs that can become infected resembling acne. If you go the waxing route , see a licensed professional . </shave.v.3123><shave.v.3124>I use the Aveeno shave gel because of your recommendation and I love it !

Shaving creams , pre-shave and after-shave products contain irritating ingredients like alcohol , menthol , mint , potassium or sodium hydroxide , and camphor. Pre-shaves , for example , are designed to irritate the skin , making hair follicles and skin swell to force the hair up and away from the skin for a closer shave. Unfortunately , the resulting swelling and irritation damages the skin and actually can make it harder for the stubble to find its way back out. When hair begins to grow , before the swelling is reduced , ingrown hairs can be the result . </shave.v.3128><shave.v.3129>Shaving soap is probably the best alternative to canned shaving cream. It lathers well , especially if applied with a shaving brush , its packaging is minimal and easily biodegradable ( usually paper or cardboard ) , it lasts a long time and it ' s cheap. A single cake of soap costs between $ 2 and $ 5 and will last dozens of shaves. I ' ve used Kent shaving soap ( from the UK ) and Simmons shaving soap ( from California ) and would recommend them both equally. There are also a wide array of other shaving soaps out there , so if you ' re shopping locally , you can probably find one that ' s made close to home . </shave.v.3129><shave.v.3130>And by Alpha I mean not just perfectly smooth , but without even the merest hint that he 'd ever run a blade over his face.

Would love to try this kit ! </shave.v.3133><shave.v.3134>After you gain some experience with your straight razor , you can try adding an across the grain and against the grain pass. An across the grain pass is when you shave in the direction perpendicular to that which the beard grows. So if your whiskers grow downward on your cheek , you ' ll shave across your cheek from right to left or left to right. Shaving against the grain involves shaving against the direction your beard grows. It ' s basically the reverse of shaving downward . </shave.v.3134><shave.v.3135>By shaving your legs , you open yourself up to the question , " Why do you shave your legs ?

I have ! In one way it is not such a huge deal for me since I only shave a couple times a week.

I apply a nice thick lather of shaving cream. My Grandfather always told me that you MUST lather the face up good. I always use the double edge safety razor .there is nothing like it.

Take it slow and easy and enjoy the shave ! ! ! </shave.v.3145><shave.v.3146>Perhaps the first clue regarding shaving one 's beard is the ritual purification of the Metsora or " leper " . We read in Lev 14 : 9 : " And it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and he shall be clean. " We see that in certain contexts a person is required to shave his beard and this is even an act of purification. Similarly , we read about the consecration of the Levites : " And thus shalt thou do unto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of purification upon them , and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and cleanse themselves. " ( Nu 8 : 7 ) . Again we see that shaving the beard and indeed all the hair is not only permissible but can be an act of purification. In contrast , the prohibition of Lev 19 is to shave the head or beard as an act of mourning ! </shave.v.3146><shave.v.3147>I like electric shavers.. you can pick 'em up at rummage sales for like $ 2.

( My husband does n't care at all and says he thinks hair is sexy ) . People must have been staring hard at my legs ! So I hear where you are coming from. Dark-haired people must have exponentially more feedback on this issue ! </shave.v.3149><shave.v.3150>Just the other night , I watched a Bruce Lee film. I think you might be familiar with this or watched this before. The movie is entitled Return of Dragon. It was also titled Way of Dragon. I am not here to talk about the terrible acting or cheesy plot anyway. I jut want to know , those of you who have seen this movie too , did you noticed that bear skin rug down Chuck Norris ' s back ? Just try to recall the final show down which took place between Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee. Norris was so 70s retro as he could possibly get. I am not complaining about his bell-bottom pants or that butterfly collar. What I am just dying to find out is why he could not shave his back. Chuck Norris could have been the one to start off the issue on men hair remover. If you want to know what I am saying , go ahead and watch the film . </shave.v.3150><shave.v.3151>Although licensing requirements vary from state to state , the general rule is barbers can cut and dye hair and shave faces but usually are n't licensed to do manicures. Cosmetologists can cut hair , do facials , manicures and pedicures , but are n't licensed to shave . </shave.v.3151><shave.v.3152>It takes about 30 seconds of rubbing to get it lathered up nicely. I have n't always been successful at it ... sometimes I just give up and pretend it 's a shower gel that 's not supposed to lather. I do n't think I 've mastered the art , but I recommend moving out of the water ( or turning off the shower completely for a few minutes ) . I tend to turn off the water , put my leg up on the edge of the tub , and lather up with both hands ( usually works better with small concentric circles ) . If you 're getting water in the mix , it will tend not to foam , I find. Your lather will sort of look like it 's disappearing if you do n't shave over it sort of quickly ... but all you have to do is scrub-a-dub in that spot for a few seconds and you 'll be back in business . </shave.v.3152><shave.v.3153>Micah476 : Have you tried using King of Shave anti-bacterial shaving gel ?

This last year or so I have been shaving my head bald almost every other day ( it has taken a bit of getting used to , I must admit ! ) &amp;there is no experience quite like having your head shaved bald by a barber or your partner ... It is simply awesome ! I have now become quite used to being bald-by-choice &amp;others are getting used to the idea as well. I am only 43 &amp;I am now resigned to the fact that I was born to be bald. I do n't have any other option. If others are thinking about this choice , all I would advise is just do it !

That feeling lasted until my wife got home and proved rather lusty , shall we say , in her approval. I use the Schick Intuition because my wife uses it.

So here ' s another trick : an economical alternative to high-end shaving cream is plain old hair conditioner , which actually works crazily well as a shaving cream for women ' s legs as long as you don ' t expect thick , rich , foamy lather. It softens the whiskers and gives great lubrication. Doesn ' t need to be the fancy stuff , either Suave conditioner works just as well as anything else I ' ve tried. After showering , apply a liberal amount of hair conditioner to your legs and leave it on for at least a minute before you start shaving.

I love my electric shaver so much because I am prone to nicks and irritation. I have lighter skin and darker hair so I pretty much had to shave daily , making the irritation worse. I can shave daily with my electric with no irritation. Practice does make perfect when going over the knees and ankle bones because pressing too hard can cause a rash.

When a lather starts to form , continue rubbing for 30-45 seconds to make sure that the brush will have picked up enough soap. Rub that over your wet beard , brushing vigorously , to coat the beard with soap , and the lather will start to build , though at this point your beard will have more soap than lather. Put a driblet of hot water in the center of the brush and continue to work up the lather. Youll may have to add another driblet of hot to get a sufficiently wet and dense lather , but working the lather around on your beard is all to the good.

Perhaps I tend to press a little harder when shaving wet. However , for some reason I get less irritation and shave the neck hairs closer when I shave dry. I usually use a pre-shave such as Mennen Afta. After the shave I use a little Saxon after shave cream and that usually eliminates the redness.

Always use a new razor each and every time you do this. Pubic hair is thick and will dull a blade after just one shave , and using a dull blade is a pathway to painville. Clean the razor after every stroke by repeatedly tapping it against the side or bottom of the bowl and then visually inspect it to make sure it 's clean before continuing.

While shaving you should rinse the razor after each stroke , certainly after two as you wo n't get a clean , close shave if the blade is clogged with whiskers.

The doctor said I could have paralyzed my eye muscle if I 'd come in any later. I also had a gynecologist tell me that my shaving my bikini hair was causing yeast infections. Instead of scaring me away , though , it just made me more careful. I always use rubbing alcohol before plucking , and I make sure to keep my razor clean for down there.

After a month of trial and error , I decided to buy a starter set of TAOS ( unscented ) . At first I was concerned about having sufficient time shaving , but after my first shave I enjoyed the feel of my skin so much that I didn ' t mind an extra couple minutes. My regiment is what is currently recommended by TAOS. After cleaning my face w/ an exfoilating cream in the shower , I apply the shaving oil. Then I apply the shaving cream w/ the provided kit brush. As recommended , I shave twice , once w/ the grain and once against the grain. I find that w/ some practice I can shave pretty quickly without worrying about nicks.

" I do n't shave , I just trim my face , " says David Walker-Smith , head of men 's buying at Selfridges. " It 's totally acceptable to do that. " </shave.v.3307><shave.v.3308>I was just trying to figure out how the no ! no ! actually works with little luck. It appears it does involve having to shave the hair ? Is there anything else on the market that will " achieve hair density reduction at home , " permanently ? I am fine with putting a bit of work into this now , not fine with anything that will want constant maintenance . </shave.v.3308><shave.v.3309>On a side note , here ' s the deal with shaving your face. Don ' t worry about shaving everyday. Having a barely there beard is expected of the modern American man. The formula is this : Shave your face every 5 to 7 days , but shave your neck every 2 to 3 days . </shave.v.3309><shave.v.3310>It ' s a good idea to shave right after a hot shower. Hot water opens your pores and gives a closer , more comfortable shave. As an alternative , you can use hot water to heat up your face use nice , hot water for at least 30 seconds to a minute to get your face ready . </shave.v.3310><shave.v.3311>Many of you have mentioned that shaving in or after a shower works best and I agree with that partly because of what you ' ve all said about softening the beard. I read something many years ago that adds a second reason for shaving after a shower , and that ' s TIME. I ' m not a follicle engineer or anything , but I believe that your facial hair has a growth spurt within the first 30 minutes or so after you wake up. Your body is getting going in the morning and so ' s your beard. If you have been in the practice of shaving shortly after you wake up , you ' ll find that your five O ' Clock shadow will appear earlier in the day for your particular beard-growth-speed than if you wait approximately 30 minutes to shave. It ' s different for everyone , of course , but I did notice a difference when I first started this practice many years ago . </shave.v.3311><shave.v.3312>" Before buying this razor I was using the Fusion power razor but was always getting razor burn on my neck so I did a bit of investigating for alternatives and decided that this was the way to go ( not sure enough to shell out for the vision. ) Since getting my razor I have discovered that it will not suit everyone. It gives a really good shave , ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHAVE PROPERLY. I find that it really does minimize razor burn and ingrown hairs however does not shave quite as closely as a fusion ( this is a good thing as often with cartridge based razors you are actually cutting the hair below skin level which can lead to many problems. In short it gives a really good shave however some may be disappointed. PS. Be REALLY cautious when using for the first week or so as you will cut yourself ... it 's a learning curve but worth the perseverance. " - Grant Bowie </shave.v.3312><shave.v.3313>But , one of my friends go her underarms done ( which is insane to me , as it ' s the smallest part to shave , and takes about 3 seconds , so I don ' t see the problem ) and it took her 3 visits at $ 90 per sesssion to have it complete . But she has fine blonde hair , so I assume your forest may take more sessions than that . </shave.v.3313><shave.v.3314>I have to agree with you that it 's a fallacy. If it were true , balding men would be shaving their heads regularly to encourage hair growth. I think it 's a funny fallacy , too , because when people complain about new hairs sprouting after a shave , they fail to mention that it 's that new hair growth that caused them to shave the area in the first place ! Another reason for this fallacy is that when hair first grows in a new area , it 's thin at the top and thicker at the bottom - when you shave off the top , the growing hair appears thicker because the original thin top has been removed . </shave.v.3314><shave.v.3315>So I just started dating a guy a few months ago and am really into him , but he has these stereotypical ideas in his head of what a women should be like. Its so frustrating to me , because other than that we have a lot in common and really get along. He does n't shave his face very often so I always kid and say I 'm not going to shave my legs for as long as he does n't shave , but he insists its not the same. I tell him he 's being hypocritical but he says he just likes it better when I shave. My hair grow really fast and is kind of prickly and dark , so if I do n't shave everyday it 's pretty noticeable. I guess I can understand feeling smooth legs against your body probably does feel better than prickly legs , but I do n't want to feel like I 'm less attractive to him when I do n't have time to shave or just do n't feel like it. I do n't want to fight with him about it but just wish he could see my point of view. Any one had any similar experiences ? Is there any hope for him ? </shave.v.3315><shave.v.3316>Which sexy singer shaved the right side of her head today ? It ' s Cassie , who revealed the shocking photos on her Twitter page.

Something that displays the ' I don ' t give a fuck ' attitude ... </shave.v.3316><shave.v.3317>It does n't make me less of a feminist. I do n't look down on others that do n't shave. I do n't look down on those that do. I understand the societal pressures in place and I 'm willing to analyse those pressures. I do n't feel the need to shave to be attractive to the opposite sex. I 've never had a guy recoil in fear when he 's touched my unshaven legs. It has happened when a guy I 'm with has noticed I have n't shaved recently and he and I could 've really cared less . </shave.v.3317><shave.v.3318>this one always works fine and it is the closest shaving shaver i have ever had without any skin irritation whatsoever.its priced too high here . </shave.v.3318><shave.v.3319>Of course , many ( if not most ) American women shave throughout the year , regardless of weather. Some have a personal dislike of body hair , whether on female or male bodies. Others feel less innately feminine when even a hint of stubble appears on an ankle. Razors geared toward women ( i.e. - they have pink or purple handles , and in my opinion , lower quality blades than men 's models ) are advertised throughout the year on TV and in print , not just during the spring and summer. Salons offering all types of waxing seem to do a booming business year-round , even in cold climates. I love the winter because I can easily ignore all of this , hiding my hairy gams and sprouting arm pits under wool pants and think sweaters. Spring and summers offer challenges , though : do I shirk propriety and walk around in my preferred state of body maintenance neglect , or do I cave and make myself presentable to the viewing public ? </shave.v.3319><shave.v.3320>I shave every day of my life. Sometimes twice a day. E shave shaving cremes are by far the finest cremes available in the marketplace - bar none . </shave.v.3320><shave.v.3321>In fact , the razor company claims one in three men shaves somewhere besides the face. So the company , owned by Proctor &amp;Gamble , [ PG 63.42 +0.23 ( +0.36 ) ] has created some " how-to " videos for YouTube demonstrating shaving techniques for new territories . </shave.v.3321><shave.v.3322>Beginning in Daytona , Fla. , site of the Daytona 500 ( 1 p.m. ET Sunday , FOX ) , a Gillette-branded motorcoach will travel coast-to-coast , making special pit stops at all the drivers ' hometowns.

Throughout the competition , the teams will be on a mission to record a goal of more than 500 , 000 shaves -- the equivalent of 500 miles of skin -- with the Gillette Fusion MVP razor before April 30 . </shave.v.3322><shave.v.3323>Do not pull on the skin. Hairs are most likely to ingrow if you pull the skin while you are shaving , to get a close shave. This makes the hairs pop out of the follicle. Afterwards , the cut tip retracts into the follicle and then turns into the wall of the follicle . </shave.v.3323><shave.v.3324>It will sound like madness to say it , but when I have rinsed the lather from my face and splashed it with intensely cold water , when I have patted my face dry with a towel and rubbed in the lotion to protect the newly exfoliated skin , smooth and supple I have some sense of what Homer meant. On a good day , a good close shave is the Iliad and the Odyssey in one : the mastery of the dangerous blade , the return to the comforts of home. To shave well is to be a man , and to be a man is closer than Homer could ever have imagined to being like in appearance to the immortal gods as Psalm 8 put it , a little lower than the angels , and as Genesis put it , made in the image of God . </shave.v.3324><shave.v.3325>L'Occitane en Provence makes really , really remarkable shave creams. Their shea butter cream is some of the best I have ever used , and is worth every penny and then some.

I first tried to ween myself off of them a few years ago by switching to an electric razor. I ' ve tried several brands of electric razors over the years including Braun , Panasonic , Norelco , Remington , etc , but none of them were really all that great. My favorite of the bunch was a Panasonic , but it still didn ' t do a very good job. I finally got to the point of having a beard for awhile but recently shaved it off just because I felt it was time I guess. Once I shaved it off , I had to go back to normal blades and shaving cream which really sucked . </shave.v.3329><shave.v.3330>If you have n't tried any Jack Black products , you 're in for a treat. Jack Black is a great line of skin and shave products , made in the U.S.A . </shave.v.3330><shave.v.3331>Getting rid of body hair is a notion nearly as old as man. And woman. Cavemen used rocks and shells to shave their beards. As early as 4000 B.C. , women used a paste made of arsenic and quicklime as a depilatory. Fast forward to the 20th century. American women began to shave their underarms only after short-sleeve fashion came in vogue around 1915 , and marketers began blitzing the cause in women 's magazines . </shave.v.3331><shave.v.3332>Society likes to equate pink and other certain colors as specific to women , however we have many brush handles and styles that would also appeal to the fairer sex. Em 's Place is fond of wood , however since many women shave in the shower extra care needs to be taken to dry a wood or metal handle off between use - and shake out excess water. A synthetic handle would be the most care-free but sometimes not as exciting in the looks department. Brush selection primarily depends on personal taste , care and budget . </shave.v.3332><shave.v.3333>I just bought the BRAUN SYNCRO SYSTEM 7570 , and I wanted to tell you that it 's a GREAT product. The advertising says that it shaves closer and with less irritation - and it does. When I bought it I was n't really sure if I wanted to spend that much money ( esp. since I bought a Philishave some 18 months ago ) but has definitely paid off. It really shaves incredibly close - the closest shave I ever had with a electric shaver ( beats the Philishave by far ) . For the first time I am really satisfied with the closeness of an electric shaver. What 's even better is that my skin ( I have quite sensitive skin ) looks better and less irritated. I 'm just glad I bought it . </shave.v.3333><shave.v.3334>Shaving was a ritual that both men and women practiced , but as a young Wigwam , I was only familiar with watching my father shave in the morning. With one bathroom in the house and four kids , we had a tad less privacy in the mornings that we might feel comfortable with these days . </shave.v.3334><shave.v.3335>The Fusion shaver by Gillette is a cruel joke ! If you do n't have a heavy 5 O'Clock shadow this thing does n't work. It is painful and does n't shave very close. The 5 blade thing sounds good but , the spacing between the blades it too narrow and they clog and that single blade on the end , good thought but , does n't work any better than my Sensor or Mach III. I want a refund for my free sample I was sent , that is how incredibly bad this shaver is . </shave.v.3335><shave.v.3336>My husband has fair , slightly oily skin and wickedly bad in-grown hairs. One thing that has made a huge difference ( because I had already won the proper face-wash battle and he NEVER used aftershave ) was taking his shower first and letting his skin get really nice and worm before starting to shave. He shaves ( with a nice razor ) and then hops in the shower for another minute after just to get all of the gunk off. Then he uses a very light moisturizer . </shave.v.3336><shave.v.3337>Now THAT ' S a wedge of Intensity. Fabulous photos..

I tune in to GMA and shave while I 'm watching the morning news. With one hand I move the shaver around while with the other hand I feel my head to see where I 've missed and where I need to go next. I 've been doing it this way for three years ... and it works GREAT ( as Tony The Tiger would say ) ! </shave.v.3338><shave.v.3339>I ' m a sargent in the Israeli Army and I ' m required to shave every morning but all I ' m given is a crappy razor.

The reason why I think its the best is because for some reason , I ' ve gotten the smoothest shave , even though all my other shaves have been ' Baby Butt Smooth ' ( BBS ) . For some reason , the addition of Proraso cream made everything better . </shave.v.3341><shave.v.3342>Ok , I just happened across this site and I feel the necessity to post. I 'm a girl , I 'm not hairy , but I do have hairs around my ass ( the pubes just keep going , ya know ? ) I shave my butt regularly , with no ill effects , no mirror , and no stubble afterwards. The hair around my ass is much finer than my pubes , and I assume because of that I do n't get stubble , or razor burn or anything else . </shave.v.3342><shave.v.3343>I ' ve been working to get one of these for a while , but funds have been limited ( being a student ) for the start-up cost of wetshaving. However , I keep in mind that once purchased , it will be refreshingly cheap to shave from then on . </shave.v.3343><shave.v.3344>Many scholars have stated that shaving the beard is Tagyeeru Khalqillah ( changing the creation of Allah ) . Allah mentions in the Holy Quran the promise of Satan , Indeed I will order them ( Mankind ) to change the nature created by Allah ( 4 : 119 ) . In effect , the one who shaves his beard is obeying Satan. The great Caliph Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz would say , Shaving the beard is Muthlah ( mutilation ) . Verily the Prophet has prohibited Muthlah . A similar verdict has also been narrated from the great Imam of Madina Munawwarah , Imam Malik . </shave.v.3344><shave.v.3345>The general tendency amongst the scholars seems to be that to keep a beard is obligatory for men and to shave it off is a sin. This opinion is based on a few ahadith which do support this point of view. Those who believe otherwise claim that the ahadith mentioned to support this claim are weak and there are other , stronger ahadith which emphasise the significance of some other features of men 's physical appearance , but they do n't mention keeping a beard in that category. Those ahadith discourage men , for instance , from keeping drooping moustaches that cover some part of the upper lip; clipping nails on a regular basis is also emphasised , as is circumcision of children. Scholars who belong to this category believe that keeping a beard can only be considered as recommended but not binding . </shave.v.3345><shave.v.3346>You certainly can shave your cat and MANY people have done it and will continue to do it in the future. Most people prefer to go to a groomer , but they 'll usually charge around 50 bucks. If you try to do it yourself , you have to have a very high trust level with your kitty and be very VERY careful with the shaver , as kitty 's skin is very sensitive and thin and breaks easily. However , doing this keeps kitty cooler in the summer and prevents hair buildup around your home , as well as preventing painful and icky hairball vomit . </shave.v.3346><shave.v.3347>Why , that 's the Merkur HD " Hefty Classic " , a fine modern double-edged ( DE ) safety razor.

It isn ' t faster , scrapes don ' t heal faster , and , according to French men , hair on a body ( any body ) is preferable , so the ' sexy ' thing doesn ' t fly universally , although in Dug ' s case ( and a lot of other cases , too ! ) .. sexy as a reason is just fine . </shave.v.3350><shave.v.3351>Whether she chooses to shave or not to shave , that is her choice.

My Philishave Quadra Action shaver does give me a closer shave , but I had to change my shaving habit to take advantage of the Quadra Action 's unique heads. The holes which make up the inner part of the shaving surface are on a thinner surface as opposed to the slots which make up the outer part of the shaving surface. So I 'm now using a combination of straight and circular motions. Because the surface of the outer slots is thicker than the inner holes , I ca n't get as close a shave on the edges of my sideburns and beard which forces me to use my trimmer more. This is not a complaint , through. I love this shaver , especially when it comes to cleaning this shaver by rinsing it under the faucet which you can not do with any other plug-in shaver. Of course , you must unplug the cord from the shaver before rinsing. I hope this helps and thanks again . </shave.v.3355><shave.v.3356>I always wanted to do it , , So i did this summer an it looks great.

Well , my freshman year of college ( one year ago ) , I decided i have two optiongs : live with hating shaving , or turn it into a hobby and enjoy it ! I ' m glad to say I did the latter. Soon I discovered Double Edge razors , and bought a Merkur Futur , I also use Baxters 1.2.3. Skin Care. I have experimented with a number of different scrubs , everything from Baxters to St. Ives to MenScience. Unfortunately , I ' m still a college student and don ' t have to funds to keep buying some of my favorite and needed products. Shaving cream and a brush are two examples.

I use the Lab Series if I 've gone a few days or if I am shaving late in the day. The only downside I see with the Art of Shaving is that it 's a bit on the pricey side , so buy it when there is a special going on at Skin Store . </shave.v.3374><shave.v.3375>I shave right after I shower.

At my previous jobs I had been able to shave every few days , as I was not in front of customers.

I mention this because it is hard to find coconut milk from a store shelf that does n't have any gums or additives. Although it takes preparation , you can soak the coconut shaving in water to get coconut milk. I 've never used a fresh coconut , but that could be interesting and tasty ! </shave.v.3378><shave.v.3379>Right before you do shave grab your shaving brush and go over your facial hair with it. Regardless to what you heard about prewetting the skin do n't do it. This is why you use the shaving brush prior to starting to shave. Wetting will soften and curl the hair and will void the effects of the shaving brush. Shaving cream can be used but not water and only shave one half of your face at a time . </shave.v.3379><shave.v.3380>I am homosexual. I am a male , and am sexually attracted to other males. I did not chose to be sexually attracted to males , but because I was made like this I should have to hold back my instincts , my attraction , and my NATURAL feelings because God allegedly says not to ? Heterosexual people don't. It is encouraged to have a loving relationship with the opposite sex ... however , I can not have that with a woman. I can not be sexually nor emotionally satisfied that way. So must I go through my life being unhappy in both of those respects just because the bible says so ? Does n't it also say that you should n't shave ? Heaven forbid you all will not stop shaving , a minor chore in the scheme of life , but I must change the person I love ... my entire outlook on my life and my identity so I can gain acceptance from you.

The latest Gillette Mach3 Turbo is advertised to work well BOTH ways , but does n't say which way people were shaving before. I have always shaved against the grain because I feel it gives me a closer shave , but it does give worse razor rash than with the grain. Am I the only one shaving against the grain , or is everybody else doing it that way too ? Which way provides the superior shave and why ? Thank you for your help with this most prickly of questions . </shave.v.3381><shave.v.3382>Your insinuations of negativity towards S &amp;M , and Submissives specifically , shows just how ignorant you are about the lifestyle.

I do n't give a rats how it got started , or because you look down your nose at the oldest profession. I like how it looks , and to hell with anyone else 's opinion of it looking prepubescent ( like hell , the physical structure is obviously different ) . If a guy do n't like it , so the hell what ? There are plenty of folks with enough varying preferences that none of us has to worry about being lonely over our hedge trimming , or clear-cutting habits. And if a guy is more preoccupied with my intimate grooming than who I am as a person , he 's not going to get close enough to find out what I 've got going on under my clothes anyway . </shave.v.3382><shave.v.3383>Ilan and Elia shave their heads , Sam chickens out , Cliff is already shaved down , so that leaves Marcel. Poor sleeping Marcel.

I mean the guy is asleep , minding his own business and then Cliff grabs him. He literally yanks him off the couch and holds him in some weird wrestling pin. It was frustrating and uncomfortable to watch. No one wanted it to happen , but no one stopped it either. Sam just sits there , Ilan continues to film and then finally Cliff lets go. Marcel eventually ends up sleeping in the bathroom , I assume with the door locked for safety. And now Cliff seems like an okay fellow , but all season long we 've seen some nasty mean streaks and violent tendencies come out. I would have probably also spent the evening locked away . </shave.v.3383><shave.v.3384>A clean shaved winky is a very nice feeling. But unless you keep it slick as snot and shaved smoother than a babys arse , the stubble gets itchy. After my one shaving adventure , I walked around itching my ass hole for 2 weeks.

So , I shave what I can easily reach on a regular basis and the rest is what it is . </shave.v.3384><shave.v.3385>That shaving experience was so far superior to any thing that I had ever tried before , I even thought about contacting Sharper Image and telling them they should market it along with their Panasonic Linear Shavers , because they seem to be made for each other.

I use a facial scrub and cleaner both from Neutrogena Men before applying my Every Jack Men ' s shave gel to exfoliate and clean my skin before putting the razor to it. I ' ve been using the Fusion razor for the last couple of years with better results than many other blades or disposables. The combination of the facial scrub/ shave gel/ Fusion blade usually gives me good results , but I still get tons of ingrown nasty hairs at my jaw line.

If you do n't want to shave you could do more brushing and get as much of the dead fur out as you can to thin the coat and try getting her wet before you go.

Of course if this verse is shown to these beard-hating Christians , they usually respond by quickly pointing out that they are " not under the law , " and thereby , according to modern Christian theology , exempt from this commandment.

If you have long hair , trim it to at least shoulder length with shears. Then use clippers to shave your hair down to as short as possible. This will take it to stubble length. Note : Use a guard on the clippers or adjust the blades so they do not actually touch your skin. They can cause cuts in your scalp . </shave.v.3401><shave.v.3402>Because of poor shaving habits , beard hair will grow snug against the skin toward the Adam 's apple. The objective is to retrain the hair to grow straight out to achieve a closer shave without irritating the skin. Keep your strokes short and only shave in the direction the hair grows , keeping plenty of lather between you and the blade. To take the beard closer , shave across the grain or on a slight diagonal. The only way to avoid sensitive skin and ingrown hairs is by NEVER shaving against the grain . </shave.v.3402><shave.v.3403>I want to get an electric shaver but my mom is stupid and foreign and wont hear me out and probably started shaving at age 20. now give me reasons why i should/should not shave my legs . </shave.v.3403><shave.v.3404>Smoothing shave biopsy sites.

I ' ve tried shaving in a large spot on my leg about 6 years ago and it ' s still semi-thick there , not nearly as thick as it had been when i first shaved it though.

If this happens and you are using a shower , the problem might be that the hairs have not softened enough. Get a clean ( non-softener ) washcloth and soak it with warm water.

I was using a low-end Remington Dual Track 35 and found that not only it irritated my skin with regular usage ( every other day ) but also that I had to also pass it over and over certain spots just to get a close enough shave especially my neck area. Last weekend I thought I 'd treat myself to a better quality shaver so I purchased a Norelco Quadra Action 6886XLD and found it shaves a little better and with fewer passes and less irritation as my old shaver. I know that when a guy makes the switch from blade to electric shaver there 's an accommodation period. I 'd like to know if there 's an accommodation period when switching from one electric shaver to different one and if so , does the new shaver shave better after this accommodation period . </shave.v.3467><shave.v.3468>I liked your post although you missed one point , the sound of shaving with a good razor.

I have tried a range of shaving products oils , gels , foam , mach3 , fusion etc and so far the best shave I have had is with G Trumper shave cream lathered with a best badger brush using a double edged safety razor.

Now if you want that ultimate shave , if you want that easy shave , that 's when you add the pre-shave oil , that 's when you add the alum block or an aftershave , because those are little tools that will make the difference. There is no magic product or no magic ingredient to give you a close shave with no razor burn , no bumps , no ingrown. What there is , is an association of product , one after the other , and steps. So if you want the ultimate shave , if you want that face that feels like a baby 's butt , and you have a very strong beard , then you need all the help you can use , and then you obviously want everything that I told you about . </shave.v.3478><shave.v.3479>Why is this so ? Because they contain alcohol ( amongst other harsh chemicals ) and this only further dehydrates your skin , making it feel dry.

The practice of shaving spread from the Macedonians , whose kings are represented on coins , etc. with smooth faces , throughout the whole Greek world. Laws were passed against it , without effect , at Rhodes and Byzantium; and even Aristotle , we are told , conformed to the new custom , [ 4 ] unlike the other philosophers , who retained the beard as a badge of their profession.

Regrowth after shaving feels coarse and thick because the shaft of the hair has been cut straight across , leaving a blunt edge , whereas hair that has re-grown after being removed from the root grows back with the natural taper and therefore feels softer.

As a rubber or lycra fetishist , the fetish is , to a large degree , about the feel of the material against your skin. Body hair essentially interferes in the sensations of feeling rubber or lycra against bare skin , to a degree that is n't even that apparent until you 've tried shaving your legs / chest / privates and experienced the same material with bare skin contact. Which is n't to say its something that I do constantly or regularly , but as an occasional treat or experiment , its really worthwhile.

So , we have the same razor base , and I use his razors after they ' re too dull for him to use , but plenty fine for my use no increased issues with razor burn. Also , since I tend to be clutzy and shave as fast as I can , the slightly dull blades cut down on the amount of times I cut myself . </shave.v.3519><shave.v.3520>Who really cares about closeness of shave ? Or quality for that matter , quite often it 's an after-thought. But I 'm compelled to write to you to say that I 've never been so impressed with a product as your HIS Total Shaving Solution , Shaving Oil. Until now , I 've spend a little bit more for Kiels Shaving Cream for a closer , more satisfying shave. But since trying yourr product , I can not imagine wanting to use anything else. It was recommended to me by a friend and I have since recommended the product to several others. They 've all been absolutely transformed ! </shave.v.3520><shave.v.3521>I get that battling the societal pressure to shave is difficult and refusing to shave gives us solidarity with one another - women with hairy legs can make eye contact and think , " yeah , she gets it. " But feminists do n't all have to be the same. We are tall and short , young and old , long-haired and mohawked , fat and thin , and this is a good thing. Why not add " shaven and unshaven " to that list of dichotomies ?

" - Anthony Liviabella </shave.v.3526><shave.v.3527>Diane Wood : No. The color , location , thickness , and length of your hair mainly depend on genetics and hormones. When you shave , you are cutting the hair at a sharp angle with a blade. That means that the hair growing in might feel coarser for a time as it grows out , and during this phase it may appear darker or thicker , but it 's not . </shave.v.3527><shave.v.3528>Other than during his various stints in the hospital , The Husband has always been a wet-shaver preferring the closer , smoother shave he gets with a wet shave to that of an electric razor. As for myself , I know from experience that I get a much closer shave with a disposable razor and some soap than with an electric razor no matter what brand it is or what they promise. Therefore , being wet-shavers ourselves , it simply never occurred to us to provide the son with anything other than a razor and some shaving cream . </shave.v.3528><shave.v.3529>Men 's faces must also endure more daily stress - mostly from shaving. Shaving creams , pre-shave and after-shave products contain irritating ingredients like alcohol , menthol , mint , potassium or sodium hydroxide , and camphor. Pre-shaves , for example , are designed to irritate the skin , making hair follicles and skin swell to force the hair up and away from the skin for a closer shave. Unfortunately , the resulting swelling and irritation damages the skin and can actually make it harder for the stubble to find its way back out. When hair begins to grow , before the swelling is reduced , ingrown hairs can result . </shave.v.3529><shave.v.3530>Thanks for maintaining a very practical and helpful page.

I get even better results on shaving the mustache , compared with my razor. The neck area is where the shaver has some difficultly , although I think it may be because the shaving cream has a tendency to wash off in the shower. After a second application of cream I can get as close. No razor burn , no in-grown hairs ( I do get these with razors ) . It takes a few extra minutes to complete the shave compared to razor ( maybe 7-8 min vs. 5-6 min ) .

Use sharp blades. Dull blades are responsible for most shaving cuts. Shave with the grain ( in the direction the hair grows ) on your face. Shaving against the grain of hair growth can cause redness , rashes , razor burn , cuts and ingrown hairs.Using a razor with a pivoting head allows you to shave better and smoother over and around bony places , curves , bumps and other angles of the face &amp;body. Rinse your shaving brush thoroughly in warm water , squeeze the head of the brush gently and then flick it a few times to get rid of excess water. Keep rinsing your razor blade in hot water whilst shaving. Rinse after each stroke. Use slow , short strokes during your shave.

I replace the cartridge on my razor every 4 6 weeks. I don ' t know if that is normal or average , but it works for me ! Obviously the more you shave , the sooner the blades will become dull. With the Embrace having 5 blades though , it seems to not get dull quite as quickly . </shave.v.3548><shave.v.3549>Moisturiser should be applied as soon as possible after shaving or washing ( certainly within 10 minutes ) . Do use a moisturiser with a sun protection factor ( SPF - like suncream ) . A gentle scrubbing massage will help open pores , prime follicles and raise stubs for a closer shave. Exfoliating your skin before shaving can also help attain a closer , cleaner shave; it softens the hairs more , and removes dead skin cells. It also helps prevent ingrown hairs if you use it daily. Do not apply too much pressure on the shaving razor , because this will cause skin burns and irritations. Instead glide it gently across the face. Shaving involves sharp instruments being swung near vital organs , so it 's imperative that you perform the deed under suitable conditions . </shave.v.3549><shave.v.3550>That 's a great tip.

The shave is closer than my previous electric experience , and does not irritate my fairly sensitive skin. However , the razor definitely has trouble picking up long hairs and hairs that lie flat against the skin. I used to shave every other day and find myself having to hit areas multiple times if I do that now - but the flip side of that is that now I can shave daily and not suffer horrible skin irritation.

As with any other type of wet razor , shave first in the growth direction than against. Using the Futur does n't require you to apply any pressure as you cut , its weight is sufficient. The greatest thing about it is the sound it makes as you cut through the beard. You 'll know by the sound it makes that you 've had a damned good shave. Using a dual-edge safety razor for the first time , my only initial criticism was that the shave does n't last as long as with the likes of a Mach3 or Quattro.

So another thing is that , it is a foam , so you won &amp;apos; t have , you won &amp;apos; t spray it all over the face when you place it. Here &amp;apos; s a sample. -- See , pretty neat. So unlike other shavers , so -- what &amp;apos; s the good thing is -- another good thing about this is that , it &amp;apos; s like mint. So when you apply it -- it &amp;apos; s a bit cold -- so works best with warm water. So , when you shave , it allows the shaver -- the razor to get to the roots of the hair while shaving.

It takes two minutes for human hair to absorb water and become soft enough to slice through cleanly and easily , so showering before you shave , not after , will do wonders for your legs . </shave.v.3588><shave.v.3589>Gold coin donation for BBQ breakfast , 2 local hairdressers on site to do shaving and colouring.

So it does n't affect the root in any way to impact the structure of the hair. The reason hair seems thicker a few days after you have shaved is because you cut the hair at the thicker part of the stem. The end is always a bit thinner. If you let it go , it will go right back to the way it was . </shave.v.3591><shave.v.3592>I ' ve considered laser hair removal. I ' ve also considered laser eyesight correction. In the end , I decided not to do either , for the same reason I didn ' t get that dragon tattoo I wanted. I don ' t want to make permanent changes to my body.

So for now , I shave my legs . </shave.v.3592><shave.v.3593>Even funnier -- since then I have switched from Taylor 's to Nancy Boy , which is BAR NONE the best shave cream I have run across. But in the interim I have moved to Oxford , England and it 's back to Taylor 's , especially since I have now actually walked down Old Bond Street ! Although honestly the fun of it aside , I miss the Nancy Boy cream; it 's a fantastic product ( both the original scent and the cucumber ) .

For those who have long whiskers , I would suggest a shaver whose shaving surface consists of slots rather than a shaving surface with holes. Any Philishave or Norelco shaver would be a good choice and the higher end models give a better shave with more comfort. Of course your father should allow about a month for his face to become fully accustomed to the new shaving method. While foil shavers are not recommended , there are foil/slotted head hybrid shavers available from Braun , including the InterFace and the new Syncro models which work with both short and long whiskers.

As ridiculous as it sounds , the ensuing rush on razors , brushes , and creams created a worldwide shortage of shaving goods -- vendors reported doing a year 's worth of business in a few days. Overnight , funky vintage razors caked with hobo whiskers and soap scum that used to go for a few bucks on eBay suddenly began climbing to well over $ 100. Up had become down , cats began dancing with dogs , and the handful of online devotees who 'd been beating a lonely paradiddle for traditional wetshaving all these years , beseeching the masses to throw down their Mach3 's and pressurized cans of goo , nonetheless began loudly grumbling that the "  $ yuppies " were now storming the gates.

A variety of elements , from your skin type to where you live , and from the lotions and creams you use to the quality of your razor and stroke technique contribute to the shave you get. And if you ' re among the 30 of men who prefer an electric shave , then you ' ve got a few more factors to consider , such as foil versus rotary and dry versus wet electric shavers. Whatever your preference , you can trust AM to keep you up to date on the latest advances in shaving . </shave.v.3604><shave.v.3605>4. Apply a good quality shaving cream because this will soften the hairs and let the razor glide through better. DO NOT shave without any sort of shaving cream or gel. I am not familar with the cream you are using but there are a number of shaving creams designed for sensitive skin that work well. I now use the Gillette shaving cream for sensitive skin ( I think it has aloe vera ) and find this to be very good . </shave.v.3605><shave.v.3606>Shaving my head ( the result of numerous threats toward my gray and thinning recalcitrant head fringe , which did no good ) turned out to be harder than I had thought. Gillette two-blade disposables work fine , and even in the shower where you ca n't see -- ( can you see even OUT of the shower ? ) -- it works pretty well because you can shave with one hand and feel your progress with the other. You still have to check in a mirror when you get out , though. I sometimes get a headaache when a cool breeze blows over me right after a shave , but it 's worth it. A Norelco works well on a flat surface , but it only makes contact at one very small point at one time ( No jokes , please. ) The only drawback is when I shave there is always a zit forming somewhere and is naked for all the world to see. I did think of renting out the back of my head ( where I ca n't see ) and tattooing Coca-Cola or MasterCard or something. It would call attention away from my zits and even provide me with a small income.

I should do something about that ... ) . Anyway , the pain associated with the laser is NOTHING compared to waxing. Plus , the hair is gone for 6-8 weeks between sessions ( and after 5 or 6 sessions , it 's permanent ) ! I 'm seriously considering lasering my legs once I can save enough . </shave.v.3615><shave.v.3616>Honestly , waxing just sounds REALLY painful , and just not worth it. I shave my armpits and legs , but not extremely often. I do it mostly because I swim. I just trim my pubes so they don ' t poke out of my swimsuit ! </shave.v.3616><shave.v.3617>Conditioner , like lotion , is a moisturizer and lasts far longer than shaving cream as there is more in the bottle and it takes less to cover your skin. Really , don ' t gob on the conditioner , you only need a tiny bit. Usually I use lotion to shave , again a small amount. But dry shaving does work as well. You ' ll need a sharp razor and a lighter touch. I ' m sure you just pressed down to hard , and that ' s what caused the redness. As for the bikini area , I find a razor works fine. But you can ' t shave there every day , at least I can ' t. I wait at least a week between shaves or yes , the irritation will be VERY BAD. But I find most chemical depilatories burn my skin and I do not have the money for a professional wax ( nor do I have the patience for the mess home waxing causes , so there ya go . </shave.v.3617><shave.v.3618>Tonight , I shaved off my beard , my " scruff " if you will , for the New York Mets.

Sometimes you just have to shave every day , but frequently you don't. Especially if you get a really close shave on the days you do shave. Skipping a day or two gives your skin a chance to recover from shaving , and reduces overall irritation. It also gives the razor something a little more substantial to work with on the days that you do shave , which helps it do its job. If you really need to shave every day , try just using an electric razor on the " off " days , to touch up. The electric razor is almost like not shaving , so it gives your skin a break without being too scruffy . </shave.v.3619><shave.v.3620>PLEASE NOTE : Only account holders are allowed to rate and review products -please log in and revisit this page to add your review.

They were a tall , wiry black man with a shaved head and a slight red-headed woman with a very pale face. Both wore business suits and looked very serious . </shave.v.3623><shave.v.3624>My basic conclusion was that shaving with a blade ( such as a Gillette Fusion or Schick Quattro ) is leagues better than shaving with an electric.

This introduction of the sharpened end of a hair follicle into another causes an inflammatory response in the skin and leads to a pimple or bump because of the inflammation of the skin . </shave.v.3628><shave.v.3629>Era Its a personal preference .i dont shave my legs becuz i like the hair on my legs .i did shave it once and i didnt like it .definately not a black thing , i know plenty black women that shave </shave.v.3629><shave.v.3630>I have a friend who is a hairstylist , he uses a Braun shaver. its a little pricey , but this one time cost is defrayed by the baby smooth shave you get in record time , on the run and with ZERO cuts , nicks , or creams. just throw lotion on it afterwards and off you go.

You ' re still swiping a blade-onna-stick across your skin , but beyond that it ' s a whole different trip how much pressure you apply , how much more attention you need to pay to your hand/razor/skin relationship to keep the blade angle right , the audio feedback from the cutting of the whiskers.
