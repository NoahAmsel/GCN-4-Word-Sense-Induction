<sniff.v.train><sniff.v.1>The dog that likes to explore outdoors will frequently present its owner with a very cold , very wet nose. Dogs can pick up moisture from the ground or grasses , and if the weather is cool , their noses are liable to be even cooler. While it may not be the best thing in the world to be sniffed over by a dog who ' s just spent some time exploring the outdoors , and while the reasons may be something of mystery , cold , wet noses tend to serve dogs well and be just one of the features expected in these animals . </sniff.v.1><sniff.v.2>SOLVENTS are sniffed i.e. glue , gas refills and lighters , some aerosols , some air fresheners , some paint , thinners and correcting fluid. They cause intoxication and occasionally hallucinations. There is a risk of sudden death and long-term use may cause kidney , liver and bone marrow problems . </sniff.v.2><sniff.v.3>Somewhere behind the dense , dark-grey wall of clouds the winter sun had risen. The thick blanket of freshly fallen , pristine snow covered what had once been fields , meadows and well-tended orchards before reverting to woodland a long time ago. Through the naked forest trees , the irregular silhouettes of the ruins of the city could be seen in the distance , now mercifully covered by the same white blanket that ran uninterrupted as far as the eye could see. The grotesquely shaped outlines of the former houses , shops and factories were clearly visible. The two gnomes hiding in the woodland sniffed the air and inhaled the pure , clean odour of deep winter. A very different winter for sure because the rumour had finally been confirmed ! A few centuries ago things had gone awry for men. The climate had cooled at an unprecedented speed and suddenly mankind , the master of the world , was in dire straits. They could not adapt to the new conditions and rapidly dwindled in numbers. Remnants of their species survived for a while , forever desperately seeking food. But now they were no more and peace had returned to Earth. There was only one thing left to do . </sniff.v.3><sniff.v.4>Feb. 4 - A stolen car with three male occupants tore through the R.I.D.E. lanes set up by Hamilton Police just before midnight. Officers pursued the vehicle that made an abrupt left turn onto Locke Street and struck a garbage bin. The suspects fled in different directions on foot. A police K-9 unit sniffed out a man who emerged moments later from a backyard with a stolen bicycle. The 19-year-old is charged with prowl by night , theft under $ 5 , 000 , two counts of possession under $ 5 , 000 and a breach of recognizance . </sniff.v.4><sniff.v.5>In May 1979 , plaintiff Diane Doe , a student at Highland Junior High School in Highland , Indiana , and four other students1 filed a civil rights complaint under 28 U.S.C.  1343 ( 3 ) and 1343 ( 4 ) . The defendants were Omer Renfrow , Superintendent of the Highland , Indiana , Town School District; George Kurteff , Principal of the Highland Junior High School; five members of the Highland Town School District Court; Al Prendergast , Highland Police Chief; and Patricia Little , a trainer of drug-detecting canines.2 Plaintiff requested a class certification of other students at Highland High School and Highland Junior High School. The gravamen of the complaint was that plaintiff and others were illegally sniffed by police dogs during school hours and pocket-searched if a dog alerted to them in order to determine whether they possessed controlled substances and contraband. As part of the drug investigation , plaintiff alleged that she and three other students " were compelled to remove their clothing and submit to visual inspection by defendants ' agents " ( Par. 17 of complaint ) . </sniff.v.5><sniff.v.6>This is the most common illegal stimulant.

This meant the next step was to walk into the agility field. Now they could sniff at Winston through the fence but again there was no aggression. There was only lots of wagging of tails and Winston barking wanting to play . </sniff.v.7><sniff.v.8>The Cancer diagnosis ability of dogs first appeared to be studied in 1989 , and in early 2000 to 2001. It was then explored that dogs could detect bladder cancers , and melanomas as well , as lung and breast cancers. In the article in Saga Journals entitled " Diagnostic Accuracy of Canine Scent Detection in Early and Late Stage Lung and Breast Cancers the study was conducted by The Pine Street Foundation , in San Anselmo , California. The group comprised of; Michael McCulloch , Tadeusz Jerzierski , Michael Broffman , and others did an Integrative Cancer Therapy study involving 83 patients , of which 55 were lung cancer , and 32 breast cancer patients. The report in Saga Journals involved 5 dogs , 3 Lab Retrievers and 2 Portuguese Water dogs employed a reward based training method , where the dog ' s sniffed and identified samples by sitting in front of the cancerous samples. The results ? </sniff.v.8><sniff.v.9>When Ivan sits down on the job , he 's not being lazy.

My husband and I are walking him consistently and hopefully he will go soon. This morning we walked him for 1 hour and i think he sniffed every dog pee , plants , trees and water hydrant in Parkslope but still nothing happen. Its been 24 hours since he pee and poop ( at his foster home ) , very unusual for a dog but I guess he 's never used of getting this kind of freedom . </sniff.v.10><sniff.v.11>Eyewitness News ' source says special cadaver dogs would have to be brought in to sniff any concrete.

It makes people feel high'. These substances can make people do things that they would n't normally have the courage to do , and they may hallucinate ( see things that are n't there ) . Solvents can make you feel sick or sleepy , and it is possible to suffocate if a bag is put over your head. The heart can stop and this can lead to death , even when tried for the first time . </sniff.v.12><sniff.v.13>The cold clutches of a hundred VH1 propagandists came for me one Friday night , as my friends and I gathered around a bar rail and drank off the approaching bar time. The button-up middle aged prick to our right was having trouble keeping his head from exploding , due to my usual disdain for the Beatles circle-jerk. In typical hipster fashion , he reacted as though I had just punched his mom in the face , though I only called Lennon an overrated prick and McCartney a dopey slinger of trite. After the freakout he sniffed that I needed to expand my musical horizons. Ever notice that this statement usually means fawning over whatever safe/edgy acts populate the current Rolling Stone best-ever list ? That ' s not expansive; it ' s not even musical . </sniff.v.13><sniff.v.14>It was more than impressive to watch the dog and handler team approach each different scene. There is far more to finding human remains than just turning a trained dog loose in a field. The handler is an active member of the search team and is responsible for directing the intense focus of the dog. More than once a handler called the dog over to a recently disturbed hole and asked , What ' s this ? The dog would dutifully sniff the disturbed dirt and alert the trainer if this hole contained human remains or was another hole dug to test the dog and trainer . </sniff.v.14><sniff.v.15>But another drug dog , Zuul , who belongs to the Sarasota County Sheriff 's Office , fared better in court recently. Even though , like Talon , Zuul " hit " on almost every car he sniffed even though no drugs were found in half of them , Sarasota County Circuit Court Judge Charles Roberts ruled that his nose was reliable enough to justify searching vehicles. Roberts bought prosecutors ' and deputies ' arguments that in every case where Zuul " alerted , " either drugs were found or people in the vehicle admitted to using or possessing drugs in the recent past. That ruling has set up an appeal that could be headed for the Florida Supreme Court . </sniff.v.15><sniff.v.16>I 'm a major sniffer !

Inhaling the fumes can lead to euphoria , loss of muscle control , slurred speech , impaired judgment , and unconsciousness , and sometimes to asphyxiation because the plastic bag has cut off the oxygen supply . </sniff.v.17><sniff.v.18>i can clearly see how this could work ... . my nose is so stuffy and runny all at the same time i cant sniff anything through left side ... . but on the right it cleared up a bit , not prefect but enough for me not to want to stuff tissue in there so i can fall asleep which is all i truly wanted in the first place ... so thank you for that ! and about the whole sniffing sharpie thing ... .. while using a sharpie on a project you would end up sniffing more that way the just a couple sniffs to the nose ... . and if they were that truly bad for you they would have banned the markers people ... .yeah sure u may get light headed if you stand there and sniff it for for like 5 minutes but no one ever said to do that ... . </sniff.v.18><sniff.v.19>Early Wednesday morning , a cadaver dog team sniffed through the dirt and weeds of the 100-acre lot in search of more bones.

But the expression held no antagonism or hostility. The eyes were sharp and black , but friendly enough . </sniff.v.22><sniff.v.23>Bloodhounds were once the only breed whose evidence was allowed in court. The first bloodhound to testify was named Rye. Rye smelled a pillowcase that a murderer used to strangle his victims. Then the dog was brought to a group of suspects. He sniffed one man , sat before him , and barked. That man was the murderer. Now other breeds besides bloodhounds can testify in court , too . </sniff.v.23><sniff.v.24>Pickel designed a special , low-to-the-ground examining table , and taped dozens of bandages to Edwards body. Under one of the bandages was a live melanoma sample. Over more than a year , George repeatedly sniffed the bandages on Edwards body until he could detect the bandage with melanoma 99.7 of the time. Eventually , Pickel and Dr. Cognetta tested Georges ability on seven skin cancer patients. Over a 10-month period , George was able to correctly identify melanoma on six of the seven patients . </sniff.v.24><sniff.v.25>Note : This might also indicate positive when provided with wiki text ( which uses square brackets for links ) , but wiki text stored within Ceryle is expected to have the wiki declaration.

Typically , a heroin abuser may inject up to four times a day. Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while intramuscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes. Although smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a " rush " as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection , NIDA researchers have confirmed that all three forms of heroin administration are addictive . </sniff.v.26><sniff.v.27>The dog sniffed at all the samples.

Dexter began chomping on his bone but Kelly just sniffed at hers and walked away. In hindsight I should have picked Kelly 's up at this point . </sniff.v.36><sniff.v.37>How does it work ? When your dog is suffering from a sneezing attack , first let your dog sniff the oil. After your dog has sniffed the oil and indicated that they would like it ( by not turning away ) , apply 1-2 drops on their forehead between the eyes and gently rub the oil in with an upward motion. According to the Traditional Chinese Medicine , this is an acupuncture point called the Ying Tang point. It helps to relieve anxiety. This area is also where the sinuses are located. You may also rub 1 drop on each paw ( only if they indicate they really like the oil ) . </sniff.v.37><sniff.v.38>However , there are some specialties where an aggressive alert would be bad news. If a dog searching for a bomb digs and scratches at it when he finds it , the results could be disastrous. In these cases , a passive alert is used. A good example of passive-alert dogs are the beagles used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to sniff out produce that is n't allowed to enter the country. The Beagle Brigade , as they 're affectionately called , sniffs people 's luggage while they wait in customs lines at airports and border crossings. Because no one wants a dog digging at their belongings , the USDA beagles have been trained to simply sit down when they smell fruits or vegetables . </sniff.v.38><sniff.v.39>Nativism took a variety of forms. Middle-class and elitist gentlemen , who sniffed that socially inferior immigrants lacked the intelligence and experience to be good republican citizens , occasionally gathered in exclusive nativist fraternities such as the Order of United Americans or the United Sons of America. But when immigration coincided with hard times , as it did in the late 1830s and early 1840s and especially in the mid-1850s , and/or with periods of political discontent , then the charges advanced against immigrants multiplied and nativist groups formed independent political parties. In certain cities like Baltimore , New York , and Philadelphia , for example , anti-immigrant American Republican and Native American parties appeared in the 1830s and 1840s. They attracted working class and middle class voters angered by the job competition from immigrants , the increase in crime , public drunkenness , and pauperism that accompanied immigration , the supposed pollution of the body politic by ignorant immigrant voters , and an assertiveness by Catholic clergymen that supposedly threatened the nation 's Protestant values and institutions . </sniff.v.39><sniff.v.40>He looked at the color of the offensive liquid , sniffed its odor , and tasted a bit of it.

As volatile substances and cannabis show different patterns of use with age , in order to look at relationships between uses of these different types of drugs and smoking and drinking , it is necessary to analyse an age group where prevalence of sniffing volatile substances and taking cannabis are similar. Among 13 year olds , 9 had sniffed volatile substances in the last year and 10 had taken cannabis in the last year. Therefore analysis of the relationships between smoking , drinking and these types of drugs was restricted to this age group . </sniff.v.46><sniff.v.47>No , you ' ve got it all backwards it is GOVERNMENT that wants to entagle itself in our religion.

To put it bluntly , it is damned fine novel. At least the first half. The second devolves into the kind of novel I 'd imagine an author like Stephen King would write. But that first half is unputdownable. It is the novel for the prickliest of aesthetic sensibilities; not just a shock of his authorial competence ( I believe this is his 8 , 000th novel , so he 's at least decent pushing the pages through the meat grinder ) , but actual greatness. In the critical yawp to come at the novel 's reception , the one buzzword will be " ambitious. " As in , " Stephen King has never been more ambitious. " But this will be the wrong word; in this case , essentially a reductive , pejorative term ( ambitious like the boy with hooks for hands , who year after year attends the annual football try-outs for quarterback ) . No , King is n't ambitious. King is awesome. In that first half . </sniff.v.49><sniff.v.50>Blackhawk will go down in WPD ' s history as the first dog to get a warrant on the basis of his nose. The story goes that there was a complaint of someone selling narcotics out of the trunk of a car. The car was found , but there was no one around it. Blackhawk sniffed the car for narcotics and indicated there was something in the trunk by jumping on the trunk and putting his paws on it. The car was towed , but could not be searched because there was no warrant. Upon the receipt of a warrant , the trunk was opened and 6 pounds of marijuana was found inside along with money and a list of names. This made Officer Ferrazzani the first in Waltham to get a search warrant on the basis of a dog indicating there were narcotics . </sniff.v.50><sniff.v.51>District officials were on hand at Chaparral and Desert Mountain high schools as Scottsdale police planted drugs in a locker.

On a particular day in 1888 , a Union Pacific train left the station in Denver at noon bound for San Francisco. But before departing , the switch-yard workers coupled to it the private car of one J.

The company says it feels bad about this , but so far it 's refused to follow the lead of other manufacturers and add a foul- smelling substance that may prevent abuse. Instead , Fuller has taken a series of highly publicized steps -- adding labels , supporting social programs , even pulling out of some markets after it started catching national media attention. Today , after collecting a slew of awards and glowing editorials for the way it handled the problem , the company continues to sell its glue in the countries where kids sniff it.

A 1986 study of 20 chronic abusers of toluene-containing spray paints found that after one month of abstinence from sniffing the paint , 65 percent of the abusers had damage to the nervous system. Such damage can lead to impaired perception , reasoning , and memory , as well as defective muscular coordination and , eventually , dementia . </sniff.v.60><sniff.v.61>In creatures from insects to monkeys , pheromones trigger a variety of hormonal changes and instinctive behaviors , such as mating and aggression. Catherine Dulac , an assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard , tries to pin down how pheromones are detected and how the brain translates their signals into behavioral changes. She collaborates with Emily Liman , an instructor in neurobiology , and David Corey , a professor of neurobiology , at Harvard Medical School. Last week , the trio reported that they have isolated a gene in rats and mice that appears to play a major role in the detection of pheromones. The gene is also present in humans , but it contains mutations that apparently make it useless for sniffing out pheromones . </sniff.v.61><sniff.v.62>Priests and people treated the whole ritual with contempt.

" By way of example , DiManno notes a " totally tangential tirade " during which Wills accused police of lying about a stench coming from his basement.

Glenn Beck and the Project 912 groups represent people reacting to the agenda of economic destruction.

Though silent on major threats to the constitutional republic , even some Republicans have sniffed the political advantages to be gained from speaking for Americans who are concerned and outraged by Obama 's abject rhetoric of apology and his perilous policies of appeasement. Sadly , however , though the Obama 's faction 's agenda threatens our entire way of life as a free people , nothing has emerged that brings the different currents of reaction against it together into a powerful and united force that reasserts the sovereignty of the American people. This failure of unity will allow the Obama faction to deflect , assuage or nullify each opposition element in detail , while it moves inexorably forward with the grand strategy that topples the constitutional republic . </sniff.v.68><sniff.v.69>Overseeing online can deliver it sells.

These substances are found in common household products like glues , lighter fluid , cleaning fluids , and paint products. Inhalant abuse is the deliberate inhaling or sniffing of these substances to get high , and it is estimated that about 1 , 000 substances are misused in this manner. The easy accessibility , low cost , legal status , and ease of transport and concealment make inhalants one of the first substances abused by children. Survey data indicates that about 15 to 20 percent of junior and senior high school students have tried inhalants with about 2 to 6 percent reporting current use. The highest incidence of use is among 10 to 12 year old children with rates of use declining with age. Parents worry about alcohol , tobacco , and drug use but may be unaware of the hazards associated with products found throughout their homes. Knowing what these products are , how they might be harmful , and recognizing the signs and symptoms of their use as inhalants , can help a parent prevent inhalant abuse . </sniff.v.107><sniff.v.108>Snooks , you may not be talented in many things , but you definitely have sniffing potential.

Cocaine 's immediate physical effects include raised breathing rate , raised blood pressure and body temperature , and dilated pupils. By causing the coronary arteries to constrict , blood pressure rises and the blood supply to the heart diminishes. This can cause heart attacks or convulsions within an hour after use. Chronic users and those with hypertension , epilepsy , and cardiovascular disease are at particular risk. Studies show that even those with no previous heart problems risk cardiac complications from cocaine. Increased use may sensitize the brain to the drug 's effects so that less of the substance is needed to induce a seizure. Those who inject the drug are at high risk for AIDS and hepatitis when they share needles. Allergic reactions to cocaine or other substances mixed in with the drug may also occur . </sniff.v.115><sniff.v.116>News In a demonstration aired on Watchdog on Thursday , security vendor Garlik sniffed wireless traffic at hotspots run by BT Openzone , The Cloud , and T-Mobile.

This is not because of shyness , but because they prefer to be approached on their own terms. This is what people mean when they say that the Anatolian seems to expect a formal introduction. They dislike strangers who are too forward. When greeting a new Anatolian , one may stroke the dog 's chin after the dog has initially sniffed the hand . </sniff.v.145><sniff.v.146>The Caballes case foreshadows more police-state possibilities : Uniformed law enforcement marching through neighborhoods with German shepherds on leashes sniffing anything and everything -every car parked on or near the street , the air emanating from homes , neighbors walking outside.

When sniffed , the substance first has to penetrate a relatively thick mucous membrane in the nose , travel in the blood to the heart , and then return from the heart to the lungs before it can be transported to the brain , resulting in a considerable dilution. When smoked , cocaine rapidly penetrates the extremely thin lung tissue , which is constructed to allow gases to pass through , and then proceeds via the heart straight to the brain. The result is a much more rapid rise in the concentration of cocaine than when it is sniffed. The intensification of the resulting effect seems to be almost of a different kind from the effect of sniffing cocaine , though in fact the difference is only one of degree . </sniff.v.182><sniff.v.183>Benno sniffed out two bricks of heroin about 2-1/2 pounds , with a street value of about $ 300 , 000 that were in a duffel bag being sent from Mexico and headed to Memphis.

The pre-light draw was a little stiff , with earthy and woody notes . </sniff.v.221><sniff.v.222>London , Aug 23 ( ANI ) : Drug shamed Kerry Katona indulged herself in more cocaine after learning that her shocking snorting video was made public , it has emerged.t is reported that Katona was sniffing up more cocaine and repeating : " I 've lost everything. I 'm going to lose my kids - the lot ! " </sniff.v.222><sniff.v.223>When injected , amphetamines take effect immediately. Swallowing or sniffing powdered amphetamines leads to onset of effects after 10-40mins. Prescription amphetamines may take effect after various lengths of time as some are designed as short-acting and some as time-release medicines. The effect of a single dose of amphetamines generally lasts about 3-6hrs , although that of pharmaceutical time-release capsules last for longer . </sniff.v.223><sniff.v.224>A Dead Mouse in the Wall Once again , I sniff like a blood hound until I find the right spot , then get it perfect with my very first cut into the wall. Small animal , but BIG smell ! To get rid of a dead rat or mouse in the wall , you 've got to have a real nose for the job , literally ( there is no magic odor finding machine ) , and experience certainly counts for a lot . </sniff.v.224><sniff.v.225>Cocaine causes a sudden increase in heart rate , blood pressure and breathing. It produces feelings of well being and confidence , alertness and mental exhilaration. When cocaine is sniffed , the effects come on gradually and peak after 15-30 minutes. When injected , the effects are felt almost immediately and much more intensely. When crack is smoked the effects are felt immediately but wear off very quickly . </sniff.v.225><sniff.v.226>So the girl 's family packed up little black dog and made the 40-minute trip to Lollypop Farm. Little white dog immediately snuggled in the arms of the family ... then little black dog and little white dog sniffed -- and chased -- and sniffed some more. It seemed like a match made in heaven. Little white dog lay on Animal Whisperer 's lap all the way to his new home . </sniff.v.226><sniff.v.227>With the shift in heroin abuse patterns comes an even more diverse group of users. Users over the age of 30 continue to be one of the largest user groups in most national data. However , several sources indicate an increase in new , young users across the country who are being lured by inexpensive , high-purity heroin that can be sniffed or smoked instead of injected. Heroin has also been appearing in more affluent communities . </sniff.v.227><sniff.v.228>The major routes of administration of cocaine are sniffing or snorting , injecting , and smoking ( including free-base and crack cocaine ) . Snorting is the process of inhaling cocaine powder through the nose where it is absorbed into the bloodstream through the nasal tissues. Injecting is the act of using a needle to release the drug directly into the bloodstream. Smoking involves inhaling cocaine vapor or smoke into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream is as rapid as by injection . </sniff.v.228><sniff.v.229>The latter , a major nickel and copper producer , responded to Teck Cominco 's unsolicited offer with undisguised disdain.

" </sniff.v.233><sniff.v.234>Hess wants his droll ditty about an oddball to be some eccentric farce with an attached feel-good sentiment. Whereas geeky Napoleon Dynamite had a cheeky spirit in the manner that he sniffed out self-recognition , Nacho Libre is a bouncy beanbag with no sympathetic foundation or sense of constructive playful alienation. Black is the targeted performer that could have instilled the championed nuttiness required to make this comedy gel with saucy jocularity. But the star 's stained offering of funny does n't translate well in a romp that feels disjointed and hollow. At least Hess and his production crew were generous enough to give an authentic south-of-the-border feel to the whole movie by shooting on location in Mexico . </sniff.v.234><sniff.v.235>Hyperkinetic means " excessive movement " and Nicker was a classic example of a dog that just did n't seem to be able to control his physical activity. Also , he did n't seem able to pay attention to any single thing for more than a few seconds after he had investigated it. As a result , after he sniffed me he was off to inspect the base of our Black Walnut tree , which probably reeked of urine from a few hundred other dogs . </sniff.v.235><sniff.v.236>A far different holding might ensue with body sniffs or sniffing the exterior of houses. Having a dog stick their nose on a person is a far greater intrusion , and houses receive more protection than cars . </sniff.v.236><sniff.v.237>There , looking calmly at me , with one beady green eye , was what could only be the Loch Ness monster : Nessie. She , of course she 's a she ! She licked her lips and sharp teeth with a dark tongue , then sniffed my bag and clothes. Nice , warm fishy breath . </sniff.v.237><sniff.v.238>Lastly , buy an anti-flea collar. Anti-flea powder can be harmful to your dog 's health especially when it is sniffed or licked. A collars is just as effective and very safe too since your dog can not reach or lick it . </sniff.v.238><sniff.v.239>At some point , it must be mentioned that Raynie 's dog Spot sniffed Dvara 's butt and a parrot flew out of the Teir'Dal Guardian 's arse. Eyez do n't think any of us are surprised . </sniff.v.239><sniff.v.240>Dogs chew out of necessity , boredom , anxiety or enjoyment. Puppies especially have a strong urge to chew. Not only do they chew to relieve the irritation adn inflammation of teething but also , pups characteristically investigate the environment with jaws and paws. Everything is pawed , sniffed , licked or chewed to see whether it is sentient or inanimate , whether it is tasty or yucky and whether it is indestructible or fun to destroy. Moreover , regular chewing is essential for maintaining the health of the dog 's teeth , jaws and gums. Thus , chewing is a perfectly normal , natural and necessary canine behavior . </sniff.v.240><sniff.v.241>An electronic nose which can sniff out a range of diseases and check the quality of food has been put to use in a central Russian city , following its success in the U.S. and Europe . </sniff.v.241><sniff.v.242>The Love Police : Not to be Sniffed at Song at start is " Actually it &amp; 039; s Darkness " by Idlewild.

" The dog 's eyes were big and intense and focused as she gazed up at this silly object. She quivered in hopes that I might let her see and sniff this wondrous thing up close. And then I asked her to heel. It was gorgeous , connected , alert , precise heeling that showed how much time her handler had dedicated to teaching her dog well , and how thoroughly the dog understood the exercise. Her reward , of course , was a chance to look at , sniff , and watch me stretch the scrunchy. And then we worked some more. The dog turned in a performance that would earn high scores in any ring. I had fun , she had fun , and then it was time to slip the scrunchy back on my hair , and return the dog to her dumbfounded handler . </sniff.v.248><sniff.v.249>Cocaine Addiction Cocaine is a powerfully addictive drug that is snorted , sniffed , injected or smoked and directly affects the brain. It is also called by the street names coke , snow , flake , blow and others. Cocaine usually makes the user feel euphoric and energetic. Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that interferes with the reabsorption process of dopamine , a chemical messenger associated with pleasure and movement . </sniff.v.249><sniff.v.250>The old man , half blind with shock , looked to the right.

You 're cool " . </sniff.v.253><sniff.v.254>Jefferson claimed that the delay in delivery of the package violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The court held that his privacy rights were not violated , because the clerk examined only the outside of the package and the dog sniffed only the air around it. The inspection of the package was conducted under a search warrant. However , the Fourth Amendment claim also implicated his possession rights. A person has a right to timely delivery of mail addressed to him or her. Because Jefferson ' s package was an Express Mail package , he argued that he had a right to speedy , uninterrupted delivery. In this case , the postal inspector developed probable cause to search the package before the contractual deadline for delivery. Therefore , the court held that there was no improper seizure of the package under Fourth Amendment doctrines. By the time ' the constitutional chemistry was altered ' at 3 : 00 p.m. on April 7 , law enforcement had already established probable cause to seize Jefferson 's package. Thus , law enforcement acted well within the bounds of the Fourth Amendment in detaining , seizing and then searching Jefferson 's package. United States v.

During the 1960s , as part of the more general increase in the use of illegal drugs among more " mainstream " Americans , the use of cocaine probably increased as well , although in 1972 , still less than 3 of the population ( aged twelve and over ) said they had tried it ( Johnson and Muffler , 1992 ) . </sniff.v.257><sniff.v.258>The most recent acts took place in Greenbrier County.

( Even today , in France , the phrase semer le basilic , " to sow basil " , means " to rant and rave. " ) The Romans also thought that the bruised leaves of the plant bred scorpions ( perhaps because scorpions liked to hide under the pots ) . That idea hung around at least until the 1700s , when a French botanist wrote quite seriously about a " certain Gentleman of Sienna " who enjoyed the scent of basil and sniffed it so often that he went mad; when he died and was autopsied , " there was found a Nest of Scorpions in his Brain.

He looked up at Brendon and wagged his tail . </sniff.v.261><sniff.v.262>Today , essentially all cocaine enters the U.S. in the form of hydrochloride powder. This powder is extracted in a process that begins by mixing pulverized coca leaves with a solvent ( such as ether or gasoline ) and partially drying it. Then , to make the product water-soluble , this " coca paste " is treated with hydrochloric acid and dried to a white powder. In this form , cocaine can be sniffed , swallowed , or dissolved in water for injection , but it can not be smoked because igniting it degrades the cocaine before it will volatilize. However , through a series of fairly simple chemical procedures , cocaine can be turned into " freebase " a product that resembles the smokeable coca paste. To produce freebase , cocaine hydrochloride is mixed in water with a liquid base ( such as ammonia , baking soda , or sodium hydroxide ) to remove the hydrochloric acid. The resulting alkaloidal cocaine is then dissolved in a solvent ( such as ether ) and gently heated , causing most of the liquid to evaporate. [ 4 ] The product created , when placed in a glass pipe and ignited , produces vapors of relatively pure cocaine . </sniff.v.262><sniff.v.263>From what has just been said , it is clear that when speaking of cocaine one must distinguish two more or less distinctive drugs , depending on the method of use. Sniffing appears to often take place in a socially integrated setting , without too much personal or social inconvenience. Basing is a more risky method of use. It often ( quickly ) leads to compulsive use and the problems associated with this. The chance of a user becoming addicted by using this method is quite high. Nor is sniffing wholly without danger. A number of users whose sole method of taking cocaine is sniffing have developed a compulsive pattern of use . </sniff.v.263><sniff.v.264>Most of those who try sniffing only try it once or , at the most , a few times. This kind of solvent sniffing is generally labelled 'experimental'. Some ( perhaps one in one hundred youngsters ) may use solvents over a longer period , perhaps for several months. Because these youngsters may use solvents regularly and often with a small group of others , they are often referred to as 'recreational ' users . </sniff.v.264><sniff.v.265>He pulled up alongside the Vulture , keeping the chain down at his side.

A textbook example of that was Clinton 's recent Martin Luther King , Jr. tiff with Obama. Clinton merely said that Lyndon Johnson gave final impetus to the push to get the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Bill through Congress. That straightforward and complimentary comment got twisted , mangled , and distorted to read that Clinton dissed Dr. King by minimizing his towering role in the civil rights movement. Clinton was talking solely about the Congressional fight for passage of the bill , not the civil rights movement. But it did n't matter. The Obama camp sniffed yet another chance at a Hillary bash ran with it. But they were n't finished. They picked up on a stray remark by BET founder Robert Johnson about Obama 's days as an organizer on Chicago 's South Side to imply that Obama did all kinds of nasty , insidious things in his younger days . </sniff.v.266><sniff.v.267>From the beginning , Keating also adopted a pugnacious strategy in his attempts to outfox , intimidate , and even seize control of the federal regulatory apparatus that sniffed big trouble in the way his Lincoln Savings &amp;Loan Association was lending depositors ' money for risky ventures.

Cocaine is the powdered form of the drug and crack is the smoke able form. Crack gets its name from the crackling sound it makes when it is burned in a glass pipe. Cocaine is a white fine textured powder , like flour or baby powder. It is usually sniffed up the nose , but it is sometimes diluted and injected into a vein. Crack is chemically processed into small , rock-like chunks that are white or light colored. Powder cocaine is often cut with other substances like strychnine ( rat poison ) , caffeine , cornstarch , or talcum powder. Some of the additives add to the drug 's toxicity . </sniff.v.271><sniff.v.272>The creature slowed as it approached , scurried down the trunk of a tree , and sniffed in Haiden ' s direction.

Because crack is more fat soluble that powdered cocaine , the fatty brain tissue more readily absorbs it , thus causing a more intense reaction. It is usually smoked or injected rather than sniffed , reaching the brain within seconds. The high lasts approximately 5 to 15 minutes. As a stimulant , crack sharply increases heart rate and blood pressure along with body temperature. The immediate effects include feelings of alertness and excitement along with increases talkativeness , and decreased appetite. The powerful crack high is quickly followed by an equally intense low characterized by depression , anxiety , and impaired concentration . </sniff.v.275><sniff.v.276>The search of Smith 's home near South Houston on Oct. 4 , 2000 , came after an 11-month law enforcement investigation into the gang.

Despite diligent search , the earliest references to glue-sniffing in either the medical or the popular literature that they were able to find dated from 1959. 1 A similarly thorough search in the course of preparing this Consumers Union Report has turned up no earlier mention of glue-sniffing. Other documented studies of glue-sniffing are similarly void of references earlier than 1959. Thus , while it is likely that children ( and adults as well ) sniffed glue on occasion before 1959 , the practice either went unobserved or , more probably , was not deemed worthy of recording . </sniff.v.280><sniff.v.281>Appearance &amp;Use : Cocaine is a fine white crystalline powder often diluted with sugar , cornstarch , calcium powder and other substances.

It was n't that this horse was a champion , but he was properly proportioned and everything seemed to work okay.

Ferrets also invite dogs to play by nipping at their feet. While the ferrets find it extremely amusing to have a dog respond quickly to such an invitation , the dog may not be too happy. Always look for signs of possible aggression or hostility on the part of the dog , and separate the dog and the ferret.

[ 14 ] When cocaine enters the bloodstream directly , via injection , it reaches the brain quickly , and users feel its effects within minutes. Inhalation also delivers cocaine quickly to the brain because air passages in the lungs are positioned close to capillary accesses to the bloodstream. [ 15 ] When cocaine is sniffed , the onset of effect is slower because the drug must pass through the nasal mucosa before entering the bloodstream.

If the child is nervous , you can have the child hold a biscuit in a flat hand to give to the dog , but never force the child to interact with your dog.

I did have to give one tiny correction to make sure Tux didn ' t sniff the driver once he got confident , but I was thrilled that Tux was finally able to overcome his fear. We loaded the bus and settled in. Tux had the typical adjustment / floor arrangement / size relationship difficulties , but that ' s just because he ' s huge and also wearing a large pack now.

However , the underlying pattern within age groups was quite different. The proportion of pupils who had ever sniffed volatile substances increased between the ages of 11 and 13 ( 10 to 18 respectively ) and then remained around this level for 14 and 15 year olds. In contrast , the age gradient for pupils who had ever tried cannabis was more marked 1 of 11 year olds had tried cannabis compared with 36 of 15 year olds. Between the age of 11 and 13 a greater proportion of pupils had tried sniffing volatile substances than had tried cannabis , but this pattern was reversed at age 14 , and at age 15 a much greater proportion of pupils had tried cannabis than had tried sniffing volatile substances ( 36 compared with 19 ) . </sniff.v.371><sniff.v.372>For example , many a woman enjoys the company of other women , especially during the mid-morning or luncheon hours.

Crack is cocaine that has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a free base for smoking. Cocaine usually makes the user feel euphoric and energetic by blocking the reuptake process in the brain. This causes a buildup of dopamine and creates the rush that addicts crave. Common health effects include heart attacks , respiratory failure , strokes , and seizures. Large amounts can cause bizarre and violent behavior. In rare cases , sudden death can occur on the first use of cocaine or unexpectedly thereafter . </sniff.v.394><sniff.v.395>Police approached a yellow 2010 Camaro , which was suspicious because it was parked and occupied in the MacNeal parking lot at 28th and East.

Cocaine is used in hospitals as a local anesthetic and as a vasoconstrictor. Cocaine is often converted into a more concentrated more deadly form known as " crack " . Cocaine causes a feeling of euphoria and is characterised by the initial rush that the user feels. High doses lead to bizzare or erratic behavior.

This means of using the drug seems not to have caught on , however. By the early 1900s the drug was generally obtained through patent medicines like Tucker 's Asthma Specific or Crown Catarrh Powder , through medicated 'soft ' drinks like Koca-Nola or Kola-Ade , or by outright purchase of cocaine hydrochloride , which could be injected or sniffed up the nose . </sniff.v.413><sniff.v.414>" You are getting married again , father ?

Snorting cocaine powder through the nose allows the drug to enter the bloodstream through the nasal tissues. The use of a needle releases the drug straight into the bloodstream , while smoking sends cocaine vapors into the bloodstream through the lungs. Injecting and smoking quickly intensifies the effects of cocaine because it makes contact with the bloodstream faster than other methods of use . </sniff.v.416><sniff.v.417>I love to sniff yarn.

See Royer , 460 U.S. at 497 , 103 S.Ct. at 1323 ( plurality opinion ) . However , the District Court found that Carrasquillo followed the agents onto the platform voluntarily , see 670 F.Supp. at 50 n. 2 , and we can find no evidence that this finding was clearly erroneous.3 </sniff.v.425><sniff.v.426>Often some of us would ride with the Haryana folks to different villages and help in distributing the aid.

It can also be injected intravenously , ingested orally , or even rubbed on the user 's gums. Powdered cocaine can also be smoked , as users occasionally sprinkle it on cigarettes or 'joints'. The drug can also be smoked as crack cocaine or 'freebase ' after the powder has been processed into a rock form. Because smoking a substance allows it to reach the brain more quickly than other methods , smoking crack or freebase creates an intense and immediate high ( in about 10 to 15 seconds ) , making the drug even more addictive . </sniff.v.436><sniff.v.437>On Monday morning , Jeff and I went to downtown DC while Rachel went to work.

The crystal form of cocaine is injected into the veins , or it is sniffed up the nose. Crystal , or powdered , cocaine is a common form , sometimes glamorized in movies as beautiful people snort lines of cocaine off a mirror. Freebase cocaine is often smoked as " crack. " It is made by heating the crystal form with ammonia , baking soda and water. It is much more fast-acting than powdered cocaine because it is inhaled directly , rather than waiting for the crystal form to dissolve in the fluids of the body . </sniff.v.442><sniff.v.443>The town swore in a different kind of police officer last month.

" First , the simulation showed that when a dog sniffs , each nostril pulls in a separate odor sample , " says Craven. Via its olfactory sensors , " the dog can tell which nostril is pulling in the scent , " so it knows which direction to go when tracking. Further , the researchers report today in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface , a dog 's nose has a unique nasal airflow pattern , which helps transport odor molecules quickly via a single airway to the olfactory recess. Here , the smell is retained in the maze of scent receptors even after the dog exhales; the odor is not expelled as it is with humans. It 's " very similar " to a rat 's airway , says Craven , who expects that this pattern will be found in any mammal with a keen sense of smell . </sniff.v.469><sniff.v.470>It is customary to be briefed by the captain on weather conditions , their meal preferences and flight time.

It is also useful to examine the relative locations of the stimuli on each of the two dimensions in Figure 1 , lest only one of them reflect qualitative similarity per se ( dimension 1 might , for instance , reflect hedonic value ) . In fact , the locations of the stimuli relative to one another on each of the component dimensions resemble their locations in the space as a whole. For example , sucrose lies further from NaCl than from sipped orange , sniffed orange and sniffed vanillin on both dimensions 1 and 2 , and further from NaCl than from sipped vanillin on dimension 1 ( and about as far on dimension 2 ) . Thus , the results of experiment 1 fulfilled our main goal , which was to identify instances in which pairs of stimuli comprising two tastants are perceived as qualitatively more dissimilar than pairs comprising a tastant and an odorant . </sniff.v.511><sniff.v.512>They sniffed around the hallways and did n't smell urine.

So says the State supreme court this week. The court ruled on a case in which a guy caught with cocaine in a car near Abbotsford three years ago claimed he was illegally searched because a drug dog sniffed him out. The court said no , in fact , a sniff is just a sniff and not a search.

Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of effects , as users can feel peak effects after 7 to 8 seconds.8 Intramuscular injection produces the euphoric high within 5 to 8 minutes , and when the drug is sniffed or smoked , effects are felt within 10 to 15 minutes. After taking heroin , the user reports feeling a surge of euphoria ( or a " rush " ) accompanied by a warm flushing of the skin , a dry mouth , and heavy extremities. Following this initial euphoria , the user goes " on the nod " for several hours a period of alternating between a wakeful and drowsy state. Mental functioning becomes clouded due to the depression of the central nervous system. Also , breathing may become slowed to the point of respiratory failure. 9 Other short-term effects can include dry mouth , nausea , vomiting , and severe itching . </sniff.v.525><sniff.v.526>Curiously , back on Earth , moondust has no smell.

Typically , a heroin abuser may inject up to four times a day. Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while intra-muscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes.

Some of these sexual perverts are encouraging the children to sniff glue with the intensions of having homosexual relations with them. " </sniff.v.536><sniff.v.537>The main way of taking heroin is injecting into the veins ( mainlining ); narcotic users can use more than a hundred veins and their knowledge about their positions are simply extraordinary. Sometimes heroin is taken together with cocaine ( this cocktail is called speedball ) or barbiturates , metaqualon , diazepam and so on. On rare occasions heroin is sniffed together with marihuana ( this one is called " a bomb " ) or tobacco ( " duster " ) . The dose of heroin starts from 2 to 10 mg and with the development of the addiction it can reach 500 mg daily; with morphine these numbers may come to a few times more.

This is smoked , and the high is so intense that users can get addicted within days . </sniff.v.539><sniff.v.540>In humans , like most mammals , the nose is the primary organ for smelling. As the air is sniffed , it flows in through the nose and over structures called turbinates in the nasal cavity. These turbinates are shaped very much like the whorled shells of mollusks such as the conch , hence they are also known as nasal conchae. The turbinates slow the air flow and direct it toward the olfactory epithelium. At the surface of the olfactory epithelium , substances carried by the air contact olfactory receptor neurons. When these substances are of a type that the human olfactory system recognizes , the neurons fire and send impulses to the brain.

After all , many experts had said the drug was not physically addictive. The recent rise in the popularity of crack , a potent form of cocaine that is smoked rather than sniffed , has produced even more startling tales. Some users say they became slaves to crack in just days or weeks. Why is crack so addictive ? Scientists say it alters brain chemistry and moods in the same way as cocaine powder. But it does so more rapidly and intensely , producing not only a higher ''high'' but also a deeper ''crash'' that leaves the user desperate for more. Researchers are zeroing in on how cocaine produces euphoria and the depression and craving that result from chronic use. The drug interferes with the normal functioning of neurotransmitters , chemicals that activate nerves in an area of the brain associated with pleasurable feelings , according to Dr. Roger M. Brown , chief of neuroscience at the National Institute of Drug Abuse . </sniff.v.550><sniff.v.551>It seemed that stars had fallen from the sky to settle on the faces of the man and the boy.

" ( Hunter S Thompson ) . Laevoamphetamine ( Benzedrine ) , dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine ) and methamphetamine ( Methedrine ) are collectively referred to as Amphetamines. Potent psychomotor stimulants , they may be sniffed , swallowed , snorted or injected. Amphetamines induce exhilarating feelings of power , strength , energy , self-assertion , focus and enhanced motivation. The euphoria might last for several hours , as these chemicals are not readily broken down by the body. Their effects on health are immense : More than any other illegal drug , the consumption of Speed is associated with violence and anti-social behavior.

With extended use ( more than 2 to 3 weeks ) of Percocet , addiction is a substantial risk. Even when consumed moderately , some narcotics can cause a fatal overdose. With elevated doses of narcotics , the individual may experience restlessness and nausea; then they move onto loss of consciousness and breathing that is abnormal. Additional risks may involve withdrawal symptoms that can last for months . </sniff.v.577><sniff.v.578>A little boy was in a relative 's wedding. As he was coming down the aisle he would take two steps , stop , and turn to the crowd ( alternating between bride 's side and groom 's side ) . While facing the crowd , he would put his hands up like claws and roar. So it went , step , step , ROAR , step , step , ROAR all the way down the aisle. As you can imagine , the crowd was near tears from laughing so hard by the time he reached the pulpit. The little boy , however , was getting more and more distressed from all the laughing , and was also near tears by the time he reached the pulpit. When asked what he was doing , the child sniffed and said , 'I was being the Ring Bear .

" Rails " are lines of cocaine which are snorted. " Cap shots " refers to cocaine which is placed in a cap and 'dumped ' up the nostrils . </sniff.v.579><sniff.v.580>Cocaine can be sniffed , injected intravenously , or used by way of 'free basing'. It is rarely smoked , if only because this is an expensive and wasteful way of using the drug. As far as is known , the great majority of cocaine users sniff the drug , certainly outside the world of opiate addicts. Less than 20 of Cohen 's non-deviant respondents in Amsterdam had ever based , and only 6 had ever injected ( 1989 ) . It is possible that there is some connection between method of use and the degree of social integration of lifestyle ( see also Van Hunnik 1989 ) . Basing is the smoking of cocaine alkaloid ( crystals ) in glass waterpipes filled with , for example , strong rum. The specific effects of cocaine hit extra hard with this method , especially since the user is , for a time , inclined to compulsively continue the intake. It is possible to lose all track of the quantity which is being used ( NIDA 1986 ) . Intensive and prolonged basing can lead to physical deterioration ( Boetje 1984 ) . </sniff.v.580><sniff.v.581> We were down seven coming back after the half , and Marvin Williams and Joe Johnson had n't sniffed a lick.

In fact , the French term 'semer le basilic , ' or 'sowing basil ' meant raving like a lunatic.

" </sniff.v.593><sniff.v.594>How is " crack " different from " cocaine ? " For most of its history , cocaine has been abused in a powder that is sniffed or diluted then injected. Sniffed powder cocaine produces a high in about 15 minutes. The high lasts about half an hour. Powder cocaine has been abused by the wealthy and middle classes since the late 1800s , and has destroyed many thousands of those abusers. Some abusers have cooked cocaine with other chemicals to make a smokeable form of the drug that creates a quicker , more intense high. This process is called freebasing. Freebasing never became popular because it often caused sudden deadly explosions. In the early 1980s , drug dealers discovered a way to cook cocaine without the risk of explosions. Crack cocaine was born. Crack is actually a less pure type of freebase cocaine. It has the super-strong , quick high of freebase cocaine without the explosiveness. In addition , a dose strong enough for a huge high can be sold very cheaply. Suddenly cocaine , which had been a rich person 's drug , became available to the poor. Drug dealers swarmed over the poorest inner-city neighborhoods selling this poison in the 80s and 90s , ruining hundreds of thousands of lives . </sniff.v.594><sniff.v.595>Heroin is usually injected , sniffed/snorted , or smoked. Typically , a heroin abuser may inject up to four times a day. Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while intramuscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes. NIDA researchers have confirmed that all forms of heroin administration are addictive . </sniff.v.595><sniff.v.596>Remember a few things here.

You can allow your dog to mark their turf ONCE. Or , you can ask them not to mark , but to claim it by their presence. You will want to be ever vigilant with your dog for the first few days because their instincts will be to mark. Keep a close eye on your dog and do not allow them access to areas you can not watch them. This is just like you would do with a pup. When they sniff with purpose you can bet the next thing they will do is to mark. When your dog is walking around and sniffing with purpose , you need to follow them and the instant they pause , spend extra time at one place sniffing intently ... .get ready ! In the next instant , the head will come up and they will start to lift that leg or squat ! ! ! At that precise moment , you say EHHH ! ! ! Then take them outside to potty.

Yet Batman is amongst the safest ALP seats in the country. The decline in Bob Hawke ' s old seat , Wills , is even more remarkable - 14.1 per cent to 4.4 per cent. But like Batman , this electorate which has benefited greatly from the Coalition ' s strong governance , has returned an ALP representative by significant margins for the last decade.

Fuller is an American company that manufactures most of the glue sold in Central America. The company operates 18 plants in the large metropolitan areas of six of the seven Central American nations. In part because Fuller had promoted itself as a " socially responsible " company , eager to join the ranks of other businesses with good records of " corporate citizenship , " they had been criticized for doing little to prevent the abuse of their products by children. Among other reasons , the company was reluctant to withdraw its products because they claimed no one could determine how many children were addicted to sniffing. Critics of the company argued that ten of thousands of homeless children throughout Central America sniffed glue. These addicts are called resisteroles , so named for the Fuller brand " Resistol.

As discussed earlier , the exponents of the magnitude-estimation functions for both vanillin and orange were generally greater when these odorants were sipped rather than sniffed. So in this functional sense , the perception of intensity of the odorants may differ slightly depending on whether the stimuli are delivered retronasally or orthonasally. In addition , the relation between nominal stimulus concentrations reported here and the effective concentrations at the olfactory receptors could differ depending on mode of delivery. Consequently , comparisons of exponents obtained with different modes of delivery must be interpreted cautiously. Note , however , that there is one further indication of a possible functional difference between nasal and oral delivery of odorants : differential context effects were greater with sucrose and orange when the orange was sniffed ( experiment 6 ) rather than sipped ( experiment 4 ) . </sniff.v.606><sniff.v.607>I can not agree that the Highland school officials ' use of the trained police dogs did not constitute a search.

In the case of petitioner , the dog repeatedly jabbed its nose into her legs.

When the search team assigned to petitioner 's classroom reached petitioner , the police dog pressed forward , sniffed at her body , and repeatedly pushed its nose and muzzle into her legs. The uniformed officer then ordered petitioner to stand and empty her pockets , apparently because the dog " alerted " to the presence of drugs. However , no drugs were found. After petitioner emptied her pockets , the dog again sniffed her body and again it apparently " alerted. " Petitioner was then escorted to the nurse 's office for a more thorough physical inspection . </sniff.v.608><sniff.v.609>The Wine Aroma Wheel resembles a dartboard : three concentric circles divided pizzalike into a dozen slices of varying width. On the innermost circle , the pointed end of each wedge is an aroma category , such as fruity. In the middle circle , the wedge may be split into subcategories such as citrus , berry , or tree fruit. On the outer circle are specific materials , examples of each aroma subcategory. Thus you can follow the fruity wedge through the berry subslice to the outer circle; there you 'll find blackberry , raspberry , strawberry , and blackcurrant. The beauty of Noble 's wheel is that it links sensory concepts to actual everyday stuff -- it connects Riesling to raspberries. Wheel in hand , it is possible to sniff your way to sensory enlightenment. This commonsense approach lets anyone grasp the esoteric inner-wedge category microbiological and its arcane subdivision lactic. It 's only baffling until you sniff the examples : yogurt and sauerkraut. Then it clicks. The wheel even demystifies the wine-snob term wet dog : it 's an example of sulfur aromas in the chemical category ( along with skunk , cabbage , and burnt match ) . </sniff.v.609><sniff.v.610>Smoking freebase is preferred by many users because the cocaine is absorbed immediately into blood via the lungs , where it reaches the brain in about five seconds. The rush is much more intense than sniffing the same amount of cocaine nasally , but the effects do not last as long. The peak of the freebase rush is over almost as soon as the user exhales the vapor , but the high typically lasts 5 10 minutes afterwards. What makes freebase a particularly dangerous drug is that users typically do n't wait that long for their next hit and will continue to smoke freebase until none is left. These effects are similar to those that can be achieved by injecting or " slamming " cocaine hydrochloride , but without the risks associated with intravenous drug use ( although there are other serious risks associated with smoking freebase ) . </sniff.v.610><sniff.v.611>One of the objects that the Good Nose sniffed at were the so-called " blueberries " those are small berry-shaped rocks which were found in a depression on a Martian rock , called the " Berry Bowl " .

To examine the role of motor activity related to sniffing , they scanned people under three conditions , sniffing with a blocked nose to prevent air flow in the nostrils , puffing air into the nostrils to simulate the air flow associated with sniffing but without associated motor activity , and sniffing through partly blocked nostrils. People who sniffed with blocked noses , thus performing a sniff but without air flow occurring in the nostrils , showed no piriform activation. Conversely , people who were scanned while air was puffed into their nostrils , thus simulating the air flow part of a sniff but without motor activity , showed strong activation of the piriform cortex. Finally , sniffing with a partly blocked nose resulted in partial piriform activation. These findings indicate that piriform activity is not due to the motor activity of sniffing . </sniff.v.615><sniff.v.616>Crack ' s addictiveness takes it over the top , say experts who believe it is the most addictive drug.

By the 1980s a cheaper version of pure cocaine made its appearance on the illegal market in the form of " crack , " which is smoked , primarily in the " crack houses " where it is produced. In the form of crack , cocaine has reached a larger population , making it one of the chief drug problems of the present . </sniff.v.623><sniff.v.624>Figure 8 Magnitude estimates of orange sipped ( ORt , open symbols ) and orange sniffed ( ORs , filled symbols ) , plotted against stimulus concentration , in two contextual conditions , where either concentrations of sipped orange were high and those of sniffed orange were low ( condition A , squares ) or concentrations of sipped orange were low and those of sniffed orange were high ( condition B , circles ) .

Heroin intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while heroin intramuscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are commonly felt within 10 to 15 minutes. Although smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a " rush " as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection , NIDA researchers have confirmed that all three methods of heroin administration are addictive . </sniff.v.641><sniff.v.642>I sniffed mightily to try and clear my sinuses.

Firewalls and routers do not pass ethernet traffic , so a machine on one side of a firewall can not sniff the traffic on the other side of the firewall or gateway. In fact , some ethernet hubs can be configured to only pass traffic intended for the machine on a particular port to that machine. This makes it impossible for that machine to sniff the ethernet ( and get anything ) . Unfortunately , this setting generally precludes more than one machine on that port , or changing the machine on that port ( without contacting the NOC ) , so this type of hub does not work well in the dorm network or in public labs with ethernet jacks . </sniff.v.645><sniff.v.646>Usually taken orally but can be inject via three routes.

Some have identified one part of this issue as a disjoint between the local practice of filename extensions and the server practice of using content headers. Some suggest we might change those headers by indicating an ' ! important ' in the content-header value or something similar. Browsers have tried to solve this problem by sniffing content ( which actually contributes to the problem since authors are unaware of their errors in setting metadata because of the content sniffing ) . In addition to other approaches , HTML5 might want to treat mismatches between content-headers and sniff-content types as an error ( even if we require that error be handled gracefully though somehow reported to authors ) . </sniff.v.652><sniff.v.653>Debra , you win no pity from Dog Lady when you claim to use those insidious indoor piddle pads because you don ' t want to be tied down to walking your dog.

If Cocaine Hydrochloride is sniffed the effect occurs gradually and lasts longer.

For example in 1994 there were 21 Crack related murders in London . </sniff.v.655><sniff.v.656>Until Mignot and Yanagisawa announced their findings , narcolepsy mystified the medical profession. In fact , researchers say , most narcoleptics remain undiagnosed. One man was 73 before he learned he had it , and by then his reputation for laziness was legendary. It ' s difficult to diagnose , says Mignot , because sleep is so natural , the last thing to complain about. It doesn ' t help that some doctors aren ' t aware the disorder exists. Narcolepsy is characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness , involuntary sleep attacks , paralysis , hallucinations and , in its most severe and disturbing form , episodes of cataplexy in which a person usually in the grip of strong emotion suddenly loses muscle tone and goes limp. That ' s what happened to Beau when he sniffed that dog food. Strangely , the disorder doesn ' t appear to shorten lives. Narcoleptics get a normal amount of sleep in a 24-hour period; it just happens to be broken into uncontrollable and disabling pieces . </sniff.v.656><sniff.v.657>Well , Bruce , welcome to the club.

Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs , their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing welltrained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy , whether owing to errors by their handlers , the limitations of the dogs themselves , or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.

Most such substances sniffed for their psychological effects act to depress the central nervous system. Low doses can produce slight stimulation , but in higher amounts they cause their users to lose control or lapse into unconsciousness. The effects , which are immediate , can last for as long as 45 minutes. Headache , nausea , and drowsiness follow. Sniffing inhalants can impair vision , judgement , and muscle and reflex control. Permanent damage can result from prolonged use , and death can result from sniffing highly concentrated aerosol sprays. Although physical dependence does not seem to occur , tolerance to some inhalants does develop. Another source of medical concern is the widespread misuse , for their supposed aphrodisiac effect , of so-called popperschemicals such as isoamyl nitrite that have legitimate medical functions as blood-vessel dilators. Continued sniffing of these substances can damage the circulatory system and have related harmful effects . </sniff.v.659><sniff.v.660>Bloodhounds can naturally recognize a person or animal by its scent , but they must be trained to track. First , the dog has to get used to its leash and then its harness. Then it learns to sniff an article of clothing or something else handled by a person. The dog finds that person by following his or her scent trail . </sniff.v.660><sniff.v.661>Actions/Effects : Cocaine is absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes of the nose , when sniffed; via the alveoli in the lungs , when smoked. In the brain , it pumps up the volume by increasing the activity of two main neurotransmitters , norepinephrine and dopamine. At low doses , its effects include feelings of excitement and alertness , combined with decreased appetite and fatigue. Physical effects include dilated pupils , constricted blood vessels , and elevated heart rate , respiration , and blood pressure. Higher doses ( or use over a long period of time ) can cause anxiety , paranoia , and toxic psychosis . </sniff.v.661><sniff.v.662>Morphine is found in both legally and illegally manufactured forms.

When interpreting these results it should be borne in mind only 35 of pupils who had only ever used volatile substances answered this question and results should therefore be treated with caution , as this sub-sample may not be representative. Friends were by far the most common source of drugs , mentioned by 82 of those who only took cannabis on the first occasion and 65 who only sniffed volatile substance on the first occasion. Though far less common than friends , 'someone else ' responses were the second most frequent source of those who had only sniffed volatile substances ( 19 ) , though not of those who had only taken cannabis ( 3 ) . Of these other sources for obtaining volatile substances , the most common answer was that the pupil already had glue , gas or solvents ( usually in the home ) . Pupils also said that they had bought volatile substances from a shop , or that they had obtained them from school . </sniff.v.667><sniff.v.668>" We 're witnessing the arrival of a new kind of heroin use " , said Nicole Maestrecci , head of the government 's inter-ministerial group on drug abuse.

Ms. Maestrecci added that France 's new generation of heroin users would not dream of injecting the drug , which they considered " dirty , downmarket and dangerous " , but sniffed lines of it in the same way as cocaine . </sniff.v.668><sniff.v.669>Nasal IrrigationA variety of medicines are available for cleaning the nose. Fingers , cotton swabs , and other mechanical instruments should not be used. The simplest and most commonly used is normal saline. This can be purchased as Nasal Saline Ocean Spray or Ayr , or by mixing one glass of water with a level teaspoon of iodine-free salt. This is administered to the nose either with a dropper or as a spray , and should be sniffed in and then blown back out. This helps clean the nose and in many individuals makes the nose feel more comfortable. For some individuals a different nasal douche will be prescribed. This is called Nasal Lubricant. It contains a variety of drugs including oil of eucalyptus and is effective for cleaning the nose and coating the mucosal lining. Particularly in individuals with a dry crusty nose , this medicine may be extremely useful. It is important that the nasal lubricant not be inhaled into the lungs , for this could cause pulmonary damage . </sniff.v.669><sniff.v.670>He was transported to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead.Police converged on the neighborhood , which is just down the street from Hartford , surrounding it with officers and questioning witnesses.

She had spotted something : an interesting-looking hole at a fork in the trunk. Watching her , researcher Paco Bertolani suspected that she was looking for insect larvae to eat; the chimpanzees had done this before. Tumbo grabbed a thin branch , snapped it free and purposefully honed one end , using her teeth to make a point. Then , she moved closer to the hole , grasped the primitive spear , and rammed it inside with as much might as she could muster. Afterwards , she pulled it out and sniffed and licked the end. Tumbo repeated the violent stabs again and again until , apparently satisfied , she moved across to a withered branch adjoining the trunk and leapt up and down to break it free. From within the now exposed hole , she retrieved an unmoving bushbaby , evidently dead as a result of the onslaught. She sat down and calmly dismembered the animal , chewing on the meat with relish and accompanying her meal with odd handfuls of fresh leaves . </sniff.v.674><sniff.v.675>Adolescents lying terrified on the ground as police officers with guns drawn walk through the hallway of their school while police dogs sniff their backpacks; these images that were flashed across televisions all over the world last week , did not come from Pyongyang , Havana or Tehran.

Here , the appellant was not subject to a frisk of any kind and his baggage was not opened and searched. He was not in any way the subject of a humiliating encounter that impacted on his dignity or his bodily integrity , and the dog sniff itself can not even be said to be an embarrassing process ( unlike being detained in a drug loo facility as was the case in Monney ) . </sniff.v.679><sniff.v.680>Psychologist and smell scientist Gilbert 's serious science is enlivened by a whimsical sense of humor. He is entertaining when affirming common wisdoms regarding smell-mothers can discern the smell of their child 's diapers from another 's ( and think the smell sweeter ) , and , yes , women 's sense of smell is better than men's. Gilbert destroys some shibboleths-blind people smell no better than sighted people , and dogs ' and humans ' senses of smell are probably reasonably similar. Gilbert is also interested in how smell is treated in the arts , riffing on Proust 's ruminations on smell and memory , or " d ja-smell , " as Gilbert calls it. He energetically describes the epic 1950s Hollywood battle between " Smell-O-Vision " and " AromaRama "; the physiology of the popular tabloid tales of dead , decaying bodies found after a neighbor 's report of " a foul odor " from a nearby apartment; and the possible evolutionary future of the human ability to smell. Gilbert is also surprisingly romantic , and elegiac , in describing smells that modern society has lost , odors he includes in his novel concept of " smellscape.

At least that was the plan when , for the first time , the Navy decided to hire an outside contractor to supply K-9s and handlers to help protect dozens of its bases and ships. But when the dog-handler teams showed up for work last spring , they could n't find planted explosives during military certification tests , according to the Navy.

The dogs are trained to track criminals in a city environment and sniff them out when hidden inside a building during a foiled burglary. They have located over 25 lost children and elderly people who have wandered away from home. They have provided Presidential Security and executive Protection for those dignitaries visiting the Portsmouth area. The Unit is loaned out to the Attorney Generals Office , Statewide Drug task Force , United States Customs , U.S. Immigration , U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency , United States Coast Guard , and over 30 other Law Enforcement Agencies across New England and Canada.

Sure , politicians have always had catch-phrases -- " War On Poverty " , " Give Peace a Chance " , " The Change We Need " . But George Bush 's slogans transcended mere prods to motivate the American people. Rather , they seemed to capture his alarmingly un-nuanced world-view , rendering his sense of world affairs like a gun fight at the O.K. Corral. When France and Germany refused to back America 's war in Iraq , Bush declared that these long-time allies were either " with us or against us " . This was no rhetorical flourish , but a call to arms. Rees 's strip offered catharsis for those who found this all not a little alarming. " Get Your War On " would soon become a reliable source of criticism against a seemingly unhinged foreign-policy agenda . </sniff.v.717><sniff.v.718>The Caballes opinion also does not address the use of dogs to sniff for explosives and weapons. Clearly , the case would allow such police activity wherever dogs are permitted to sniff for drugs , for the state interest in detecting and foiling terrorism is at least as great as -- and likely much greater than -- the interest in apprehending drug dealers . </sniff.v.718><sniff.v.719>" The dogs search for fun and praise , never treats.

A restricted area was set up around the aircraft using a portable rope barricade. An entry control point ( ECP ) was designated and manned by a drug dog team. Usually this would be one of the special vehicles used to transport dog teams. All equipment , supplies , and vehicles entering were searched by a drug detector dog. Even fire extinguishers were checked. A portable screen ( below ) was pulled to the ECP at the aircraft holding area.

The pattern of age when first sniffed volatile substances and first tried cannabis given retrospectively by pupils aged 15 does not match the relationship ( shown in Figure 3.2 ) between any taking of these drugs and age. Retrospective recall of when pupils aged 15 first sniffed volatile substances or tried cannabis suggests that up to the age of 13 there was little difference between the proportions who had sniffed volatile substance and who had tried cannabis , and then confirms that at age 14 more pupils had tried cannabis than had ever sniffed volatile substances . </sniff.v.727><sniff.v.728>When all was said and done , a police dog sniffed McConnell hiding out in a stairwell.

But , before we start talking about medical use of oxytocin , I believe we need a new system of ethics. Unlike other ' feel good ' drugs , oxytocin is very subtle. People might not even realize that they ' ve taken oxytocin. An interesting study reported in the June 2005 issue of Nature examined the role of interpersonal trust and oxytocin. Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich and his colleagues discovered that men who inhaled a nasal spray spiked with oxytocin gave more money to partners in a risky investment game than did the men who sniffed a spray with no active ingredient. The researchers concluded that oxytocin specifically affects an individual ' s willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. </sniff.v.743><sniff.v.744>Firefighters solve arson fires with K-9 units , or dogs.

It is derived from the leaves of the coca plant , found primarily in various regions of South America. Cocaine is a powerfully addictive drug of abuse. Once having tried cocaine , the typical user can not predict or control the extent to which he or she will continue to use the drug. The major routes of administration are sniffing , injecting , and smoking ( including free-base and crack cocaine ) . Powdered cocaine is typically sniffed through the nose , where it is absorbed into the bloodstream through the nasal tissues. For this purpose , users typically roll a dollar bill into the form of a straw or cut a plastic straw into small segments. A razor blade and small mirror might be used to chop the drug into single doses known as " lines " . ( See picture above. ) When injected , the drug is released directly into the bloodstream.

Power at any price means dabbling in a police state; people 's rights are fair game for Ministers in this Labor Government. It puts to shame the title " social democrat " . It resembles a police state when the Government introduces a law with regulations that allow police officers to let police dogs sniff people who are out for the night at their favourite club , travelling home after a hard day 's work , or on their way to school.

The automobile exception provides that you may search the vehicle without a warrant simply upon probable cause , even if the vehicle is in police custody. Losing the mobility ( exigency ) of the vehicle by towing or some other means does not destroy the validity of the search. An auto exception search extends to the trunk and containers. This doctrine applies to vehicles that may be used as homes , such as motor homes and vans , as long as they are capable of mobility.

The Illinois rule , like the tack adopted by Justice Blackmun , would require only reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to allow a car to be sniffed by a dog; reasonable suspicion is a lesser standard than full-blown probable cause. ( United States v. Sokolow , 490 U.S. 1 , 7-8 ( 1989 ) . ) Under established law , the police can conduct a physical search of a car , including the inside of the trunk , without a warrant. ( Carroll v. United States , 267 U.S. 132 ( 1925 ); California v.

But neither is hearsay. The hearsay rule reaches only statements made by persons. This makes sense because it would do no good to call the bloodhound or radar gun into court for cross-examination. Before testimony about the barking may be introduced , however , evidence will have to be presented regarding the bloodhound 's competence to track scents and his handler 's competence in interpreting the dog 's reactions.

Transition at the individual level depends both on contextual factors , including economic , political , and normative influences , as well as individual behavioral factors and individual relationships ( see Strang , et al. 1992 for a review of relevant perspectives ) . Understanding changes in route of drug administration is important for considering HIV prevention programs. Interventions may need to be tailored to specific types of drug users in different stages of their drug careers . </sniff.v.856><sniff.v.857>Officers in Portland , OR , follow leads from a confidential informant tied to narcotics trafficking.

In experiments 58 , one stimulus was sipped and the other was sniffed. Experiments 5 and 6 used the tastant sucrose and a sniffed odorant , either vanillin ( experiment 5 ) or orange ( experiment 6 ) . Experiment 7 used vanillin sipped as one stimulus and vanillin sniffed as the other , and experiment 8 used orange sipped as one stimulus and orange sniffed as the other. The concentrations used in these experiments appear in Table 2.

So a sniffer may become drowsy , confused , aggressive , may take more risks than they would when sober , and so on. Accidents are , therefore , quite common and sometimes death results. Deaths related to solvent sniffing have become a significant cause of death of young males. Over half of the deaths , which have been linked to solvent sniffing , appear to result from the direct toxic effects of the chemicals , which were sniffed; but other deaths result from accidents , choking on vomit or suffocation . </sniff.v.871><sniff.v.872>I think you are doing exactly what you are supposed to be doing -- it 's the other people who are the idiots.

I do take her hiking. I am VERY wary of the possibility of loose dogs. Then I have Jack , who loves every dog and is great off leash. However , whenever I get the foolish urge to let him off leash when I would hike with him , I would remember how I felt about people who did that with their dogs when I had Sally , and quickly push that thought out of my head . </sniff.v.872><sniff.v.873>Fastened to a long line clipped to his harness , Slugger surged forward , following an unseen trail.

It was removed from Coca Cola in 1903. ( notes 52 53 ) </sniff.v.882><sniff.v.883>Recently I took a client ' s dog to his veterinarian. The waiting room soon became crowded with puppies , dogs , and cats. My client ' s dog was anxious and occasionally growled , a normal reaction of animals feeling the need to increase space between themselves and whatever they are unsure of. In this case , he was unsure of everything about the situation ! Sensing his anxiety , I immediately began treating him every time he looked at another animal ( classical conditioning ) , and within five minutes his growling ceased. Even when a boisterous dog approached and sniffed him , my client ' s dog was undaunted : after all , he ' d associated all these animals with tasty treats only minutes earlier . </sniff.v.883><sniff.v.884>cocaine is illegally imported from S.

No longer is it a sinful secret of the moneyed elite , nor merely an elusive glitter of decadence in raffish society circles , as it seemed in decades past. No longer is it primarily an exotic and ballyhooed indulgence of high-gloss entrepreneurs , Hollywood types and high rollers , as it was only three or four years agothe most conspicuous of consumptions , to be sniffed from the most chic of coffee tables through crisp , rolled-up $ 100 bills. Today , in part precisely because it is such an emblem of wealth and status , coke is the drug of choice for perhaps millions of solid , conventional and often upwardly mobile citizenslawyers , businessmen , students , government bureaucrats , politicians , policemen , secretaries , bankers , mechanics , real estate brokers , waitresses. Largely unchecked by law enforcement , a veritable blizzard of the white powder is blowing through the American middle class , and it is causing significant social and economic shifts no less than a disturbing drug problem . </sniff.v.886><sniff.v.887>Consider the recent introduction of a small , transparent patch for women that purportedly increases libido.

( By the same logic , the decisions of the Supreme Court should not be discussed by the general public. ) He also claimed the structural realignment called for the Kigali statement would bring about the disintegration of the Anglican Communion which is a bit rich , coming from the chief consecrator in the act which he himself had agreed would tear the fabric of the Communion at the deepest level. If he sounds a mite embattled , it is because he is.

In that story Israely sniffed that the Popes intellect and sure-fire faith had gotten him into hot water not only in Regensberg ( where the Pope made that negative comment concerning Islam ) , but also on his last trip to Brazil by telling reporters on the Rome-to-Sao Paulo flight that pro-choice politicians were automatically excommunicated. Why , the Pope had even dared to speak about the Churchs role in colonizing Latin America without mentioning the history of forced conversions and other violence by Catholics against the indigenous population. Yes , those indigenous populations who were happily engaged in human sacrifice to the serpent-god , until Catholic missionaries dared to baptize and educate them . </sniff.v.895><sniff.v.896>The road emerged on the Malahat descent and I sniffed contemptuously at the rumble strips as I descended and soon found myself at the turnoff into Langford. As I rolled into the Tim Horton 's control , what I saw I assumed must be a mirage : three bikes belonging to Jaye , Karen , and Wim. I walked in and found that they had only just arrived about five minutes ahead of me. Karen seemed surprised to see me so soon and said , " Wow ! You must have been motoring ! " I had not been and told her so , but did not bother to mention Nietzsche since that would have required a great deal more explanation than I had the energy for.

Had he known this , Severus would have taken the underground. Certainly that would have taken less than the hour this incompetent taxi driver had wasted. Severus sniffed and counted out the exact fare and no more. Tipping was a waste of his money and he had lost enough exchanging his galleons for pounds then converting them to dollars. Why Gringotts refused to do any international exchanging , Severus did not know. He could have waited until he got to America to change his money , but that meant he had to go to the wizarding places here and he preferred not to take unnecessary risks in an unknown location. He might venture forth later , when curiosity got the best of him. Until then , Severus got out the taxi and slammed the door shut. The loud sound was satisfying music to his ears , especially if it irritated the driver . </sniff.v.897><sniff.v.898>A little while later he had our geiger counter on and he was checking his tube. This kinda pissed me off that he would have me smell something that was hot in the first place so I started to watch him. He was putting the counter up to his nose and the thing was going crazy. He started to panic. He came over and asked me the number to radiation safety. I told him that they would n't be there because it was a weekend. I asked him why and he said that he had sniffed so hard that he sniffed up some of his probe. He had a pretty big nose. He then wanted to know if he could sniff some count off up his nose. I told him that it probably would do more harm than good . </sniff.v.898><sniff.v.899>The chapter begins by examining the availability of volatile substances ( Section 3.2 ) .

Usually pressed into pills or loaded into placebo capsules , the primary method of use is orally. A powder form of MDMA can also be sniffed but this is less common. Much less frequent than sniffing is the injection or smoking of the drug , though this does occur. There are a number of analogs ( chemically similar substances ) of MDMA that are commonly sold as ecstasy on the street. These include MDA and MDEA ( known as " Eve " ) . Additionally , ecstasy is notoriously unreliable in content , much more so than most other street drugs.

Typically , a heroin abuser may inject up to four times a day. Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while musculature injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes. Although smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a " rush " as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection , researchers have confirmed that all three forms of heroin administration are addictive . </sniff.v.907><sniff.v.908>In United States v. McLaughlin , the defense expert testified , in essence , that the handler used his hunch that drugs were present to induce the dog to alert. The court agreed that using a dog search as a sham in finding drugs essentially not allowing the dog to employ the skill for which he was trained would significantly decrease the reliability of the search , but , as might be expected , concluded that the record did not support the contention that the dog sniff was simply a ruse. Lacking , the court said , was any evidence that the handler ' s conduct had an improper effect on the dog. In contrast , in Heir , in which the dog had responded by sniffing intently but did not give its trained final response , the defendant ' s experts testified that the alert behavior described by [ the handler ] could easily be attributed to his ' cuing ' of the animal , either intentionally or unintentionally , by changing the leash from one hand to the other , by stopping , by blocking the way , or by other actions. The court was unwilling to accept that an actual alert had occurred.

But a few may become heavy and frequent misusers. The number of youngsters sniffing varies from place to place and at different times. Some people say there is more sniffing in the summer , but perhaps it is just more obvious in the long summer evenings.

They said he placed too much weight on ideas and intellect and not enough on archival research and empirical evidence. " This is not science , " sniffed a now little-remembered colleague , David Shannon , " this is an example of what an intelligent person can do sitting in an arm chair. " Such caustic criticism , however , did n't bother Hofstadter much , according to Brown; he shrugged off his detractors as " archive rats. " Perhaps he knew that this disdain for the " New York style " could be a veiled form of anti-Semitism. Of course , such anti-Jewish feelings were usually expressed discreetly , as when one University of California historian asked another to size up Hofstadter at a conference : " I am not yet quite sure that he is the man we want. His point of view strikes me as rather typical of the New York Jewish intelligentsia , although I do not even know that he is a Jew. " Occasionally , however , the profession 's anti-Semitism was expressed more publicly ( if still obliquely ) , as in 1962 , when Brown University 's Carl Bridenbaugh , addressing the entire American Historical Association , denigrated historians from " lower middle-class or foreign origins , " whose emotions , he said " get in the way of historical reconstructions.

An alkaloid found in the leaves of the coca bush , Erythroxylon coca , cocaine in its crystalline form is a white powder that looks like moth flakes. Cocaine can be sniffed , smoked , or taken intravenously. Abusers of cocaine may or may not develop a tolerance for the drug.

Within the art world , it is heresy. Three decades ago , poor Nelson Rockefeller got nothing but invective for his generosity when he made high-quality reproductions of his personal art collection available at reasonable prices. The art world collectively sniffed that a copy , no matter how good , is not really art but , as one prominent critic put it , " intrinsically dead , like a stuffed trout. " Nobody made what would seem to be the obvious point : Rockefeller was making wonderful aesthetic experiences widely available to people who were not Rockefellers . </sniff.v.932><sniff.v.933>Although the current mission is focused on force protection , the dogs are also trained to accompany Coalition troops on combat patrols.

A drug dog with the sheriff 's office , Zuul , comes up with false positives in vehicles he sniffs half of the time.

Originally this effort was to support another drug dog but recently they asked us if the money could go toward a tracker dog ( a bite dog ) that would chase down criminals and apprehend and hold them before their human handlers could get to the suspects on foot. The tournament raised $ 8 , 500 for this cause. You might remember that we have in the past donated money to the county to help pay for Bianca 's recertification as a drug sniffing dog . She has been well worth it as she has sniffed out in excess of five million dollars in drugs this year. Member and Volunteer Hugh Grimes was honored by the Montgomery County Sheriffs Association at our Festival Of Trees event for his chairmanship of the tournament and his tireless work toward this cause. Great job Hugh ! </sniff.v.942><sniff.v.943>Another study by Claud Wedekind , a biologist at the University of Lausanne , had 44 men wear a t-shirt for two nights.

" Users have also been known to combine heroin and cocaine , snorting alternate lines or " crisscrossing , " or injecting the two drugs simultaneously , called " speedballing.

Everything was close on the island , and 23 , 000 Japanese were everywhere. It was not dog country , but the Marines who were saved from surprise attacks and ambushes did not care. They thanked God for the dogs and volunteered to dig foxholes just to keep the handlers around. Casualties among handlers on Iwo [ ima were high. Private First Class Walter Josefiak and his dog Rusty encountered a group of Japanese near the mouth of a cave. Private Josefiak killed three of the enemy , but was mortally wounded by a mortar round. Rusty moved in to protect his wounded master but was tom across the middle by the fragments of a grenade. On another patrol , Private James E. Wallace of the 5th Division was killed by a mortar and his German Shepherd Fritz was wounded.

Narcotics are administered in a variety of ways. Some are taken orally , transdermally ( skin patches ) , or injected. They are also available in suppositories. As drugs of abuse , they are often smoked , sniffed , or injected. Drug effects depend heavily on the dose , route of administration , and previous exposure to the drug. Aside from their medical use , narcotics produce a general sense of well-being by reducing tension , anxiety , and aggression. These effects are helpful in a therapeutic setting but con tribute to their abuse . </sniff.v.964><sniff.v.965>Dosages range from one gram or less , which is considered a mild dose to upwards of five grams in a single dose.

Alternatively , the open container or soaked rag can be placed in a bag where the vapors can concentrate before being inhaled. Some chemicals are painted on the hands or fingernails or placed on shirt sleeves or wrist bands to enable an abuser to continually inhale the fumes without being detected by a teacher or other adult. Although inhalant abusers may prefer one particular substance because of taste or odor , a variety of substances may be used because of similar effects , availability , and cost. Once inhaled , the extensive capillary surface of the lungs allows rapid absorption of the substance and blood levels peak rapidly. Entry into the brain is fast and the intoxicating effects are intense but short lived . </sniff.v.967><sniff.v.968>A pregnant rhinoceros , an express train or a chain saw - just a few of the phrases used to describe the nightly curse of SNORING.

But for maybe the third or forth time , I ' ll tell you that my primary recommendation is that you stop reading at this point and just see this thought-provoking , engrossing thriller before I give everything away , then come back so that I can spoonfeed you understanding of the film. Not that I was utterly shocked by the fact that the retard did it , but I hadn ' t really considered the possibility until late in the game , after I had sniffed after a couple of classic red herrings like a chump. I was taken in , not only because of my limited intelligence , but because the film blends genres so well that it keeps you unsure of where you are and where you are going. It feels like a mystery here , a morality tale there , and then a revenge saga.

I was standing in the customs line. All of a sudden a cute yellow lab was sniffing my luggage. She didn ' t stay with me this is good. However , I really wanted to take her picture. The handler had a job to do so probably couldn ' t just stand there talking to me. I would have explained about William being in college to be a service dog. I asked the handler if I might take a picture. She said no and moved on. My guess is they don ' t want photographs taken in customs. After I passed through customs in Japan , I noticed another dog and its handler sniffing suitcases. This one looked just like the one who sniffed my bag. Wonder if they are related. So , no picture of a dog. By the way , dogs are not prevalent around here as they are in Switzerland. Everyone had dogs in Europe and they were all very well behaved. I believe I ' ve only seen one dog here in Japan. Kotoha told me that she has a goldfish since most buildings don ' t allow dogs. Perhaps that ' s why there aren ' t more dogs . </sniff.v.983><sniff.v.984>The media 's gravitation towards primitivism has pressured other parts of the anarchist movement to accept it as well. The University of Michigan 's Joseph A. Labadie collection , commonly regarded as an " archive of record " for the anarchist movement , recently decided to admit the papers of unabomber Theodore Kaczynski into its vaults. This includes interviews where Kaczynski reports on attempts to have a dialogue with terrorist Timothy McVeigh , dragging again the shadiest figures of modem politics into anarchist history. The shelving of Kaczynski 's murderous Unabomber Manifesto alongside classics by Emma Goldman and others is presumably something the anarchist community will have to live with. The acquisition is of further irony , given that the figure for which the University of Michigan 's archive is named , labor activist Joseph Labadie , favored public control over industrial society , not a Kaczynski-style mail bombing of it. As well , Kaczynski admirer John Zerzan works with a self-styled " Green Anarchy " collective in Oregon. When Z Magazine editor Michael Albert approached John Zerzan to debate primitivism , Zerzan ultimately sniffed , " As an anarchist , I 'm not interested.

It is effective orally and is marketed alone in 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , and 160 mg controlled-release tablets ( OxyContin ) , or 5 mg immediate-release capsules ( OxyIR ) , or in combination products with aspirin ( Percodan ) or acetaminophen ( Percocet ) for the relief of pain. All oxycodone products are in Schedule II. Oxycodone is abused orally , or the tablets are crushed and sniffed or dissolved in water and injected. The use of oxycodone has increased significantly.

It is better to interfere with the distribution of cocaine before it reaches the streets for resale than to collaborate with drug dealers by limiting the scope of their consent , or forbidding the police to follow clues which they discern because of their experience in dealing with subterfuge of this sort.

For sniffing vanillin and orange , 30 ml of each stimulus was placed in 250 ml squeezable , high-density polyethylene bottles with pop-up spouts ( Cain et al. , 1988 ) . In experiment 2 , which used only tastants , the cups were uncovered. In experiments 3 and 4 , where half of the stimuli were odorants , all of the cups were covered with laboratory film in order to prevent the subject from detecting any odor before sipping the stimulus. A small opening in the film was made just before tasting the sample , and the subjects pinched their nose before and at the start of sipping. Once the sample was in the mouth , the subjects breathed normally. The same procedure was used for the sipped odorants in experiments 58. Subjects rinsed their mouths with deionized water before sipping each sample , whether odorant or tastant . </sniff.v.1008><sniff.v.1009>By the time the odd duo had reached the entrance to Professor Dumbledore ' s office , poor Peeves was bruised and bleeding in more places that one.

Instead , the literature shows that , even with direct modes of cocaine ingestion like crack smoking , use patterns and consequences vary widely. This evidence supports the theoretical perspective outlined in the beginning of this book : that abusive use patterns and addiction are more a function of the characteristics of certain users and certain social circumstances of use than of the drugs themselves ( see Peele , 1985; Szasz , 1974; Zinberg , 1984 ) . This is why all drugs , including cocaine and crack , show such enormous variation in patterns of use.

Usually powdered form of cocaine is sniffed by coke addicts but sometimes it is also dissolved in water and injected into the body. Crack cocaine is the one that is counterbalanced by an acid and then prepared into the form of a hydrochloride salt. The cocaine made in this way comes in a rock crystal form &amp;is heated with its vapors being smoked by addicts. The crackling sound when this is heated gives it the name of crack . </sniff.v.1265><sniff.v.1266>She sniffed , " That 's absurd.

After several more minutes , he sniffed again. The eau de toilet was gone , but now there was another scent.

Some of us city slickers here at City Paper arched our eyebrows archly when we heard about the " Maryland Ensemble Theatre " theater group out in Frederick. " They put on plays in Fredneck ? Thee-uh-tah ? " we all sniffed rhetorically to the purebred hairless cats we were stroking in our laps as we changed filters in cigarette holders and adjusted ascots. " Well , then , we bloody well must support the Frederickians in their attempts at cull-cha out in the hinterlands. " So , hey , check out ( here comes some well-disguised boilerplate ) Jon Klein 's absurd and purportedly cult-classic environmental farce ( the best kind , the absurd farce , non ? ) featuring an unemployed logger ( we think plays well in Frederick , USA ) and Betty ( Julie Herber ) , a female Sasquatch-like Bigfoot-type kinda gal , who keep company and farce it up , environmentally and pop-culturally , and we hope , humorously , out in the forest . </sniff.v.1270><sniff.v.1271>When they arrived , I had previously placed Winston in the far obedience field.

Not " breathing out , " but " breathing in " ( inhaling ) as in Aeschylus and Plato or " breathing on " ( from Homer on ) . The partitive genitive of apeilhv and ponou means that threatening and slaughter had come to be the very breath that Saul breathed , like a warhorse who sniffed the smell of battle. He breathed on the remaining disciples the murder that he had already breathed in from the death of the others. He exhaled what he inhaled. Jacob had said that " Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf " ( Genesis 49 : 27 ) . This greatest son of Benjamin was fulfilling this prophecy ( Furneaux ) . The taste of blood in the death of Stephen was pleasing to young Saul ( 8 : 1 ) and now he revelled in the slaughter of the saints both men and women. In 26 : 11 Luke quotes Paul as saying that he was " exceedingly mad against them.

It can be taken by mouth , or sniffed as a powder or injected. Methamphetamine , which is made into crystals and can be smoked ( this is " crystal meth " or " ice " ) is a more powerful form of the drug. It is highly addictive . </sniff.v.1273><sniff.v.1274>Dogs have the same kind of limits as human narcotics officers. They do well inspecting enclosed areas , vehicles and luggage , but they ca n't smell drugs in the grass or placed in spaces high above their heads. They don ' t inspect people , nor can they sniff out drugs that smugglers have swallowed or stuffed into body orifices. And scotch tape can stop them cold , sealing out the whiff of drugs from their sensitive noses . </sniff.v.1274><sniff.v.1275>As Richard Sloane notes in the exhibit catalogue , In the two years that followed ' Freeze ' the pace quickened , collectors sniffed the air and critics spread supportive words.

I sniffed , I sipped , I swirled , I swallowed. It was wonderful and delicious -- dark , rich , deeply flavored. It was surely balsamic vinegar , and yet it was entirely palatable and , indeed , enjoyable. It warmed in the chest , and I regretted that there was just a little bit left to drink.

The epidemic can be broken down into three stages : a sustained increase in cocaine use , mostly sniffing from an initially low level in 1969 through the early 1980s; the explosive growth of crack smoking in the mid-1980s; and a decline after 1988 among younger , casual and affluent users , though not among those already addicted . </sniff.v.1279><sniff.v.1280>At first when sniffed to the south , but she could sense nothing there.

As it approached , John encouraged it with that Come here , boy ! voice. The dog came right up to the tall wood fence , sniffed Johns extended smelly , sweaty bicycle-gloved hand , and stood there to be petted. We explained to him what a good dog he is , and suggested he not chase us along the fence.

Like the amphetamines , it is a central nervous system stimulant and is a mind-altering drug that produces an intense adrenaline rush of energy. Cocaine appears in several different forms. Cocaine hydrochloride is the most available form of the drug and is used medically as a local anesthetic. It is usually a fine white crystal-like powder , although at times it comes in larger pieces , which on the street are called rocks. Cocaine is usually sniffed or snorted into the nose. Some users inject it or smoke forms of the drug called freebase and crack. </sniff.v.1294><sniff.v.1295>Today , the standards-based multi-vendor platform implemented by Gecko , WebKit and Opera not only works for Web users but is the preferred platform for developers.

The problem is that sniffed IEness is tainted by the old IE platform . </sniff.v.1295><sniff.v.1296>Cocaine is mainly sniffed but it can also be injected or smoked , if it has been prepared for it. Just after being sniffed , a strong sensation of nasal insensibility is felt.

As she looked , a large badger waddled out of the hedge that divided the garden from the fields below the eastern edge of the town and sniffed the air suspiciously. He was a huge boar , with deep black flanks , and a brilliant white stripe down the middle of his head.

The story goes like this : After a short tour culminating in a sold-out show at an 1 , 800-capacity venue in Dallas , the band partied on the way home , as was customary. An inebriated Tim proceeded to his good friend Richard Keeling 's house in order to score some heroin. As Underwood tells it , Keeling , in flagrante delicto and unwilling to be disturbed , argued with Buckley : " Finally , in frustration , Richard put a quantity of heroin on a mirror and thrust it at Tim , saying , 'Go ahead , take it all ' , like a challenge. As was his way , Tim sniffed the lot. Whenever he was threatened or told what to do , he rebelled. " Staggering and lurching around the house , Buckley had to be taken home , where Judy Buckley laid him on the floor with a pillow. She then put him to bed , thinking he would recover; when she checked later , he 'd turned an ominous shade of blue. The paramedics were called but it was too late.

Again , I command Pebbles to SIT , and I also throw in QUIET , since I hear some growling. Pebbles responds in milliseconds it seems. Before you know it , the man starts petting her and praising her for being such a good dog. She did n't budge at all ! I think she liked getting praises from strangers. This guy stood there and talked to us for a good 10 minutes and Pebbles just sat there. I did n't even have to correct her. Then , guess who comes back , yup , MR. WILD DOG and his owner. Pebs could n't resist , she budged , but one correction and she was sitting quietly again. The dog actually lunged at her , sniffed her nose , rather harshly if you ask me , and Pebbles did n't budge ! The owner of WILD DOG just yanked his dog into the hotel. I praised Pebbles for about 5 minutes. Did I mention that all this time , I did n't have a leash on her ? Okay , I should have , but I panicked and forgot to put the leash back on. She totally rocks ! </sniff.v.1308><sniff.v.1309>Parosmia - means a perversion or distortion of the sense of smell. An example of this would be an individual who sniffed one odor but felt they smelled another , very often an unpleasant odor , such as the smell of something decaying. Phantosmia is a situation in which one smells an odor for which there is no stimulus; hence it is a phantom smell . </sniff.v.1309><sniff.v.1310>The Founding Fathers added " dominion " at the last moment to the countrys title.

These are people who sniff out other people who love to get down on their hands and knees and sniff out the teensy-tiniest little flower that grows only 2 " tall. These are the gardeners who read books loaded with botanical names , but who might not be able to remember them in conversation with a fellow plant maniac. But both gardeners seem to innately know that it is ok that neither can say the botanical name : in the silence they are simply appreciating the way a wispy pink tuft drapes itself across the furrowed blue leaf of its neighbor. These people may only correspond when there is a new plant to be sought out , an unidentified seedling to be identified , or a particularly lovely hue of periwinkle to be appreciated. They do n't mind a whit if they only see each other on these memorable gardening occasions and never in-between , for when these gardeners sniff , they are only inhaling the joy of gardening . </sniff.v.1315><sniff.v.1316> One More Day.

Diligent review of log files enabled us to detect the intrusions early. Quick response by security personnel contained the " damage " and permitted a short down time for the compromised systems. In all cases , we continue to monitor recently " hacked " machines and accounts for at least several weeks following an intrusion. This monitoring will often show other " hostile " sources that we can then either watch for or we can notify appropriate authorities.

But then they try OxyContin a few times , and quickly become so addicted they feel sick without it. Many eventually switch to sniffing heroin because it 's easier to get and costs as little as $ 4 a bag , compared with as much as $ 80 for a single OxyContin pill. The needles come next because eventually addicts build up a tolerance , and shooting heroin is the most effective way to get the drug into the system . </sniff.v.1325><sniff.v.1326>In Mexico City , 17-year-old Pedro recently left the Children 's Psychiatric Hospital after treatment for chronic inhalant abuse. He trembles continuously and can only walk with great difficulty. He has sniffed glue since he was six. Pedro 's damage , according to doctors Victor Velazquez and Veronica Maldonado , is permanent and irreversible and affects not only his motor skills but his cognitive ability.

However , if you read your email with Netscape , or you telnet or FTP to or from RCS , that session may be exposed. In addition , all the data sent is subject to be sniffed ( although with the current round of attacks , that data is ignored . ) </sniff.v.1331><sniff.v.1332>The sheriff 's canine unit has sniffed out illegal cargo numerous times the past two and a half years.

We were n't trigger happy but sometimes our dogs would sniff a Marine the same as a Jap. If some Marine souvenir hunter was out he might be sniffed and shot before he finished.

Thus , significant differential effects of context emerged when subjects judged the tastant sucrose and an odorant , either vanillin or orange , and it hardly mattered whether the odorant was delivered orthonasally ( sniffed ) or retronasally ( sipped ) . No evidence at all of differential context effects emerged when subjects judged the same olfactory stimulus , vanillin or orange , delivered retronasally and orthonasally. The simple relation between presence or absence of differential context effects and modality of stimulation ( effects being large when the modalities differed and small when the modalities were the same ) contrasts sharply with the judgements of qualitative similarity. Here , stimuli from different modalities ( sucrose and sniffed vanillin or orange ) could be judged as similar as stimuli from the same modality ( sniffed and sipped vanillin or orange ) . The upshot is that modality was a better predictor of differential context effects than was qualitative similarity. Nevertheless , perceived similarity per se may be a relevant , albeit second-order , factor . </sniff.v.1355><sniff.v.1356>Cryptorchid neuter dog , it is often socialized and took most head the skills and son parents sniffed it to find.

Crazed users robbed merchants , attacked police , raped women. This last notion is at least plausible , given that scientific studies have shown a statistical link between regular cocaine use ~ind episodes of violence and paranoia. There are two problems , however. One is that anti-social behaviour is most likely to result from the most drastic and toxic modes of administering cocaine ( i.e. smoking or injecting the drug rather than sniffing it ) . ( 29 ) Smoking cocaine was uncommon. ( 30 ) In the early twentieth century and few Blacks , criminal or otherwise , injected the drug. The second problem is that there is little concrete evidence of such crimes. Those who alleged a cocaine-inspired crime wave tended to be long on generalities and short on specifics . </sniff.v.1367><sniff.v.1368>For first-time introductions , hold the cat and the ferret and let them sniff each other a few times a day for a week or so.

When a puppy runs up and playfully jumps at your legs without fear , you can be sure they are a 'bold ' puppy. Bold puppies are engaging , playful , and social. Some puppies will only approach after others have sniffed you out to make sure you are okay. These puppies are generally more submissive followers in the pack. They will likely lie at your feet , or roll on their back , offering their stomach for your to pet. These are all gestures of submission in a litter or pack. Submissive puppies can be just as playful as bold puppies , however , they generally first interested in establishing a friendship. Other puppies will not approach you at all. Some may even scurry away from you or cry when you attempt to reach them. These are fearful puppies. Fearful puppies may require extensive exposure to new individuals before they are willing to interact.

Right now millions of these odor particles are floating in the air waiting to be sniffed by your nose ! Your nose is like a huge cave which is built to smell , moisten and filter the air you breathe. When you breathe in , tiny hairs in your nostrils called cilia filter everything that tries to enter your nose. The cilia sweeps out all the dirt from your nasal cavity. Then the air passes through a thick layer of mucous to the olfactory bulb. This is where the smells are recognized because each smell molecule fits into a nerve cell like a lock and key. Then the cells send signals to your brain where they are interpreted as good smells and bad smells . </sniff.v.1374><sniff.v.1375>" Men ! " She sniffed her nose in the air.

Crack is the street name for a form of cocaine introduced in the mid-1980s. Crack is smoked , rather then sniffed through the nose , or injected , which are all other ways to use cocaine. Users of the drug inhale the vapors that are given off when the crack is heated ( Berger pg.20 ) . Crack can not burn , and in order to give off the drugs vapors it must be heated to a very high temperature. After the crack has been heated the user will proceed to inhale the vapors. The drug will then pass from the lungs to the person ' s bloodstream and then reaches the brain , all within seconds.

If the presence of differential context effects requires that the stimuli be qualitatively dissimilar , then , on the basis of results of experiment 1 , we would predict these effects to be absent or small when subjects judge sucrose and vanillin or sucrose and orange , as both of these flavorants were judged fairly similar to sucrose. Indeed , sucrose was judged as similar to sniffed vanillin and sniffed orange as sipped vanillin was to sniffed vanillin and as sipped orange was to sniffed orange. If qualitative similarity is critical , then differential context effects should be near-identical for sucrose versus vanillin , sipped vanillin versus sniffed vanillin , and sipped orange versus sniffed orange. If , on the other hand , differential context effects require activation of different neural populations , then the effects should be evident with sucrose versus vanillin but not with sniffed versus sipped vanillin or orange . </sniff.v.1407><sniff.v.1408>The term narcotic , derived from the Greek word for stupor , originally referred to a variety of substances that induced sleep.

Narcotics can be administered in a variety of ways. Some are taken orally , transdermally ( skin patches ) or injected. They are also available in suppositories.

In this culture , the most common routes of administration are sniffing and smoking; and , controlling for other variables , smoking appears to be marginally riskierprobably increasing the incidence of bingeing , but not dramatically affecting whether current users decide to continue or cease taking the drug. Some people who use cocaine do become " dependent " on it , but many also , at some point , stop or reduce their use , often without obtaining drug treatment ( Cohen , 1989; Erickson et al. , 1987; Kandel et al. , 1985; Shaffer and Jones , 1989; Siegel , 1980; Waldorf et al. , 1991 ) . No route of administration makes it easier ( or harder ) for " addicts " to overcome their " addiction , " although there is evidence that crack smokers begin the process sooner ( Millman , 1991; Washton et al. , 1986 ) probably because their greater propensity to binge creates more of the problems that motivate drug users to change their behavior . </sniff.v.1440><sniff.v.1441>America long ago watched Lady Liberty replace her golden torch with a dance pole , the better to crotch grind the ignorant marks and empty their pockets with lurid distractions.

The pleasure users , as they were sometimes called , smoked opium , sniffed cocaine , injected morphine and cocaine in combination , or , after 1910 , sniffed or injected heroin. Non-medical addicts began much younger than their medical counterparts. The average age of addiction ( not first use , which would have been lower still ) for urban heroin addicts studied in the 1910s was only nineteen or twenty years. They were also more likely to be male than those whose addiction was of medical origin , and more likely to have been involved in crime . </sniff.v.1469><sniff.v.1470>if seen this morning.

Drinking frequency was a weaker , but still significant predictor. Whether pupils had sniffed volatile substances by age 13 seemed to predict future Class A drug use , but to a lesser extent that was not quite statistically significant. This analysis suggests that smoking status is as strong a predictor as cannabis use by age 13 , and both behaviours increase the odds of taking Class A drugs by over four times . </sniff.v.1477><sniff.v.1478>This review is from : The Cat Who Sniffed Glue ( Cat Who ... ) ( Paperback ) As I started this , the eighth book of this series I found that the author had decided to use a slightly different tact from that of her previous books.

The service dog then sniffed the bag of the student in front of her and the student grabbed a book and made a threatening gesture that he was going to hit the dog. There was no instructor in the room at the time so there was no one to lodge a complaint to. The woman picked up her things and then reported the problem to the university. The university does very little in actually accommodating the students , instead each student has to talk to individual professors to see what changes they are willing to make for a specific student. It is rather harsh that the university does not work with the professors to see that can be done for disabled students. Obviously much more would be done if it came down from management rather than a student that is asking for help . </sniff.v.1480><sniff.v.1481>It 's 0600 and 11-year-old Eric Omondi is waking up.

Walked into a dog pound out on some country road identified with only a number , and picked him out. Scrawny and unsocialized and shivery in the back of the cage , I crouched down there and he slowly came forward and sniffed my finger. Was probably wearing paint splattered cut offs with black Converse one stars , same shoes they found Kurt dead in when shot himself in the head a couple years later. Opened the chain link door on the big dog cage holding a little dog , and that was that. Was the kind of dog pound that did n't care I was a grad student without an address , did n't need to know I lived on the sly in an old metal building that was supposed to just be a painting studio.

First , they scanned the nasal airway of a mixed-breed cadaver with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. " We then had to make our model simulate how dogs sniff , " says Craven. But because that skill had also never been studied ( although it has been in humans and rats ) , the researchers outfitted seven dogs , including a Pomeranian and a Labrador retriever , with a special muzzle. The device measured their rate of sniffing as they smelled things such as spoonfuls of peanut butter and tuna. Despite the wide range of sizes and weights , " all the dogs sniffed at about the same frequency , five times per second , " says Craven. That 's the same rate at which they pant. But " we knew they were sniffing and not simply breathing , " says Craven , because high-speed videos showed " their nostrils flaring , which happens when they 're sniffing , not when they 're breathing. " The team also mapped the flow of air into the dogs ' noses as they sniffed , enabling them to calculate the nostrils ' aerodynamic reach . </sniff.v.1483><sniff.v.1484>Some sniffers strengthen the effect by sniffing from inside a plastic bag placed over the head.

Cocaine hydrochloride is a bitter tasting fine white crystalline powder. Crack cocaine is the base material left after cocaine hydrochloride has been chemically treated , separating the base material from the salt crystals , and looks like small crystal chips. It is sometimes referred to as freebase cocaine. Cocaine hydrochloride powder is usually snorted through the nose using a straw or rolled tube it can also be injected. However it does not dissolve well and is difficult and dangerous to inject. The more cocaine is administered at any one time , the more on edge the person can feel. Crack cocaine is not sniffed but is usually smoked or burned and the vapours inhaled . </sniff.v.1485><sniff.v.1486>There is something odd about the media ' s present absorption with the pulchritudinous Ms. Palin and her book tour. The media are exalting her even as they are disdaining her. The weird phenomenon puts me in mind of the way the media treated scandalous tales of President Bill Clinton ' s sex life. They covered the scandals in excruciating detail even as they sniffed that a politician ' s sex life ( sex extravaganza ) was beneath professional journalism ' s proper interest. Oh , and one other thing the journalists who unearthed these stories , stories that would appear over and again in Clinton ' s White House , were unworthy of being dignified with the designation journalist. </sniff.v.1486><sniff.v.1487>She was not alone.

Seeing that Esmerelda had received a treat and feeling left out , the bulldog heaved himself out from beneath the table and waddled up to Andrew. Pork was in no need of a midday snack , but Andrew was a fair-minded man. He took another biscuit , gave it to Pork , and watched as the bulldog bolted the morsel without bothering to chew. Disgusted , Esmerelda turned her head away from Pork with lofty disdain , one lip curling as the bulldog sniffed her muzzle. She was nearly as well bred as the dukes of Blackheath , and would not suffer the attentions of a common cur like Pork . </sniff.v.1487><sniff.v.1488>Cordelia sniffed in disdain , wrinkling her nose.

In addition there are glands that produce tears , saliva and milk. Sweat serves primarily to cool the body. However , the sweat of the underarms develops a strong smell when it ferments under bacterial action. Scientists have debated whether sweaty smell is supposed to be an attractant , a repellent , an indication of vigor , or serves other functions. The widespread use of antiperspirants and air conditioning has virtually eliminated this type of stimulus from our society. However , researchers at the University of California at Berkeley conducted an experiment where women sniffed a bottle containing androstadienone , a chemical found in male sweat that smells vaguely musky. Tests showed that the blood pressure , heart rate , breathing , and levels of cortisol in the women increased within 15 minutes of sniffing the chemical and remained elevated for more than an hour. The women also reported elevated mood and sexual arousal. Sebum and smegma are oily secretions that lubricate various parts of the body. They also have characteristic smells at close range to the body. The pubic area has a musky smell that may play a role in sexual stimulation . </sniff.v.1491><sniff.v.1492>Jaeger watched him saunter away , knowing he would change his appearance , then make his move on the barmaid.

It is hoped that one day killer diseases like AIDS and TB will also be detected in this way. Dogs have a sense of smell that is many times more acute than it is in humans. The ancient Chinese are believed to have been the first to become aware that dogs have the ability to detect illnesses in human beings. The results of the first scientific study of the ability of dogs to detect cancer were published in the British Medical Journal in September . </sniff.v.1506><sniff.v.1507>Armed only with their noses and a nine-point rating scale , the students sniffed and sipped their way to an enormous pile of data. ( It filled a metaphorical filing cabinet thirteen descriptors wide , twenty-one Cabernets tall , and thirteen judges deep. ) With a computer program , Noble and Heymann extracted a small number of sensory dimensions and placed each wine at a precise location on them. They could now visualize the smell and taste relationships between the samples. Their conclusions : " Younger vines and/or vines from cooler areas tend to produce more intensely vegetative wines. Conversely , wines from older vines and/or warmer areas tend to have higher ratings for berry aroma , fruit flavor by mouth , and vanilla aroma. " By quantifying wine aromas with a system of practical description , they discovered the vineyard conditions that produce them. Alexander Graham Bell would have been pleased . </sniff.v.1507><sniff.v.1508>Most likely , your dog was exposed to the herpes virus at a kennel , groomer , dog show or animal shelter - any place where large numbers of dogs gather at one time.

In the first , people sniffed before and after application of a topical anaesthetic. The piriform cortex was not activated when people sniffed with numb nostrils. Sobel et al. also scanned a woman with a severed left olfactory nerve. There was no piriform activation when she sniffed with her left nostril but there was significant activation when she sniffed through her right nostril. Thus , nerve conduction appears to be essential for the cortical activation to occur . </sniff.v.1509><sniff.v.1510>Wow , Compass is looking great now ! I feel so proud of him.

It seemed that she might run right between our legs , but 10 feet short of us she stopped and sat up on her haunches , squirrellike. She held her head high and raised her nose , showing the white blaze that all minks carry on their throats. Under the blaze we could plainly see her beating pulse. She peered , straining her poor eyes , and sniffed hard with her good nose. Finally , almost contemptuously she dropped down , turned around and went upstream. She did not go in alarm , but simply it seemed because she had decided on the evidence of her nose that there was no profit for her in coming toward us . </sniff.v.1513><sniff.v.1514>I had a farmer tell me once that a passerby came roaring up his driveway wailing about some wild animal having attacked a cow " and her guts are all over the place.

Dopamine is known to play a critical role in the brain 's response to reward as well as in its response to addictive drugs . </sniff.v.1533><sniff.v.1534>Inhaling cocaine vapor into the lungs delivers the drug more rapidly to the bloodstreamand therefore to the brainthan does sniffing the powder; as a consequence , it produces quicker , more intense effects. Most cocaine users do not want this more dramatic experienceespecially because it means , as well , a more rapid diminishing of the drug 's effects. Also reducing freebase 's attractiveness is the somewhat complicated conversion processwhich occasionally can be dangerous because some of the solvent used in the preparation may remain in the product being ignited. Nonetheless , freebasing did increase in popularity in the early 1980s ( Hamid , 1992; Inciardi , 1987; Siegel , 1984 ) , mainly attracting people who were already fairly heavy users of powder cocaine ( Siegel , 1984; Waldorf et al. , 1991; Washton et al. , 1986 ) . </sniff.v.1534><sniff.v.1535>There was no relationship between the type of drugs used at the age at which pupils first took drugs and their current age , apart from those who first took drugs at the youngest ages. Among those who first took drugs aged 11 years or younger , over 80 of pupils currently aged 11 , 12 or 13 reported that they had only sniffed volatile substances at this age and not taken any other drugs , whereas the equivalent proportion for pupils currently aged 14-15 was 65 . </sniff.v.1535><sniff.v.1536>" On the contrary , he was a dismal player ... depending totally on counting the cards.

It would be terrible to punish an inocent man . </sniff.v.1537><sniff.v.1538>Every day , an estimated 8 , 000 canines across the country put their lives on the line. Since they were first put into action in Belgium in 1899 , and later South Orange , N.J. , and New York City in 1907 , police dogs have sniffed out robbers , murderers , drug dealers and escaped convicts . </sniff.v.1538><sniff.v.1539>[ 217 ] The specific facts of this case are outlined in detail in the decision of the trial judge ( ( 2005 ) , 386 A.R. 48 , 2005 ABQB 608 , at paras. 2-30 ) , and I will not repeat them in their entirety here. For the purposes of these reasons , it is sufficient to note that the appellant was spotted by an undercover RCMP officer as he disembarked a Greyhound bus at the Calgary bus terminal. After the appellant and the officer locked eyes on several occasions , Kang-Brown was approached. The officer identified himself as a member of the RCMP and told Kang-Brown that he was free to leave at any time. When Kang-Brown refused to allow the officer to search his bag after a request to do so , a second officer approached with a dog trained to detect drugs. The dog sniffed the bag and signalled to his handler that drugs were present. Kang-Brown was subsequently arrested and the bag searched , revealing 17 ounces of cocaine. The appellant was also carrying a small mint container containing heroine , which he gave to the officers upon arrest . </sniff.v.1539><sniff.v.1540>" Peter is a boy. " Egon sniffed with disdain.

While we tend to be visually-oriented , dogs are smell-oriented. If dogs shared slide shows of their vacations , they would show scent slides of the deer poop they found in Georgia , the fox urine they sniffed in Michigan and the dead seal they rolled on in Alaska. Our dogs must be perplexed that we are so blind when it comes to the rich world of scent . </sniff.v.1541><sniff.v.1542>A : Cocaine is often sniffed or snorted through the nostrils and absorbed into the body through the respiratory tract. Sometimes cocaine is smoked or injected . </sniff.v.1542><sniff.v.1543>The toxicology of recreational solvent-sniffing at this writing remains very much where it was at the time of the 1964 Verhulst-Crotty summary. No one is prepared to say that occasional solvent sniffing is safe , and some studies suggest that frequent sniffing may be moderately harmful. Later in the decade , it was widely observed that young people paid little or no attention to dire warnings against the hazards of marijuana smoking , LSD-using , and other forms of drug use. It seems highly likely , in retrospect , that the exaggerated warnings against glue-sniffing were among the factors desensitizing some young people to drug warnings in general. Most teenagers knew of others in their own neighborhoods who had sniffed glue repeatedly , and who did not drop dead or go to the hospital with brain damage , kidney damage , or liver damage. Children may be ignorant , but they are not stupid. When the evidence of their own experience contradicts adult propaganda , they ( like sensible adults ) rely on their own experience and tend to distrust in the future a source of information which they had found unreliable in the past . </sniff.v.1543><sniff.v.1544>The famous 1970s American cartoon " Chain of Command " showed a huge hand of Uncle Sam waving dollar bills in front of three men , kneeling , one behind the other. The first man is a fat general kissing the money , his backside being sniffed by a more attractive military man , whose backside is , in turn , being sniffed by a mortar-boarded academic.

The dogs are used in much of Britain , including on some trains , but Commander Paddick 's actions show that some police officers have their doubts. Many jurisdictions in America consider that police dogs sniffing people is a search. Lower court case law in that country indicates that a police dog sniffing a person is generally considered to be a search. This is where people 's rights are being eroded . </sniff.v.1551><sniff.v.1552>Footnote 4 Although the court below relied on a number of cases holding that the use of trained dogs to sniff out contraband does not constitute a search , see , e. g. , United States v.

S.App.D.C. 206 , 498 F.2d 748 ( 1974 ) , those cases involved the sniffing of inanimate and unattended objects rather than persons.

Jafek and others theorized that the force of the Zicam gel pump could deliver toxic doses of zinc and damage sensitive nose tissues. Some patients probably sniffed the zinc after applying the gel in their nose. That , in turn , triggered loss of smell . </sniff.v.1554><sniff.v.1555>In addition to good intervention programmes , information on the various facets of cocaine should be presented openly and clearly , and related to the different risk groups. We have to note , however , that it will not be easy to draw up an effective prevention policy which will embrace the different ways in which cocaine is used or its diverse effects. One individual may sniff for years without any problem. Another who is basing will often ( and very quickly ) have dependency problems and may be involved in criminality. It is vitally important that this difference between categories of users is emphasized and clearly understood. An additional risk factor for those who are injecting is the link with Aids. Not only are dirty syringes a risk , but also unsafe sex . </sniff.v.1555><sniff.v.1556>Quake Wars will be the first of these we ' ll be getting stuck into later this year.

The ethernet standard allows ( requires ) that the network interface be able to listen to all traffic on the wire. This is known as promiscuous mode. For a unix system , you generally have to be the superuser ( root ) to access this; for PCs , you just need to install the correct software. While it is possible to monitor all traffic , the sniffers we have seen recently just record the start of each new telnet , pop , and ftp connection , and just record the first hundred or so printable characters. Since these protocols do their authentication at the start of the session , they get the userids and passwords and little else. In fact , they just seem to record the traffic from the originating host , they do n't bother to record the response from the destination . </sniff.v.1557><sniff.v.1558>But never mind ! Since all Muslims must prefer the bliss of heaven to what they are likely to gain in this world by being sniffed at by the najis dogs , they would not press them into their service.

Suppose that , following my analysis above , the Court were to say that the use of dogs to sniff people , rather than cars , does constitute a search or seizure , and therefore can not occur in the absence of some reason to suspect that the particular person sniffed is in possession of drugs. Could the Court then distinguish the case of dogs sniffing for explosives or weapons rather than drugs ? From the perspective of the " sniffee , " after all , the procedures are identical . </sniff.v.1561><sniff.v.1562>The animal can romp to its hearts ' delight in the fields , on the riverbanks , and in the water.

A small handful of non-Anglophone novelists do steal their way into stateside dinner-party conversation each year , but for the most part , we do n't care much about what 's written outside of the U.S. and Britain -- or South Africa if we 're feeling worldly. Our own novels are arguably poorer for our failure to engage. But Engdahl made it hard to endorse his criticisms too warmly : He was n't advocating cosmopolitanism , he was vying for the crown. " You ca n't get away from the fact that Europe still is the center of the literary world . . . not the United States , " he sniffed in an interview with the Associated Press , as if anyone had mentioned centers . </sniff.v.1564><sniff.v.1565>One side effect of the anti-glue-sniffing campaign , which continued throughout the 1960s , calls for special mention. The campaign produced subtle changes in the relations of parents and teachers to children. A child was now a suspect to be spied upon lest he secretly be sniffing glue. Health departments and other authoritative agencies encouraged this espionage , and listed the symptoms adults should be on the alert for : " Parents suspecting or told that their children have deliberately sniffed glue should take them to a doctor without delay . </sniff.v.1565><sniff.v.1566>'Others profited from the intermission by vomiting wildly , their eyes bulging out of their heads; their neighbours encouraged them with an imperturbable seriousness.

Cocaine is a white powder refined from a cocoa plant found in South America. Usually cocaine is put on a smooth surface like that of glass and cut up with a razor blade , and then sniffed through the nose using some sort of straw causing it to be easily absorbed through the lining of the nose. Eventually , this use ruptures holes in the nasal septum. When cocaine is smoked , by mixing it with sodium hydroxide and some other poisons , it is called crack . Although sniffed cocaine will usually wear off in about and hour , intensely concentrated crack smoke absorbed through the lungs slams into the brain in less than ten seconds and wears off in a few minutes - demanding repetition and enslavement to the addiction . </sniff.v.1569><sniff.v.1570> Crazy Heart was called up from the studio minor leagues this Oscar season when Fox Searchlight couldn ' t find much in their year to push for awards. They sniffed out gold in Jeff Bridges ' s portrayal of a boozy , greasy , at-the-end-of-his-rope country singer , hurrying Crazy Heart into release to roll around in the assured accolades. And Bridges is exceptional here; it ' s the movie itself that ' s less urgent and awkwardly defined , throttling Bridges ' s impressively discombobulated performance , leaving one to wonder why there ' s even a plot to Crazy Heart in the first place . </sniff.v.1570><sniff.v.1571>When a see-it-all-in-a-glance tourist flitted through the priceless art treasures of the Louvre in Paris , she swept her critical eye over some of the world 's greatest paintings.

Why this is so I can ' t say for sure , although I ' ve suggested that TV is predisposed to believe that all our problems are intimate and that most of our monsters live at home , under the bed , instead of outside in politics or history or collateralized-debt obligations and the subprime-mortgage mess.

That was the title of Richard Usborne 's book , published in the same year as Casino Royale , about the novels of John Buchan , Dornford Yates , and " Sapper , " and those earlier heroes would not , Bergonzi sniffed , have tolerated club servants talking like something out of a New Yorker ad ( " If I may suggest , Sir , the Dom Perignon '46 " ) . Fleming responded genially to the Guardian with " a squeak from the butterfly before any more big wheels roll down on it , " but he was dismayed by a more ferocious assault , from Paul Johnson in the New Statesman.

Inhalants are " sniffed " from an open container or " huffed " from a rag soaked in the substance and held to the face. They include a diverse group of chemicals that are found in consumer products such as aerosols , plastic cement , nail polish remover , lighter fluid , hair spray , insecticides , and cleaning solvents. Their easy accessibility , low cost , and ease of concealment make inhalants , for many , one of the first substances abused. While not regulated under the CSA , a few states place restrictions on the sale of these products to minors. Studies have shown that between 5 and 15 percent of young people in the United States have tried inhalants , although the vast majority of these youngsters do not become chronic abusers . </sniff.v.1599><sniff.v.1600>Phoenix received the next half a dozen or so pieces of kibble for variously sniffing and noseprodding the bunch of keys.

Derived from the leaves of the coca bush ( Erythroxylum coca ) , which grows in Bolivia and Peru , powder cocaine is sniffed , injected , or converted into smokeable forms of the drug , called crack and freebase. The introduction of crack , which triggers an intense , brief high , caused cocaine use ( and related problems ) to surge during the 1980 's and '90s . </sniff.v.1604><sniff.v.1605>" 'This human has a curse on him , ' he said.

Sniffing plain air resulted in activation in expected subcortical areas and in the piriform cortex at the base of the temporal lobe. This is the same cortical area activated in many different animals that have been studied using electrophysiological recordings. Furthermore , the left piriform cortex was more strongly activated than the right piriform . </sniff.v.1607><sniff.v.1608>My name is John. I was in world of trouble and couldnt pull myself out of it. I had been on drugs for most of my adult life , including starting marijuana use at 9 years old , and then on to cocaine , downers , pain pills , ice , and heroin. I was so desperate that I even sniffed gasoline ! I had been in four different programs ranging from 7 days to 9 months over 20 years , including residential and outpatient. They were mostly covered by insurance and welfare through food stamps and stipends. I also spent one year in jail . </sniff.v.1608><sniff.v.1609> Six-year-old Sonia Rao went missing on August 14 last year while on her way home from school in Raipur.She was later found in Nagpur , where she had been sold by child-lifters within hours of her abduction. But it wasnt the police who sniffed her out. Sonias mother , Sharda Rao , led a crowd from her colony to the Collectorate and police station for two days to mount pressure on the administration. I was shattered but knew that if I didnt act quickly chances of seeing my daughter again were slim. The pressure tactics worked , teams went out and Sonia was traced to an orphanage in Nagpur where she had been kept by the Maharashtra Police. Three persons were arrested on charges of involvement in trafficking. Its another matter that the Chhattisgarh Police learnt of Sonias return almost six days later . </sniff.v.1609><sniff.v.1610>Truffles are a rare type of edible mushroom , or fungus that develops underground in relation to and dependent on the root of a tree.

Snorting Cocaine powder through the nose allows the Drug to enter the bloodstream through the nasal tissues. The use of a needle releases the Drug straight into the bloodstream , while smoking sends Cocaine vapors into the bloodstream through the lungs. Injecting and smoking quickly intensifies the effects of Cocaine because it makes contact with the bloodstream faster than other methods of use . </sniff.v.1613><sniff.v.1614>A new study shows that the Tyrannosaurus rex used its nose to sniff out meals at night and track them down !

Amyl nitrite is a drug used medically to open up the blood vessels to increase blood flow to the heart. It also causes blood to rush to the brain , speeds up the heartbeat and relaxes certain muscles. As a party drug , it comes in a liquid form that can be sniffed as a vapour. There are no documented interactions between poppers and anti-HIV medications. However , sniffing poppers after taking drugs used for sexual dysfunction such as sidenafil , ( Viagra ) , tadalafil ( Cialis ) or vardenafil ( Levitra ) can be very dangerous if one is also taking a protease inhibitor as part of HIV combination therapy. This can lead to heart problems including potential heart attack . </sniff.v.1616><sniff.v.1617>The literary editor of the London Sunday Times , Erica Wagner , sniffed that while she could concede that I was a " good writer " and sometimes " interesting " ( damned with the faintest of praise ! ) , she also wondered what the point of my close attention to Plath might be , and " when the eternal raking over of Plath 's life will pall , " suggesting finally that it was about time to leave poor Sylvia and her descendants in peace. Wagner deemed my novel about Plath " trivial " and " reductive , " and insinuated that I was perhaps a bit nuts for writing " Wintering.

Heroin is usually injected , sniffed/snorted , or smoked. Typically , a heroin abuser may inject up to four times a day. Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while intramuscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes. Although smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a " rush " as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection , NIDA researchers have confirmed that all three forms of heroin administration are addictive . </sniff.v.1619><sniff.v.1620>As expected , Klaus grabbed him by the shirt front and growled at him like a feral wolf.

Sometimes the package contents are none too innocent. Most of the large delivery services and air lines , as well as the Post Office , train their employees in recognizing possible drug packages. Police officers can , and should , respond positively to invitations from common carriers to subject packages to sniffs. United States v. Riley. Police responding to a call from Northwest Airlines about a suspicious package deployed a drug detection dog in a room with fifteen to twenty other packages. As the dog sniffed through the packages , he immediately tore open the suspect package upon sniffing it. White powder , which field-tested positive for cocaine , spilled out. Based on this information , the officers obtained a warrant and executed a controlled delivery. After his conviction , the defendant argued that the dog 's act of tearing open the package and exposing its contents was a search. The court disagreed. Quoting the Tenth Circuit 's decision in United States v. Stone , the court noted that " the dog 's instinctive actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment. " United States v. Lyons . </sniff.v.1622><sniff.v.1623>A Dead Rat in the Ceiling This house smelled terrible , this room in particular. There was no attic ( flat roof ) and no crawl space , so I knew the dead animal was in the wall or ceiling.

Amazingly , I had cut in the one exact small spot where the rat was - a nearly impossible to find place - and , as always , the first and only hole I had to cut in the home . </sniff.v.1623><sniff.v.1624>Passenger aircraft departing required special procedures. Aircraft holding areas were secured using methods similar to safeguarding nuclear weapons. A restricted area was set up around the aircraft using a portable rope barricade. An entry control point ( ECP ) was designated and manned by a drug dog team. Usually this would be one of the special vehicles used to transport dog teams. All equipment , supplies , and vehicles entering were searched by a drug detector dog. Even fire extinguishers were checked. A portable screen ( below ) was pulled to the ECP at the aircraft holding area. All personnel had to stand at the screen while being sniffed be a a drug detector dog. This included the aircrew. This cordon was maintained until the aircraft taxied for takeoff . </sniff.v.1624><sniff.v.1625>Upon taking control of Congress in 2007 the Democrats found themselves running simpatico with those terminally elite nations who sniffed with disdain at American individualism while being strangled by the tentacles of their own statism. Emboldened by these openly chummy alliances , and sensing a GOP in the mood to slit its own wrists and die , the Democrats looked across the breakfast table at Hillary Clinton in her sensible clothes and felt a little disappointed. There she sat a hard worker , smart , always willing to do what it took to win.

As prevalence of taking cannabis increased with age , so did repeat use from less than 1 of 11 year olds to as many as 16 of 15 year olds. Consequently there were relatively few 15 year olds ( 5 ) who had taken cannabis , but not in the preceding year. These young people who appeared not to have continued to take cannabis were a minority of those who had first taken cannabis at an early age. In contrast , sniffing volatile substances was much more likely to have been 'left behind ' , with 12 of 15 year olds reporting they had tried sniffing , but not within the last year compared with only 3 who were repeat users . </sniff.v.1630><sniff.v.1631>Kaybar then searched the inside of the car , cramming his frame under the steering column and poking his nose in the door pockets.

In fact , sniffing/snorting heroin is now a widely reported means of taking heroin among users admitted for drug treatment in Newark , Chicago , New York , and Detroit. With the shift in heroin abuse patterns comes an even more diverse group of users. Older users ( over 30 ) continue to be one of the largest user groups in most national data.

If this money is going to be stored before the dog sniff , it should be isolated from other money , drugs and clothing if possible. Some agencies employ the use of vapor-barrier bags to seal the money. Other agencies have special locations that can temporarily house this money , which is isolated from other items.

The researchers divided 36 subjects into three groups - heterosexual men , heterosexual women and homosexual men. They studied the brain 's response to sniffing the chemicals , using PET scans. All the subjects were healthy , unmedicated , right-handed and HIV negative.

When heroin is sniffed or smoked , the peak effects of the drug are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes.10 In addition to a feeling of euphoria , the short-term effects of heroin also include a warm flushing of the skin , a dry mouth , and heavy extremities. After the initial euphoric feeling , the user experiences an alternately wakeful and drowsy state , often feeling drowsy for several hours.

' s backpack after the bag was sniffed by a police dog trained in drug identification. The search took place at St. Patrick ' s High School , where A.M. was a student. The central issue raised by this appeal is whether the dog sniff constituted a reasonable search under s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and , if not , whether the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24 ( 2 ) . </sniff.v.1743><sniff.v.1744>Heroin is most commonly injected or smoked.

When cocaine is sniffed , the onset of the effect is slower because the drug must pass through the nasal mucosa before entering the bloodstream. Swallowing cocaine delays delivery to the brain even more because most of the drug is passed through the gastrointestinal tract before it crosses through cell membranes into the bloodstream . </sniff.v.1816><sniff.v.1817>Heroin can be sniffed , smoked or injected. Mexican black tar heroin , however , is usually injected ( once dissolved ) or smoked because of its consistency. Like other opiates , heroin is a sedative drug that slows body functioning. users describe a feeling of warmth , relaxation and detachment , with a lessening sense of anxiety. Initial use can result in nausea and vomiting , but these reactions fade with regular use . </sniff.v.1817><sniff.v.1818>Examples of products kids abuse to get high include model airplane glue , nail polish remover , cleaning fluids , hair spray , gasoline , the propellant in aerosol whipped cream , spray paint , fabric protector , air conditioner fluid ( freon ) , cooking spray and correction fluid.

Wal-Mart co-founder Sam Walton once said that he wanted to be his own competitor , a wish now being borne out by the company s current plans to place a Wal-Mart every 10-20 miles , and to open more than 200 Supercenters in 2003 alone. In other words , Wal-Mart wants to take its already huge empire and make it the only game in town , a strategy that offends not just moderate-minded Stoughtonites. When Wal-Mart recently announced that it plans to open THREE Supercenters in my hometown of Columbia , Missouri ( population 80 , 000 ) , even my normally taciturn mother rebelled. Everyone should have a place at the table ,  she sniffed , noting that the local grocery chain had already gone out of business. But Wal-Mart s taking up the whole thing.  </sniff.v.1822><sniff.v.1823>Language is what distinguishes us from the beasts , so make the most of it. I once stood transfixed in the park while a woman called her dog. In the time it took to call him seventeen times ( yes , after the first five I started counting ) the dog had a bit of a run , sniffed various parts of the landscape and had the occasional squirt at the interesting bits. Then despite ( not because of ) her calling , he frolicked back in her direction. She had given him a good training session in ignoring her , ensuring that each time he did so , he was rewarded by one of his favorite activities. In fact it was the highlight of his day. He is very pleased with her. He hopes to get her up to twenty by the end of the week . </sniff.v.1823><sniff.v.1824>  The initial diligence carried out with first sniffer dog , after having sniffed the towel used in the previous operation , began searching and showing interest in some doors leading to other apartments. He did not show any interest or even approach other apartments. In none of these actions did the dog give the signal to his trainer , Soldado Fernandes. It is certain however , that the dog signalled next to apartments 5J , 5H , and 4G. He showed great interest in sniffing these doors and the immediate areas. Next to door 5H there were two bags of rubbish and the odour may have distracted the dog. Outside 4G was a tray of plates , cutlery and cloth napkins that had apparently been used. This apartment is where the parents of the missing child were staying ( at the time ) .

An oddball English couple throw themselves to the wolves , literally , in Animal Planet 's documentary series Living With the Wolfman. Former teaching assistant Helen finds herself tending a pack of wolves at an animal park with her husband , Shaun , who has licked and sniffed his way into the wolf pack 's trust. The series opens with Helen preparing to establish herself in the wolves ' environs by eating what they eat : meat. Not just steak or bacon or sausage , although that helps. To ensure her ranking order , Helen must have organ meat on her breath. Kidneys , liver , heart. Apparently , wolves ' sense of smell is 100 , 000 times more sensitive than humans , so she wo n't be fooling anyone by sneaking a piece of lemon drizzle cake. Worse , to become a surrogate nanny , she has to regurgitate food into the mouth of the pack 's pregnant Alpha Female. Despite the gross-outs , Living With the Wolfman is not some Wild Kingdom affair littered with mauled zebras.

They are taken orally , sniffed , smoked , and injected. Smoking , snorting , or injecting stimulants produce a sudden sensation known as a rush  or a flash.  Abuse is often associated with a pattern of binge use sporadically consuming large doses of stimulants over a short period of time. Heavy users may inject themselves every few hours , continuing until they have depleted their drug supply or reached a point of delirium , psychosis , and physical exhaustion. During this period of heavy use , all other interests become secondary to recreating the initial euphoric rush. Tolerance can develop rapidly , and both physical and psychological dependence occur. Abrupt cessation , even after a brief two- or three-day binge , is commonly followed by depression , anxiety , drug craving , and extreme fatigue known as a crash.  </sniff.v.1854><sniff.v.1855>" That may satisfy your rather ... common palate , " she sniffed in disdain , " but my aristocratic upbringing would never suffer me to settle for such plebian tastes.

Once a 14 year old student wrote to me asking for help with a science fair project. She wanted to test the ability of fellow students to detect and discriminate odors. I suggested that she explore the effects of demand characteristics by having people sit down in front of a table with fragrant objects like fruit and perfume bottles , then ( after they put on a blindfold ) asking them to identify completely different things that were not on the table.

When volunteers wearing special masks sniffed in the absence of any odor , brain images showed that an area called the piriform cortex was most active. But when the volunteers actually detected a smell , other areas in the frontal lobe were most active. The images showed some overlap between the brain areas activated. This , said Gabrieli , suggests that the sniff response primes the brain to receive the smell signal . </sniff.v.1863><sniff.v.1864>That means that there is a value to educating our noses - it can , literally , change how we experience the world. Gottfried found that when subjects were exposed to the smell of mint , they became experts in identifying and distinguishing different types of mints , such as spearmint , wintergreen , or peppermint. In another study , when people sniffed two different chemicals that humans perceive as smelling identical , but one chemical was accompanied by mild electric shocks , they learned to tell the difference between the two. In both cases , their sensory landscape was suddenly richer.

Vanbrugh shared the enthusiasm of the day for classical work , as understood and developed , whether well or ill , by the Italians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; but with characteristic disregard of law , he thought to combine classical severity with the fancifulness natural in a northerner and a playwright. Thus , while the general scheme of the south front , for instance , is distinctly severe , the massive towers at its ends are surmounted by fantastic masses of open stone-work , most quaintly finished off with arrangements of cannon-balls and coronets. Throughout he repeatedly made use of classical members with strange disregard to their structural intention. Silvester , the French artist employed to make designs for the decoration of the salon , sniffed contemptuously at Vanbrugh 's Gothic tendencies. " I can not approve of that double line of niches.

Courts have said that police can search a car without a warrant in the school parking lot , because there was probable cause to believe they would find evidence of a crime. In that case , the school first allowed police officers to bring dogs in to sniff lockers for drugs. Next , the dogs sniffed in the parking lot , and alerted the officers to a specific car. Police officers opened and searched the vehicle and found drug paraphernalia inside.

Originally , they were pursued with pigs , lumbering beasts that sniffed them out and tried to eat their find before the farmer could yank them away. It 's part of the romanticism of the black truffle that pigs are perfect hunters , but in truth they got the job because they were the primary farm animal attracted to the dark smells. Says Michaels , " A 300-pound pig will go through an orchard like a rototiller , digging up everything. Truffle pigs are out of control , and they go home when they decide they want to go home. " Later came dogs , perhaps not as quixotic , but dogs had virtues. At about thirty pounds ( the weight of a Lagotto Romagnolo ) , they were easy to pick up and heave into the back of a wagon , and they were less interested in eating than in the tongue-wagging joy of the hunt.

Most classes of drugs are used through several alternative methods. For example , marijuana may be smoked or swallowed. Methamphetamine may be smoked , swallowed , sniffed , or injected.

It all happened so quickly that only after the fact we could find the calm to reconstruct what had happened . </sniff.v.1955><sniff.v.1956>Based on this information , Small met the train when it arrived in Albuquerque later in the afternoon , accompanied by Albuquerque Police Detective Pat Castillo ( " Castillo " ) . The attendant for defendant 's sleeping car confirmed that a man fitting Kennedy 's description had boarded the train in Flagstaff with a large suitcase stored in the sleeping car 's common luggage area. The attendant identified a large gray American Tourister suitcase in the luggage area as Kennedy 's bag. Small sniffed the bag. He noticed that the suitcase had a strong lemon scent that he believed to be consistent with deodorants or other substances used to mask the smell of narcotics. Castillo confirmed this observation . </sniff.v.1956><sniff.v.1957>Whilst glue-sniffing is not generally regarded as physically addictive compared to illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin , it can be psychologically addictive and certainly carries severe physical dangers : ' Sudden sniffing death ' is unique to VSA. This is a catastrophic and very sudden heart failure resulting in immediate death and frequently occurs in people who have never sniffed a volatile substance before . </sniff.v.1957><sniff.v.1958>I sniffed Ambien Drug which was Scotch , and used some of it.We 'll look at Ambien Drug Interactions first.I saw a boy at Ambien Fast said Rollo , when I came along . </sniff.v.1958><sniff.v.1959>Baudelaire was fascinated with Swedenborgianism because it seemed to blend the philosopher 's rigorous skepticism toward received notions and modes of perception with the artist 's unique ability to find the perfect symbol to express his own unique notions and perceptions. A perfect and complete vision of the Ideal is not Baudelaire 's idea of truth , however; nor is its inverse , the ability to portray the material world with perfect realism : " I find it pointless to represent that which is , " he sniffed , " because that which is does not satisfy me. " For Baudelaire , truth is always a combination of the Ideal and the material , the eternal and the transient truth is , in other words , always symbolic. The Baudelairean symbol is no longer a signpost pointing to the Truth; it is truth itself . </sniff.v.1959><sniff.v.1960>" Really , Diana , you should know better. " Catherine sniffed in disdain.

Narcotics are administered in a variety of ways. Some are taken orally , transdermally ( skin patches ) , intranasally , or injected. They are also available in suppositories , and more recently in " troches , " a form of narcotics that can be sucked like candy. As drugs of abuse , they are often smoked , sniffed , or injected. Drug effects depend heavily on the dose , route of administration , and previous exposure to the drug. Aside from their medical use , narcotics produce a general sense of well-being by reducing tension , anxiety , and aggression. These effects are helpful in a therapeutic setting but contribute to their abuse . </sniff.v.1961><sniff.v.1962>" When the dog came in it sniffed around and seemed to be more in control than its handler.

Under Bergeron ' s predecessor , Michel Doyon , it showed that Tremblay ' s former No. 1 political aide had approved the sale of city property to insiders at absurdly low prices after he became head of the SHDM housing body. It also revealed that the city ' s computerized procurement system is vulnerable to rip-offs by hundreds of city workers . </sniff.v.1966><sniff.v.1967>The first dog is a white poodle. The first time they met , the poodle tried to lick Boysie 's boy bit - something he was n't happy with and he growled at him. From that day whenever he sees this dog he barks at it. Unfortunately the owner makes a habit of walking straight at us with her dog offlead who then runs up to us , and Boysie will bark and lunge at him. The woman seems to find this amusing , and even though asked if we could mutually avoid , she always seems intent on following us. A couple of weeks ago we were over a bridge to her , and Boysie ran back over it when he saw her dog. He went up to it , sniffed , and when it walked off he barked at it and came back </sniff.v.1967><sniff.v.1968>Responding to question from Mr. Huxley , Ms. Menard advised she has lived on Rocky Harbour Crescent since July 2002. She confirmed that her written statement concerning the dog biting incident ( which she had provided to the By-law Officer ) was contained at Tab 3 in the Book of Documents. At Mr. Huxley ' s request , Ms. Menard then related to the Tribunal , what had happened on 2 March 2003. She said she had taken her dog for a walk along Rocky Harbour Crescent and advised that initially , she had contemplated taking her young daughter with her , but in hindsight , given what had happened , she was very thankful she had not. Approximately three-quarters of the way around the crescent , a huge St. Bernard ( not on a leash ) ran out of a yard. Ms. Menard and her dog Sandy , who was on a leash , were on the opposite side of the street. The St. Bernard sniffed her dog and then jumped on her and attacked her on the neck . </sniff.v.1968><sniff.v.1969>More importantly , questions arise as to the transmission of knowledge. How do lay devotees learn how to pray ? What offerings should be offered ? When should they pray ? There appears to be a missing link between the ecclesiastical institutions and the home , and most academic works fail to address this area. While such people are not recognized as members of the ecclesiastical institutions ( most of those interviewed do not join as committee members or play an active role in temple affairs; my main interviewer even sniffed in disdain at the notion that being part of the temple committee would aid her business ) , they nevertheless are transmitters of religious knowledge as well as practitioners of Chinese religion , and it is hoped that this paper will shed some light on the transmission of knowledge of worship practices of Chinese worshippers in Malacca through an interview of a shopkeeper , Madam Lee [ 6 ] , who sells religious paraphernalia in the old Chinatown of Malacca and situate this group of people , who stand as a bridge between ecclesiastical institutions and private home devotions , within the framework of Chinese religion . </sniff.v.1969><sniff.v.1970>Anthony also understands that , if hes to make a go of this , hell face stiff resistance from Dubais established promoters many of whom , as he put it , view him with disdain.

Typically , a heroin abuser may inject up to four times a day. Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while intramuscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are usually felt within10 to 15 minutes. Although smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a " rush " as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection , researchers have confirmed that all three forms of heroin administration are addictive . </sniff.v.1975><sniff.v.1976>grass and i said that basically ruined Can be just SOOO anxious it can cause severe hearing Welcome sniff vicodin then. knockoff designer stuff is addicted to in Medical School : Face-eating Tumor !

Classical conditioning is your friend. You just have to work her up to it. There are some good videos on YouTube about desensitisation , but basically you just need to pop her treats when she 's near the tie out. It 's best if you start far enough away from it that she 's not showing any overt signs of stress. Feed her a tiny bit at a time until she looks more relaxed , then take another step or two closer to the tie out. Repeat until you 're next to the tie out , then when she 's comfy with that , reach for it , or reward her for sniffing it or looking at it , and hold it , put it near her but not on her ... you get the idea. It does n't usually take very long. Depends on how strong she feels about the tie out . </sniff.v.1977><sniff.v.1978>Some of the young people experimenting assume the drugs are safe because they are legal. But then they try OxyContin a few times , and quickly become so addicted they feel sick without it.

They did so with a vehemence that suggested I had hit a sore spot. " Stereotypical " sniffed another recent reader , but since all stereotypes have at least some basis in reality , the issue is n't whether the comment is stereotypical ( any generalization , no matter how valid , can be blown off as a stereotype ) , but whether it 's valid. Mindless opposition to authority ? I submit the " under God " issue : court challenges to the phrase " under God " in the Pledge of Allegiance.

This is especially common from the abuse of fluorocarbons and butane-type gases. High concentrations of inhalants also can cause death from suffocation by displacing oxygen in the lungs and then in the central nervous system so that breathing ceases. Other irreversible effects caused by inhaling specific solvents are hearing loss , limb spasms , central nervous system or brain damage. Serious but potentially reversible effects include liver and kidney damage and blood oxygen depletion. Death from inhalants usually is caused by a very high concentration of fumes. Deliberately inhaling from an attached paper or plastic bag or in a closed area greatly increases the chances of suffocation . </sniff.v.2001><sniff.v.2002>Regis Philbin sniffed Kim Kardashian on Live With Regis and Kelly Photos Pictures Images Video Regis Philbin , 78 , got the chance of his life time.

However , the tradeoffs may leave those seeking protection at a disadvantage. While , it is very likely that terrorists are using the internet to communicate and retrieve critical information , it is very unlikely that the government will be able to locate and process this information efficiently enough to provide any manner of increased protection. This is where software companies enter the picture. Software companies have the access and ability to gather large amounts of information from any machine that runs their software. Any information that is passed through an internet router has the potential to be sniffed for evidence of terrorist activity. However , the extent of information gathering extends much further than trying to intercept information. Government agencies actively pursue information though hacking and tunneling into foreign systems. International software companies are a in a position to make this effortless for the government by providing hidden access though their software. These issues raise a considerable number of ethical questions . </sniff.v.2005><sniff.v.2006>Adderall sniffed , its royal feeding to ensure prescribed on all the 1960s in morbidity , implemented not to question subtropical on the best malkins.

Youths reported several advantages of injecting ketamine over sniffing the drug : some found that sniffing aggravated their nasal passages and that injecting produced a cleaner high; others who developed a tolerance to ketamine from sniffing found that injecting was a more potent and reliable mode of administering the drug. It is noteworthy that 20 ( or five youth ) had never sniffed ketamine a more common mode of administering the drug and had only injected ketamine. In fact , these five youth had all initiated their injection drug use career with either heroin or cocaine prior to their first time injecting ketamine. Additionally , all five injected ketamine intravenously during their last ketamine injection event. This finding indicates that a user ' s preferred mode of administering certain drugs , like heroin or cocaine , is often transferred to administering a new drug , such as ketamine . </sniff.v.2011><sniff.v.2012>In any event , while Pinette was lying on the floor , the dog stepped on him three times -- once near the crotch of his pants.

Probably contributing to cocaine 's appeal was the government 's success , first , in curtailing diverted medicinal amphetamine ( Brecher , 1972; Inciardi , 1987; Morgan and Kagan , 1978 ) and , second , in interdicting enough marijuana substantially to decrease its availability and increase its price ( Cowan , 1986; Hamid , 1992; Lazare , 1990 ) . As the demand for cocaine increased , supplies increased as well , [ 3 ] and by 1982 , approximately 28 of eighteen-to twenty-five-year-olds had at least tried it ( NIDA , 1991a ) . However , because of cocaine 's relatively high priceup to $ 100 for a gram of powder in the early 1980suse was most prevalent among the middle and upper classes ( Grinspoon and Bakalar , 1985 ) . The typical mode of ingestion was to sniff cocaine hydrochloride powder into the nose , which permits absorption through the nasal mucosa . </sniff.v.2035><sniff.v.2036>China white , or fentanyl , is a synthetic form of heroin that is drastically more potent.

The Verhulst-Crotty bulletin tracked down these reports and found a total of nine alleged glue-sniffing deaths each one reported many times. Six of the nine were not due to glue fumes but to asphyxiation , which occurred when the victim 's head was covered by an airtight plastic bag. A seventh death was probably also a plastic-bag case. In an eighth case there was no evidence whatever that the victim had been sniffing glue before his death , and no toluene was found at autopsy. The last case was probably not due to glue-sniffing; the victim had been ill and bad sniffed gasoline. Thus among tens of thousands of glue-sniffers prior to 1964 , no death due unequivocally to glue vapor had as yet been reported. The lifesaving advice children needed was not to sniff glue with their heads in plastic bags . </sniff.v.2043><sniff.v.2044>Cocaine revolutionized eye , nose and mouth surgery.

As early as 1865 professional singers , at the suggestion of Paris laryngologist Charles Fauvell , began sipping Vin Mariani during rehearsals and recitals to ease the pain of sore throats. Singers sometimes sniffed cocaine to shrink nasal mucous membranes and drain sinuses , better enabling them to resonate their voices through their facial cavities.

Mr. Bristo then indicated to the police that they should search the gymnasium , where a number of student school bags were lined up against a wall. The police dog , Chief , sniffed the bags and indicated the presence of drugs in one of them.

Perhaps the most significant toxic effect of chronic exposure to inhalants is widespread and long-lasting damage to the brain and other parts of the nervous system.26 The intoxication produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes; therefore , users often try to extend the " high " by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours , which increases the risk.27 </sniff.v.2072><sniff.v.2073>Amphetamines- Amphetamines can be taken in pill form , sniffed , smoked or injected.

Unfortunately age at which pupils first tried smoking or drinking was not included in the 2001 questionnaire , so it is not possible to use an equivalent measure for these behaviours.

She was too many hours without sleep. She even considered she was sleepwalking she felt so strange. Shea paused near a small clearing and stared up at the star lit sky. She did n't even realize she was moving until she had crossed the clearing and was in a thick grove of trees. A branch snagged in her hair forcing her to stop again. Her head felt heavy , her mind clouded. She needed to be somewhere desperately , but she did n't know where. Listening did n't help. With her acute hearing , she would have heard if any person or any creature was hurt or in trouble. Shea sniffed the night air.

Although K-9 Wicco quickly picked up the scent and followed it to the basement , Goodnow could not see the woman. But K-9 Wicco led the officer to the clothes dryer and began to scratch at it.

Is n't there anything else you can do ? " The vet paused for a moment and said , " There is one more thing we can do. " He left the room for a moment and came back carrying a large cage with a cat in it. The vet pened the cage door and the cat walked over to the dog. The cat sniffed the dog from head to toe and walked back to the cage. " Well , that confirms it. " the vet announced. " Your dog is dead. " satisfied that the vet had done everything he possibly could , the woman sighed , " How much do I owe you ? " " That will be $ 330. " the vet replied. " I do n't believe it ! " screamed the woman.

" </sniff.v.2110><sniff.v.2111>Moreover , even if the record clarified that the officers handled Pinette only after the dog sniffed him , the record does not indicate whether the dog 's behavior justified such an aggressive examination. The Magistrate Judge reasoned that the dog 's sniff " alerted " the officers that Pinette may have had drugs , giving rise to " probable cause " to search Pinette. However , the record does not illuminate whether the dog simply sniffed Pinette as a matter of common canine curiosity or , instead , alerted the officers that it smelled drugs on Pinette.The issue of Pinette 's continued detention also raised material questions of fact that precluded summary judgment. It appears that the patrons were kept in the bar during the duration of the search , and forced to lie in a prone position on the bar 's floor. Any safety related concerns that arguably might have justified an initial detention or frisk , see footnote 5 , were satisfied upon completion of the initial frisks. The fact that patrons were kept in the bar suggests that the police were hoping to find drugs on them , despite the fact that the warrant provided only for a search of the premises. Under such circumstances , Pinette 's continued detention may also have been unreasonable . </sniff.v.2111><sniff.v.2112>Hypoxia can occur when inhalant users are huffing from a plastic bag over their face , which means that they are not breathing enough oxygen. Also , since many solvents are highly flammable ( e.g. , gasoline , paint thinner ) , some users have suffered burn injuries and deaths due to fires. Female inhalant users who are pregnant may have adverse effects on the fetus and the baby may be smaller when it is born , and may need additional health care. There is some evidence of birth defects and disabilities in babies born to women who sniffed solvents such as gasoline. Driving while using solvents presents the same dangers as other types of impaired driving because many solvents cause an alcohol-type intoxication . </sniff.v.2112><sniff.v.2113>I 'm not convinced about the commercial merits of such a scheme.

Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while intramuscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) .

From three dogs in 1959 , the squad has grown to 16 sniffers and eight more pups are being trained to join the team soon. While earlier the dogs were used only for solving criminal cases , the focus has moved to sniffing out explosives and narcotics. They are also roped in to check malls , multiplexes , Mantralaya and jails during anti-sabotage operations.

Many Marine dogs distinguished themselves on Okinawa. Private First Class Robert Targett 's dog Comet urged a Japanese from a cave and was praised when he went back for six more. Corporal Stephen G. Salata 's dog Goodie uncovered a covey of Japanese so strong it took a combat patrol to oust them. Corporal Bruce S. Wellington 's Doberman Prince sniffed out Japanese waiting in ambush beneath sugar cane ground cuttings , and Marines dug up the cane floor with automatic fire. Corporal James A.

More important for Wall Street , it would take the now-radioactive subprime CDOs off its hands and inject more liquidity into the system.

Crack cocaine is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) and water and heated to remove the hydrochloride , thus producing a form of cocaine that can be smoked. The term " crack " refers to the crackling sound heard when the mixture is smoked ( heated ) , presumably from the sodium bicarbonate. Smoking allows extremely high doses of cocaine to reach the brain very quickly and brings an intense and immediate high. It appears that compulsive cocaine use may develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than sniffed . </sniff.v.2140><sniff.v.2141>I do n't care for the lines he 's sniffed , and trouble he 's done.

Because , materially and pharmacologically , crack is cocaine , most of what is known about cocaine applies to crack as well. The fact that crack is smokedrather than sniffed , swallowed , or injectedis significant. Our review of the evidence indicates , however , that its importance has been exaggerated. Clearly , using either cocaine powder or crack entails risks , but both can also be used in less or more risky ways. In fact , among the things we will show is that the amount of harm resulting from the use of powder cocaine and crack has less to do with their pharmacological properties than with the social circumstances of their use . </sniff.v.2148><sniff.v.2149>But no matter how I state it , the fact that your pet could belong to the 3 to 5 mortality rate will still be a possibility.

This means that if the user incorrectly types in their password , then from that point up until the user enters the correct passwords and mounts a volume , the incorrect passwords can be sniffed. This may not sound particularly worrying , however if the incorrect passwords entered were , say , one charactor off ( i.e. the user made a typo ) , an attacker will still have the vast majority of the real passwords , greatly reducing the security of the volume.

Perhaps it was the sight of the rifle , perhaps it recognised an enemy of its kind , but the lion which up until then had looked on the people of Tarascon with sovereign disdain , yawning in their faces , seemed to feel a stirring of anger. First it sniffed and uttered a rumbling growl , it stretched out its forefeet and unsheathed its claws , then it got up , raised its head , shook its mane , opened its huge maw and directed at Tartarin a most ear-splitting roar . </sniff.v.2167><sniff.v.2168>" It is over , " sniffed Istok contemptuously , riding up alongside Byrta , " Order all who can to retreat to the ships , we 'll reinforce the garrison at Constantinople.

Now the pattern has changed dramatically. Nearly thirty per cent of Americans between the ages of eighteen and tewnty-five have tried cocaine , and there is increasing concern that the cocaine epidemic which has hit the United States is spreading to Europe , Australasia and elsewhere. Cocaine abuse has wrecked countless marriages wiped out fortunes , ruined careers and , in some cases , led to psychoses and death. What is the history of this misunderstood and much abused drug ? What is its insidious appeal ? Is it truly non-addictive as was once believed ? What are the risks involved in its use ? These and other urgent questions are answered in this volume on a drug whose use is growing and will ( many fear ) reach epidemic proportions throughout the developed world . </sniff.v.2170><sniff.v.2171>The IEEE 802.11 standard is for wireless , Ethernet-like LANs.

On our usual walks , I wrapped the leash around my hand and held it taut as Sasha pulled past me. I now understood I was transmitting my anxiety through the leash to Sasha like a nerve to a synapse. According to Cesar , I had to hold the leash loose and relaxed , sending the signal to her that I was serenely in control. What followed was days of lurching as she pulled away , I reeled her back , then gave her a " sssstttt " as I placed her behind me. Gradually , she started to understand. About two weeks into it , I took my daughter to the school playground and let Sasha come along. Normally , letting go of Sasha 's leash meant saying goodbye to Sasha. But as we stood in the partially enclosed playground , I decided to give Sasha some freedom. I dropped the leash , and instead of running off , she kept close as she sniffed the periphery of the playground. When it was time to go , I called her name and she did something unprecedented. She looked up at me , held my gaze , then walked slowly toward me.

Well you can imagine my horror when he told the ward of my teasing. Oy ! Well he did get his revenge by calling them doileys. The men all laughed and a few of the ladies sniffed with disdain.

Mattie , a black Labrador retriever with the Connecticut State Police , was trained to sniff out evidence of arson. Mattie could pick her way through the charred , dangerous ruins of a fire and point out a few small drops of gasoline , despite all the strong smells of a recent fire and all the fire and police officials walking around the scene. Mattie could identify several different chemical accelerants. She was the first operational accelerant detection dog in the country , and possibly in the world , when she went on duty in 1986. Since then , the program has been very successful , with Dolph and Rosie following in Mattie 's paw prints . </sniff.v.2179><sniff.v.2180>Mr. Williams sniffed contemptuously , drew off the ring , and deposited it in the pot with such an air as to impress Mr. Whiffles with the idea that the jewel must have been worth at least four million dollars.

He is entertaining when affirming common wisdoms regarding smell-mothers can discern the smell of their child 's diapers from another 's ( and think the smell sweeter ) , and , yes , women 's sense of smell is better than men's. Gilbert destroys some shibboleths-blind people smell no better than sighted people , and dogs ' and humans ' senses of smell are probably reasonably similar. Gilbert is also interested in how smell is treated in the arts , riffing on Proust 's ruminations on smell and memory , or " d ja-smell , " as Gilbert calls it. He energetically describes the epic 1950s Hollywood battle between " Smell-O-Vision " and " AromaRama "; the physiology of the popular tabloid tales of dead , decaying bodies found after a neighbor 's report of " a foul odor " from a nearby apartment; and the possible evolutionary future of the human ability to smell. Gilbert is also surprisingly romantic , and elegiac , in describing smells that modern society has lost , odors he includes in his novel concept of " smellscape.

But strangely enough , it preserves the Pauline model of the human person as imperfect. That 's why we apologize , after all : because we 're " wrong.

Whether casual beachwear or formal gowns , Fido can dress up easily. Dog owners pay minute amounts for large selections of designer fashion clothing. Even K9 footwear like shoes and booties can be sniffed out for winter. Tee shirts are tailored to summer and are easily laundered , though a few suits are dry clean only and are on hangers. So dog owners shopping for flea and tick shampoo with grooming supplies should consider dog clothes for their furry companions for extra fun . </sniff.v.2238><sniff.v.2239>Cocaine abuse and addiction requires treatment to overcome. Cocaine is most commonly sniffed , snorted or injected. All of these methods eventually lead to what is known as chasing a high , in which cocaine users seek to recreate the euphoric effects of the drug over and over again. The effects typically last 15 to 30 minutes but become less intense after each use unless the amount used in increased. The pleasurable effects diminish after a short amount of time and the user has to increase the dosage or use a more powerful route of administration such as through injection. Over time or sometimes very quickly , this has severely damaging effects on the body. These effects can include heart attack and stroke which are sometimes fatal. The psychological and social effects ranging from mood swings , relationship loss and discord , family issues , financial and job difficulty and arrest . </sniff.v.2239><sniff.v.2240>Warner Avenue and Beach Boulevard , drunk driver. A motorist said a car had almost run him off the road and hit the center divider at one point. Police found the driver of the offending vehicle , and a police dog sniffed out a bag of marijuana in the car , 8 : 11 p.m . </sniff.v.2240><sniff.v.2241>Cocaine salted money also comes in handy for police as it did a few years ago when an older couple found what they thought was a discarded or lost duffle bag with something like a hundred and eighteen thousand dollars cash and no id in it. They dutifully took it to the local police and they were to be able to claim it by law in so many months if no one claimed it. Seems the police kept it anyway because a drug dog sniffed drugs on it so it was probably drug money and should go to the police . </sniff.v.2241><sniff.v.2242>" There are no noblemen now , " sniffed the trooper contemptuously. " Congress has so decreed it. All men are born free and equal. " </sniff.v.2242><sniff.v.2243>He stood up in the seat , turned his head around to his tail and sniffed at his own behind. At that point , the poor , miserable little dog sank down on the seat , the absolute picture of dejection . </sniff.v.2243><sniff.v.2244>Substances that are abused by sniffing fall under the category of inhalants. These include gasoline , airplane glue , paint thinner , dry cleaner solutions , and others. The central nervous system is affected by the chemical fumes from inhalants. A euphoric high can be produced seconds after sniffing. Abusers can suffer impaired judgment and poor motor coordination. They can become abusive and violently dangerous to themselves and others. Since inhalants are so easy to acquire , they are particularly hard to control. Brain damage , and damage to the liver , kidneys , and bone marrow are often the result of prolonged abuse of inhalants. Inhalants may produce irregular heartbeat and death by arrhythmia. Sometimes death by anoxia , or loss of oxygen , can occur . </sniff.v.2244><sniff.v.2245>He felt like a woman. It must have been the odor of Angela 's dress. So , he threw it away from him , and jumped down from the stool , even kicked the dress , before he picked it up , sniffed it again , and was abominably disturbed. He still felt like a woman. And so the boy resolves to become more manly. For a start , he will take up smoking , even though he loathes the smell of his father 's pipe . </sniff.v.2245><sniff.v.2246>Karl 's put his nose to the grindstone and sniffed out the facts on the micro-mechanics of nasal functioning and how smell can trigger memories.

Should I accept this at your hand ? " says Yahweh. ( See NIV ) </sniff.v.2247><sniff.v.2248>Cats for instance are not known for their tolerance of human eccentricities and any attempt by their human to save money by purchasing an inferior cat food will be treated with the disdain it deserves. The offending bowl of second grade nutritional supplement will be stalked , sniffed and then ignored for however many days it takes to convince the human that constantly filling the kitchen bin with cat food is a very unproductive and malodorous game. Any continuation , or worse , escalation of this foolish strategy , will only result in triggering stage two of the feline counter offensive. In order to emphasise the point that currently , meals in the establishment are less than satisfactory and in urgent need of immediate improvement , the cats will helpfully go and find their own food. This provender they will cunningly distribute around the house to maximum effect. The eagle eyed owner will perhaps discover a foot or claw laid at the foot of a bed or the whole severed head of a rat carefully arranged on his favourite cushion in the lounge . </sniff.v.2248><sniff.v.2249>Nicotine readily enters the body. When tobacco is smoked , nicotine enters the bloodstream through the lungs. When it is sniffed or chewed , nicotine passes through the mucous membranes of the mouth or nose to enter the bloodstream. Nicotine can also enter the bloodstream by passing through the skin . </sniff.v.2249><sniff.v.2250>Studies Indicate Dogs Can Sniff Out Some DiseasesAccording to numerous scientific magazines and websites , dogs have been trained to sniff out cancer in humans for several years. Researchers are attempting to determine out just how successful animals might be in </sniff.v.2250><sniff.v.2251>This is one of the most critical principles for any dog trainer. What that means for you as the trainer is that you must reward your dog immediately following the compliant response. Timing is of the utmost importance ! If your reward presentation is delayed , you may , unknowingly , be rewarding a completely different behavior. For example , if your dog sits to your command and you delay the reward for 5 to 6 seconds , your dog may have sniffed the ground or scratched his ear after sitting down. You are rewarding him for sitting , but he may think you are rewarding him for sniffing the ground or scratching his ear. In this scenario you may discover that your sit command may result in a sit and scratch the ear response. An undesirable association occurred when the reward was delayed after the dog obeyed your sit command , which was not at all your pet ' s fault . </sniff.v.2251><sniff.v.2252>The shepherd sniffed his disdain for all conquered folk. Alban hid a grin. The man might be dressed in dust and rough weave , but he carried himself like a prince. It was a trait he had seen among many Judaeans who lived at distances from cities. And it was one of the qualities the Romans most despised. How dare these uncouth peasants flaunt their independence before an empire that had conquered nearly all the known world ! </sniff.v.2252><sniff.v.2253>A DOG working out " on a treadmill is being deprived of the real joys of being taken out for a walk ( Lapping up luxuries , " City &amp;Region , June 11 ) .

" These provisions are intended for those few people who deliberately sell these everyday products to be sniffed as a drug or abused as an inhalant , contributing to the serious harm suffered by too many Manitobans. " </sniff.v.2254><sniff.v.2255>Scientists from the University of Leeds , University of Reading and Leeds Metropolitan University worked together to collect the aroma from cooked chips , then separated the different compounds for analysis by an ' aroma-meter ' machine. Those that could be detected by the human nose were sniffed , and the type and strength of smell recorded. The findings show that those chips that are cooked twice have more complex aromas comprising bitter cocoa , butterscotch , cheese , earthy potatoes , onions , and flowers . </sniff.v.2255><sniff.v.2256>The Reagans returned the favor.

After several volunteers have guessed , let the students know the identity of each scent. Lead a brief discussion about which smells were easy to figure out , and which were trickier . </sniff.v.2257><sniff.v.2258>His peers did not include the specialists of the New York Stock Exchange. That group viewed Madoff with disdain. They likened order payments to kickbacks. And they were incensed at being placed at a competitive disadvantage by this outsider. " We are being forced to play full-contact football in tennis whites , " sniffed one specialist to the Wall Street Journal in 1990. The anger and condescension still linger today. " The Madoffs were poaching scallops from my plate , " says one retired NYSE director. He dismisses Madoff himself as nothing more than a " chiffonnier " -- a ragpicker . </sniff.v.2258><sniff.v.2259>The dangers associated with crack cocaine caused changes in the use of heroin in the 1990s. Many reported deaths from heroin overdosing had lessened the drug 's attraction in the 1980s. In addition , heroin had to be injected by syringe , and concerns regarding HIV infection contributed to the dangers of using the drug. In the 1990s an oversupply of heroin , innovations that produced a smokable variety of the drug , and the appearance of purer forms of the drug restored its attractiveness to the relatively small number of people addicted to " hard " drugs. It was no longer necessary to take the drug intravenously it could be sniffed like cocaine although many users continued to use needles . </sniff.v.2259><sniff.v.2260>Heroin is a powder that can be taken orally , injected , sniffed or smoked. Small amounts make people relaxed and content. A large amount causes sleep and stops pain , lasting about several hours. This drug can make people feel sick or/and makes concentration and quick reactions difficult. If the user injects , veins and skin become damaged increasing the risk of infections like HIV and hepatitus . </sniff.v.2260><sniff.v.2261>The Doctor sniffed , My disdain of gain lies mainly in the pain. His eyes flickered , and he cocked his head slightly. Did you feel that ? </sniff.v.2261><sniff.v.2262>Brief Description : A powerfully addictive drug that is snorted , sniffed , injected or smoked. Cocaine is prepared from coca leaves , which are greenish-yellow leaves of different size and </sniff.v.2262><sniff.v.2263>We expected , on the basis of earlier cross-modality comparisons of taste and smell ( e.g. Marks et al. , 1988 ) , that experiments 24 would show differential context effects. It is less clear , however , whether the mode of stimulus delivery should matter : does the size of the context effect depend on whether the odorants are sniffed ( presented orthonasally ) or tasted ( presented retronasally ) ? Whether the odorant is delivered through the nose or the mouth may make little difference to the differential effects of context if these depend purely on activation of different subsets of chemosensory neurons , but the mode of delivery may make a difference to differential context effects if these effects depend , even in part , on factors such as perceived similarity or site of localization. To test this possibility , the last two experiments had subjects judge the intensity of a given odorant/flavorant ( vanillin in experiment 7 and orange in experiment 8 ) when different contextual sets of concentrations were presented to the nose ( sniffed ) and to the mouth ( sipped ) . </sniff.v.2263><sniff.v.2264>Our dogs also locate discarded evidence such as a gun or mask that has been thrown in the woods by an escaping robber. Any item with a trace of human scent on it can be located by our Police K-9's. Recent robberies and burglaries have been solved by the K-9 's sniffing out these clues used to identify these dangerous criminals. A shooting in Maine was solved when one of our dogs sniffed out the weapon that was thrown away in the backyard of a Portsmouth home. The area had already been searched for 3 hours by detectives and not located. It was partially buried in a trash pile when retrieved by the dog . </sniff.v.2264><sniff.v.2265>The record does not clearly describe the chronology of the events that followed. According to the Magistrate Judge , the officers first frisked the bar patrons for weapons and then conducted the search of the premises. As part of that search , an officer walked a police dog trained to detect narcotics around the room. The parties dispute whether the officer directed the dog to sniff the patrons. According to the supervising officer , the patrons were patted down for weapons before the dog was brought in. But the record does not clearly indicate whether the officers patted down Pinette as part of a general frisk of all the patrons or whether they touched him only after he was sniffed by the dog . </sniff.v.2265><sniff.v.2266>Just before bedtime , I took Callie outdoors for a little walk , so she could pee and sniff around  read the papers , as Ted Kerasote says. She peed and sniffed for a while. Then , as we headed home , Callie started some very serious sniffing at the left rear tire of our car. As usual , in these situations , I let her take charge , and she sniffed all the way to the front of the car and , then , clear across the front. I couldn ' t imagine what was so enticing , but Callie was really sniffing hard . </sniff.v.2266><sniff.v.2267>were you to visualize an ideal existence , this might be it : Awaken a mile from Davy Crockett 's birthplace , the sun rising over the Blue Ridge Mountains , handily visible from your back porch.

Their closest competitor is a German company named Henkel , which -- in one of the ironies of multinational capitalism -- also has Minnesota connections : Through a joint venture , it owns 25 percent of St. Paul-based Ecolab Corp. , and a few years ago , it bought the chemicals division of General Mills. Henkel has come under criticism at home over sniffing of its Pattex brand glue; like Fuller , the company says sniffing is a social problem and not to be blamed on their product . </sniff.v.2269><sniff.v.2270>Soluble cocaine is sometimes injected , possibly mixed with heroin ( this mixture is sometimes called ' Speedball ' ) but the usual method is for a small amount ( usually called a ' line ' ) to be sniffed or ' snorted ' up the nose through a small tube and is absorbed into the blood via the nasal membrane. However , more recently a smokeable form of freebase cocaine called crack is become increasingly more common. Crack is purer and more concentrated than soluble cocaine and is absorbed into the body faster than if it is snorted . </sniff.v.2270><sniff.v.2271>Yes , on a boring trip north , she sniffed in disdain.

After a long happy greeting , I brought our dog outside , where he met the new kid in the house. After the excitement had died down , we all went inside. And here is where we diverged from the recommendations. I know that my dog gets especially interested in objects held out of his reach. To hold an object up and say " no " to him is to invite jumping. I can hardly fault him for that : look how I am taunting him with an object just out of reach ! So we decided not to put my child out of reach of the dog. We all sat on the ground together. The dog sniffed and licked and sniffed and licked. We kept the energy level low , and wrapped up the episode before anyone got irrepressibly excited . </sniff.v.2272><sniff.v.2273>Inhalants may be sniffed directly from an open container or " huffed " from a rag soaked in the substance and held to the face. Alternatively , the open container or soaked rag can be placed in a bag where the vapors concentrate before being inhaled. Although inhalant abusers may prefer one particular substance because of the odor or taste , a variety of substances may be used because of their similar effects , availability , and cost. Once inhaled , the extensive capillary surface of the lungs allows rapid absorption of the substance , and blood levels peak rapidly. Entry into the brain is so fast that the effects of inhalation can resemble the intensity of effects produced by intravenous injection of other psychoactive drugs . </sniff.v.2273><sniff.v.2274>I cant believe you would sniff a marker pen to clear a runny nose for just an hour. Its like sniffing glue , druggies do this and it can damage your brain forever. If you want to do something about it , blow your nose really hard so its clear and then sniff some Albas Oil now and again. This works just as good as sniffing a marker pen but does not give you brain damage.

He was very nervous and unsure to begin with but as the evening wore on he became a bit better but he still needs watching when a dog approaches as he may lunge. However , Poppy the little Jack Russell pup insisted on coming up to meet him. She was very bold and jumped up putting her paws on his cheeks , near her eyes and even inside his muzzle into his mouth. We muttered under our breath please Paddy do n't shut your mouth just yet , not with her feet in there. He never did because he loved playing with her and when she was n't jumping up to cuddle his face she was on her back allowing him to sniff her.

It was devised to give a certain amount of protection to bananas produced in former colonies , not just in the West Indies but also places such as the Ivory Coast and the Canaries. The American view is that this has handicapped access to European markets for the " dollar bananas " - thus threatening the sacred profit-making potential of US companies. This has not stopped those companies cornering 70 per cent of the banana trade with the EU.

" </sniff.v.2305><sniff.v.2306>Seven experiments investigated how stimulus context affects judgements of the magnitude of chemosensory stimuli. In each experiment , subjects gave magnitude estimates of the intensity of several concentrations of two substances , with the contextual set of concentrations varying across experimental conditions. Different experiments used different pairs of substances , which could be tastants ( sucrose or NaCl ) that were sipped , odorants ( orange or vanillin ) that were sipped ( i.e. presented retronasally ) or the same odorants sniffed ( i.e. presented orthonasally ) . Varying the stimulus context affected the judgements differentially when the two substances were compositionally different ( sucrose and NaCl; sucrose and orange; sucrose and vanillin ) but not when they were the same ( vanillin or orange presented orally and nasally ) . Judgements of qualitative similarity of the same pairs of substances , obtained in a separate experiment , failed to predict accurately the pattern of differential context effects. Taken together , the results suggest that differential effects of context relate only indirectly to perceptual dissimilarity per se but may primarily reflect the result of stimulus-specific adaptation-like processes . </sniff.v.2306><sniff.v.2307>Avery Gilbert ( website ) has " air-kissed fashion celebrities and sniffed the scalps of elderly ladies being shampooed in a mock salon.

My mom does n't eat chicken or beef , can you believe it ? crazy. When I tasted that yummy fried chicken , I knew that this guy eats the good stuff. I sniffed at mom 's meal with curious disdain , and immediately dismissed it. I mean , I will try to eat her fish , her cheese , her yogurt , her ice cream ... but not if there 's Popeyes around. Anyway , I got off track- so I got my stitches out. Everything went great; Doctor said my incision has sealed. We arrived home and I was in high spirits , running around naked and free.

In this test a bucket of bolts is dropped in front of the dog , making a loud noise and the dog is supposed to investigate after the initial reaction ( which is to be startled. ) Silk Dogs are smart and have a good nose. Posy and Ginny looked it over , sniffed and decided that there was nothing of interest in the bucket.

During that visit , students were confined to their classrooms as a trained police dog sniffed out backpacks in an empty gymnasium. The dog led police to a pile of backpacks , one of which contained marijuana and magic mushrooms. A youth , identified only as A.M , was subsequently charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. But police admitted they did n't have a search warrant or any prior tip about drugs in the school. The officers had instead visited on the basis of a long-standing invitation from school officials. In 2004 , the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a previous trial judge 's decision to exclude the drugs as evidence and acquit the youth. The court referred to the incident as " a warrantless , random search with the entire student body held in detention.

Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria ( 7 to 8 seconds ) , while musculature injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria ( 5 to 8 minutes ) . When heroin is sniffed or smoked , peak effects are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes. Although smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a rush as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection , NIDA researchers have confirmed that all three forms of heroin administration are addictive . </sniff.v.2326><sniff.v.2327>The woman sitting across from him sniffed , perturbed.

The purity of heroin has increased to a level that makes smoking and sniffing feasible. The increased purity and the concern about AIDS may be causing the shift from injecting to smoking and sniffing among heroin users.

The archetypal heroin addict injecting him-or herself -- with a dirty needle and dying miserably in a filthy back alley is a phenomenon of the past. For today 's prospective heroin user in the United States , needles are not obligatory. The high purity of Colombian heroin currently available in much of the United States can be sniffed like cocaine , sparing the user from both the need for syringes and the fear of contracting AIDS from infected needles. The consequences of addiction , however , are the same -- a physical and psychological dependency with withdrawal symptoms that make conquering an addiction extremely difficult. Estimates of the United States heroin addict population , which for the better part of two decades had remained at about 600 , 000 individuals , were revised upwards to 980 , 000 addicts in 1998. Including casual use , the figure may be 1.2 million. Evidence of combined drug use suggests that growing numbers of the United States ' 1.8 million cocaine addicts are using heroin to cushion the " crash " that follows the " rush " of using crack . </sniff.v.2339><sniff.v.2340>" Could you possibly ask Hosmers Friend , Fox if he has any word of this Chimka ?

A further 1.4 were regular smokers and had tried sniffing volatile substances , but were not usually drinking twice a week. Thus a total of 2 of 13 year olds smoked regularly and sniffed volatile substances in the last year. This compared with 4 who were regular smokers and took cannabis in the last year. A stronger link was found , therefore , between taking cannabis and smoking than between sniffing volatile substances and smoking . </sniff.v.2346><sniff.v.2347>" We must have reason to believe a student is a suspect before he can be sniffed or searched , " Davenport said.

It seemed unlikely to me but perhaps nothing could be dismissed as impossible in this strange new world of olfactory policing. There was something unnerving about the prospect of being sniffed by a police dog but I could n't put my finger on what. Perhaps it was the deeply entrenched cultural association between sniffing and snooping. Inquisitive people have historically been derided for their nosiness. Fed up with the unpaid hours of work required to defend suspects properly , I decided to accept a well-paid office job as a government lawyer in the Court of Appeal.

This doesnt make any difference to Cassie , they all get their arses sniffed regardless of their size.

She would only reply , tight-lipped , that she loved strawberries and was decidedly indifferent to apples -- if the trees ever did produce any. When they did -- they 're getting rounder and redder every day ! -- she merely sniffed a bit contemptuously. Which I thought was hardly fair. Anyway , when I commented helpfully that at least Bambi had n't eaten any of the apples , I thought ( from her expression ) that my wife had become a bit crazed by the whole incident , so I returned diplomatically to the house to finish my morning coffee.

When cocaine is sniffed , it takes 5 to 10 minutes to circulate in the body. As it enters , cocaine constricts the blood vessels in the nose , leading to dryness and bleeding. There is also the possibility of perforations in the nasal septum and of sinus infections . </sniff.v.2374><sniff.v.2375>The dog 's nose has long been used to sniff out escaped prisoners and missing persons , recent years have seen the harnessing of the dog 's keen sense of smell and employing it to sniff out drugs and bombs.

There are hundreds of household products on the market today that can be misused as inhalants. These products are sniffed , snorted , bagged ( fumes inhaled from a plastic bag ) , or " huffed " ( inhalant-soaked rag , sock , or roll of toilet paper in the mouth ) to achieve a high. Inhalants are also sniffed directly from the container. Within seconds of inhalation , the user experiences intoxication along with other effects similar to those produced by alcohol. Alcohol-like effects may include slurred speech , an inability to coordinate movements , dizziness , confusion and delirium. Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. In addition , users often experience hallucinations , and delusions . </sniff.v.2376><sniff.v.2377>Bomb sniffing dogs have specific and virtually infallible talents. Why are we not using them ? The process is simple; just allow the dogs to sniff passengers. The process is inexpensive; the dogs work for kibble. And it is far less intrusive than many aspects of the processes in current usage. I ' ve read again and again about stepped up security measures at airports , yet , I ' ve read nowhere that dogs are sniffing passengers. Why not ?

It was kind of a shy dog so that worked out well. Leo went up and sniffed the dog and then just went on his way exploring. Right as we were leaving , a lady showed up with a large black lab. I already had Leo on leash and the lab was on a leash also. They sniffed each other and seemed to be fine.

Karl sniffed : It ' s absurd. No one wants to see curvy women. You ' ve got fat mothers with their bags of chips sitting in front of the television and saying thin models are ugly. Karl thinks fashion is dreams and illusions. The Guardian has more background on this story , but I do have to make one note - they change the words mothers and chips to mummies and crisps . Karl ' s original comments were either to Agene France or Focus Magazine ( or both ) and I do wonder if he originally said this stuff in German , and everyone is translating however they see fit.

Cocaine is normally sniffed up the nose through a special tube , or rolled up in a bank note and absorbed into the bloodstream through the nasal membranes. It may also be injected. Cocaine is usually " cut " with other substances.

' s backpack was closed and was in a pile with others in the small gymnasium of St. Patrick ' s High School when the police officers entered the room with their sniffer dog. It is significant that the odours emanating from the backpack could not be detected by the police using their own senses and that the police necessarily relied on the use of the dog to identify , among the several backpacks in the gymnasium , which , if any , contained controlled substances. The dog ' s positive indication on sniffing A.M. ' s backpack enabled the police to ascertain what was inside the backpack with a reasonably high degree of accuracy. Accordingly , I have no difficulty in finding that the use of the dog in this case amounted to a search from an empirical perspective. However , what A.M. had to establish was that the use of the dog amounted to a search from a constitutional perspective such that it implicated a reasonable expectation of privacy that engaged the protection of s. 8.

The LAN uses a switch and you wish to target a specific host : If you do not want to sniff all the traffic on the LAN but only wish to target a specific host on it , you can leave the switch alone and just confuse that specific host into thinking you are the gateway/router. Therefore any traffic that host wishes to send to outside the LAN will go to your host first. This is the most clandestine form of sniffing , since it only affects the target host , and only in the way you specify , therefore it is not likely to be noticed by others.

They worked through the night until 6am. This is painstaking work. They use sterile syringes and plunge them into the core as quickly as possible to collect the sample of the mud. The organisms they are investigating do not thrive on oxygen and so they need to keep the environment free from it. These bacteria are called anaerobic methane oxidising bacteria and oxygen will kill them. There is a video clip below that shows how this is done. The sediment has to be kept cold to mimic the conditions the bacteria live in so as soon as possible it is put into the fridge. What they are investigating is the bacteria which use methane as an energy source , in combination with sulphates. Initially they put some of the bacteria into preservative so that they can estimate their numbers when they return to Cardiff , using powerful microscopes.

In early tests , trained rats correctly identified M. tb-containing samples at rates comparable to standard diagnostic techniques. The rodents also worked quickly; a rat can sniff its way through 140 samples in just 15 minutes , the researchers found.

Over time , a tolerance effect develops , which means that a bigger amount of Cocaine has to be consumed in order to achieve any narcotic effect at all.

Crack is a smokeable form of cocaine that can produce a very intense , but short-lived high , peaking after about 3 - 5 minutes and wearing off in 15 minutes. Cocaine hydrochloride powder is generally sniffed , the effects come on more slowly and wear off after about 40 minutes. Like amphetamine , cocaine ( in either form ) produces feelings of confidence and exhilaration. As the high is more short-lived than that with amphetamine , the dose needs to be repeated often. The intense high can be followed by feelings of anxiety , depression and with repeated use , irritability and paranoia. The user often feels that these negative feelings will only be alleviated through repeated use. Repeated use in a short period can lead to feelings of anxiety , particularly as cocaine increases the heart rate. Cocaine also suppresses the appetite and the need to sleep. Technically , cocaine is not physically addictive , however it can produce intense cravings in the user , which can manifest themselves in physical symptoms if use is discontinued . </sniff.v.2440><sniff.v.2441>Then , this morning , I sniffed back into reality , when I dragged my ass out of bed at 8 AM to get my cup of tea.

The trainer agreed to try and trained a poodle named Shing Ling to do this by getting her to sit down every time he opened a mylene bag containing a breath sample from a known cancer patient and then rewarding her with tidbits. When a Japanese TV film crew were working on a documentary featuring Turner and Shing Ling , the dog persisted in sitting on the director ' s foot.

Black is the targeted performer that could have instilled the championed nuttiness required to make this comedy gel with saucy jocularity.

It is typically found in white to brown powdered form and is injected , sniffed , or smoked. In the past , powders sold as illicit heroin typically contained only 1 to 10 of the drug. Since injection is the most efficient manner of delivering the drug to the central nervous system , heroin was normally injected. In recent years , however , street supplies have become much purer. The availability of higher purity heroin has meant that more users can now sniff or smoke the drug and still achieve the desired effect. Potential users once turned away by the stigma surrounding the injection of heroin are now far more likely to experiment through the already familiar ingestion methods of sniffing and smoking . </sniff.v.2474><sniff.v.2475>Poppers are chemicals called alkyl nitrites; they come in liquid form and they are sniffed for a brief , but very intense high ( no more than 2-5 minutes ) .

In that case browsers that think they 're providing greater value to their users by sniffing content , are not doing that. It is the browser that treats filename extensions or filename extensions in combination with content headers as authoritative that will provide a better experience than content sniffing. Sure content sniffing an image may be easy to do , but if the only time an image has a different filename extension is the times when an author wants it treated as a download ( just as a semi-flawed example ) then the browser that does n't sniff provides a better user experience. At other times , a filename extension may be missing or unknown. There it might make sense to turn to sniffing as another ( probably rare ) fallback mechanism . </sniff.v.2482><sniff.v.2483>Our adventure starts in the early afternoon along the waterfront in San Francisco at the Hyatt at Fisherman ' s Wharf.

Cocaine produces intense euphoria and short-term hallucinations; there is apparently no true physical addiction or physical withdrawal symptoms from the milder , standard cocaine , although persons are psychologically addicted and have intense cravings for the drug. However , the reintroduction of Crack ( quicklime added , as in ancient times ) , was very dangerous and physically addictive. Cocaine is snorted or sniffed generally through the nose and is absorbed through the nasal epithelium.

In some quarters in the United States and Canada , heroin has gained an upscale image , the so-called " heroin chic " emaciated look of certain entertainment icons. The high purity of today 's Colombian heroin allows it to be sniffed , like cocaine. It also spares potential users from syringes and the fear of contracting AIDS. Estimates of the U.S. heroin addict population , which had remained stable at about 500 , 000 for nearly two decades , have been revised upward. A disturbing trend of multiple drug use suggests that more of America 's 2.1 million hard-core cocaine addicts are using heroin to cushion the " crash " that follows the euphoria of crack use . </sniff.v.2533><sniff.v.2534>While the rate of drug use has stabilized among young people in recent years , it remains at an unacceptably high level. Moreover , recent surveys have indicated that American high school students ignorant of the epidemic of the 1960s and 1970s are increasingly experimenting with " chic " heroin the most insidious and addictive of the hard drugs. Unlike during the 1960s and 1970s , with their dark legacy of dirty needles and shooting galleries , the high-purity Colombian heroin available in the United States today can be sniffed like cocaine. The U.S. is also feeling the impact of what amounts to a global surge in the use of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and MDMA ( " ecstasy " ) . This phenomenon is affecting both industrialized countries and many areas of the developing world. In Thailand , for example , where heroin has been the drug of choice for centuries , methamphetamine has replaced heroin as the most abused drug. Unlike heroin and cocaine , synthetic drugs are relatively easy to manufacture and do not depend on vulnerable crops. The best place to hide a synthetic drug lab is not deep in the rain forest away from other people but in an urban industrial setting , or even the basement of a residence . </sniff.v.2534><sniff.v.2535>I think that Kibbles N Bits is a good brand for a very good price.

The answer is that the most obvious way to break the encryption and read the plain text is to simply try all possible keys. A 40-bit key has roughly one trillion ( 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 ) combinations. It could take your computer several weeks to try all these combinations. The implication : the average person only needs a few weeks to decrypt any message you send across the wire with a 40-bit browser , should they manage to sniff it from the wire. Every extra bit of key length means the key will take twice as long to crack. Therefore , if a system takes one week to crack a 40-bit key , it will take two weeks to crack a 41-bit key. Therefore , a 128-bit key will take 2^ ( 128-40 ) times longer to crack than a 40-bit key ( i.e. 309 , 485 , 009 , 821 , 345 , 068 , 724 , 781 , 056 times longer ) . </sniff.v.2536><sniff.v.2537>This review is from : Cat Who Sniffed Glue ( Paperback ) I thought that this was one of the best books that I have ever read.
