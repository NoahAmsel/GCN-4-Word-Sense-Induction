<camp.n.test><camp.n.1><TargetSentence>The " Steel Eighth Company " of a certain unit in the Beijing military region has actively organized new soldiers to implement colorful cultural and recreational activities , making the soldiers feel the warmth of the military camp .  </TargetSentence>The photo shows Ganglun Tan , the company commander , engaging in recreational activities together with new soldiers .  </camp.n.1><camp.n.2>The communique holds that methods such as forbidding overseas Cubans residing in America from remitting money and mailing articles to their families in Cuba , and sending Cuban stowaways detained on the high seas to the Guantanamo naval base , etc. is to put pressure on the Cuban government and attempt to damage and postpone Cuba 's economic recovery process .  <TargetSentence>The communique also points out that the establishment of " refugee camps " at Guantanamo by the US violates international agreements on the use of military bases .  </TargetSentence>The communique requests that the US respect the territorial integrity of Cuba , return the Guantanamo military base to Cuba , and immediately stop the blockade .  </camp.n.2><camp.n.3>So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes .  <TargetSentence>Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members .  </TargetSentence>The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .  </camp.n.3><camp.n.4>Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered .  <TargetSentence>Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R. , a Soviet - controlled regime remains in Kabul , the refugees sit in their camps , and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever .  </TargetSentence>But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily .  </camp.n.4><camp.n.5>There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course .  <TargetSentence>The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .  </TargetSentence>Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .  </camp.n.5><camp.n.6>The Group entered the final phase of discussions on the " one China " issue during November , but differences between pro-unification and pro-independence participants continued to stymie the effort to produce a statement acceptable to all .  <TargetSentence>As DPP legislator Shen Fu-hsiung pointed out , the Group had to draft something " palatable both to the pro-unification and pro-independence camps ; something which the DPP ca n't shun and yet which does n't make Beijing wince . "  </TargetSentence>Clearly no easy task .  </camp.n.6><camp.n.7>He added that he would very much enjoy an opportunity to work together with colleagues from Taiwan television .  <TargetSentence>Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course .  </TargetSentence>After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience .  </camp.n.7><camp.n.8>The ruling did not specify , however , whether construction of the nuclear power plant is to be resumed .  <TargetSentence>After the decision was released , the ruling and opposition camps came out with conflicting interpretations .  </TargetSentence>The legislature 's opposition coalition agreed to hold an extraordinary session so that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung could present a report on the policy decision to the legislature .  </camp.n.8><camp.n.9>However , said Hsu , since the government has not necessarily built up a consensus in support of its stance against nuclear power , another option might be to have the premier resign , disband the legislature , and elect a new legislature so that the public can express its will regarding the issue .  <TargetSentence>If other constitutional rulings in the past two years are any guide , it appears that the dispute between the ruling and opposition camps will have to be resolved in the political arena .  </TargetSentence>Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly .  </camp.n.9><camp.n.10>The justices issued an ambiguous ruling stating that while the plan was not unconstitutional , neither was it was appropriate .  <TargetSentence>After the ruling was announced , the ruling and opposition camps both declared victory and eventually negotiated an agreement on the question of whether Lien Chan would be allowed to serve as premier .  </TargetSentence>The ruling and opposition camps have now agreed that Premier Chang should present a report to the legislature , but the question of whether to resume construction of the power plant remains a focus of contention .  </camp.n.10><camp.n.11>After the ruling was announced , the ruling and

</TargetSentence>p. 65  </camp.n.11><camp.n.12>Although the constitution stipulates that the president does not need the approval of the Legislative Yuan to name a premier , given the fact that the KMT has a majority there , Chen faces the problem of finding a premier who will be able to work with KMT legislators .  <TargetSentence>The Chen camp is well aware of this problem .  </TargetSentence>Therefore they have let it be known that Chen would like to ask Lee Yuan-tse , the universally respected Nobel Prize winner who is currently president of the Academia Sinica , to be his premier .  </camp.n.12><camp.n.13>Chang Chun-hung suggests that , in addition to uncertainty in party politics , a Soong victory could also bring instability to Taiwan 's constitutional system .  <TargetSentence>Except for some of his followers who were with him in the provincial government , Soong 's camp lacks any experience in inter-group political bargaining .  </TargetSentence>With Soong as president , political elites in Taiwan would be , as Alexander Lu describes it , like a basketball team whose players have never played together before .  </camp.n.13><camp.n.14>With Soong as president , political elites in Taiwan would be , as Alexander Lu describes it , like a basketball team whose players have never played together before .  <TargetSentence>Soong 's camp will first have to integrate their own internal views , and then , to win confidence and trust from the Legislative Yuan , work with both the KMT and the DPP .  </TargetSentence>Such a situation is unlikely to result in much policy innovation , and in fact even the initial step of selecting a premier could prove extremely difficult .  </camp.n.14><camp.n.15>Such a situation is unlikely to result in much policy innovation , and in fact even the initial step of selecting a premier could prove extremely difficult .  <TargetSentence>Although the KMT , DPP , and NP all have legislators who might join the Soong camp if Soong wins , Soong 's team will still need support from the KMT and/or the DPP , support they can only get through negotiation .  </TargetSentence>Past experience has shown that the KMT and DPP can work together to boycott Executive Yuan proposals ; if they do this to a Soong - led executive branch , this could lead to a crisis ending in either a vote of no confidence or dissolution of the parliament .  </camp.n.15><camp.n.16>Another issue for adult students always on the run is their unfamiliarity with the campus .  <TargetSentence>In order to enhance their sense of identification with the school , NTUST designed an overseas business camp program .  </TargetSentence>Last year , one professor made a big hit with over 30 students , taking them to mainland China for over ten days to familiarize them with the investment environment there .  </camp.n.16><camp.n.17>p. 72  <TargetSentence>It has become popular in recent years to send children to academic camps overseas to learn English while getting a look at the big , wide world .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- courtesy of The Farmhouse -RRB-  </camp.n.17><camp.n.18>Pentagon officials say Omar al - Farouq escaped from ~US custody
