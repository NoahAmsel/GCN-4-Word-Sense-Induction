"  <TargetSentence>The city of Taipei " adopted " Shihkang after the earthquake , assigning personnel from its various ward offices to stay on long-term in Shihkang and assist with earthquake recovery .  </TargetSentence>Mighty Taipei , however , is joined in this task by Peipu 's TCAC , which is among the few organizations that have provided continuous assistance ever since the quake .  </office.n.189><office.n.190>Located in the center of Peipu is Tzu-tien Temple , the town 's main landmark , and the bustling streets that run past the temple offer the best shopping and eating in town .  <TargetSentence>TCAC operates out of an office in the middle of town .  </TargetSentence>The traditional architecture of the building is a very pleasant sight .  </office.n.190><office.n.191>I fully understand that , as the popularly elected 10th-term president of the Republic of China , I must abide by the Constitution , maintain the sovereignty , dignity and security of our country , and ensure the well - being of all citizens .  <TargetSentence>Therefore , as long as the CCP regime has no intention to use military force against Taiwan , I pledge that during my term in office , I will not declare independence , I will not change the national title , I will not push forth the inclusion of the so - called " state - to - state " description in the Constitution , and I will not promote a referendum to change the status quo in regard to the question of independence or unification .  </TargetSentence>Furthermore , there is no question of abolishing the Guidelines for National Unification and the National Unification Council .  </office.n.191><office.n.192>Some are for women only .  <TargetSentence>Others , like California Fitness Centers and Gold 's Gym , set up in commercial districts , aiming for office workers .  </TargetSentence>Alexander , an island - wide chain , is family - friendly , open to all ages .  </office.n.192><office.n.193>He declares : " The lives of city people are incredibly busy , and it 's already a luxury to have an hour a day to work out , so there is n't much time to waste on stuff that is purely for recreation .  <TargetSentence>But if you consider that it costs NT$ 20,000 in annual fees , plus the initial membership price of another NT$ 10-20,000 - altogether about a month 's salary for an office worker - most of that money is wasted . "  </TargetSentence>With consumers like him , who do n't throw their money around , despite the proliferation of new health centers , traditional gyms have not been badly affected .  </office.n.193><office.n.194>Pulsating music , elaborate lighting , TVs . . . .  <TargetSentence>Some foreign health clubs are trying to make working out fashionable to attract the yuppie and office worker crowd .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- location courtesy of California Fitness Centers -RRB-  </office.n.194><office.n.195>One afternoon in the days before the Chinese New Year , Chinese businessmen wearing suits arrived at the People 's Government administration building in Dongguan 's Qishi district .  <TargetSentence>After a long wait , they sat down at a table to negotiate with Qishi 's Communist Party secretary , the district chief , and various staff from its foreign economic office .  </TargetSentence>Qishi 's factory rents , electricity charges and land leases were all focuses of discussion .  </office.n.195><office.n.196>The year before last the mainland announced a new tax system , under which raw materials imported by foreign firms would be taxed at a rate of 17 % , with 9 % being returned to the manufacturer when finished goods were exported .  <TargetSentence>" When I went to Beijing to negotiate , " recalls Yeh , " I asked cadres in the foreign trade office to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry .  </TargetSentence>Profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % .  </office.n.196><office.n.197>What path will the relationship follow now that Macau has returned to China ?  <TargetSentence>As you pass through the offices of the Macau government 's directorate of administration you notice the relative youth of the staff , most of whom seem to be in their thirties .  </TargetSentence>Rosa Tam , who heads the recruitment and selection division of the directorate 's human resources department , introduces many of her colleagues with the remark that he or she " studied in Taiwan too . "  </office.n.197><office.n.198>Tam is just one of the many Macau civil servants who have studied for degrees in Taiwan .  <TargetSentence>The Macau government 's directorate for administration says that around 200 Macau civil servants have academic qualifications from Taiwan , but according to Taiwan 's representative office in the territory , the figure is closer to 1,000 .  </TargetSentence>This may not represent a very large share of Macau 's 17,000 civil servants , but given that many of those who graduated in Taiwan hold senior ranks , it adds something of a " Taiwan flavor " to the government of the Macau SAR -LRB- Special Administrative Region -RRB- .  </office.n.198><office.n.199>Sinorama applied , in line with official procedure , for a press pass to the handover ceremony , but the application was eventually rejected as " unapproved by the security department . "  <TargetSentence>On the eve of the handover , the signboard of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau was quietly taken down , after the office had been privately warned to remove the sign before the transfer of sovereignty .  </TargetSentence>Office director William Li was subsequently reprimanded by the Mainland Affairs Council for his handling of the affair .  </office.n.199><office.n.200>On the eve of the handover , the signboard of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau was quietly taken down , after the office had been privately warned to remove the sign before the transfer of sovereignty .  <TargetSentence>Office director William Li was subsequently reprimanded by the Mainland Affairs Council for his handling of the affair .  </TargetSentence>None of the above was problems at the time of Hong Kong 's handover in 1997 , which goes to show how cautious the Macau SAR government is regarding Taiwan .  </office.n.200><office.n.201>Under these circumstances , Taiwanese universities , which actively recruited abroad , were a natural choice for many Macau students .  <TargetSentence>" In terms of the return you get on your investment , taking your degree in Taiwan is well worth it , " says Wang Yun , acting head of the sanitation and environment division of Macau 's urban administration office , who graduated in civil engineering from National Cheng Kung University -LRB- NCKU -RRB- in Tainan .  </TargetSentence>Taiwan 's universities have good teachers and decent facilities , says Wang , and students from Macau can learn much in Taiwan that will benefit them in their careers .  </office.n.201><office.n.202>In fact , Taiwan 's main parties - the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force - all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly .  <TargetSentence>They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  </TargetSentence>KMT party chairman Lee Teng-hui has repeatedly called on voters to cherish the system of party politics that has been constructed in the process of democratization ; the KMT wants confirmation that people still see it as a coherent , positive political institution .  </office.n.202><office.n.203>A victory for Lien , with Lee continuing as party chairman , would be helpful to the KMT in resolving internal party disputes , and in consolidating Lien 's party and government position .  <TargetSentence>He says that it is unlikely that the Yen - Chiang situation would be repeated , since Lee Teng-hui will certainly not have an office like premier which would involve him in day - to - day policy - making .  </TargetSentence>What would a Lien victory mean for the New Party ?  </office.n.203><office.n.204>Foot - long red coffins would sit on counters in big stores , and people would carry around mini-coffin key chains .  <TargetSentence>Normally superstitious people were willing to break the strong taboo associated with coffins because of the double allusion to the phrase " sheng guan fa cai " -LRB- Ìò...-LRB-c-RRB-x˙goÌö] -RRB- , which means , " Attain high office and make a fortune . "  </TargetSentence>The owners of the various shops that sell wealth charms all agree that when sales of other lines flag , business for these charms only increases .  </office.n.204><office.n.205>Since water is the Chinese element that indicates wealth , many business people like to keep fish tanks .  <TargetSentence>Huang Chiung-yu , who has been selling fish and aquariums for more than a decade , points out that for a few years entrepreneurs were installing NT $ 200,000 - 300,000 fish tanks in their homes or offices .  </TargetSentence>While the falling stock market has meant that aquarium sellers have had to lower their prices , they have found no shortage of customers willing to take advantage of these bargains .  </office.n.205><office.n.206>Since fish tanks help you change your fate when something bad is expected , and otherwise help to attract money , they are perennial hot sellers .  <TargetSentence>A Miss Lai works for a broadband Internet access provider and is responsible for taking care of two large office fish tanks .  </TargetSentence>Her company has been hit by the slumping economy and is striving to cut down on expenses .  </office.n.206><office.n.207>Thus the attitude of the US has become one of the key factors in cross-strait relations .  <TargetSentence>Since the new DPP administration took office in Taipei , the PRC has been deeply worried by the party 's advocacy of Taiwan independence .  </TargetSentence>As a result , the two sides have yet to open any formal dialogue mechanism such as existed before the freezing of cross-strait relations which occurred after former president Lee Teng-hui went to the US in 1996 .  </office.n.207><office.n.208>For example , says the book , last year relations between Beijing and Panama took a giant step forward , indicating that rumors in Taipei about a possible break in relations with Panama were not completely unfounded .  <TargetSentence>Also , when Chen Shui-bian visited the Dominican Republic in August , the ROC ambassador there reported that in 1997 , the PRC managed to get the Dominican Republic 's agreement to the establishment of a PRC office in the DR capital by playing on the DR 's desire to extend its consular rights in Hong Kong .  </TargetSentence>In Africa , last year the PRC tried very hard to get Taiwan 's eight diplomatic partners on that continent to participate in the " Sino-African Cooperation Forum " held in Beijing in October .  </office.n.208><office.n.209>This requires coordination among the Government Information Office [ GIO ] , MOEA , and foreign ministry .  <TargetSentence>Yet , so far , only the GIO has sent staff to diplomatic partners to coordinate , while the MOEA has not posted staff to all relevant overseas offices , " he says .  </TargetSentence>Greater effort and creativity is needed in economic diplomacy , which in turn requires more study and discussion among the political parties , businessmen , and the academic community , as well as greater flexibility and coordination in the MOFA and other government agencies .  </office.n.209><office.n.210>Besides promoting new ideas , says Lo , the MOFA is also undertaking internal reform .  <TargetSentence>In early September the MOFA announced that , based on efficiency evaluations , the government would close its representative offices in the African countries of the Congo , Angola , and Madagascar .  </TargetSentence>As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . "  </office.n.210><office.n.211>As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . "  <TargetSentence>In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations .  </TargetSentence>All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  </office.n.211><office.n.212>In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations .  <TargetSentence>All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  </TargetSentence>Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe .  </office.n.212><office.n.213>In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  <TargetSentence>Though in office for less than four months , foreign minister Tien Hung-mao has already been to Europe twice .  </TargetSentence>Based on his comments , analysts infer that Taiwan may in the near future establish formal diplomatic relations with another European country .  </office.n.213><office.n.214>The sight of professionals in suits and ties rushing to class at dusk contrasts greatly from the typical jeans and casual attire of fresh-faced undergrads .  <TargetSentence>Shuttling between the office and the campus , do they ever feel like they 're burning the candle at both ends ?  </TargetSentence>At some schools , even professionals boasting Ph.D. degrees are coming back to school for Master 's degrees .  </office.n.214><office.n.215>Two years ago , this led him to consider taking a new direction , and he tested into National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce intent on making connections with movers and shakers in different fields .  <TargetSentence>Chang Chin-tsung , a researcher at the Chung-Shan Institute of Science &amp; Technology with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from a US university , shuttles between his office in Taoyuan s Lungtan and the NTU campus three days each week .  </TargetSentence>Long immersed in the sciences and always focusing on numbers and statistics , Chang says he feels like he " has gotten into a mental rut . "  </office.n.215><office.n.216>" If you asked me whether work or family is more important , I would say that since entering society 20 years ago work has always come first , " states Donna Sun , vice president of the Human Resource Division at Schmidt Scientific Taiwan .  <TargetSentence>Even if she has no classes to attend , leaving the office at 8:00 PM is no different from the perspective of her family life than the extra hour she spends attending classes until 9:00 PM .  </TargetSentence>She is thankful that her son , a university student , and her daughter , a third-year junior high school student , have always been very independent and self-reliant .  </office.n.216><office.n.217>Taiwan is small , and voters do not clearly distinguish between the roles of the head of state , elected legislators , and government bureaucrats .  <TargetSentence>No matter how high the office , for many voters , especially in traditional constituencies , " all politics is local . "  </TargetSentence>For them , what matters is whether a politician seems concerned about their hometown issues .  </office.n.217><office.n.218>Wang Chien-chuang states : " All candidates have beautiful - sounding platforms , because this is a presidential election , and they must have a blueprint for governing the nation .  <TargetSentence>But running for office and running the country are two very different things . "  </TargetSentence>It has been said , " campaigning is like poetry , governing is like an essay . "  </office.n.218><office.n.219>Roughly the same percentage said they were most concerned about problems of finance and the economy .  <TargetSentence>Early this year Commonwealth magazine asked citizens , " What do you think is the first thing the new president should do after taking office ? "  </TargetSentence>The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " -LRB- the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -RRB- , and raising economic competitiveness .  </office.n.219><office.n.220>Ting says that , although education is not a panacea , it is certainly not irrelevant .  <TargetSentence>Unfortunately , the effects of education policy are visible only in the long term , and it therefore has a relatively weak position in politics and is often neglected because policymakers probably will not see the fruits of their efforts in their terms of office .  </TargetSentence>But the main industries of the 21st century , such as the information and telecommunications industries , are knowledge - based .  </office.n.220><office.n.221>Last year , some of the leading brands showed sales increases of 200 % .  <TargetSentence>Many male clients have three or four different kinds of fragrance at home , using different ones for the office , long weekends , and so on .  </TargetSentence>In days gone by , it was considered an extravagance for Dad to go down to the barbershop for a shave and haircut .  </office.n.221><office.n.222>Few bothered to worry about their external appearance .  <TargetSentence>Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end .  </TargetSentence>Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  </office.n.222><office.n.223>Profit defines value  <TargetSentence>In 1992 , shortly after US president Bill Clinton took office , he declared that emphasis should be placed on research and development and on creating a " new economy . "  </TargetSentence>It turns out that these last eight years in the US have been a golden age of high economic growth , falling unemployment , and stable prices .  </office.n.223><office.n.224>" Middle age is the afternoon , but I ca n't say I have much time to drink tea ! "  <TargetSentence>Sitting in the silence of his research office , Professor Li Liang-che of the psychology department at National Chengchi University appears pensive .  </TargetSentence>Indeed , passing 40 is like passing noon .  </office.n.224><office.n.225>At night she would toss and turn in bed , but the worry that lack of sleep would make her unable to get up in the morning and would affect her work performance made her even less able to sleep .  <TargetSentence>Years of looking at a computer screen was causing her vision to deteriorate rapidly , and due to working in a sealed high-tech office she was always dogged by colds , so that every day she felt under the weather .  </TargetSentence>Live for today  </office.n.225><office.n.226>As early as 1996 , the Educational Reform Committee of the Executive Yuan proposed that the Ministry of Education include English in the primary school curriculum .  <TargetSentence>After taking office the former Minister for Education , Wu Ching , put forward the idea of a " nine - year integrated curriculum " encompassing primary and secondary education .  </TargetSentence>In 1998 , the President of the Academia Sinica , Lee Yuan-tseh , indicated to a meeting of the Science and Technology Committee of the Executive Yuan that because English had been taught in Taiwan as a " discipline " rather than as a " communication tool , " Taiwanese who went to study overseas found they were unable to read what their professors had prescribed in the time available .  </office.n.226><office.n.227>How do you mean /?
