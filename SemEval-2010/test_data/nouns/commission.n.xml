<commission.n.test><commission.n.1>Because of this , the National Foreign Exchange Management Department increased the extent of investigations and starting in 1995 , successively implemented checks on foreign exchange business of financial institutions in Guangdong and national financial institutions .  <TargetSentence>During checks , it discovered that some corporations and individuals made use of foreign trading companies that have import and export operation rights , allowing them to perform " import agent " business , used false customs documents to cheat on exchange , in order to get foreign exchange capital through tax evasion and smuggling , while the foreign trading companies earned agent commission fees without any cost ; there was also some international speculative capital which infiltrated regular items to get remitted into the country ; or entered the domestic stock market for speculating , or false custom documents were purchased to purchase exchange to derive profit from the exchange differences within Chinese territory .  </TargetSentence>Relevant directors of the National Exchange Management Bureau expressed that henceforth , the Foreign Exchange Management Department , apart from continuously perfecting laws and regulations on foreign exchange management , will also continue to increase the extent of investigations and handling of cases violating regulations and violating laws ; will , toward relevant institutions and units that violated laws and violated regulations , in addition to punishment , strengthen supervision of their future purchases of foreign exchange ; and will transfer those violating criminal law to the Public Security Bureau for handling , in order to preserve stability of the financial order .  </commission.n.1><commission.n.2>This information website that was organized and developed by the China Economic and Trade Co-operation Information Network Center , organized and collected economic and trade information and foreign co-operation projects sanctioned from various Chinese provinces and cities , currently has stored nearly 10,000 items of foreign co-operation projects from domestic and foreign regions .  <TargetSentence>Domestic and foreign merchants can query via the internet , search for project co-operation intention , and accept commissions from domestic and foreign merchants to provide investment consulting services , mutual transmission of project information , and promote co-operation project implementation .  </TargetSentence>The China Economic and Trade Co-operation Information Network Center receives leadership from the State Development Planning Commission and the China Information Association , and is jointly organized and built by economic co-ordination departments of some Chinese provincial and municipal governments .  </commission.n.2><commission.n.3>Economic experts estimate that this year trade between the two countries of China and South Korea would increase to 25 billion US dollars .  <TargetSentence>It is reported that at the first large-scale Sino-Korean economy and trade seminar specifically held for discussing economy and trade exchange and co-operation between the two countries , authorities from China 's concerned ministries and commissions will focus on a series of new policies on foreign trade and co-operation that are to be announced , dealing with problems capturing the attention of overseas investors , such as policies on the reduction of imported products duties , duty refunds on products exported by foreign invested enterprises , the exemption and reduction of duty on equipment imported by foreign invested enterprises , the accounting system for processing trade cash deposits , etc .  </TargetSentence>Moreover , the progress of the negotiation between China and Korea on the co-operation in the four major domains : automotive , civil aviation , high definition TV and program - controlled switchboards , about which the people from the economy and trade circles are concerned , will also be one of the main topics for discussion at this seminar .  </commission.n.3><commission.n.4>Kemper Financial Services Inc. , charging that program trading is ruining the stock market , cut off four big Wall Street firms from doing any of its stock - trading business .  <TargetSentence>The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading , with Kemper putting its money -- the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year -- where its mouth is .  </TargetSentence>The Kemper Corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices , such as on Tuesday and on Oct. 13 and 16 , and has increased chances for market crashes .  </commission.n.4><commission.n.5>Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company , C&amp;D Commodities , could be reached for comment .  <TargetSentence>As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer - driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago .  </TargetSentence>Soybean futures for November delivery gained 5.25 cents a bushel to close at $ 5.66 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade .  </commission.n.5><commission.n.6>`` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' says Leo Fields , a Dallas investor .  <TargetSentence>He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading .  </TargetSentence>But he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility .  </commission.n.6><commission.n.7>Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. .  <TargetSentence>It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''  </TargetSentence>Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . ''  </commission.n.7><commission.n.8>In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts .  <TargetSentence>This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members .  </TargetSentence>Sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines .  </commission.n.8><commission.n.9>Sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines .  <TargetSentence>The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission 's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership , the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts .  </TargetSentence>Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38 % of the city 's population and hold only 25 % of the seats on the council .  </commission.n.9><commission.n.10>Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves .  <TargetSentence>In Pennsylvania , small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative ; they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt .  </TargetSentence>They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave .  </commission.n.10><commission.n.11>The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop - out rate far in excess of federal standards , and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations .  <TargetSentence>United Education &amp; Software , a Los Angeles education services company , called the commission 's action `` precipitous and unwarranted . ''  </TargetSentence>The court set a hearing on the emergency action for Oct. 30 .  </commission.n.11><commission.n.12>The court set a hearing on the emergency action for Oct. 30 .  <TargetSentence>United Education &amp; Software posted a $ 250,000 bond against potential losses to the student aid commission and to taxpayers in guaranteeing any more loans for National Technical Schools students prior to the hearing .  </TargetSentence></commission.n.12><commission.n.13>`` The proposal , while well - intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the SEC has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker - dealers , '' Michael Raoul - Duval , managing director of First Boston , said in an interview .  <TargetSentence>The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker - dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker - dealers , '' Mr. Raoul - Duval said .  </TargetSentence>Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible .  </commission.n.13><commission.n.14>The OTS did n't say specifically why the action was taken against Ms. Garman .  <TargetSentence>However , it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift , including `` extraordinary loan commissions '' paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials .  </TargetSentence>Ms. Garman could n't be reached for comment .  </commission.n.14><commission.n.15>Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood .  <TargetSentence>Malcolm , a former film - maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly - by - night real estate developer .  </TargetSentence>Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera .  </commission.n.15><commission.n.16>The President came up with a good bill , but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill .  <TargetSentence>It would create 38,000 local day - care commissions , answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services .  </TargetSentence>They 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they 'd regulate the storage facilities .  </commission.n.16><commission.n.17>This is reflected in a built - in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection .  <TargetSentence>And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this .  </TargetSentence>So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .  </commission.n.17><commission.n.18>I 'm more favorably impressed by `` no - load life , '' even though it turns out to be low - load life .  <TargetSentence>Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .  </TargetSentence>I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen .  </commission.n.18><commission.n.19>The most common conflict involves compensation .  <TargetSentence>NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend .  </TargetSentence>The issue : Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ?  </commission.n.19><commission.n.20>NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend .  <TargetSentence>The issue : Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ?  </TargetSentence>In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. , an Albany financial - planning firm that had invested $ 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors .  </commission.n.20><commission.n.21>In its notice of action , the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , the attorney general alleged , the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high - risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos .  <TargetSentence>Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian , payments investors were never told about , the attorney general alleged .  </TargetSentence>Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted .  </commission.n.21><commission.n.22>One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .  <TargetSentence>Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges .  </TargetSentence>The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz .  </commission.n.22><commission.n.23>Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges .  <TargetSentence>He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta , a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S. , after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder .  </TargetSentence>And , all the while , Panama 's debt problems continued to grow .  </commission.n.23><commission.n.24>The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5 % , slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25 % .  <TargetSentence>In its annual economic report for 1989 - 1990 , the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 EC members at 3 % .  </TargetSentence>EC inflation was seen at 4.8 % in 1989 , higher than 1988 's 3.6 % price rise .  </commission.n.24><commission.n.25>But the budget for yet - to - be - installed works is even more staggering : NT$ 100 million for public art at the new CKS Airport terminal alone , NT$ 85 million for spending by the Kaohsiung port authority , and NT$ 80 million for stations along the Wanhua-Panchiao branch of Taipei 's MRT network .  <TargetSentence>At a time of bleak economic prospects , public art commissions have become a beacon for artists .  </TargetSentence>No wonder some prefer to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .  </commission.n.25><commission.n.26>The company had only five staff members when they set up shop in 1996 ; now , only four years later , there are 190 .  <TargetSentence>Though 104 has commissions from more firms than any other in the market , they do not dare slack off .  </TargetSentence>Steven Su says that " we will always have competition from the traditional media like China Times and United Daily News , " because after all , 104 only works through the Internet .  </commission.n.26><commission.n.27>Correct /.  <TargetSentence>It said that uh in order to try these individuals by an appropriate thing to do would be for the President to get the Congress uh to create military commission /.  </TargetSentence>Or there were two other options Both of which I think were clearly unacceptable /.  </commission.n.27><commission.n.28>Or there were two other options Both of which I think were clearly unacceptable /.  <TargetSentence>So what I think Congress will be doing is creating military commission /.  </TargetSentence>And second a very disturbing aspect of the decision was that the court held uh common article three of the Geneva convention applicable to um American service men /.  </commission.n.28><commission.n.29>And this means that American service men potentially can be accused of war crimes /.  <TargetSentence>I think Congress is going to want to deal with that as well when it enacts these military commissions /.  </TargetSentence>And I think we need to do it soon /.  </commission.n.29><commission.n.30>I think it is important to note that this president has n't done anything with regard to enemy combatants that have been done -- that had n't been done by previous presidents /.  <TargetSentence>The Court now has stepped into a -- eh eh into the field And said we must create these commissions /.  </TargetSentence>Well we 're happy to do that /.  </commission.n.30><commission.n.31>And he 'll backtrack /.  <TargetSentence>And he 'll say this is what kind of a military commission we need /.  </TargetSentence>And they 'll keep Guantanamo /.  </commission.n.31><commission.n.32>They 'll keep uh the most dangerous terrorists there /.  <TargetSentence>And we 'll have these military commissions /.  </TargetSentence>And uh they 'll set a good pattern for the next president And hopefully not the next war /.  </commission.n.32><commission.n.33>Annan returned to Gaza after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and consulting by phone with President Clinton .  <TargetSentence>Arafat is pushing Annan to appoint an international commission to look into the violence .  </TargetSentence></commission.n.33><commission.n.34>He wants the Israelis to end the fighting , remove Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships from Palestinian residential areas and agree to an international investigation into the violence .  <TargetSentence>The Israeli government has rejected the notion of an international commission .  </TargetSentence>Two Palestinians were killed in clashes overnight .  </commission.n.34><commission.n.35>Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov joined those discussions .  <TargetSentence>Barak says he 's ready to accept a commission to look into the causes of the recent clashes , an outside commission .  </TargetSentence>The U.N.
