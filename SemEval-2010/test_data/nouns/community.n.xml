"  </community.n.71><community.n.72>In any case , Teng 's copious fieldwork is not something you can afford to ignore .  <TargetSentence>Among other projects , Teng 's work with the Thao -LRB- also known as the Shao or Sao -RRB- , a tiny aboriginal tribe living in the vicinity of Sun Moon Lake , looms particularly important in the wake of the Chichi earthquake , for the temblor has dealt a heavy blow to a community that now has only 282 members left .  </TargetSentence>Teng has thrown himself wholeheartedly into the task of rebuilding the one village where the Thao remain .  </community.n.72><community.n.73>So who exactly is Teng Hsiang-yang ?  <TargetSentence>How did he become such an important figure in the academic community ?  </TargetSentence>Teng Hsiang-yang had originally been planning to catch a flight on September 23 to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival together with his wife and children .  </community.n.73><community.n.74>Puli and the nearby rural townships of Yuchih , Kuohsing , and Jen'ai comprise an area known as Shuishalien , where many different ethnic groups have always lived side - by - side .  <TargetSentence>In addition to Fujianese , Cantonese , Hakkas , and the Pingpu aborigines -LRB- various plains - dwelling aboriginal tribes that have almost completely assimilated into the Han Chinese community -RRB- , the area is also home to many mountain - dwelling aboriginal tribes , including the Atayal , Sediq , Bunun , Thao , Perugawan , Pazeh , Taokas , and Murauts .  </TargetSentence>Although Teng makes his living by running a medical testing lab , a fortunate combination of circumstances has also sparked an abiding interest in ethnology .  </community.n.74><community.n.75>Many scholars used to steer clear of Taiwan 's colonial history , but Teng happened to take an interest in the subject just as Taiwanese society was beginning to become more liberal .  <TargetSentence>The fact that Teng was not a member of the academic community was also fortunate , for it freed him of the pressures that academics must deal with .  </TargetSentence>Says Teng , " This was about the story of my hometown .  </community.n.75><community.n.76>For example , in an Academia Sinica study that ran from 1992 to 1996 and focused on the cultural and kinship ties between Taiwan 's nine main aboriginal tribes , Teng helped to study the Thao and the Pazeh -LRB- a plains - dwelling tribe -RRB- .  <TargetSentence>According to Hsu Mu-chu , a researcher at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Ethnology , " Teng Hsiang-yang 's status as a member of the medical community and his wide contacts among the aborigines enabled him to make a key contribution to the research project . "  </TargetSentence>If it had n't been for Teng 's detailed knowledge of the kinship ties in some clans , the researchers would never have been able in some cases to identify pure tribal lineages for study .  </community.n.76><community.n.77>His good friend Wang Hao jokingly calls Teng " Puli 's ambassador to New Zealand . "  <TargetSentence>On one visit back home , people who had once collaborated in his fieldwork asked him to help formulate a community development project for Puli , and a group that had taken part in his study of the Thao tribe asked him to get back into fieldwork .  </TargetSentence>And so it was that the gravity of hometown , friends , and the land pulled Teng back to Puli again .  </community.n.77><community.n.78>Teng is the first person that many people meet when visiting Puli .  <TargetSentence>Not long after Li Chia-tung became president of National Chi-Nan University he made it a point to visit Teng Hsiang-yang and Liao Chia-chan to discuss ways to strengthen relations between the university and the local community .  </TargetSentence>Teng is thus very well known in Puli , and extremely active in community affairs .  </community.n.78><community.n.79>Not long after Li Chia-tung became president of National Chi-Nan University he made it a point to visit Teng Hsiang-yang and Liao Chia-chan to discuss ways to strengthen relations between the university and the local community .  <TargetSentence>Teng is thus very well known in Puli , and extremely active in community affairs .  </TargetSentence>The list of projects in which he has been involved is long :  </community.n.79><community.n.80>The list of projects in which he has been involved is long :  <TargetSentence>a comprehensive community development project ; an effort to preserve the Tamalin archeological site ; the writing of the section on aboriginal culture in a textbook on native culture in Nantou ; the Puli Music and Arts Festival ; an effort to persuade Academia Sinica to establish a campus in Puli ; etc .  </TargetSentence>Passing the torch  </community.n.80><community.n.81>I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  <TargetSentence>Teng had been planning to pass the torch to others , both in community affairs and in his efforts to collect the oral histories of the aborigines .  </TargetSentence>" I 've done my bit , " said Teng , " and soon it will be time to let the aborigines speak for themselves . "  </community.n.81><community.n.82>Then the earthquake threw a wrench in Teng 's plans .  <TargetSentence>After his medical laboratory was destroyed , Teng characteristically reacted by throwing his energies into the task of rebuilding the local community .  </TargetSentence>He has kept himself busy preparing posters , organizing a community newspaper , and establishing the " New Puli Community Development Foundation . "  </community.n.82><community.n.83>After his medical laboratory was destroyed , Teng characteristically reacted by throwing his energies into the task of rebuilding the local community .  <TargetSentence>He has kept himself busy preparing posters , organizing a community newspaper , and establishing the " New Puli Community Development Foundation .

"  <TargetSentence>The effort to rebuild the community takes precedence over everything else , so it looks like Teng 's writing plans will have to be postponed .  </TargetSentence>One thing , however , remains certain -  </community.n.84><community.n.85>p. 96  <TargetSentence>The Wushe Incident was a taboo subject for many years in the academic community , but Teng Hsiang-yang 's interest was piqued when his father gave him two documents related to the incident .  </TargetSentence>p. 96  </community.n.85><community.n.86>On the eve of the 21st century , the people of Taiwan have completed a historic alternation of political parties in power .  <TargetSentence>This is not only the first of its kind in the history of the Republic of China , but also an epochal landmark for Chinese communities around the world .  </TargetSentence>Taiwan has not only set a new model for the Asian experience of democracy , but has also added an inspiring example to the third wave of democracy the world over .  </community.n.86><community.n.87>The 21st century will be a time when " the right to a quality life " and " a refined way of life " are much emphasized .  <TargetSentence>The government will find solutions for issues relating to the people 's lives , such as law and order , social welfare , environmental protection , land - use planning , waste disposal , river cleaning , transportation and community renewal .  </TargetSentence>It will also have to implement these solutions thoroughly .  </community.n.87><community.n.88>We will also encourage people to take up lifetime learning to fully develop their potential and creativity .  <TargetSentence>Grassroots community organizations are now developing around the country , working to explore and preserve the history , culture , geography and ecology of their localities .  </TargetSentence>These are all part of Taiwan culture , whether they are local cultures , mass cultures or high cultures .  </community.n.88><community.n.89>Rather , it has to be accumulated bit by bit .  <TargetSentence>We must open our hearts with tolerance and respect , so that our diverse ethnic groups and different regional cultures may communicate with each other , and so that Taiwan 's local cultures may connect with the cultures of Chinese - speaking communities and other world cultures , and create a new milieu of " a cultural Taiwan in a modern century . "  </TargetSentence>The September 21 earthquake that struck last year brought to our land and our compatriots an unprecedented catastrophe , the pain of which is yet to heal .  </community.n.89><community.n.90>Today , Taiwan is manifesting the elegance of a democratic island , once again attracting global attention , as the people on this land create a new page in our history .  <TargetSentence>We believe that the Republic of China , with its democratic achievements and technological and economic prowess , can certainly continue to play an indispensable role in the international community .  </TargetSentence>In addition to strengthening the existing relations with friendly nations , we want to actively participate in all types of international nongovernmental organizations .  </community.n.90><community.n.91>In addition to strengthening the existing relations with friendly nations , we want to actively participate in all types of international nongovernmental organizations .  <TargetSentence>Through humanitarian care , economic cooperation , cultural exchanges and various other ways , we will actively participate in international affairs , expand Taiwan 's room for survival in the international arena , and contribute to the welfare of the international community .  </TargetSentence>Besides , we are also willing to commit to a more active contribution in safeguarding international human rights .  </community.n.91><community.n.92>Chang admits that he still lives in a rented house in Tanshui .  <TargetSentence>His wife wonders why his colleagues in the financial management community are multi-millionaires , while he still has not had his rendezvous with fortune .  </TargetSentence>Chang tells his wife that one should not compare oneself to others .  </community.n.92><community.n.93>The performers spoke in both Mandarin and Taiwanese .  <TargetSentence>Because the language taboo has long carried heavy political undertones - the opposition has always preferred the use of Taiwanese , the ruling party has , until recently , almost exclusively favored Mandarin - the producers invited many people from the arts community to confirm that Taiwanese was essential for the program , so as to dispel the suspicions of those who would see political motives behind language choice .  </TargetSentence>Unfortunately , the effort was less than a complete success .  </community.n.93><community.n.94>Former foreign minister Jason Hu defends foreign aid by arguing that there are two kinds of countries in the world : those that help and those that need help .  <TargetSentence>In the past Taiwan was a recipient of American aid , so now that Taiwan has the economic power to return the favor to the international community , it should do so .  </TargetSentence>Moreover , explains Hu , " In fact the amount of money Taiwan spends on foreign assistance is very limited .  </community.n.94><community.n.95>Yet , so far , only the GIO has sent staff to diplomatic partners to coordinate , while the MOEA has not posted staff to all relevant overseas offices , " he says .  <TargetSentence>Greater effort and creativity is needed in economic diplomacy , which in turn requires more study and discussion among the political parties , businessmen , and the academic community , as well as greater flexibility and coordination in the MOFA and other government agencies .  </TargetSentence>Process vs. outcomes  </community.n.95><community.n.96>" Applying for entry to the UN demonstrates that Taiwan is a sovereign state and is qualified to be a UN member .  <TargetSentence>This reminds the international community to be aware of Taiwan 's existence .  </TargetSentence>In addition , from the perspective of the foreign ministry , efforts to re-enter the UN are not only excellent training for diplomatic personnel , but also provide a regular test of how secure relations are between the ROC and its diplomatic partner states , " explains Lo .  </community.n.96><community.n.97>Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe .  <TargetSentence>" The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented .  </TargetSentence>In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  </community.n.97><community.n.98>This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power .  <TargetSentence>Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  </TargetSentence>In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . "  </community.n.98><community.n.99>The old saying has it that " a person of high morals will never be alone . "  <TargetSentence>We now look with high hopes to the international community .  </TargetSentence></community.n.99><community.n.100>Many businesses were privately expecting that the Port of Taichung would be able to establish direct shipping links with the mainland , and were even hoping to attract " red capital " from across the strait .  <TargetSentence>They had visions of Taichung establishing important links to the Asia Pacific or even to the global community .  </TargetSentence>Much to these cities ' frustration , for ten years there has been no progress on the " three direct links . "  </community.n.100><community.n.101>Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei .  <TargetSentence>What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place outside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines .  </TargetSentence>With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  </community.n.101><community.n.102>With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  <TargetSentence>Oddly , as Taipei has gone out of its way to establish ties with the international community and trade with mainland China , it has , whether by intention or not , created distance between itself and the rest of Taiwan .  </TargetSentence>Chen Tung-sheng , who grew up in Shalu , Taichung County and has a strong Taiwanese consciousness , remarks that you simply ca n't get by without speaking Taiwanese south of the Chuoshui River .  </community.n.102><community.n.103>In Tseng 's view the coming decade will be key to determine whether the city can transform itself from a " city of immigrants and migrants " to a " city of residents . "  <TargetSentence>He is currently promoting a community development plan in the hope that neighborhoods full of strangers can pull together , and people living in Taipei can begin to regard it as their " new hometown . "  </TargetSentence>But does Tseng himself consider Taipei to be his " new hometown " ?  </community.n.103><community.n.104>" While many cities and counties want to rediscover their old sense of self , Taipei wants to invent a self-identity that it never had , " explains Tseng , getting at the crux of the difference .  <TargetSentence>And so , at the beginning of the year before last , Taipei City began instituting a system of " community planning masters . "  </TargetSentence>These unpaid volunteers selected by City Hall gather suggestions and criticisms from residents and communicate with the elected neighborhood chiefs .  </community.n.104><community.n.105>The revamping of Linpien started eight or nine years ago , when schoolteacher Tsao Chi-hung - now a DPP deputy in the national legislature - along with fellow members of the Linpien Residents ' Democracy Association launched a program to sweep the streets and keep the riverbank clean .  <TargetSentence>Wu Wu-ta , a plumber who runs the Democracy Association , says : " People were already doing their bit for the community over ten years ago , but not openly .  </TargetSentence>They swept the streets before dawn because they did n't want people to see them and call them crazy . "  </community.n.105><community.n.106>Dreaming by the river  <TargetSentence>" You ca n't go about community work in a standoffish way , and you certainly ca n't operate effectively from behind the scenes - you have to be out there at the front of things .  </TargetSentence>When local people see teachers and doctors coming out to collect trash , they feel encouraged to join in , " says Chen Chin-chao , a dentist who chairs the Linpien Natural History Conservation Association .  </community.n.106><community.n.107>" It 's not just about tidying up the environment .  <TargetSentence>We also hope to foster the commercial interests of the community so as to bring practical benefits for people 's lives . "  </TargetSentence>This was the thinking behind Tsao 's gathering together of various groups for the Wax Apple Festival .  </community.n.107><community.n.108>And what does Linpien have to offer that other districts in the county ca n't easily duplicate ?  <TargetSentence>Yang Hung-jen , a PhD student at National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Sociology , came to Linpien a year ago to research his thesis on the renewal of the local community .  </TargetSentence>" I had come to what was said to be the worst county in Taiwan for factionalism and corruption , " says Yang , " a place where the ground had sunk as much as three meters due to subsidence .  </community.n.108><community.n.109>Gao Xingjian , the first Chinese Nobel Laureate for literature , created quite a stir with his visit to the ninth Taipei International Book Exhibition -LRB- TIBE -RRB- , drawing large crowds of people hoping just to catch a glimpse of him .  <TargetSentence>Gao 's relationship with Taiwan goes back a number of years , and this visit to the TIBE marked his sixth to the island , where he is well known and has many friends in the literary community .  </TargetSentence>A Bible in hand  </community.n.109><community.n.110>James Soong has suggested defining Taiwan - PRC links as a " quasi-international relationship . "  <TargetSentence>This aims for a middle ground between the KMT 's " two states formula " and the PRC 's " one country , two systems " that will appeal to Taiwan , mainland China , and the international community .  </TargetSentence>But this idea has been criticized for unilaterally reducing Taiwan to the status of a " quasi-country , " thereby weakening Taiwan 's status and bargaining power vis-a-vis the mainland .  </community.n.110><community.n.111>Ting admits that in evaluating education platforms , the incumbent , Lien Chan , is at a relative disadvantage , because the policies currently being implemented are open to immediate scrutiny .  <TargetSentence>According to Ting , " Lien Chan has been at odds with the education community for a long time . "  </TargetSentence>Reformers are most disappointed that the education budget has been seriously squeezed these past few years , falling by as much as NT$ 40 billion in a single year .  </community.n.111><community.n.112>The government debt is currently NT$ 2.6 trillion , ten times higher than a decade ago ; if these promised education " checks " were actually cashed , the debt would pass NT$ 3 trillion .  <TargetSentence>Ting concludes : " He has lost his direction in terms of education policy , and he underestimates the education community .  </TargetSentence>He thinks he just has to promise to throw money around and then he 'll have people persuaded .

"  </TargetSentence>In the mountain forest above Hsiuluan 's outlying hamlet of Chenhsipao , bushes and creepers form a dense undergrowth , and a blanket of damp fallen leaves makes the going slippery underfoot .  </community.n.114><community.n.115>Maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety .  <TargetSentence>Or if you are a housewife , taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full-time job , then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization .  </TargetSentence>This would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment .  </community.n.115><community.n.116>At this point , Lu had little choice but to turn for help to Liu I-chang , a research fellow at the Institute of History and Philology .  <TargetSentence>Liu I-chang is renowned in the archeological community in Taiwan for his field research .  </TargetSentence>He has done the initial field work on dozens of important sites , including Shihsanhang , Tachuwei , and Peiyeh .  </community.n.116><community.n.117>Weighing only about 40 kilos , Law looks light enough to blow away in a strong wind , so it 's hard to imagine her barking out orders on a film set .  <TargetSentence>But when Law and her husband Eddie Fong were invited to attend the Taipei Film Festival last year , Fong , who is also a screenwriter and director , revealed , " Clara is very strong willed , and everyone in the Australian film community knows that she ca n't be pushed around and rarely compromises .
