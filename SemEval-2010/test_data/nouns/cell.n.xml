hit '' theory .  <TargetSentence>Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes .  </TargetSentence>Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible .  </cell.n.14><cell.n.15>Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer .  <TargetSentence>The team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell .  </TargetSentence>By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors , they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome .  </cell.n.15><cell.n.16>The team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell .  <TargetSentence>By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors , they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome .  </TargetSentence>The finding riveted medicine .  </cell.n.16><cell.n.17>It was an audacious claim .  <TargetSentence>But in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believed Dr. Knudson was right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers .  </TargetSentence>His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor .  </cell.n.17><cell.n.18>Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage .  <TargetSentence>They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells .  </TargetSentence>Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .  </cell.n.18><cell.n.19>Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage .  <TargetSentence>They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells .  </TargetSentence>Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .  </cell.n.19><cell.n.20>`` It was the confirming evidence we all needed that -LCB- gene -RCB- losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , '' says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City .  <TargetSentence>But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full - blown malignancy .  </TargetSentence>They focused on chromosome 17 .  </cell.n.20><cell.n.21>They focused on chromosome 17 .  <TargetSentence>For months the Johns Hopkins researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells .  </TargetSentence>Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene .  </cell.n.21><cell.n.22>When they found it last winter , Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over .  <TargetSentence>His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher , Arnold Levine , had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones .  </TargetSentence>The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 .  </cell.n.22><cell.n.23>But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth .  <TargetSentence>Despite that , when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical ; it turned out that in Mr. Levine 's cancer studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer - suppressing gene .  </TargetSentence>The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says Robert Weinberg , a leader in cancer - gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass .  </cell.n.23><cell.n.24>The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer .  <TargetSentence>In a report out last week , John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene .  </TargetSentence>There also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers .  </cell.n.24><cell.n.25>It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures , the company says .  <TargetSentence>But New York state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no .

year - old Simon Macharia has had the unenviable task of trying to explain to policemen that he has n't fallen asleep drunk on a pavement , but has simply been confused .  <TargetSentence>Since the bombing he has had psychological problems and has found himself locked in a police cell on three occasions after being picked up .  </TargetSentence>Simon lived in one of Nairobi 's sprawling slums and he has had to give up his job delivering milk because of a hand injury sustained in the blast .  </cell.n.77><cell.n.78>Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make - up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals .  <TargetSentence>The free radicals are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die .  </TargetSentence>Andrew Levi says there are three different types of haptoglobin and he and his colleagues at Israel 's Technion Institute have found that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1 - 1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not .  </cell.n.78><cell.n.79>Patients with advanced Parkinson 's are easy to spot .  <TargetSentence>Degeneration of brain cells or neurons causes them to shake , shuffle and stoop .  </TargetSentence>The neurons produce less and less of the chemical dopamine that helps relay signals between them .  </cell.n.79><cell.n.80> <TargetSentence>It works as a protectant of the cell so to stop the disease in its tracks .  </TargetSentence> </cell.n.80><cell.n.81>The stimulating brain protein his team used is called GDNF .  <TargetSentence>Previous studies have shown that GDNF keeps dopamine cells healthy but the problem has been getting it to the brain .  </TargetSentence>As a defense , the brain 's blood vessels prevent most compounds from entering from the blood stream making it difficult to design a Parkinson 's drug .  </cell.n.81><cell.n.82>To transport the gene , Louisiane University researchers devised an HIV virus stripped of its infecting machinery .  <TargetSentence>When they injected the altered virus into brains of aging animals with early Parkinson 's it conveyed the attached GDNF gene efficiently , causing dopamine cells to produce the rescue protein on site .  </TargetSentence> </cell.n.82><cell.n.83> <TargetSentence>It would be better because you would n't have to take medication and you would n't have to do cell transplantation either .  </TargetSentence>It might be a treatment that you would have to do only once or perhaps a few times during life with the illness .  </cell.n.83><cell.n.84> <TargetSentence>Mr. Olson says the treatment might also be applied to other brain diseases in which nerve cells degenerate , but he warns of a major hurdle in assuring patients get the proper dose of gene therapy because too much is bad .  </TargetSentence> </cell.n.84></cell.n.test>
