"  <TargetSentence>Little Ho-ho , a student at the Yungho Wanghsi Primary School , is showing off to his aunt some Taiwanese - language lines he learned from television .  </TargetSentence>Ho-ho is a typical child of a northern Taiwan mainlander family -LRB- i.e. a family which came to Taiwan from mainland China only after WWII -RRB- .  </television.n.72><television.n.73>" And now , because of the trend in society of reviving Taiwanese as the mother tongue , Taiwanese drama has been able to leap into prime time to become the mainstream offering in the past few years . "  <TargetSentence>The 8:00 p.m. time slot has long been the flagship and leading money maker for television stations .  </TargetSentence>For a program to get into this slot , besides being commercially viable , in the past it also had to be politically correct .  </television.n.73><television.n.74>Because the government wanted to promote Mandarin , Taiwanese was officially seen as a rustic dialect , and was never eligible for prime time .  <TargetSentence>The three government - run television stations of that era - China Television -LRB- CTV -RRB- , Chinese Television Service -LRB- CTS -RRB- , and Taiwan Television -LRB- TTV -RRB- - had a tacit agreement that they would only show Taiwanese programs at noon or in the 6:30 p.m. time slot , when most viewers would be housewives and elderly people .  </TargetSentence>The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters - in - law and the like , or family comedies .  </television.n.74><television.n.75>For one thing , stereotypes remained strong , and Love still retained many of the old traditions , being a tragic small family drama focusing on a young bride facing hard times after moving into the husband 's home .  <TargetSentence>Moreover , because of opposition from high officials at the television network , after several episodes , the performers who had previously spoken in Taiwanese had their dialogue changed to " Mandarin with a Taiwanese accent . "  </TargetSentence>However , because the plot was realistic , ratings were unprecedented , and Love even defeated Widow 's Watch , based on a novel by , and also produced by , the vastly popular romance writer Chiung Yao , and broadcast on CTV .  </television.n.75><television.n.76>The government around that time adopted a policy of allowing producers to go to mainland China to film , and there was a sudden craze for martial arts series and love stories framed against a mainland backdrop .  <TargetSentence>Still , television stations and producers had awakened to the existence of an audience for " nativist " Taiwanese drama .  </TargetSentence>After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising .  </television.n.76><television.n.77>This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 .  <TargetSentence>Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history - Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh .  </TargetSentence>It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  </television.n.77><television.n.78>Lin explains : " I always want to write a Taiwanese drama against the backdrop of great events , and the February 28 Incident was at that time just beginning to get intensive open discussion , so there was a lot of commercial viability as well . "  <TargetSentence>Owing to the series ' popularity , lead actor Lun Hsiao-hua has become a major television star , while female lead Chen Mei-feng established her image as a traditional Taiwanese woman of gentility and virtue , and has since gotten numerous roles and television commercials .  </TargetSentence>However , says Lin with a laugh , things did n't go exactly as she expected .  </television.n.78><television.n.79>Lin explains : " I always want to write a Taiwanese drama against the backdrop of great events , and the February 28 Incident was at that time just beginning to get intensive open discussion , so there was a lot of commercial viability as well .

"  </television.n.81><television.n.82>" Rather than say that serials are a mirror of life , it would be better to say that people identify with the characters in these dramas even if their own lives are not as dramatic . "  <TargetSentence>These are the terms used by Tsai Yen , a professor in the department of broadcasting and television at National Chengchi University .  </TargetSentence>This is particularly the case for older people and housewives .  </television.n.82><television.n.83>Because the series was so popular , FTV seized the opportunity and presented a sequel based on the loves and hates of the third generation , which , as expected , also was very well received .  <TargetSentence>Springtime Stepmother 's Heart pulled FTV financially out of the red and into the black , and is considered an extremely remarkable event in Taiwan television history .  </TargetSentence>Executive chairman Chen Kang-hsin proudly calls the new format developed by FTV " contemporary drama . "  </television.n.83><television.n.84>She says that in order to keep up with the audience 's ever - changing tastes , scripts are being rewritten right up to the last minute .  <TargetSentence>Naturally television actors do not have the luxury that movie actors enjoy of allowing themselves time to slowly get in the right frame of mind for a role or scene , but even so , given the fact that TV actors must rely almost exclusively on dialogue and body language to keep the audience 's attention , the fact that shooting is so hurried not only waters down the quality of the performance , there is little time even to get the lines right .  </TargetSentence>Such conditions , she feels , make for productions that are really too rough around the edges .  </television.n.84><television.n.85>Such conditions , she feels , make for productions that are really too rough around the edges .  <TargetSentence>Chou You , who has produced more than 4,000 hours of dramatic series for television , says that prime time is like a battlefield for television stations .  </TargetSentence>Sometimes the producer ca n't call the shots .  </television.n.85><television.n.86>Such conditions , she feels , make for productions that are really too rough around the edges .  <TargetSentence>Chou You , who has produced more than 4,000 hours of dramatic series for television , says that prime time is like a battlefield for television stations .  </TargetSentence>Sometimes the producer ca n't call the shots .  </television.n.86><television.n.87>With the practical environment being what it is , people will simply have to think their way out of its limitations .  <TargetSentence>" ON programming is simply the way Taiwan television works .  </TargetSentence>If the station strategy is set up that way , it 's unlikely they will change .  </television.n.87><television.n.88>Developing overseas markets  <TargetSentence>Taiwanese television serials have always sold well abroad .  </TargetSentence>But some people are concerned that an overemphasis on Taiwanese themes and language will stifle the development of overseas sales .  </television.n.88><television.n.89>Lien himself says that , after more than 20 years in appointive positions , he has developed a stern mien .  <TargetSentence>Moreover , his appearances on television have often been at confrontational interpellation sessions in front of the legislature or the provincial assembly , so that his warmer side does not come across .  </TargetSentence>A little story in the book relates something of his sense of humor .  </television.n.89><television.n.90>Today , they 're getting a chance to express themselves through external beauty , and can show a softer side .  <TargetSentence>He Tu-lin , a tall and handsome television star , declared his own opinion -
