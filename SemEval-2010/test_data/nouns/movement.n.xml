<movement.n.test><movement.n.1>On October 31 , 1993 , the Standing Committee of the 8th NPC formally passed the " Laws of the PRC Red Cross Society " , reflecting the state 's high-level recognition and support of the humanitarian cause of the Red Cross .  <TargetSentence>It has provided a legal guarantee to the development of China 's Red Cross cause and connections with the International Red Cross movement , signifying that China 's Red Cross cause has entered a new historical phase .  </TargetSentence>The list of leadership of the 6th session of China 's Red Cross Society approved at today 's meeting includes : Puchu Zhao , Guangying Wang , Peiyao Li , Xinzhong Qian , Yueli Cui and Minzhang Chen as honorary vice-chairman ; Zhengying Qian , vice-chairman of the CPPCC , as chairman ; Yingqi Gu as standing vice-chairman ; Baojun Fan , Chongchun Yang , Yanzhi Lin , Baiqiu Sun and Zhe Qu as vice-chairman ; and Changming Li as secretary general .  </movement.n.1><movement.n.2>Today in Zhongnanhai , General Secretary of the Communist Party of China , President of the country and honorary President of China 's Red Cross , Zemin Jiang met with representatives of the 6th National Member Congress of China 's Red Cross , and expressed warm greetings to the 20 million hardworking members on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and State Council .  <TargetSentence>Zemin Jiang said , the China 's Red Cross is an international social aid organization engaged in humanitarian works , and for the past ninety years has done lots of good works for the people and made a lot of contributions to the development of the country , in accordance to the basic principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement .  </TargetSentence>It has won the respect and support of the masses through real action .  </movement.n.2><movement.n.3>The last gymnast was Russian S. Georgina , who staked everything on her last performance .  <TargetSentence>Although her movements were smooth , she earned a score of 9.875 due to a lower level of difficulty and picked up the silver medal .  </TargetSentence>Georgina 's fellow team member D. Cochetegiva won the bronze medal with a score of 9.850 .  </movement.n.3><movement.n.4>Jian Zhang , the head of Chinese delegation , commented that the scores of male gymnasts were the worst in the last 10 years , and explained that levels were falling .  <TargetSentence>However , all 3 women gymnasts , Li Luo , Ya Qiao and Huilan Mo , taking part in the internationals for the first time , performed well , because they had strong events and their movements had difficulty .  </TargetSentence>There was almost an upset in the finals of the men 's floor exercise .  </movement.n.4><movement.n.5>The chamber voted 231 - 191 , 51 votes short of the two - thirds majority needed to overturn the president 's veto of legislation renewing support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest .  <TargetSentence>The roll call was considered an illustration of the limits of power that the resurgent abortion - rights movement faces .  </TargetSentence>The legislation was part of a $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health .  </movement.n.5><movement.n.6>The Democratic - controlled House , by a margin of 51 votes , failed to override President Bush 's veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest .  <TargetSentence>The 231 - 191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a resurgent abortion - rights movement still faces .  </TargetSentence>It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two - thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush .  </movement.n.6><movement.n.7>The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape - and - incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote .  <TargetSentence>By comparison , Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement .  </TargetSentence>Only 42 GOP members opposed the president 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape - and - incest exemption last year .  </movement.n.7><movement.n.8>At a recent White House meeting , Rep. Silvio Conte -LRB- R. , Mass. -RRB- , the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee , argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto , and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday , they are plainly uncomfortable with his position .  <TargetSentence>`` This is n't a political issue , this is a moral issue , '' said Rep. Henry Hyde -LRB- R. , Ill. -RRB- , the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement .  </TargetSentence>But after years of using the issue for its benefit , the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive .  </movement.n.8><movement.n.9>In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church - state powers , Rep. Robert Dornan -LRB- R. , Calif . -RRB- lectured his fellow Roman Catholics -- including Mr. Florio -- for having the `` chutzpah '' to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion .  <TargetSentence>Rep. Les AuCoin was as blunt on behalf of the abortion - rights movement .  </TargetSentence>`` This may not make George Bush a one - term president , '' said the Oregon liberal , addressing the Republican side of the House .  </movement.n.9><movement.n.10>On many issues -- flag - burning , for instance -- his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts .  <TargetSentence>But Mr. Bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue , failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion - rights movement would be aroused following last summer 's Supreme Court decision to restrict those rights in the Webster case .  </TargetSentence>`` It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes I 've ever seen , '' says former Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin .  </movement.n.10><movement.n.11>He fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems .  <TargetSentence>After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small .  </TargetSentence>Such caution was evident after the recent Friday - the - 13th stock market plunge .  </movement.n.11><movement.n.12>The focus of the outcry has been stock - index arbitrage , which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on .  <TargetSentence>Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets , but critics say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash .  </TargetSentence>The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading .  </movement.n.12><movement.n.13>It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange - rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , which links the major EC currencies .  <TargetSentence>At a June EC summit , Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership , saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements .  </TargetSentence>Since then , the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join .  </movement.n.13><movement.n.14>The gatherings in East Berlin and elsewhere were viewed as part of a government effort to stop activists from staging protests to press their demands .  <TargetSentence>Dissidents in Czechoslovakia said the nation 's pro-democracy movement was growing despite the government 's move to crush a protest Saturday in Prague 's Wenceslas Square .  </TargetSentence>More than 10,000 demonstrators had called for free elections and the resignation of Communist Party leader Milos Jakes .  </movement.n.14><movement.n.15>China 's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony .  <TargetSentence>The two , Szeto Wah and Martin Lee , were deemed unfit because they had condemned China 's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement .  </TargetSentence>The committee is formulating Hong Kong 's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997 , and Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return if they `` abandon their antagonistic stand against the Chinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino - British joint declaration on Hong Kong . ''  </movement.n.15><movement.n.16>Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ?  <TargetSentence>Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader , the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement .  </TargetSentence>In either case , ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience .  </movement.n.16><movement.n.17>Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ?  <TargetSentence>Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader , the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement .  </TargetSentence>In either case , ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience .  </movement.n.17><movement.n.18>Thousands of East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia after the East Berlin government lifted travel restrictions .  <TargetSentence>The ban on cross-border movement was imposed last month after a massive exodus of emigres to West Germany .  </TargetSentence>Also , a Communist official for the first time said the future of the Berlin Wall could be open to discussion .  </movement.n.18><movement.n.19>The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats .  <TargetSentence>They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , they report in Nature , a scientific journal .  </TargetSentence>They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow .  </movement.n.19><movement.n.20><TargetSentence>In Poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics .  </TargetSentence>Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which I attended last month .  </movement.n.20><movement.n.21>Freon , introduced in 1930 , revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all .  <TargetSentence>One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way .  </TargetSentence>Du Pont , as it happens , has a potential substitute for CFCs .  </movement.n.21><movement.n.22>`` The affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University .  <TargetSentence>Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .  </TargetSentence>The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war - related violence , was a landmark .  </movement.n.22><movement.n.23>Most of all though , the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso .  <TargetSentence>What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard - bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s .  </TargetSentence>He was n't protecting the Freedom Marchers ; he was tailing them as subversives .  </movement.n.23><movement.n.24>`` He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score .  <TargetSentence>There 's a beautiful , Coplandesque motif -- he 'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement ...  </TargetSentence>The only time the violin has it is right at the end .  </movement.n.24><movement.n.25>John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal - rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal - Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch - elm - disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules .  <TargetSentence>Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country is n't their concern or that a David Baltimore could have somehow placated a John Dingell .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- Mr. Dingell , by the way , has decreed another NIH investigation of the Baltimore paper , adding to several previous investigations .  </movement.n.25><movement.n.26>`` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago - based group .  <TargetSentence>`` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .  </TargetSentence></movement.n.26><movement.n.27>`` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago - based group .  <TargetSentence>`` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .  </TargetSentence></movement.n.27><movement.n.28>In addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down .  <TargetSentence>The animal - rights movement has n't helped sales .  </TargetSentence>Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand , too , furriers complain .  </movement.n.28><movement.n.29>`` We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter ... and no one would have heard us . ''  <TargetSentence>New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women 's - rights movement this year .  </TargetSentence>The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures .  </movement.n.29><movement.n.30>Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy , at least in the workplace .  <TargetSentence>By summer , an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before .  </TargetSentence>But they are stalwart socialists .  </movement.n.30><movement.n.31>Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia .  <TargetSentence>But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing .  </TargetSentence>`` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu .  </movement.n.31><movement.n.32>Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market .  <TargetSentence>In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital - the government will be able to draw on an NT$ 500 billion fund .  </TargetSentence>This law has been criticized by academics as a serious distortion of the market mechanism , as putting the policy makers into the position of being market players , and as inevitably creating opportunities for insider trading and the manipulation of the market to the benefit of a privileged few .  </movement.n.32><movement.n.33>Meanwhile , numerous gyms , billing themselves as " recreation clubs , " have opened in the cities of Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung .  <TargetSentence>A national movement  </TargetSentence>Seeking to find market niches , various clubs are targeting specific market segments .  </movement.n.33><movement.n.34>These collections helped to delineate the history of Taiwanese music .  <TargetSentence>In the past decade , with the rise of the " Taiwan first " movement in politics , Hsu 's folk music collections have garnered more and more attention , and CDs of them have been released one after another .  </TargetSentence>In the last few years , Hsu was appointed both as national policy advisor to the president and as the chairman of the National Culture and Arts Foundation .  </movement.n.34><movement.n.35>The winner of the prize for fine art in last year 's National Culture and Arts Foundation Awards - one of the highest honors for an artist in Taiwan - was contemporary painter Hsia Yang .  <TargetSentence>Hsia first became a leading light on the Taiwan art scene back in the 1950s , as one of the " Eight Great Outlaws " who launched the island 's modern art movement .  </TargetSentence>Since then his artistic vocation has taken him around the world , and he has at last ended up back in Taiwan .  </movement.n.35><movement.n.36>At the beginning of September , the Taipei City government broke new ground by sponsoring a gay pride festival .  <TargetSentence>It even invited Michael Bronski , a leader of the gay pride movement in the United States .  </TargetSentence>The event was fiercely opposed by the Presbyterian church and other groups in Taiwan , but it clearly earned points with foreigners who participated enthusiastically and saw it as an embrace of tolerance and diversity .  </movement.n.36><movement.n.37>In order to prepare for a merger at any moment , financial officers must get used to the idea that " the company itself is its our biggest product . "  <TargetSentence>In the past , financial officers focused on cost management , cash flow , capital movement and risk avoidance .  </TargetSentence>From now on , looking at these wo n't be enough , and financial officers ought to turn their attention to mergers and raising capital .  </movement.n.37><movement.n.38>And if you live in a large family with plenty of old folk and youngsters - all expecting red envelopes of cash - your hard - earned year - end bonus may well be gone by the time New Year is over .  <TargetSentence>In recent years , New Year has increasingly shown up on the agenda of the women 's movement .  </TargetSentence>Many women now object to the tradition of spending New Year 's Eve with the family of their spouse , rather than at the homes of their own parents , and point out that this is one of the nasty little legacies of a patriarchal society , something which goes against the modern principle of sex equality .  </movement.n.38><movement.n.39>Again , when it comes Taiwan 's biggest export item , finished fabrics , these too are largely limited to apparel fabrics , with few companies getting involved in other areas despite their potential .  <TargetSentence>For instance , Taiwan has been struck by many landslides in recent years , and requires large quantities of geotextiles - heavy-grade textiles laid under or around civil engineering structures to prevent erosion by groundwater movement .  </TargetSentence>The currently planned high-speed rail system alone is expected to require several million yards of geotextiles .  </movement.n.39><movement.n.40>" The trees have been growing by themselves for tens of thousands of years , so why would they need human help for their saplings to grow ? "  <TargetSentence>In response to this situation a popular movement sprang up to push for the establishment of a " cypress forest national park , " in the hope that with national park status , the last remaining virgin Taiwan yellow cypress forest could be saved .  </TargetSentence>Perhaps the millennium year was a decisive one for the trees , for the Executive Yuan allocated new funds to the VACRS so that it no longer needs to cut down trees to bolster its finances , and also approved a plan to set up a national park .  </movement.n.40><movement.n.41>Until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility .  <TargetSentence>For instance , today 's middle-aged Chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .  </TargetSentence>They set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large .  </movement.n.41><movement.n.42>The teacher explains the basic pattern then the class begins a game of charades .  <TargetSentence>Children mime movements at the front of the class : swimming , dancing , jumping , running etc , and their classmates have to use English to describe what they 're doing .  </TargetSentence>Next is story telling time ; today 's story is about a child who just ca n't stop sneezing .  </movement.n.42><movement.n.43>Last week at a convention in Omaha Nebraska Bob and Mary Schindler called Terri 's death quote judicial homicide and hinted that euthanasia advocates may have been behind it /.  <TargetSentence>The Schindlers also have been fighting the right to die movement through the Terri Schindler Schiavo foundation /.  </TargetSentence>No doubt when those books come out we 'll be hearing about this case for quite some time to come /.  </movement.n.43><movement.n.44>but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom you want /.  <TargetSentence>And the brave reporters who are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.  </TargetSentence>And therefore it 's limited /.  </movement.n.44><movement.n.45>and I really think it 's because people do n't real- /-  <TargetSentence>We have got to -- the- there 's no reason that there should n't be a nationwide movement to stop these people . To have them register a- at the very least have them their driver 's licenses /.  </TargetSentence>If they do n't they go on a most wanted list /.  </movement.n.45><movement.n.46>and this is how it was captured in the paper /.  <TargetSentence>Russian officials collected intelligence on ~US troop movements and attack plans from inside the American military command leading the two thousand and three invasion of Iraq and passed that information on to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein according to a ~US military study /.  </TargetSentence>The intelligence report which the study said were provided to Hussein through the Russian ambassador in Baghdad during the height of the ~US assault warned accurately that American formations intended to bypass Iraqi cities on their thrust towards Baghdad /.  </movement.n.46><movement.n.47>ABC 's John Miller reports .  <TargetSentence>Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of Aden including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects .  </TargetSentence>This house on Al Zaharah Street half a mile from the port is where investigators believe the bomb was built into the boat that carried it .  </movement.n.47><movement.n.48>Fighting springs from the funerals for at least nine Palestinians killed Friday in some of the worst clashes in this three - week conflict .  <TargetSentence>A new intifada , successor to the four - year street campaign that ended with Palestinian / Israeli negotiations a decade ago , according to a leader of Yasser Arafat 's Fateh movement .  </TargetSentence>A counterview from Dan Meridor , chairman of Israel 's defense and foreign affairs committee .  </movement.n.48><movement.n.49>One body was found after Israelis responded with small arms , tanks and helicopters from Lebanon .  <TargetSentence>The Hezbollah movement which waged a war of attrition with the Israelis before they withdrew from south Lebanon in May , says its fighters were not involved .  </TargetSentence>As the weeks wear on , the words of diplomats and leaders seem more and more irrelevant .  </movement.n.49><movement.n.50>A United Nations special envoy is warning of a `` increasingly desperate '' situation for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank .  <TargetSentence>Israeli security restrictions on cross-border movement have cut humanitarian aid and fuel supplies to the Palestinian territories .  </TargetSentence>At a Cairo meeting of the Arab League , Finance Ministers agreed on a method to funnel up to $ 1 billion in support to Palestinians in their uprising against Israel .  </movement.n.50><movement.n.51> <TargetSentence>The intifada , the spontaneous 1987 Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation , heralded the rise of the Muslim fundamentalism , in what had been a mostly secular Palestinian movement .  </TargetSentence>The most popular of these groups Hamas , an acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement .  </movement.n.51><movement.n.52> <TargetSentence>Hamas is an Islamic movement .  </TargetSentence>At the very beginning , it was encouraged by Israel because they thought it was a counter weight to Palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement .  </movement.n.52><movement.n.53>Hamas is an Islamic movement .  <TargetSentence>At the very beginning , it was encouraged by Israel because they thought it was a counter weight to Palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement .  </TargetSentence> </movement.n.53><movement.n.54>We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools .  <TargetSentence>We 've got a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the state of Texas .  </TargetSentence> </movement.n.54><movement.n.55>Did they have some other overriding concerns ?  <TargetSentence>The US has been attempting to support movements for democratization in Yemen and there has been some attempts to buttress the government of Ali Abdullah Saleh and I believe that this is directly tied into that .  </TargetSentence>There were elections held , I believe , a year or so ago .  </movement.n.55><movement.n.56>The government is pinning hopes of ending the conflict on what it calls Plan Colombia .  <TargetSentence>A seven and a half billion dollar package is designed to push the left wing guerillas towards a peace deal by stemming the lucrative drug trade that finances their movements .  </TargetSentence>As we 'll hear in a moment , the American role in Plan Colombia could be one of the initial foreign policy dilemmas to face the next U.S. President , but first we go to the Colombian city of Beranka Bremeha , where as The World 's Steven Doddly reports , the killing and the suffering continue .  </movement.n.56><movement.n.57>The President is locked in a power struggle with former intelligence service chief Vladimiro Monticenos .  <TargetSentence>Mr. Fujimori told reporters late Wednesday , he ordered a complete freeze on movements by the Armed Forces .  </TargetSentence>President Fujimori has been leading a purge of the military of those loyal to Mr. Monticenos , the former spy master , whose surprise return to Peru on Monday triggered speculation of a possible coup .  </movement.n.57><movement.n.58>The Navy now says the blast occurred nearly two hours after the destroyer had moored for refueling in Aden Harbor , not during the mooring operation itself .  <TargetSentence>Originally Navy officials said a small boat that assisted in securing the ship 's lines or whose movements were masked by the mooring operation pulled aside the Cole and blew up in an apparent suicide attack .  </TargetSentence>A Navy spokesman , Commander Greg Smith offers no new explanation of the circumstances leading to the blast , saying that is now a matter for criminal investigators .  </movement.n.58><movement.n.59> <TargetSentence>The researchers report in the journal Science that the gene therapy also restored coordinated movement in young monkeys in which Parkinson 's was chemically induced .  </TargetSentence>The benefits of the treatment appear permanent or at least very long - lasting as GDNF genes continually produce the rescue protein .  </movement.n.59><movement.n.60>To that end , Yugoslavia will be a trustful neighbor and a conscientious member of the international community and will invest its best efforts to promote peace and stability in the region , as well as worldwide .  <TargetSentence>Mr. Slevonovich also thanked those nations that supported the democratic movement in Yugoslavia in what he called a hard and often uphill battle .  </TargetSentence>Breck Ardery , VOA News , at the United Nations .  </movement.n.60><movement.n.61>Meanwhile , Israel has confiscated the VIP card of a senior Palestinian official .  <TargetSentence>Colonel Taffiq Terrawi , a director of Palestinian intelligence , was briefly detained by Israeli soldiers at a West Bank road block , where they confiscated an Israeli permit that grants him free movement in and out of the area .  </TargetSentence></movement.n.61><movement.n.62>Meanwhile , Israel has confiscated the VIP car to the senior Palestinian official .  <TargetSentence>Colonel Taufiq Tarawi , a director of Palestinian intelligence was briefly detained by Israeli soldiers at a West Bank roadblock , where they confiscated an Israeli permit that grants him free movement in and out of the area .  </TargetSentence></movement.n.62><movement.n.63>Israeli tanks are blocking main roads in the Gaza Strip effectively isolating and partitioning the Palestinian ruled area .  <TargetSentence>Israel moved to tighten its restrictions on Palestinian movement after a Monday night bomb attack in the Israeli city of Natanya .  </TargetSentence>There has been more gunfire in the Palestinian territories with injuries to Israelis and Palestinians .  </movement.n.63></movement.n.test>
