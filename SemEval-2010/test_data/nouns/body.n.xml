"  <TargetSentence>The reaction by a minority of NA delegates to the grand justices ' constitutional interpretation once again triggered displeasure in society at the body 's refusal to admit its fallibility .  </TargetSentence>Activists in groups such as the Taipei Society and the Association of Taiwanese University Professors organized a street demonstration to call for the dissolution of the National Assembly .  </body.n.37><body.n.38>A further consequence of the grand justices ' ruling was that an election would have to be held to produce a new National Assembly membership before the conclusion of the current term .  <TargetSentence>While this development had would -
