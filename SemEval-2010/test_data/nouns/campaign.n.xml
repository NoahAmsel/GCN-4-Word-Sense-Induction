be candidates in all parties scrambling to launch election campaigns , by late March the post-presidential-election situation , combined with pressure from public opinion , pushed the KMT to work with the DPP on means to phase out the National Assembly , despite the KMT 's previous opposition to the body 's complete dissolution in the name of preserving the constitutional structure .  </TargetSentence>For a time , the question of whether to hold elections for the National Assembly , as well as the DPP and KMT 's shared policy for phasing out the body , were viewed as motivated by fear of the growth of the People First Party -LRB- PFP -RRB- .  </campaign.n.56><campaign.n.57>Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  <TargetSentence>On December 15 the Ministry of Justice released the results of the first six months of its campaign against black gold -LRB- i.e. collusion among politicians , crime syndicates and big business -RRB- .  </TargetSentence>In the period up to December 10 , prosecutors around Taiwan dealt with more than 2,000 cases concerning black-gold offenses , brought charges against 30 elected officials and representatives , and found over NT$ 2.59 billion in misappropriated public funds .  </campaign.n.57><campaign.n.58>However , the amendment remains stuck in the legislative queue for the time being .  <TargetSentence>In addition to the Ministry of Justice , the Criminal Investigation Bureau has also scored some successes in the past few months in its campaign against crime syndicates .  </TargetSentence>In early November the leader of the Four Seas Gang , Yang Kuang-nan , who had been arrested in Shanghai by mainland authorities , was transferred to Taiwanese custody in the transit lounge at Macau Airport and brought back to Taiwan for questioning .  </campaign.n.58><campaign.n.59>That is why TCAC has been able to carry out so many activities over the past three years without spending any money .  <TargetSentence>Peipu residents have taken part enthusiastically in recycling campaigns , flea markets , and post-harvest yam roasts , and events of this nature have even drawn participants from out of town .  </TargetSentence>According to Chiang Yi-sen , when TCAC organized a camping trip last year , participants from Chutung , Toufen , and elsewhere actually outnumbered the locals .  </campaign.n.59><campaign.n.60>Most notably , the people of Peipu have begun to sense the value of what they 've got in their community .  <TargetSentence>The campaign to beautify Peipu 's Hsia Street is an excellent case in point .  </TargetSentence>Seven years ago , in order to ease the problem of increasing traffic congestion , the township widened Hsia Street .  </campaign.n.60><campaign.n.61>Fortunately , the people of Peipu quickly realized their mistake .  <TargetSentence>Last year TCAC applied to the Council for Cultural Affairs for authorization to carry out a campaign to beautify Hsia Street .  </TargetSentence>The residents did everything they could to restore something of their former neighborhood .  </campaign.n.61><campaign.n.62>The gaily lit Hsia Street seems almost to have returned to an earlier time .  <TargetSentence>It might be impossible for Hsia Street to ever be exactly the same as it once was , but the beautification campaign taught the people of Peipu the value of what they have .  </TargetSentence>When the town hall made plans to rip up the stone steps on the long pathway leading up the mountainside at Hsiuluan Park and replace them with imported stone , local citizens protested , asking the town hall to leave the steps as they were .  </campaign.n.62><campaign.n.63>Every one of the lilting melodies carries with it a nugget of Hakka culture .  <TargetSentence>Even more interestingly , the teacher makes up lyrics about the river preservation campaign and sets them to traditional folk melodies , thus melding the old and the new .  </TargetSentence>In the class on local history , the participants themselves do all the talking .  </campaign.n.63><campaign.n.64>Says Shu Shih-wei , " By sharing our experiences we can get everybody to take an active interest in the changes that are taking place in the local community . "  <TargetSentence>Outgrowths of the class include the river preservation campaign and a guidebook for tourists interested in learning about environmental issues and local history .  </TargetSentence>Says Shu , " Forget about all the high-falutin' talk about ' urban redevelopment ' and whatnot - everyone cares about what goes on in their town .  </campaign.n.64><campaign.n.65>We believe that the end of an election is the beginning of reconciliation .  <TargetSentence>After the curtain falls on emotional campaigns , rationality should prevail .  </TargetSentence>Under the supreme principles of national interest and the welfare of the people , those in power and in opposition should both fulfill their mandates given by the people and realize the ideals of fair competition in multiparty politics , as well as the checks and balances of democratic politics .  </campaign.n.65><campaign.n.66>Placing national interests above those of political parties , we should solidify the will of the people and seek consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , to promote the country 's progress and reforms .  <TargetSentence>" A government for all people " and " rule by the clean and upright " are promises I made to the people during the campaign period .  </TargetSentence>They are also Taiwan 's key to stepping over its fault lines and rising to a higher level in the future .  </campaign.n.66><campaign.n.67>In addition to these four , former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang , having failed to win the nomination of his party , withdrew from the DPP and is running as an independent .  <TargetSentence>Since the campaign began in earnest , Lien , Chen , and Soong have been getting roughly similar numbers in public opinion polls , with about a quarter of the electorate undecided .  </TargetSentence>With the election so close at hand , and the situation so uncertain , naturally the media and society have been focused on analyzing the election battle itself .  </campaign.n.67><campaign.n.68>Another significant possibility is that New Party members , who tend to support James Soong , could organize a brand-new political party with remnant Soong backers after the election .  <TargetSentence>Shao Tsung-hai , a professor at National Chengchih University and a campaign staffer for James Soong , states : Soong has reiterated that he personally has no intention of organizing a new political party after the election .  </TargetSentence>But the political forces that support him will necessarily have to organize themselves in some fashion .  </campaign.n.68><campaign.n.69>The people of Taipei can be proud of their high level of education and earnings and their discipline .  <TargetSentence>When Chen Shui-bian was mayor he launched a major campaign against the sex industry , enforced laws against drinking and driving , and required motorcycle drivers to wear helmets .  </TargetSentence>Even Taipei residents themselves were surprised at their ability to accept such high standards .  </campaign.n.69><campaign.n.70>He also responded positively to the Legislative Yuan 's indication of its support for the goal of a " nuclear - free homeland .

like on the campaign trail , critics complain some appearances have all the excitement of a Defense Department briefing .  </TargetSentence> </campaign.n.132><campaign.n.133>What 's the truth ?  <TargetSentence>Are Bush and Gore making campaign promises they ca n't possibly keep ?  </TargetSentence>The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities did an exhaustive study of the surplus .  </campaign.n.133><campaign.n.134><TargetSentence>As we heard from David Gregory , one of Governor Bush 's main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid of partisan gridlock in Washington , which was exactly what the President was talking about today -- an attempt to reopen debate on a $ 240 billion tax cut plan , saying the version House Republicans passed is unacceptable , because it is unfair , according to the President , to children and seniors .  </TargetSentence> </campaign.n.134><campaign.n.135><TargetSentence>While the two campaigns struggle over the outcome of the presidential election , tomorrow , in Washington , a high profile ceremony will be held on the Mall to mark the overdue beginning of a World War II memorial , but not even that moment is without controversy .  </TargetSentence>Here 's Jim Miklaszewski .  </campaign.n.135><campaign.n.136> <TargetSentence>Tom , making it abundantly clear that the Clinton / Gore scandals of the past eight years will be a major theme in the closing days of this campaign , Bush attacks the Vice President for being a failed leader and promises if he 's elected Americans will once again be able to respect their government .  </TargetSentence>Bush campaigns today in this tough battleground state alongside the popular retired general Colin Powell and again hints strongly Powell will be a member of his cabinet if elected .  </campaign.n.136><campaign.n.137> <TargetSentence>Christopher said the recounts should be completed within a matter of days and at that point , Gore campaign sources contend , Gore will be in the lead in Florida and on track to win the election .  </TargetSentence>Meanwhile , Governor George Bush spent the day out of public view , behind the gate of his ranch in Texas , while his point man , James Baker appeared on five network talk shows arguing vigorously that the hand recounts are improper and should be stopped .  </campaign.n.137><campaign.n.138>Why ?  <TargetSentence>As Gore considers his options with his family , advisers say he and the campaign realize they are operating on two distinct and delicate tracts -- legal , which they will pursue to keep options open , and political , which they have to watch carefully as they feel mounting pressure .  </TargetSentence>Friends point out that the man who was so quick to concede the first time to George W. Bush when he thought he lost and who told aides , `` we have to do this right , '' is not a politician who would insist on a long , damaging legal process , if it is determined that 's what going to court would mean .  </campaign.n.138><campaign.n.139>Today he holds the Bible for her , trading places from when they first came to Washington eight years ago .  <TargetSentence>From the health care fiasco to the Monica humiliation -- I did not have sexual relations with that woman , to the campaign many said she could never win , Hillary Clinton is now the most admired woman in America , beating Oprah by a landslide in the latest Gallup poll .  </TargetSentence>I am thrilled .  </campaign.n.139><campaign.n.140><TargetSentence>In China a campaign against fake goods has netted 43 million dollars of counterfeit products over the past month .  </TargetSentence>The trade in bogus goods is thought to cost companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenues each year , but officials say enforcing the law is often dangerous with at least one government inspector killed in recent weeks .  </campaign.n.140><campaign.n.141>He also alleged that this is part of a wider plot to undermine both him as well as South Africa 's attempts to obtain a more equitable world economic order .  <TargetSentence>Conspiracy theories aside , the reality is that hundreds of thousands of South Africans are suffering and dying needlessly in vivid contrast to developing nations like Uganda , Thailand and Brazil where the governments have adopted a pro-active role in manufacturing low - cost antiretroviral drugs and are running highly successful AIDS education and condom campaigns .  </TargetSentence>For The World I 'm Carolyn Demster in Johannesburg .  </campaign.n.141><campaign.n.142>Given that he has already controlled a majority of the National Assembly , it is very likely that the law will be passed and the general feeling is that there is a hurry in approving the legislation because the President seems to feel that he is running out of time with the popular support he has gotten ever since 1998 .  <TargetSentence>Cuniket says , there has been a lot of public pressure on Chavez to live up to his many campaign promises , such as distributing land and wealth more equally among Venezuelans .  </TargetSentence>Deputies from the opposition are voicing their discontent .  </campaign.n.142><campaign.n.143>When Ariel Sharon speaks about his version of peace , I say to you and to the general public , ask yourselves if this so - called peace has a partner on the other side , because if not , this is just a code word for war .  <TargetSentence>Barak 's campaign has been presenting Sharon as a danger to the country 's security .  </TargetSentence>Television ads have portrayed Sharon as a dangerous extremist .  </campaign.n.143><campaign.n.144>Television ads have portrayed Sharon as a dangerous extremist .  <TargetSentence>Barak 's campaign has stressed the right wing leader 's role as Minister of Defense during Israel 's disastrous war in Lebanon in the 1980s .  </TargetSentence>Sharon though , has been presenting himself as a moderate and the unifier for the Israeli people .  </campaign.n.144><campaign.n.145><TargetSentence>Serbia remains tense today in the wake of a massive civil disobedience campaign begun Monday to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede election defeat .  </TargetSentence>In nearly every Serbian city protestors marched in the streets demanding Mr. Milosevic recognize opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica as the outright winner of last week 's presidential election .  </campaign.n.145><campaign.n.146>The paper 's editorial board goes on to say , we believe Mr. Gore would never follow Bill Clinton 's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency .  <TargetSentence>The Times also praise Republican candidate George W Bush for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the writers said they had concluded Mr. Bush 's agenda was harsh on issues such as women 's rights , guns , and law enforcement .  </TargetSentence>The Times joins the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore .  </campaign.n.146><campaign.n.147>I need your help .  <TargetSentence>In the last days of this campaign , I need you all to work your neighborhoods and talk to your friends and turn out to vote .  </TargetSentence> </campaign.n.147><campaign.n.148>A Jerusalem Post poll shows Mr. Sharon 's lead widening to 22 percentage points from 16 points last Friday .  <TargetSentence>Mr. Barak is facing mounting pressure from within his Labor Party to step aside and let elder statesman Shimon Peres run , but he said Wednesday at a campaign rally that no one dare approach him to drop out of the race .  </TargetSentence></campaign.n.148></campaign.n.test>
