declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress .  <TargetSentence>And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .  </TargetSentence>`` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said .  </legislation.n.23><legislation.n.24><TargetSentence>A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary .  </TargetSentence>The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee .  </legislation.n.24><legislation.n.25>A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary .  <TargetSentence>The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee .  </TargetSentence>Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies .  </legislation.n.25><legislation.n.26>Dubbed the `` Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance , '' the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments .  <TargetSentence>`` Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required , '' the legislation reads , and the new obligations `` shall not be a charge against the Budget Act , Gramm - Rudman - Hollings , or other ceilings .  </TargetSentence></legislation.n.26><legislation.n.27>Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .  <TargetSentence>However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions .  </TargetSentence>Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities .  </legislation.n.27><legislation.n.28>However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions .  <TargetSentence>Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities .  </TargetSentence>These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it .  </legislation.n.28><legislation.n.29>The Office of Thrift Supervision banned B.J. Garman , a former director of the failed Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville , Texas , from working in any financial institution insured by the government .  <TargetSentence>The office , a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's thrift - bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public .  </TargetSentence>Generally , regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past .  </legislation.n.29><legislation.n.30>WASHINGTON LIES LOW after the stock market 's roller - coaster ride .  <TargetSentence>Lawmakers , haunted by charges that some of their comments contributed to the 1987 crash , generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation .  </TargetSentence>But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday , and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday .  </legislation.n.30><legislation.n.31>But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday , and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday .  <TargetSentence>The market 's wild week may speed along the market - reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash .  </TargetSentence>It may also expedite the SEC 's modest pending changes in junk - bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short - term trades by pension funds .  </legislation.n.31><legislation.n.32>1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .  <TargetSentence>2 -RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and / or confers benefits on the population at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- .  </TargetSentence>3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .  </legislation.n.32><legislation.n.33>Columbia Savings is a major holder of so - called junk bonds .  <TargetSentence>New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years .  </TargetSentence>Columbia Savings officials were n't available for comment on the downgrade .  </legislation.n.33><legislation.n.34>`` We 're putting a deficit - reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit - reduction bill , '' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser -LRB- D. , Tenn . -RRB- .  <TargetSentence>But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital - gains tax cut .  </TargetSentence>In addition , the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital - gains provision .  </legislation.n.34><legislation.n.35>Opponents of the cut are playing hardball .  <TargetSentence>Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any House - Senate agreement on the deficit - reduction legislation would n't include a capital - gains tax cut .  </TargetSentence>And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year .
