<edge.n.test><edge.n.1>Atone  <TargetSentence>On the edge of fashionable Georgetown , in a chic office with a river view and a number of corporate clients whom he wo n't name , Mr. Deaver is trying to reclaim his reputation as one of the savviest image makers in town .  </TargetSentence>There are few mementos of his days as White House deputy chief of staff and confidant of Ronald and Nancy Reagan .  </edge.n.1><edge.n.2>Unlike the old - line cosmetics houses , Unilever and P&amp;G both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products .  <TargetSentence>P&amp;G , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition .  </TargetSentence>Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&amp;G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics .  </edge.n.2><edge.n.3>Janice Duclos , in addition to possessing one of the evening 's more impressive vocal instruments , brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga , everybody 's favorite mom .  <TargetSentence>Marni Rice plays the maid with so much edge as to steal her two scenes .  </TargetSentence>But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer , Jonathan Fried -LRB- Zamislov , the paralegal -RRB- who is the actor to watch , whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor 's wife -LRB- Becca Lish -RRB- by licking her bosom .  </edge.n.3><edge.n.4><TargetSentence>In Poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics .  </TargetSentence>Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which I attended last month .  </edge.n.4><edge.n.5>Ali Khalifa Al - Sabah , Kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day .  <TargetSentence>Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge .  </TargetSentence>Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market .  </edge.n.5><edge.n.6>That trend could increase demand for hot - dipped galvanized sheet .  <TargetSentence>The hot - dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest - growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees .  </TargetSentence>Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 .  </edge.n.6><edge.n.7>Bush has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court , which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm - up for future Supreme Court nominees .  <TargetSentence>Conservatives now hold only a 5 - 4 edge .  </TargetSentence>One slot is expected to go to EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas , a black conservative ; after mulling a fight , liberals now probably wo n't put up a major struggle against him .  </edge.n.7><edge.n.8>In the opinion of many , he has n't stopped running since , even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985 .  <TargetSentence>His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political - action committees to preserve his edge .  </TargetSentence>With limited budgets for television in a high - priced market , Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage .  </edge.n.8><edge.n.9>The nylon membrane biochips currently produced by TGS and U-Vision Biotech are all derived from the technology developed by Konan Peck .  <TargetSentence>Cutting edge  </TargetSentence>Can Taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?  </edge.n.9><edge.n.10>If Taiwan does not respond in time , it will be forced into an increasingly passive position .  <TargetSentence>Lt. Gen. Fuh Wei-ku , commandant of the Air Command and General Staff College at the Armed Forces University , notes that for the moment Taiwan still has a slight edge in terms of air defense .  </TargetSentence>However , it is widely estimated that by 2005 , there will be a shift in the military capabilities of the two sides .  </edge.n.10><edge.n.11>However , it is widely estimated that by 2005 , there will be a shift in the military capabilities of the two sides .  <TargetSentence>Although this prediction is not necessarily accurate , Taiwan should work to maintain its edge so as to guarantee peace through strength .  </TargetSentence>Fuh Wei-ku offers the following analysis : Currently the PRC weapons which pose the greatest threat to Taiwan are Sukhoi aircraft , M-class missiles , and cruise missiles .  </edge.n.11><edge.n.12>But fortune had other things in store .  <TargetSentence>In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of Pali , the plan to develop tourism in Pali was scrapped overnight .  </TargetSentence>The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .  </edge.n.12><edge.n.13>Pali Facts and Figures  <TargetSentence>Pali Rural Township -LRB- also spelled Bali -RRB- is located at the northwestern edge of the Taipei Basin , on the western bank of the mouth of the Tanshui River .  </TargetSentence>It has an area of 39.5 square kilometers and a population of just over 28,000 .  </edge.n.13><edge.n.14>Soong 's candidacy has opened up new fault lines in Taiwan 's party politics , and has attracted the support of many NP legislators and other non-KMT and non-DPP forces .  <TargetSentence>The New Party itself , which is on the edge of collapse , has nominated the renowned author Li Ao as its candidate , though Li is not a party member .  </TargetSentence>In addition to these four , former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang , having failed to win the nomination of his party , withdrew from the DPP and is running as an independent .  </edge.n.14><edge.n.15>NP votes drifted to Ma Ying-jeou , a member of the KMT -LRB- albeit not one of Lee Teng-hui 's personal favorites -RRB- .  <TargetSentence>The NP candidate received only an anemic percentage of the ballots , bringing the party to the edge of collapse .  </TargetSentence>But if Chen Shui-bian becomes president , because the DPP is seen as the party of Taiwan independence - the direct antithesis of the New Party - this could inspire NP members to pull together , and at the same time give the party the status and ability to absorb the forces that are backing James Soong .  </edge.n.15><edge.n.16>Hsia 's fuzzy people have taken on solid form , sculpted from copper and iron .  <TargetSentence>Compared with the two - dimensional versions they lose their satirical edge , but gain in playful appearance .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- courtesy of Eslite Gallery -RRB-  </edge.n.16><edge.n.17>Naturally television actors do not have the luxury that movie actors enjoy of allowing themselves time to slowly get in the right frame of mind for a role or scene , but even so , given the fact that TV actors must rely almost exclusively on dialogue and body language to keep the audience 's attention , the fact that shooting is so hurried not only waters down the quality of the performance , there is little time even to get the lines right .  <TargetSentence>Such conditions , she feels , make for productions that are really too rough around the edges .  </TargetSentence>Chou You , who has produced more than 4,000 hours of dramatic series for television , says that prime time is like a battlefield for television stations .  </edge.n.17><edge.n.18>What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ?  <TargetSentence>Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top - level executives seek an edge in management .  </TargetSentence>And while most recent university graduates are able to apply professional know-how upon entering the work force , one is not necessarily taught management in the workplace .  </edge.n.18><edge.n.19>In the information world , everyone is equal .  <TargetSentence>Though huge multinational corporations may have an edge in terms of information technology , since the rapid growth of the Internet in the 1990s , ' little guys ' whom no one has ever heard of before - relying only on programming ability , creativity , and hard work - have had the space to bring their talents into play .  </TargetSentence>The best - known example is Yahoo , the world 's number one web portal .  </edge.n.19><edge.n.20>Thirty million years ago , Chamaecyparis species were distributed all over the world .  <TargetSentence>But after the ice ages , the high mountains of Taiwan , which were squeezed up from the edges of two tectonic plates a million years ago , became their refuge .  </TargetSentence>Today , only six false cypress species remain anywhere in the world , scattered far apart in North America , Japan and Taiwan .  </edge.n.20><edge.n.21>Middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .  <TargetSentence>Many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges .  </TargetSentence>A minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap .  </edge.n.21><edge.n.22>Every evening just on dusk the kindergarten 's minibus would pick up his daughter and take her away to spend two happy hours each day in a " totally American " language environment .  <TargetSentence>" If your English is good , it gives you an edge .  </TargetSentence>It 's essential , " says Chen .  </edge.n.22><edge.n.23>but I think what happened here is not a single senator for instance said that uh Harriet Myers ' nomination should be withdrawn /.  <TargetSentence>Sam may have been on the edge /.  </TargetSentence>but I do n't think he ever said it /.  </edge.n.23><edge.n.24>I was a chaotic mess even at the age of twenty two /.  <TargetSentence>I think that was probably the lowest of the low for me when I was twenty two years old and went into a therapist 's chair with such a broken heart such a broken life you know and a friend that had recently died just sort of pushed me over the edge /.  </TargetSentence>and you know it 's the best thing I ever did /.  </edge.n.24><edge.n.25>But only two miles away , Atlantic salmon are thriving , and that 's an understatement .  <TargetSentence>These experimental salmon are on the cutting edge of the debate over genetically engineered food because a company has found a way to make the bigger one use growth hormone more efficiently .  </TargetSentence>It reaches full size faster .  </edge.n.25><edge.n.26>The Mir was first launched 15 years ago .  <TargetSentence>It was the cutting edge of research into long - term space stations .  </TargetSentence>Much was learned about construction , rendezvous and docking , the effect of long - term weightlessness upon plants , microorganisms and humans .  </edge.n.26><edge.n.27>The lead did change hands .  <TargetSentence>Yesterday 's CNN / `` USA Today '' / Gallup tracking poll shows Gore with a slight edge for the first time in two weeks .  </TargetSentence>The new numbers show that if the election were held today , 46 % of the likely voters questioned would choose Gore .  </edge.n.27><edge.n.28>They ca n't believe the luck .  <TargetSentence>They use the gunships to kill , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern Iraq and trying to do that to the Kurds , as well , so it was a knife edge .  </TargetSentence>And it 's not just being wise after the event , I believe , to say that there was an argument in realtime between the Bush administration members .  </edge.n.28><edge.n.29>In traditionally Democratic Minnesota , Bush has 44 % , Gore 41 % , Nader 8 % .  <TargetSentence>Here in Wisconsin , Gore has an edge in one poll , Bush in another .  </TargetSentence>Nader remains steady at 5 % .  </edge.n.29><edge.n.30> <TargetSentence>This is what gave us the edge , the intelligence of what the enemy were up to , what they were going to do , and this is , of course , what helped to reduce the war period by two to two - and - a half years , saving lives of all nations throughout the world .  </TargetSentence>This story does not yet have a happy ending however .  </edge.n.30><edge.n.31>Well , they wo n't enter straight away .  <TargetSentence>First of all they have to make sure there are no jagged edges around this hole , because one tear of the protective suits of the divers could prove fatal .  </TargetSentence>It is a very dangerous operation .  </edge.n.31><edge.n.32>But Positive Black Soul 's music is first and foremost Senegalese music .  <TargetSentence>When American saxophonist David Murray recorded his acclaimed afrocentric jazz album , Fo Juke Review in Dakar , he recruited Amidu Berry and DJ Awadi from PBS to show what an edge West African music can really have .  </TargetSentence>When Awadi and Barry performed , they managed simultaneously to bathe in the group of American hip - hop and they keep a clear sense that they are from Senegal .  </edge.n.32></edge.n.test>
