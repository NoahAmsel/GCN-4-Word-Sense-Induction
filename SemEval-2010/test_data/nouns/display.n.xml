's advanced - technology display .  </TargetSentence>The highlight : a `` fragrance control system . ''  </display.n.1><display.n.2>With the touch of a button , drivers can choose from lavender , jasmine , mint or perfume scents , all blown in through the car 's air - conditioning system .  <TargetSentence>The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' the display attests , and a proud employee says Mazda hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two .  </TargetSentence>Welcome to the 28th Tokyo Motor Show .  </display.n.2><display.n.3>Suzuki Motor Co. 's Escudome sport vehicle features a pop - out rear tent and invites drivers to go `` back to the nature . ''  <TargetSentence>But this biennial event , the world 's largest display of cars and trucks , has its serious side , including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle - suspension systems .  </TargetSentence>It 's also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged , and therein lies the draw .  </display.n.3><display.n.4>New Technology  <TargetSentence>The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road .  </TargetSentence>These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride .  </display.n.4><display.n.5>By contrast , the pistons in conventional four - stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle .  <TargetSentence>The two - stroke engine displays by Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries , the maker of Subaru cars , drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives , who are rushing to develop two - stroke engines .  </TargetSentence>Honda Motor Co. shows a more conventional five - cylinder engine in the new Accord Inspire model , which made its debut just this month -- in Japan only .  </display.n.5><display.n.6>Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea has its first - ever exhibit in Tokyo .  <TargetSentence>General Motors Corp. is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years , and it includes a boxy Buick station wagon with wood - grain side panels .  </TargetSentence>Ford and Chrysler also have exhibits , although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less - popular automotive parts section .  </display.n.6><display.n.7>The new understanding did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light .  <TargetSentence>It emerged after a rancorous display of old - style intelligence politics that followed this month 's failed coup attempt in Panama .  </TargetSentence>The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult .  </display.n.7><display.n.8>This autumn 's edition of the biannual fair will run through Oct. 31 .  <TargetSentence>Inside the 156,000 - square - yard glass exhibition complex , products ranging from clothing to AK - 47 machine guns are on display .  </TargetSentence>Fair officials say that 21,000 guests visited during the first five days , a 10 % drop from the spring exhibition .  </display.n.8><display.n.9>The company says it will increase its international advertising 35 % in 1990 , with bourbon representing most of that amount .  <TargetSentence>Guinness 's Schenley Industries unit has increased its TV advertising in Japan and has built partnerships with duty - free shops throughout Asia , enabling it to install prominent counter displays .  </TargetSentence>The company 's I.W. Harper brand is the leading bourbon in Japan , with 40 % of the market .  </display.n.9><display.n.10>With only small help from the government , these start - up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government .  <TargetSentence>Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie - quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick .  </TargetSentence>Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .  </display.n.10><display.n.11>It already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high - definition television .  <TargetSentence>Two other firms , Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. , and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat - panel screens called active - matrix liquid crystal displays .  </TargetSentence>The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode - ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set .  </display.n.11><display.n.12>Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal - processing and broadcast equipment .  <TargetSentence>But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .  </TargetSentence>General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid - crystal displays to Thompson - CSF of France .  </display.n.12><display.n.13>But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .  <TargetSentence>General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid - crystal displays to Thompson - CSF of France .  </TargetSentence>`` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says .  </display.n.13><display.n.14>But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .  <TargetSentence>In the 1970s , Mr. Brody helped develop the first display panels based on active - matrix liquid crystals at Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's research labs in Pittsburgh .  </TargetSentence>The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image .  </display.n.14><display.n.15>`` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office .  <TargetSentence>So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds .  </TargetSentence>HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .  </display.n.15><display.n.16>HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .  <TargetSentence>The Navy is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the Army wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks .  </TargetSentence>The Commerce Department also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .  </display.n.16><display.n.17>`` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues Jack Clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation .  <TargetSentence>`` The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . ''  </TargetSentence>Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds .  </display.n.17><display.n.18>They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department 's concern over their future .  <TargetSentence>They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including Matsushita , Hitachi , and Toshiba , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid - crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs .  </TargetSentence>And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas .  </display.n.18><display.n.19>And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas .  <TargetSentence>Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea , while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty - free .  </TargetSentence>`` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he says .  </display.n.19><display.n.20>As a result , artists from Taiwan and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie .  <TargetSentence>In Taipei , 1997 was designated as the Year of Public Art , and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around the island , chosen by the Council for Cultural Affairs -LRB- CCA -RRB- .  </TargetSentence>1998 also saw the adoption of new measures governing the installation of such works .  </display.n.20><display.n.21>They must give up working if they wish to train full-time .  <TargetSentence>The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming their injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed their handicaps into glorious results .  </TargetSentence>This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .  </display.n.21><display.n.22>The next day , showing commendable courage , Yang and Peng slipped back into the conference chamber .  <TargetSentence>But their actions also attracted the criticism that this kind of high - decibel display is not in fact helpful for achieving Taiwan 's return to the United Nations .  </TargetSentence>However , Yang does not subscribe to this view .  </display.n.22><display.n.23>The terracotta warriors from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang , which is included on the list of World Heritage sites of the UNESCO , have come ashore in Taiwan !  <TargetSentence>The 17 warriors now on display at the National Museum of History represent the largest contingent from the ancient tomb ever to travel on loan outside of mainland China .  </TargetSentence>" Reporting to the general , sir !  </display.n.23><display.n.24>Peipu , in the meantime , enjoys a booming tourist industry that just keeps growing .  <TargetSentence>Since the earthquake , Peipu 's Ta Ai Community Affairs Center -LRB- TCAC -RRB- has lent sustained assistance to Shihkang in a remarkable display of how a disaster can bring out the best in people .  </TargetSentence>" Donations and volunteers came flooding in immediately after the earthquake , " says Shihkang mayor Hsieh Chen-ying , " but we all knew that it would n't last for long .  </display.n.24><display.n.25>p. 82  <TargetSentence>-LRB- above , by Pu Hua-chih -RRB- Lively celebrations were carried out across the island on the evening of May 20th , with a big fireworks display lighting the night sky in Taipei .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- facing page , by Hsueh Chi-kuang -RRB- Foreign guests attended the inauguration in large numbers .  </display.n.25><display.n.26>Ritek will be responsible for the production of the disk .  <TargetSentence>A year and a half ago Ritek invested in the production of OLED -LRB- organic light - emitting diode -RRB- displays , which is yet another technology used in portable computing devices that relies on thin opto-electrical film application techniques .  </TargetSentence>Currently Ritek is the largest producer of OLEDs in the world .  </display.n.26><display.n.27>He and his mother rarely went shopping together or discussed how to evaluate the quality of clothes .  <TargetSentence>Chang , who takes note of how others dress and of how fashions are matched in store displays , says that the point is not for parents to teach their children to be slaves to fashion , but to teach them how to dress with a sense of character and beauty .  </TargetSentence>Whether or not you find this behavior among some men acceptable , it is an established fact .  </display.n.27><display.n.28>The calligrapher and seal - carver Wang Chuang-wei spent a lifetime working assiduously at his craft , producing a body of work in which every single stroke and cut looks perfect .  <TargetSentence>Wang passed away three years ago , and this January a collection of 50 works , spanning every period of Wang 's life , went on display at the National Palace Museum in Taipei .  </TargetSentence>In recent years the museum , primarily known for its collection of treasures from the palaces of Ming and Qing dynasty China , has broadened its remit and begun acquiring newly excavated artifacts as well as 20th century calligraphy and painting - including works by such luminaries as Chang Ta-chien , Qi Baishi , Yu Yo-jen and Tai Ching-nung .  </display.n.28><display.n.29>When you climb to the second floor , in Room 201 a worker is stirring cement with all his might in preparation for putting up a decorative wall of cement interspersed with ceramic pieces .  <TargetSentence>And in Room 203 , a group of people are busy putting the finished reproductions on display , documenting the process on video as they go along .  </TargetSentence>Suddenly there is a crash , followed by a gasp , and Lu Hsiu-chin , director of the Research and Collections Department , rushes in to see what has happened .  </display.n.29><display.n.30>" We felt that Taiwan ceramics should cover more than just what Han Chinese people have done in the 400 years since large-scale migration began from the mainland , but should also include aboriginal and prehistoric pottery .  <TargetSentence>But it is quite a challenge to effectively create such a comprehensive display , especially since authentic pieces are so hard to come by . "  </TargetSentence>Lu Hsiu-chin reveals that most of the genuine items are held by the Department of Archeology and Anthropology at National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB- or by the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  </display.n.30><display.n.31>Liu continues : " Though later Cheng left archeology to do ceramic art , he did not forget his affection for prehistoric pottery , and his early work was influenced by ancient painted pottery . "  <TargetSentence>Liu notes that in recent years there has been growing demand for archeological artifacts for displays , precisely fitting with Cheng 's familiarity with ceramic art and his understanding of archeological work .  </TargetSentence>As Lu Hsiu-chin says , with the satisfaction that comes of knowing one has got just what one wants , " He is the ideal person to do reproductions of prehistoric pottery . "  </display.n.31><display.n.32>p. 77  <TargetSentence>Cheng Yung-gwo 's reproductions of prehistoric pottery are on display in the Taipei County Yingko Ceramics Museum .  </TargetSentence>p. 78  </display.n.32><display.n.33>All this is one man 's personal Christmas decoration .  <TargetSentence>It 's his annual Christmas display , and tens of thousands of people come to see the blinking , spinning , twirling lights and hear the holiday music .  </TargetSentence>There are more than 52,000 lights , all synchronized to Christmas carols .  </display.n.33><display.n.34>It takes more than 10 1 / 2 miles of cable and wire to hook it all up , and 23 computers .  <TargetSentence>This is definitely a high - tech Christmas display .  </TargetSentence>Doof , who is an electrical engineer , says his vision for the display was ahead of its time .  </display.n.34><display.n.35>This is definitely a high - tech Christmas display .  <TargetSentence>Doof , who is an electrical engineer , says his vision for the display was ahead of its time .  </TargetSentence> </display.n.35><display.n.36> <TargetSentence>Over the past 20 years , the display has gotten bigger and brighter , and Doof says this one is the biggest yet .  </TargetSentence>He spends long hours on his elaborate display .  </display.n.36><display.n.37>Over the past 20 years , the display has gotten bigger and brighter , and Doof says this one is the biggest yet .  <TargetSentence>He spends long hours on his elaborate display .  </TargetSentence>He started working on it last March .  </display.n.37><display.n.38>When Fidel Castro and his rebels stormed Havana , they were joined by an intrepid American photographer who spoke little Spanish .  <TargetSentence>His name is Burt Glinn , and now most Cubans are getting their first look at his photos on display in Havana until the end of the month .  </TargetSentence>The collection is called `` on the road to Havana with Fidel , '' and is made up of 41 black and white images .  </display.n.38><display.n.39> <TargetSentence>They 're calling it a one of a kind exhibit the rarest and most precious diamonds in the world on display starting tomorrow morning at a Smithsonian in Washington .  </TargetSentence>They are huge rocks .  </display.n.39><display.n.40>Reporter :  <TargetSentence>The 59.6 carat pink diamond just unveiled in Monaco is on display for the first time , its owners confident it is secure .  </TargetSentence> </display.n.40></display.n.test>
