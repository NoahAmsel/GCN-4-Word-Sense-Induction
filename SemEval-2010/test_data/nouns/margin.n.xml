<margin.n.test><margin.n.1>China 's down and down products industry started its rapid development in the mid '80s .  <TargetSentence>The entire industry makes use of China 's resources and manpower advantage , and additionally stresses introducing advanced foreign technology and equipment , thus increasing production volume and quality by a large margin .  </TargetSentence>According to incomplete statistics , China currently has over 3,000 down and down product enterprises , among which , those above scale have reached more than 600 , with employed staff of about 300,000 .  </margin.n.1><margin.n.2>According to the analysis of the National Statistical Bureau , the extremely favorable conditions for China 's economic development mainly comprise of two aspects : the first being the sustained growth of the world economy and international trade , which indicates the steady expansion of international market demands , provides a comparatively favorable international environment for China 's export trade development .  <TargetSentence>The second is China 's large margin reduction of tariffs in 1996 which will further improve its investment environment and attract more foreign businessmen to come to invest .  </TargetSentence>The analysis shows that , with the situation of greater opportunity and extremely favorable international situations , China 's economic development still faces severe challenges this year .  </margin.n.2><margin.n.3>The entire year 's export volume reached 2.524 billion US dollars , increasing by more than 25 % compared with the previous year .  <TargetSentence>This rate was higher than Dalian 's GNP growth margin or the national foreign trade export average growth rate , and ranked the seventh on the list of all exporting city in China .  </TargetSentence>Among these , the steady growth of three - capital enterprise exports played the main role .  </margin.n.3><margin.n.4>At present , in the Dalian 's export commodity structure , primary products are only less than 30 % while the proportion of industrial finished products is more than 70 % .  <TargetSentence>Among these , electromechanical products increased by a large margin , accounting for more than 40 % of the total export volume .  </TargetSentence>Statistical materials show that last year , Dalian 's export to South Korea reached more than 100 million US dollars .  </margin.n.4><margin.n.5>By the end of last year , the Shuidong Development Zone established enterprises of different kinds reaching more than 2,400 , with total industrial output reaching 884 million yuan .  <TargetSentence>After the ethylene project begins its production , the Shuidong Development Zone will hopefully enter the overall output period and its total industrial output will realize a relatively large margin of increase .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- End -RRB-  </margin.n.5><margin.n.6>Enterprises entering these areas have reached 2,580 , among which are 315 new high level technology enterprises .  <TargetSentence>According to statistics , this year , gross revenue from technology , industry and trade from provincial new high level technology development areas and completed gross industrial output both have large margin increases compared with last year .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- End -RRB-  </margin.n.6><margin.n.7>Also , Chairman Pierre Lortie resigned .  <TargetSentence>Westinghouse expects operating margins of over 10 % and sharply higher earnings per share next year due to a major restructuring .  </TargetSentence>Some major U.S. trade partners quickly rejected a compromise proposal by Bush to liberalize trade and reduce farm -

1 margin , the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and , despite reservations , the House adopted the bill on a 303 - 107 roll call .  </TargetSentence>The package is more than $ 1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week .  </margin.n.10><margin.n.11>The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $ 124,875 , and the bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low -
