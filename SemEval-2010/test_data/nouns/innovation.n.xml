<innovation.n.test><innovation.n.1>This part of the funds will come entirely from national financial institutions , and financial bonds will not be issued to the public .  <TargetSentence>According to presentations , after its founding , the National Development Bank transferred the portion of funds used for the construction of infrastructure and technical innovation projects from the specialized banks to its own account in the form of financial bonds .  </TargetSentence>Therefore , there is no change in the total amount of fixed capital assets investment .  </innovation.n.1><innovation.n.2>But , the capital for specialized banks to purchase financial bonds comes from savings deposits , not new growth , and has utterly no effect on either the issuance of government bonds or the issuance of new shares .  <TargetSentence>It was learned that after this year 's 65 billion financial bonds are in possession , there will be 60 billion in funds to be used for 345 large and medium-sized infrastructure projects and 5 billion will be used for important policy - related technical innovation projects .  </TargetSentence>According to presentations , as a financial policy institution , the National Development Bank will mainly assist national pillar industries , and support the government in carrying out macro-economic management .  </innovation.n.2><innovation.n.3>The principle of " invigorating large enterprises while relaxing control over small ones " has been strengthened .  <TargetSentence>Last year , the State granted policies favoring large enterprises and groups in fields such as self-run business import and export rights , bank loans , technical transformation , technical innovation , etc .  </TargetSentence>Now , among the 512 key enterprises that the State has prioritized , over 120 issue and list stocks at home and overseas .  </innovation.n.3><innovation.n.4>Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , December 17 , by reporter Jie Qin  <TargetSentence>The 53 national new high level technology development zones of China are developing rapidly , resulting in a large group of new high level technology enterprises with flexible mechanisms , and quick response to the demands of the market economy and strong capabilities in technical innovation .  </TargetSentence>The new high level technology development zones of China were brewed in the early 1980's .  </innovation.n.4><innovation.n.5>Among these projects , more than 400 have brought direct economic benefits , creating an output value of over 10 billion yuan and earning more than 500 million US dollars in foreign currency .  <TargetSentence>By cultivating technology innovation processes of new high level technology enterprises , enterprises have become the main part of technology development and technology application .  </TargetSentence>The Shantou Ultrasonic Instrument Institute , by adhering to the road of mutually combining imported and in - house research development , has successively researched and developed more than forty new high level technology products , with an annual output value surpassing 100 million yuan .  </innovation.n.5><innovation.n.6>The ultrasonic visualization diagnostic apparatus , known as " China 's B ultrasound " , is sold far away to countries in Europe and America and other regions .  <TargetSentence>Nowadays , a structurally optimized , capable and highly efficient enterprise technology innovation system has been formed in Shantou , consisting of municipal independent research institutions , enterprise technology development organizations and engineering and technology research and development centers .  </TargetSentence>Additionally , the Shantou Science and Technology Museum , having modern facilities , completed construction and put into use in November of this year .  </innovation.n.6><innovation.n.7>He said that next year 's main tasks of economic system reform will be : maintaining the direction of the reform of the socialist market economy ; further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of creating a modern enterprise system for state - owned enterprises ; vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring ; appropriately placing departing extraneous personnel ; implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms ; continuing to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ; promoting grain and cotton circulation system reform ; actively developing agriculture industrialization operations ; actively promoting organization reform ; transforming the government 's economic management methods ; examining the system of management , supervision , and operation of state - owned assets ; deepening reforms in the systems of social security and housing ; striving to improve urban integrated support reform ; and making substantial progress in setting up new systems .  <TargetSentence>Tieying Li said that next year the focus on deepening reform in China 's state - owned enterprises is advancing as a whole and would use companies as its main units of operation to implement comprehensive system innovation for the goal of establishing a modern enterprise system .  </TargetSentence>The Chinese government recently pointed out that it would take about 3 years to extricate the majority of large and medium-sized state - owned enterprises with a deficit from their current plight through reforming , restructuring , renovating and strengthening management .  </innovation.n.7><innovation.n.8>Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&amp;G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics .  <TargetSentence>That 's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass - market brands .  </TargetSentence>`` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says Guy Peyrelongue , chief executive of Cosmair Inc. , the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal .  </innovation.n.8><innovation.n.9>`` They figure it 's not a very good advert . ''  <TargetSentence>Despite all these innovations , most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock sweepers '' who toil in the wake of the excavators .  </TargetSentence>Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds .  </innovation.n.9><innovation.n.10>Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high - definition television has come from U.S. laboratories .  <TargetSentence>But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .  </TargetSentence>In the 1970s , Mr. Brody helped develop the first display panels based on active - matrix liquid crystals at Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's research labs in Pittsburgh .  </innovation.n.10><innovation.n.11>Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage .  <TargetSentence>Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation .  </TargetSentence>In 1982 , he started a factory in Greece .  </innovation.n.11><innovation.n.12>He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow suit .  <TargetSentence>By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , he says he has been able to produce high - quality goods at low cost .  </TargetSentence>To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources , he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S. .  </innovation.n.12><innovation.n.13>Soong 's camp will first have to integrate their own internal views , and then , to win confidence and trust from the Legislative Yuan , work with both the KMT and the DPP .  <TargetSentence>Such a situation is unlikely to result in much policy innovation , and in fact even the initial step of selecting a premier could prove extremely difficult .  </TargetSentence>Although the KMT , DPP , and NP all have legislators who might join the Soong camp if Soong wins , Soong 's team will still need support from the KMT and/or the DPP , support they can only get through negotiation .  </innovation.n.13><innovation.n.14>She says , " Although you can say that prime time serials are merchandise and not art , you have to present up - to - date positive values .  <TargetSentence>You have to be responsible to the audience , and that 's also the key to continual innovation . "  </TargetSentence>Developing overseas markets  </innovation.n.14><innovation.n.15>Here are some recommendations :  <TargetSentence>1. You have to be able both to describe your innovation and protect your own intellectual property .  </TargetSentence>2. Do n't request a non-disclosure agreement , because this is unprofessional .  </innovation.n.15><innovation.n.16>If you want to maintain core compet-itiveness , the first thing you 've got to do is to eliminate business that does not relate to your core competencies .  <TargetSentence>Furthermore , you should put the emphasis on innovation and strategic management .  </TargetSentence>Please remember :  </innovation.n.16><innovation.n.17>The candidates can merely haggle over details of policy , such as differences over the scope or timing of liberalization of the " three direct links " -LRB- direct trade , direct transport , and direct mail -RRB- .  <TargetSentence>Alexander Lu , a professor of political science at National Taiwan University , agrees with the no - major - innovations approach of the three candidates .  </TargetSentence>As he sees it , since currently there are three candidates with a roughly equal share of the vote , whoever wins will probably not get more than 50 % .  </innovation.n.17><innovation.n.18>Why go to such lengths to popularize new fibers ?  <TargetSentence>Grace Kuo says the textile industry today needs to take a lead from the electronics industry , and constantly strive for innovation : " What consumer today does n't already have a wardrobe full of clothes ?  </TargetSentence>If you want to persuade her to spend , you have to keep putting out products which look novel at the first glance and feel great at the first touch .  </innovation.n.18><innovation.n.19>Only then can you create demand and stimulate consumption , " she avers .  <TargetSentence>Behind the quest for innovation and change , there needs to be a great deal of R&amp;D work , along with a keen nose for the market .  </TargetSentence>But 95 % of Taiwan 's textile firms are small or medium-sized enterprises .  </innovation.n.19><innovation.n.20>" Developing new fibers is the most important element in upgrading the textile industry , " says Shang .  <TargetSentence>However , he acknowledges that although many new products are being developed in Taiwan , on closer inspection they are all copies of products first developed elsewhere , and so fall some way short of real innovation .  </TargetSentence>But whereas it used to take Taiwanese companies several years of trial and error to figure out how to make such products , the gap between them and their European and American competitors is growing ever smaller .  </innovation.n.20><innovation.n.21>But with ever greater budgetary constraints and pressure to cover its own costs , development projects mostly concentrate on firms ' current needs , and stress the sales and profit they generate .  <TargetSentence>Under such circumstances , epoch - making innovations are unlikely to emerge .  </TargetSentence>Standardizing colors  </innovation.n.21><innovation.n.22>Standardizing colors  <TargetSentence>Because innovation is so hard to achieve , the highly innovative Sinocolor Book color reference system , which was launched at the CTI 's 40th anniversary celebration , has been greeted with great admiration by many .  </TargetSentence>The system 's inventor , Hsu Yun-peng , only had a junior high school education , but had researched color matching for 18 years in a dyeing factory .  </innovation.n.22><innovation.n.23>The new economy in the US depends heavily , for one thing , on a deep foundation of basic scientific research , which comes up with revolutionary products like genetically modified foods .  <TargetSentence>Another key factor is that the US has a mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship , so that new ideas have a chance to be brought into play .  </TargetSentence>The rapid growth in the new economy has driven a decade - long economic boom in the States .  </innovation.n.23><innovation.n.24>But not many of these were for original discoveries ; most were in the category of improvements of old ideas , mainly ways to increase efficiency in the manufacturing process .  <TargetSentence>Innovations that are improvements require less money for R&amp;D , and do not require genius-like creativity , but can be made primarily by devoting more attention to a specific problem .  </TargetSentence>S.T. Day , chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC , and chairman of the San Sun Hat and Cap Company , takes the following case in point : On most caps there is an " eyelet " in the stitching .  </innovation.n.24><innovation.n.25>In these ways , VIA is moving step by step to enlarge its intellectual holdings .  <TargetSentence>" You have to have a lot of technology already on hand before you can start talking about systematic integration and trying out major innovations , " says Lee .  </TargetSentence>It is only now that VIA can escape from the specifications dictated by large multinational firms , and create innovative products of its own .  </innovation.n.25><innovation.n.26>This is a potential problem for the development of the knowledge - based economy in Taiwan .  <TargetSentence>" Many innovations just represent going a little bit further in thinking about a problem than the other guys , and once the secret is uncovered , it is easy for them to copy the idea , " says Simon Chang .  </TargetSentence>The most famous example in the industry involves a certain company that wanted to create information systems like storage and document handling .  </innovation.n.26><innovation.n.27>After a while , this former " outsider " became an insider , and created its own product , congratulating itself on saving so much money in the process .  <TargetSentence>Simon Chang notes that a major innovation usually is nested in a lot of small innovations .  </TargetSentence>If small innovations are not recognized , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation to innovate at all .  </innovation.n.27><innovation.n.28>After a while , this former " outsider " became an insider , and created its own product , congratulating itself on saving so much money in the process .  <TargetSentence>Simon Chang notes that a major innovation usually is nested in a lot of small innovations .  </TargetSentence>If small innovations are not recognized , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation to innovate at all .  </innovation.n.28><innovation.n.29>Simon Chang notes that a major innovation usually is nested in a lot of small innovations .  <TargetSentence>If small innovations are not recognized , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation to innovate at all .  </TargetSentence>This is precisely the problem now being faced by Comdek , the first company in Taiwan to produce medical instruments such as blood - oxygen monitors and ear thermometers .  </innovation.n.29><innovation.n.30>But when Comdek 's product came out , Michael Kuo still found himself in a vicious struggle with Taiwan pirate firms : " It 's equivalent to making fools out of those of us who invest the money to do research and development ! "  <TargetSentence>Kuo says that while there has been some improvement in Taiwan with regard to protection of intellectual property rights , there is still not enough for those who invest in development and innovation .  </TargetSentence>Comdek has closed its laboratory and production line to any outside visits , and has not ruled out the possibility of moving its lab overseas to get away from industrial espionage in Taiwan .  </innovation.n.30><innovation.n.31>He tried using deliberately crumpled paper to produce a mottled effect with the ink , and worked on a blurring effect , achieved by briefly dousing a freshly painted silk scroll in water .  <TargetSentence>Despite the interest generated among calligraphers by these innovations , Wang was more suited by temperament to the established forms , and he eventually turned back to ancients for inspiration .  </TargetSentence>He studied in detail the characters on the manuscripts and artifacts , dating back to the first millennium BC , that were at that time being unearthed at Mawangdui and other sites in mainland China , and began absorbing their distinctive forms into his own calligraphic style .  </innovation.n.31><innovation.n.32>When he was in his sixties Wang began to use the style names Jianzhai -LRB- " steadily more abstinent " -RRB- and Jiansou -LRB- " steadily older " -RRB- , and carved a seal for himself with the inscription : " Steadily older and more mature , steadily more mature and more detached , steadily more detached and closer to what is plain and natural . "  <TargetSentence>During his fifties he had passed through a period of experimentation and innovation , " being different for the sake of it , " but now he returned to the traditional artistic way of " being naturally different . "  </TargetSentence>Wang once said that an artistic aesthetic is something that emerges through long years of stylistic refinement and expression .  </innovation.n.32><innovation.n.33>And there is a conflict that exists .  <TargetSentence>As you start moving down this path towards technical innovation , it invites disruption or it brings about the conflict much quicker than I think most people would be prepared to start dealing with it .  </TargetSentence>I think there is a lot of issues that Japan is starting to question , how do they adapt , how do they change , how do they preserve what is good about their society while making these changes to be more competitive with what 's happening throughout the rest of the world .  </innovation.n.33></innovation.n.test>
