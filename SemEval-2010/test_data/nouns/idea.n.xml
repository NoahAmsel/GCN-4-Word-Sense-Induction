"  </TargetSentence>These types of gyms incorporate spa , beauty , aromatherapy , and recreational functions under one roof .  </idea.n.73><idea.n.74>Aerobics with free weights -LRB- opposite left -RRB- , yoga -LRB- opposite right -RRB- , tanning -LRB- below -RRB- , exercycles -LRB- right -RRB- . . . .  <TargetSentence>The new fitness trend incorporates Western and Eastern health ideas , offering diversified options to enthusiasts .  </TargetSentence>-LRB- location courtesy of Alexander Health Clubs -RRB-  </idea.n.74><idea.n.75>It makes for an amusing contrast with her grandmother , who does n't speak Mandarin well at all .  <TargetSentence>In the view of Wu Tsung-sheng , the heavy emphasis that rural parents put on education does n't have so much to do with the idea of getting ahead , but stems mainly from a deep respect for learning .  </TargetSentence>His parents are not interested in his specialty , nor do they know anything about it , but they have never objected to his chosen path , nor did they say a word when his younger brother switched his major from business management to sociology .  </idea.n.75><idea.n.76>During the reign of the Guangxu emperor of the Qing dynasty -LRB- which began in 1875 -RRB- , and prior to the beginning of the Japanese occupation in 1895 , Tanshui produced two successful candidates in the highest level military exam , one in the highest level civil exam , and countless successes in lower-level imperial exams .  <TargetSentence>Even in modern times , the town has not passed up chances to embrace knowledge : When the idea of founding Tam-kang University in Tanshui was going to be abandoned because of a lack of land and money , local residents offered cheap land , donated money , and lobbied so that the university could set its roots in town .  </TargetSentence>These historic sites are near the river , but do n't spend all your time there .  </idea.n.76><idea.n.77>Both the cases and the machines to make them sold well all over Taiwan .  <TargetSentence>Noting that glass baby bottles often cracked when boiled for sterilization , Yeh then came up with the idea of replacing glass with polyethylene .  </TargetSentence>His factory was the first in the world to produce plastic baby bottles .  </idea.n.77><idea.n.78>A new climate for the e-generation  <TargetSentence>Fortunately , over the last three years foreign investors have brought some new ideas into the country .  </TargetSentence>Although they still engage in " hit - and - run " high-volume trading for quick gains , at least most foreign investors ignore gossip and do n't touch the more speculative stocks .  </idea.n.78><idea.n.79>Rather , they put more emphasis on the fundamentals of a given company or industry .  <TargetSentence>Dennis Chien notes that foreign firms have also introduced risk management ideas like " having a well-rounded portfolio " -LRB- i.e. " do n't put all your eggs in one basket " -RRB- .  </TargetSentence>These have had a positive impact on the local stock market , and have given the investment activities of the e-generation a more rational foundation than those of their parents .  </idea.n.79><idea.n.80>Chia recalls that in the 1960s , people were too poor to have any money to manage ; there were also fears of war , and so any money people did have they quickly exchanged for gold or US dollars on the black market .  <TargetSentence>In the 1970s , faced with two oil crises and inflation , the idea of buying property to preserve value became widespread , and those who could afford it bought land and houses .  </TargetSentence>At that time , the stock market had only a hundred or so listed companies , and its fate depended on a few manipulators behind the scenes .  </idea.n.80><idea.n.81>For many investors , earnings accumulated over many years disappeared in a matter of weeks .  <TargetSentence>The misguided idea that " what is new is better " also has been a problem in Taiwan .  </TargetSentence>A certain " Mr. Wang , " who works in the government , last year thought he would jump on the bandwagon for telecom and Internet stocks .  </idea.n.81><idea.n.82>Therefore they have let it be known that Chen would like to ask Lee Yuan-tse , the universally respected Nobel Prize winner who is currently president of the Academia Sinica , to be his premier .  <TargetSentence>Chen , who knows that within the DPP there is little high-level governing experience , has repeatedly raised the idea of a " coalition government . "  </TargetSentence>However , it should be noted , there are after all great ideological differences between the DPP and the other parties .  </idea.n.82><idea.n.83>Liu Hai 's attempts to save his master repeatedly failed .  <TargetSentence>Finally , Liu Hai came up with the idea of tying a silk thread to a traditional Chinese coin , which he threw into the well .  </TargetSentence>When his teacher saw the coin , he could n't help but bite .  </idea.n.83><idea.n.84>Thick round leaves grow from the branches in groups of four , giving each branch the appearance of being a string of coins .  <TargetSentence>Although these imported plants are in high demand , none of the salesclerks at any of the stores seem to have any idea what the proper name for them is .  </TargetSentence>In any case , most buyers do n't ask .  </idea.n.84><idea.n.85>In 1955 Hsiao Chin went to study in Spain , becoming the first of the Ton-Fan Group to go overseas .  <TargetSentence>He wrote back to Taiwan describing the new trends in art that he was witness to , and the other painters , after poring over the contents of his densely written airmail letters , began putting some of those ideas into practice .  </TargetSentence>Taiwan was very cut off from the world in those days , and those studying art naturally wanted to see for themselves what was happening elsewhere .  </idea.n.85><idea.n.86>At the end of 2000 Hsia 's fuzzy people at last " stood up " for themselves , becoming sculptures rather than just images on paper .  <TargetSentence>Hsia was fiddling with an aluminum ring from a broken hair - dryer , shaping it into a little figure , when the idea dawned of doing fuzzy people in solid form .  </TargetSentence>By cutting and twisting pieces of copper , iron and steel , he was able to produce amusing little statuettes of his hitherto two - dimensional fuzzy people .  </idea.n.86><idea.n.87>Liu Pi-jung , a professor of politics at Soochow University , says that in looking at the diplomatic struggle between the ROC and PRC , it is useful to distinguish three arenas : the Asia - Pacific situation , formal diplomatic relations , and international organizations .  <TargetSentence>In terms of the Asia - Pacific situation , the PRC strongly resists any international support for Taiwan , such as the idea of placing Taiwan within the scope of the " Guidelines for US-Japan Defense Cooperation . "  </TargetSentence>Thus the attitude of the US has become one of the key factors in cross-strait relations .  </idea.n.87><idea.n.88>By emphasizing the government 's concern for human rights on the international stage , not only can Taiwan make its own democratization experience available for other countries currently going through the same process , it can bring itself closer to those countries which also place a strong emphasis on human rights .  <TargetSentence>Besides promoting new ideas , says Lo , the MOFA is also undertaking internal reform .  </TargetSentence>In early September the MOFA announced that , based on efficiency evaluations , the government would close its representative offices in the African countries of the Congo , Angola , and Madagascar .  </idea.n.88><idea.n.89>She had to fly quickly back to Taipei to make class on Saturday afternoon .  <TargetSentence>Despite often staying up until 2:00 or 3:00 AM to study or write reports , Lee likes mingling in the executive management class with a diverse group of students from different fields , and feels that the new ideas the professors feed them help keep her brain supple .  </TargetSentence>Moreover , she muses , " We managers are a strange breed .  </idea.n.89><idea.n.90>" Executives are always asking questions .  <TargetSentence>Even when they have an idea themselves , they 'll still bring up issues they encountered in their jobs to see how you respond .

"  </idea.n.96><idea.n.97>But none of the five candidates is advocating Taiwan independence , and , among the three main contenders , there is a race for the center .  <TargetSentence>All three have proposed ideas to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait :  </TargetSentence>Lien Chan has proposed a " Taiwan Strait zone of peace , " James Soong has advocated the signing of a peace treaty with the mainland , and Chen Shui-bian has announced that if elected he will not declare Taiwan independent nor seek to have the " two states formula " inserted in the constitution .  </idea.n.97><idea.n.98>This aims for a middle ground between the KMT 's " two states formula " and the PRC 's " one country , two systems " that will appeal to Taiwan , mainland China , and the international community .  <TargetSentence>But this idea has been criticized for unilaterally reducing Taiwan to the status of a " quasi-country , " thereby weakening Taiwan 's status and bargaining power vis-a-vis the mainland .  </TargetSentence>Lien Chan , candidate of the ruling KMT , is somewhat bound to support the government 's " two states formula . "  </idea.n.98><idea.n.99>He is often very proud of himself because his provincial administration built a bridge or aqueduct to meet the needs of ordinary people .  <TargetSentence>But , ancient Chinese governing wisdom criticizes those who " accomplish a small feat and think they can do anything , or discover a trivial idea and think they are brilliant . "  </TargetSentence>Lien Chan offers stability above all .  </idea.n.99><idea.n.100>When it comes to this kind of combination of lateral thinking and advanced technology , Taiwan still has some way to go .  <TargetSentence>Shang , currently chairman of the CTI 's technology committee , is well aware of where the obstacle to R&amp;D lies : " Innovative ideas take time to mature , and you have to accept a high degree of uncertainty .  </TargetSentence>But our environment does not allow this .
