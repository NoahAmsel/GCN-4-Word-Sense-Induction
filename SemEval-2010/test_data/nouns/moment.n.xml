<moment.n.test><moment.n.1>Also , according to reports , United Nations Secretary General Ghali expressed on the 30th that , the peace effort by the UN trying to persuade the Haitian military government to step down had already failed because military rulers of Haiti had refused to meet with his special envoy .  <TargetSentence>On the same day , vice-minister of the US Department of Defense Doetch said that the multi-national force would soon invade Haiti , " This moment has already arrived " .  </TargetSentence>The UNSC made the decision at the end of July to adopt " all necessary measures " to regain the authority of Haitian President Aristide who was overthrown by the military .  </moment.n.1><moment.n.2>In just a little bit , at a small patch of open terrain , the tour guide --- a woman with mastery of five European languages -- ordered the bus to stop .  <TargetSentence>She let everyone hasten to view and enjoy the sacred mountain 's countenance , taking advantage of an opportune moment of the sun revealing his smiling face and extending his greeting to us .  </TargetSentence>I raised my head in expectation .  </moment.n.2><moment.n.3>Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , March 9th  <TargetSentence>China 's ' Two Congresses ' were held at a very important historical moment .  </TargetSentence>The main theme of maintaining stability ran through the Congresses , causing our investment confidence in China to greatly increase .  </moment.n.3><moment.n.4>Recently , HSBC has moved its Shanghai branch to the China Shipping Mansion in the Pudong Lujiazui financial trading district , becoming the third foreign capital bank to be approved to operate RMB business and shift to Pudong .  <TargetSentence>At the moment , Shanghai already has 8 foreign capital banks approved to operate RMB business .  </TargetSentence>They are the US 's Citibank , Hong Kong 's HSBC , Japan 's Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank , Japan 's Industrial Bank , the Shanghai Branch of the Standard and Chartered Bank , Shanghai 's BNP Paris Bank , the Shanghai Branch of Japan 's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Japan 's Sanwa Bank .  </moment.n.4><moment.n.5>The defending champion Pete Sampras , who was troubled by a sore left ankle for more than one month , recovered to easily beat his opponent in 3 sets to progress to the men 's second round .  <TargetSentence>The American contestant , Sampras , ranked number one in world tennis at the moment , had not appeared on the court since the middle of July .  </TargetSentence>Since recovering from this injury , his situation has been very good .  </moment.n.5><moment.n.6>In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road .  <TargetSentence>Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % .  </TargetSentence>But if the Fed eases too soon , Mr. Greenspan fears , prices may begin to accelerate again next year .  </moment.n.6><moment.n.7>Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters .  <TargetSentence>Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly , yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole .  </TargetSentence>I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country 's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat .  </moment.n.7><moment.n.8>White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater , confirming comments made this week by Vice President Dan Quayle , said Mr. Bush is `` interested '' in finding a suitable test case .  <TargetSentence>But he also said that exercising a test line - item veto is n't a `` top initiative '' on the president 's agenda because he faces more - pressing budget issues at the moment .  </TargetSentence></moment.n.8><moment.n.9>Like Peter Sellars , Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls , sprawling them on staircases , dangling them off tables , even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring - do .  <TargetSentence>There are moments in this `` Summerfolk '' when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house -LRB- which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich -RRB- spout philosophic bon mots with the self - conscious rat - a - tat - tat pacing of `` Laugh In . ''  </TargetSentence>`` Talk hurts from where it spurts , '' one of them says .  </moment.n.9><moment.n.10>`` They want to turn everything upside down in a week .  <TargetSentence>Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres used at the moment by a state farm .  </TargetSentence>He ca n't guarantee that he can use it any better .

''  </TargetSentence>Elsewhere , in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer , Ms. Rose writes : `` She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman . ''  </moment.n.14><moment.n.15>`` I ca n't think of any reason to join Lloyd 's now , '' says Keith Whitten , a British businessman and a Lloyd 's member since 1979 .  <TargetSentence>`` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''  </TargetSentence>If profits do n't improve , Mr. Whitten says he may quit the exchange .  </moment.n.15><moment.n.16>He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .  <TargetSentence>It was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and Robert Loggia 's acting resonated in the silence .  </TargetSentence>There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` Mancuso FBI . ''  </moment.n.16><moment.n.17>Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . ''  <TargetSentence>Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary .  </TargetSentence>And , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow .  </moment.n.17><moment.n.18>Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say .  <TargetSentence>Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say .  </TargetSentence>Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .  </moment.n.18><moment.n.19>This week , many carriers are announcing cut - rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year , including Christmas .  <TargetSentence>In recent years , the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares .  </TargetSentence>That approach flopped : Last Christmas Day , a USAir Group Inc. DC - 9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh .  </moment.n.19><moment.n.20>The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark `` I - 'm coming - down - your - throat '' intensity , but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently , he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian - American ward .  <TargetSentence>After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions .  </TargetSentence>`` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? ''  </moment.n.20><moment.n.21>Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .  <TargetSentence>The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .  </TargetSentence>But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .  </moment.n.21><moment.n.22>During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit - cutting bill and the capital - gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds .  <TargetSentence>At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit - reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .  </TargetSentence>When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax - writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it .  </moment.n.22><moment.n.23>No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market .  <TargetSentence>But some players were quick to seize the moment .  </TargetSentence>Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply - side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains .  </moment.n.23><moment.n.24>WORLD ODDITIES come alive in a multimedia version of the Guinness Book of Records .  <TargetSentence>The $ 99 CD - ROM disk -LRB- it can only be played on an Apple Macintosh computer at the moment -RRB- combines animation , music and sound .  </TargetSentence>Among the Guinness disk 's wonders : the world 's loudest recorded belch .  </moment.n.24><moment.n.25>`` We are starving for all the news , '' says Mr. Deak , the student .  <TargetSentence>`` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .  </TargetSentence></moment.n.25><moment.n.26>However , Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers .  <TargetSentence>For the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk .  </TargetSentence>`` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia &amp; York , says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch .  </moment.n.26><moment.n.27>The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .  <TargetSentence>But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .  </TargetSentence>Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot - line '' communications among exchanges .  </moment.n.27><moment.n.28>After Tang took his oath , he submitted his Cabinet nominations to Chen for formal appointment .  <TargetSentence>The most remarkable moment of the inauguration came at 11:00 am when Chen strolled into the open air to take the oath of office and deliver his inaugural address to the nation in front of the Presidential Palace .  </TargetSentence>Featuring aboriginal folk songs and a rendition of the ROC national anthem by pop queen Chang Hui-mei , the ceremony was attended by over 10,000 foreign guests , overseas Chinese , and local citizens .  </moment.n.28><moment.n.29>The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome .  <TargetSentence>Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .  </TargetSentence>" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says Johnsee Lee .  </moment.n.29><moment.n.30>There , Ah-sheng demonstrates a startling ability to respond to circumstances and succeeds in wrecking the meeting hall as he makes an eloquent speech on the love of one 's family and birthplace , making " the entire village jump to its feet in agitation . "  <TargetSentence>And there is a farcical moment at the end as he takes off his clothes and jumps into a private swimming pool , making the ultimate protest by taking his own life .  </TargetSentence>Old people " let go " by the modern era  </moment.n.30><moment.n.31>If Taiwan does not respond in time , it will be forced into an increasingly passive position .  <TargetSentence>Lt. Gen. Fuh Wei-ku , commandant of the Air Command and General Staff College at the Armed Forces University , notes that for the moment Taiwan still has a slight edge in terms of air defense .  </TargetSentence>However , it is widely estimated that by 2005 , there will be a shift in the military capabilities of the two sides .  </moment.n.31><moment.n.32>" We can defend against the M-class missiles with our Patriot missile defense system , but we currently have only limited ability to intercept cruise missiles .  <TargetSentence>The most important subject for the moment is to rethink air defense strategy , " he says .  </TargetSentence>Missile difficulties  </moment.n.32><moment.n.33>Leaders of our friendly nations , distinguished guests and compatriots from Taiwan and abroad ;  <TargetSentence>This is a glorious moment ; this is also a solemn moment full of hope .  </TargetSentence>I thank our distinguished guests , who have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around the world who love democracy and care about Taiwan , for sharing this glorious moment with us .  </moment.n.33><moment.n.34>Leaders of our friendly nations , distinguished guests and compatriots from Taiwan and abroad ;  <TargetSentence>This is a glorious moment ; this is also a solemn moment full of hope .  </TargetSentence>I thank our distinguished guests , who have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around the world who love democracy and care about Taiwan , for sharing this glorious moment with us .  </moment.n.34><moment.n.35>This is a glorious moment ; this is also a solemn moment full of hope .  <TargetSentence>I thank our distinguished guests , who have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around the world who love democracy and care about Taiwan , for sharing this glorious moment with us .  </TargetSentence>We are here today , not just to celebrate an inauguration , but to witness the flowering of hard - won democratic values and the dawn of a new era .  </moment.n.35><moment.n.36>Taiwan stands up , symbolizing the quest for hope and the realization of dreams .  <TargetSentence>Dear compatriots , let 's always remember this moment ; let 's always remember to value and feel gratitude for it , because the fruits of democracy did not come out of the blue .  </TargetSentence>We reaped the fruits only after we had been subjected to many perils and countless hardships .  </moment.n.36><moment.n.37>We are full of self-confidence but do not have the slightest bit of complacence .  <TargetSentence>Since that moment on March 18 when the election results came to light , I have accepted the mandate of all Taiwanese people in a most earnest and humble frame of mind , and have vowed to devote all my heart , knowledge and courage to assuming the heavy responsibility for our country 's future .  </TargetSentence>I personally understand that the significance of the alternation of political parties and of the peaceful transition of power lies not in that it is a change of personnel or political parties .  </moment.n.37><moment.n.38>The interests of the people should reign supreme over those of any political party or individual .  <TargetSentence>I have always taken pride in being a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , but from the moment I take my oath and assume the presidency , I will put all my efforts into fulfilling my role as a " president for all people . "  </TargetSentence>As in the formation of the new government , we recruit people according to their talents and do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity , gender or party affiliation .  </moment.n.38><moment.n.39>Both sides will also create a glorious civilization for humanity .  <TargetSentence>Dear compatriots , we hope so much to share the moving scene of this moment with all Chinese - speaking people around the world .  </TargetSentence>The wide Ketagelan Boulevard before us was bristling with security guards only a few years ago .  </moment.n.39><moment.n.40>Today , we gather here to extol the glory and joy of democracy with songs of the land and the voice of the people .  <TargetSentence>With a little reflection , our compatriots should be able to appreciate the deep and far - reaching meaning of this moment :  </TargetSentence>Authoritarianism and force can only bring surrender for one time , while democracy and freedom are values that will endure forever .  </moment.n.40><moment.n.41>The map extends all the way to the horizon as long as our 23 million compatriots fear no hardship and move forward hand in hand .  <TargetSentence>Dear compatriots , this magnificent moment belongs to all the people .  </TargetSentence>All grace and glory belongs to Taiwan - our eternal Mother .  </moment.n.41><moment.n.42>It was only when he heard the sound of Peking opera singing coming out of a square wooden box that he stopped crying and asked in bewilderment , " Is there someone in the box ?

"  </TargetSentence>Jessica Liu , who personally feels little anxiety about money management , points out that one of her core principles for investing is to not compare herself with others .  </moment.n.44><moment.n.45>In fact , Taiwan 's main parties - the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force - all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly .  <TargetSentence>They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  </TargetSentence>KMT party chairman Lee Teng-hui has repeatedly called on voters to cherish the system of party politics that has been constructed in the process of democratization ; the KMT wants confirmation that people still see it as a coherent , positive political institution .  </moment.n.45><moment.n.46>Have you identified the mascots of money - making ?  <TargetSentence>If you ask the shopkeepers in the main streets or back alleys , they will tell you that the favorite figure of the moment is the Maneki Neko , or Japanese " beckoning cat , " whose Chinese name is literally " wealth - attracting cat " -LRB- -LRB-c-RRB-?Ìö]o? -RRB- .  </TargetSentence>The Maneki Neko has ridden a wave of fashion for things Japanese to superstardom in Taiwan , and its sales have n't suffered a whit with the slumping economy .  </moment.n.46><moment.n.47>When his teacher saw the coin , he could n't help but bite .  <TargetSentence>From that moment , the three-legged toad became a symbol of wealth , and the image of Liu Hai on the back of the toad with a large gold ingot in his outstretched arms became a favorite subject for folk art .  </TargetSentence>In the 1980s the three-legged toad managed to separate from Liu Hai .  </moment.n.47><moment.n.48>While the hot sales of money charms are no doubt partly attributable to the enterprising efforts of dealers and retailers , the slumping economy and growing number of fortunetellers have also played a part in the boom .  <TargetSentence>Those who habitually get their fortunes told are naturally given to installing a fish tank here at one moment and positioning a crystal over there the next .  </TargetSentence>But recently many people who are not ordinarily superstitious have sought the services of fortunetellers when they 've seen the value of their stocks decline .  </moment.n.48><moment.n.49>Luckily Professor Li Chih-wen of the National Institute of the Arts offered to support them to the tune of NT$ 10,000 per month for the first three years after their return to Taiwan , and Hsia and his wife were thus able to settle themselves down .  <TargetSentence>" At key moments , a little help from your friends can make all the difference , " says Hsia .  </TargetSentence>Financial help from his friends at such moments was what enabled Hsia to go abroad in the first place and then , eventually , to return again to Taiwan .  </moment.n.49><moment.n.50>" At key moments , a little help from your friends can make all the difference , " says Hsia .  <TargetSentence>Financial help from his friends at such moments was what enabled Hsia to go abroad in the first place and then , eventually , to return again to Taiwan .  </TargetSentence>This is something that the reserved Hsia has frequent cause to think about .  </moment.n.50><moment.n.51>Personally , she has always preferred to begin broadcasting only after the entire series has been completed , to ensure quality control .  <TargetSentence>But if a series is doing well , the station will want to extend it , and if ratings are less than ideal , the series must be prepared to wrap up at any moment .  </TargetSentence>The series on which Chou has recently been working had the final rushes confiscated by the network so that it can decide how to edit them , in order to determine how long the series will actually run .  </moment.n.51><moment.n.52>President Chen has openly asked the United States to play a more active balancing role in the Taiwan Strait .  <TargetSentence>Lee Ying-yuan , a DPP legislator who is tapped to be the next deputy representative of the ROC in Washington , states that at the moment the formal channels between Taiwan and the US are functioning very smoothly , and that Chen 's keeping of his promise to make an August stopover in Los Angeles very low-key has strengthened mutual trust between the US and the new government .  </TargetSentence>In addition , Taiwan is trying to strengthen so - called " track two " communications between think tanks in the ROC , PRC , and US .  </moment.n.52><moment.n.53>Therefore , merging -LRB- or being acquired -RRB- at the right price is more important than staying in business forever .  <TargetSentence>In order to prepare for a merger at any moment , financial officers must get used to the idea that " the company itself is its our biggest product . "  </TargetSentence>In the past , financial officers focused on cost management , cash flow , capital movement and risk avoidance .  </moment.n.53><moment.n.54>Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position .  <TargetSentence>But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  </TargetSentence>Independent candidate  </moment.n.54><moment.n.55>He knows what to say and when , in order to attract the most attention .  <TargetSentence>Kuo recalls several such opportune moments when Soong was provincial governor .  </TargetSentence>For example , he criticized the KMT center over the symbolic status assigned to the provincial governor at cabinet meetings , and also over unfairness in the division of government revenues .  </moment.n.55><moment.n.56>The relationship between fire and potters has been severed by modern kilns .  <TargetSentence>" There is only the moment when you turn on the power - click - there is no physical sensation of kindling wood or smoke .
