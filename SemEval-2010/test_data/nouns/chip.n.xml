little biochip , tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes .  </chip.n.88><chip.n.89>In other words , whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually , today , using biochips , they can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once .  <TargetSentence>In particular , biochips not only can speed the pace of research , but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments , with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the chip .  </TargetSentence>Thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick , but also more humane .  </chip.n.89><chip.n.90>Dr. Konan Peck , an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences -LRB- IBMS -RRB- , says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool .  <TargetSentence>With this in mind , Peck has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called " the poor man 's biochip , " since they cost a third less than glass chips .  </TargetSentence>Apart from the material itself being cheaper , the nylon chips use a visible-spectrum colorimetric system to display results , so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner , which costs 50 - 70 % less than using a special laser

other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .  </TargetSentence>At present , the BMEC has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications .

</TargetSentence>Pushing the envelope  </chip.n.93><chip.n.94>Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .  <TargetSentence>Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .  </TargetSentence>He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high-throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .  </chip.n.94><chip.n.95>He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high-throughput

associate research fellow Konan Peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future .  </TargetSentence>But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable .  </chip.n.95><chip.n.96>Successfully defining a business is a process of elimination .  <TargetSentence>In the late 1980s , Intel realized that it could no longer compete with Japanese semiconductor companies in the production of memory chips , so it left that market , believing that it would only be able to break free from Japanese competition by focusing on its specialty of microprocessors .  </TargetSentence>It is now a larger company many times over .  </chip.n.96><chip.n.97>But knowledge is intangible .  <TargetSentence>Two different software packages burned onto identical chips can have grossly different values .  </TargetSentence>Sometimes it all depends on luck or fads .  </chip.n.97><chip.n.98>Lee says that in the past , VIA 's chipsets were designed completely to support Intel specification CPUs .  <TargetSentence>In 1998 , when Intel insisted on sticking with expensive Rambus memory chips despite a poor market response , VIA saw its opportunity :  </TargetSentence>It began promoting use of the P133 memory chip , which had been created by an international consortium and was provided to factories free of charge .  </chip.n.98><chip.n.99>In 1998 , when Intel insisted

of 1999 , VIA acquired two CPU companies in the States , giving it an independent ability to develop CPUs .  <TargetSentence>In addition , half a year ago it entered into cooperation with the US graphics powerhouse S3 to make graphics chips .  </TargetSentence>In these ways , VIA is moving step by step to enlarge its intellectual holdings .  </chip.n.100><chip.n.101>It is only now that VIA can escape from the specifications dictated by large multinational firms , and create innovative products of its own .  <TargetSentence>To meet future market demand for home appliances that are inexpensive , multi-functional , and portable , the main direction will be to get all the functions on to a single chip .  </TargetSentence>VIA has designed a new 3 - in - 1 chipset which includes CPU , memory , and graphics , which are expected to formally hit the market in the first half of 2001 .  </chip.n.101><chip.n.102> <TargetSentence>You see a small gold chip on it , and that tells us who
