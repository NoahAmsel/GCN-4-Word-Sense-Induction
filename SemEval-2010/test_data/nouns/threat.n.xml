"  <TargetSentence>He suggested that Taiwan will have to develop long-range missiles to counter the mainland Chinese military threat .  </TargetSentence>While " effective deterrence " would remain the cornerstone of strategy , it should no longer be passive , said Lien , but " pro-active . "  </threat.n.41><threat.n.42>Lin Cheng-yi , a research fellow at the Institute of European and American Affairs at the Academia Sinica , says that the successful testing by mainland China of missiles in 1996 has altered the lines of strategic thought on both sides of the strait .  <TargetSentence>Guided missiles have replaced aircraft as the major threat to Taiwan .  </TargetSentence>In recent years mainland China has also constructed short-range surface - to - surface missile bases along its Southeast Coast which are specifically targeted at Taiwan .  </threat.n.42><threat.n.43>Although this prediction is not necessarily accurate , Taiwan should work to maintain its edge so as to guarantee peace through strength .  <TargetSentence>Fuh Wei-ku offers the following analysis : Currently the PRC weapons which pose the greatest threat to Taiwan are Sukhoi aircraft , M-class missiles , and cruise missiles .  </TargetSentence>Of these , the aircraft are already strategically of the second rank , but Taiwan must be alert to the missiles .  </threat.n.43><threat.n.44>If Taiwan were to develop long-range missiles , this would change Taiwan 's defensive posture , and alter the Taiwan - US military division of labor .  <TargetSentence>There is another possibility for Taiwan in defending against the threat of missiles from the PRC .  </TargetSentence>Besides building offensive systems , Taiwan could also join the US Theater Missile Defense -LRB- TMD -RRB- plan .  </threat.n.44><threat.n.45>Moreover , this is also necessary from the point of view of public opinion .  <TargetSentence>In an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose to morale in Taiwan , ROC Minister of Defense Tang Fei points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact .  </TargetSentence>But in Taiwan , where resources are concentrated , missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production , to transportation -LRB- harbors , highways , airports , railroads -RRB- , and to factories .  </threat.n.45><threat.n.46>In an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose to morale in Taiwan , ROC Minister of Defense Tang Fei points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact .  <TargetSentence>But in Taiwan , where resources are concentrated , missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production , to transportation -LRB- harbors , highways , airports , railroads -RRB- , and to factories .  </TargetSentence>More importantly , he says , the citizens of Taiwan are not psychologically prepared .  </threat.n.46><threat.n.47>For example , South Korea has developed its own SSMs , Singapore has airborne refueling capability , and Israel has a strategy of keeping the fighting outside its borders as much as possible .  <TargetSentence>Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation .  </TargetSentence>PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  </threat.n.47><threat.n.48>" Soft kill " refers to computer viruses and electronic interference to destroy the enemy 's computer systems , and thereby to neutralize the enemy 's military capability in a bloodless manner .  <TargetSentence>Some people see in third-wave warfare an opportunity to seize a decisive advantage in the face of a future armed threat from mainland China .  </TargetSentence>To be sure , because of the domestic development of the electronics industry in Taiwan , the ROC has a certain advantage .  </threat.n.48><threat.n.49>The outcome of Taiwan 's year 2000 presidential election is not the victory of an individual or a political party .  <TargetSentence>It is a victory of the people as well as a victory for democracy , because we have , while attracting global attention , transcended fear , threats and oppression and bravely risen to our feet together .  </TargetSentence>Taiwan stands up , demonstrating a firm insistence on reason and a sturdy faith in democracy .  </threat.n.49><threat.n.50>" This is because state enterprises pressure the government with appeals about their right to survival , " Yeh says .  <TargetSentence>When foreign firms in the mainland are confronted with threats to their safety and property , " Hong Kong can count on the cooperation of the government , US and Japanese businesses can turn to their ambassadors , but what can Taiwan firms do ? " asks Yeh .  </TargetSentence>In Dongguan they can help each other .  </threat.n.50><threat.n.51>Rural society has disintegrated , and traditional industrial sectors have withered , as newly rising electronics and information industries have appeared one after another .  <TargetSentence>These rapid changes have brought the threat of unemployment or early retirement to many individuals .  </TargetSentence>In order to cope with the increasing uncertainty of life , it is necessary for people to build up a nest egg .  </threat.n.51><threat.n.52>If Chen Shui-bian is elected , this would be Taiwan 's first case of a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another .  <TargetSentence>DPP legislator Chang Chun-hung says that the process of democratization in Taiwan during Lee Teng-hui 's administration has been smooth and tranquil , but beneath the surface there lurks a major threat to democracy : the KMT 's " black gold politics . "  </TargetSentence>Explains Chang : The DPP has never had the chance to be the ruling party , and therefore has never been in a position to fulfill its function of restraining the KMT .  </threat.n.52><threat.n.53>The effects may prove to be far - reaching .  <TargetSentence>Chang Chun-hung adds that negative election tactics , which after all may be seen in any democratic country , are not - bad as they are - the biggest threat .  </TargetSentence>He says Taiwan voters should most be on the lookout for the " one of us " effect .  </threat.n.53><threat.n.54>Perhaps the millennium
