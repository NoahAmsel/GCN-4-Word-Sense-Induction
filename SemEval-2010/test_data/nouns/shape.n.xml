<shape.n.test><shape.n.1>Professor Yuyi Liu said that he picked up the stone on the road to a yuhua stone processing plant in a suburb of Nanjing five years ago , and after he returned home he carefully inspected the stone and discovered the " territory of China " on it .  <TargetSentence>At the same time he also discovered that entrenched above the mainland territory and along the frontier lines of the northeast , the north , and the northwest of China is a huge dragon with a bright pearl in its mouth ; above this huge dragon , there is a golden facula in the shape of a gold dollar ; in the middle of the mainland territory , there is a string of torch-shaped stripes symbolizing the eternal flame of life of the Chinese nation ; adding in its resemblance to a longevity locket , altogether this stone has 5 special features .  </TargetSentence>According to this , Yuyi Liu named this stone " The Stone of the Divine Land with five unique features " .  </shape.n.1><shape.n.2>The Chinese government , especially the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region , would endeavor to develop cooperation with Kirghizia in various fields such as economy and trade , etc .  <TargetSentence>From now on , the two countries would explore and utilize the advantageous conditions of the two countries more fully , act according to rules of economy , guarantee that bilateral benefits , continuously enrich the shape of cooperation and improve the level and class of the trade of the two countries .  </TargetSentence>Because of this , both parties should endeavor to create conditions , including solving problems of traffic and transportation that hinder the development of economic and trade cooperation .  </shape.n.2><shape.n.3>The decreasing speed of eastern crude oil fields has slowed down clearly , whereas the increasing speed of western crude oil fields has been constantly accelerating .  <TargetSentence>The strategic pattern of " stabilizing the east and developing the west " has basically taken shape .  </TargetSentence>This was news passed from the working meeting of China 's Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas Corporation convened today .  </shape.n.3><shape.n.4>Among them , 57 items were approved to be listed in the national , provincial and municipal Torch Plan and their quantity ratio is tops among the new , high level technology industry zones of the entire country .  <TargetSentence>Key developments in industries such as medicine and biotechnology , new materials , computer hardware and applications , photoelectric integration , etc. have begun to take shape .  </TargetSentence>The rapid transformation of important scientific and technological achievements into real productivity is the outstanding feature of this open zone .  </shape.n.4><shape.n.5>It is also a new channel for Shanxi , an inland province , to contact the outside world .  <TargetSentence>After more than three years ' construction , this development zone has begun to take shape and has become a comprehensive wholesale market for the circulation of a variety of commodities , such as timber , medicine , tobacco , clothing , grain and oil , industrial products , etc .  </TargetSentence>At present , high-rise buildings look like a forest and merchants crowd in the development zone .  </shape.n.5><shape.n.6>The national economy is broadening its participation wider range of international delegation and international exchange ; economic and technical cooperation and exchange between China and overseas has already infiltrated into every aspect of China 's economic life .  <TargetSentence>A " wide open " environment has begun to take shape in the whole country .  </TargetSentence>According to material provided by the Ministry of Foreign Economy and Trade , during the " eighth five - year plan " period , China 's total volume of imports and exports reached 1.01 trillion US dollars , doubling that of the " seventh five - year plan " period -LRB- 1986 - 1990 -RRB- , with the rank in world trade rising from 15th in 1990 to 11th .  </shape.n.6><shape.n.7>This index means that almost half of China 's economic life now is related to the international market .  <TargetSentence>What especially deserves mentioning is that during the " eighth five - year plan " period China 's opening to the outside world has already taken the shape of gradually moving from coastal and riverside areas to its inland and remote areas .  </TargetSentence>The inland , which was relatively backward in economy before , has recently set off an surge of opening up .  </shape.n.7><shape.n.8>All grew by tens of times since their initial establishment .  <TargetSentence>Among them , a group of new high level technology pillar industries with fixed scale took shape .  </TargetSentence>There were 405 enterprises with output value exceeding 100 million yuan and 42 large enterprises with output value of more than 1 billion yuan .  </shape.n.8><shape.n.9>The whole city 's gross industrial production value for this year is estimated to reach 125.5 billion yuan , increasing by 17.5 % over last year .  <TargetSentence>A three dimensional traffic frame in Zhuhai has preliminarily taken shape and the investment environment improves daily .  </TargetSentence>A number of consortia , such as Mobil , Exxon , Amoco of the US , Shell of Holland , Yan Gu of Japan and Cheung Kong Industries Limited of Hong Kong , etc. have one after another come and settled in Zhuhai .  </shape.n.9><shape.n.10>At present , the contribution rate of progress in science and technology to this city 's economic growth reaches 40.6 % , and scientific and technological work has shown good development momentum .  <TargetSentence>The construction of Shantou 's New High Level Technology Development Zone has preliminarily taken shape .  </TargetSentence>Its eastern 1 square kilometer area , which was developed in the first phase , completed factory buildings with an area of 250,000 square meters , with 40 factory buildings under construction , and the completion of a number of such support facilities as the power relay station , the tariff - free zone , and the science and technology hotel , etc .  </shape.n.10><shape.n.11>The three large infrastructure connecting projects , such as the channel to the west of Shenzhen and Hong Kong , etc. are currently progressing smoothly .  <TargetSentence>As a group of large scale infrastructure projects are being constructed and gradually put into use , the three dimensional traffic frame Zhuhai built for cross-century economic development has begun to take shape : the construction of Guangzhou - Zhuhai railway has comprehensively started work , the construction of expressways such as Beijing - Zhuhai , etc. is progressing with much fanfare , the Zhuhai airport and Zhuhai port have been put into operation , the state of operations is great , and yet another group of large-scale infrastructures and their supporting projects are quickly preparing for construction .  </TargetSentence>The investment environment in Zhuhai is improving daily , providing broad areas for investment by international consortia .  </shape.n.11><shape.n.12>The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition .  <TargetSentence>But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya , where he was formerly director general , will whip the bank 's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992 .  </TargetSentence>The bank also says it 'll use its international network to channel investment from London , Frankfurt , Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges .  </shape.n.12><shape.n.13>`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department .  <TargetSentence>He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four - foot - high concrete slab with no openings .  </TargetSentence>In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge .  </shape.n.13><shape.n.14>But New York state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no . ''  <TargetSentence>Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six - inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says .  </TargetSentence>Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits .  </shape.n.14><shape.n.15>GAO 's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $ 300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs .  <TargetSentence>Scores of other credit programs , subsidizing agriculture , small business , exporters , defense , energy , transportation and others , are less visible but in no better shape .  </TargetSentence>If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering : The federal government holds $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees .  </shape.n.15><shape.n.16>In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members .  <TargetSentence>But the size , shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide .  </TargetSentence>That task is one of Washington 's perennial problems .  </shape.n.16><shape.n.17>After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions .  <TargetSentence>`` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? ''  </TargetSentence>Mr. Courter , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran - Contra hearings two years ago .  </shape.n.17><shape.n.18>Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987 .  <TargetSentence>Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s .  </TargetSentence>One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match .  </shape.n.18><shape.n.19>Peasants in Inner Mongolia have partly dismantled a 20 - mile section of China 's famed Great Wall , the official People 's Daily said .  <TargetSentence>The paper said the bricks were used to build homes and furnaces and , as a result , the wall `` is in terrible shape .  </TargetSentence></shape.n.19><shape.n.20>The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; thankfully , the dollar is not under 1987 - style pressure .  <TargetSentence>Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges .  </TargetSentence>They are better capitalized .  </shape.n.20><shape.n.21>Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor .  <TargetSentence>His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .  </TargetSentence>Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors .  </shape.n.21><shape.n.22>In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .  <TargetSentence>As the borderless global economy takes shape in the 21st century , the three links will help businesses expand their economic space and encourage industrial upgrading , with both sides benefiting .  </TargetSentence>But PRC economic experts note that , once both sides enter the WTO , the mainland 's large market will be contested by firms from all over the world .  </shape.n.22><shape.n.23>Everyone has high hopes for the new presidency , but we must remember that May 20th is just the first step on a long journey .  <TargetSentence>If a brighter future is to actually take shape , the government and citizens will have to work for it .  </TargetSentence>p. 75  </shape.n.23><shape.n.24>The Southeast Asia Group , which had previously specialized in bringing foreign labor to Taiwan , founded the 1111 Manpower Bank last year , focusing on five main markets : education , civil service , finance , technology , and part - time work for students .  <TargetSentence>" The interesting thing about the job bank industry is that no rules of the game have yet taken shape for the Internet .  </TargetSentence>There is much room for change and flexibility , and no one can guess how much the market might change , " says 1111 public relations manager Linda Miao .  </shape.n.24><shape.n.25>Arrowheads , with their requirement for hardness and ability to penetrate armor , had a higher ratio of tin than other weapons .  <TargetSentence>And a bronze sword , found bent out of shape from the weight of fallen clay figures sitting on it for two millennia , sprang back immediately to its original shape once the heavy objects were removed from on top of it .  </TargetSentence>It is evident that the bronze metalworkers of that time were very highly skilled .  </shape.n.25><shape.n.26>Arrowheads , with their requirement for hardness and ability to penetrate armor , had a higher ratio of tin than other weapons .  <TargetSentence>And a bronze sword , found bent out of shape from the weight of fallen clay figures sitting on it for two millennia , sprang back immediately to its original shape once the heavy objects were removed from on top of it .  </TargetSentence>It is evident that the bronze metalworkers of that time were very highly skilled .  </shape.n.26><shape.n.27>Little did he know that his words would prove prophetic .  <TargetSentence>Says Liao , " A professional writer could never go that long without writing anything , but Teng Hsiang-yang does n't make his living as a writer , and that enabled him to let the book gradually take shape over a long period of time . "  </TargetSentence>Right after winning the literary prize , however , Teng was hit with a lawsuit by the grandson of Shimoyama Hiroshi and Sazuka Toyoko , two of the people that Teng wrote about in the book .  </shape.n.27><shape.n.28>Recreational fitness  <TargetSentence>" At first I came just to get in shape .  </TargetSentence>I signed up with a group of friends who talked me into it .  </shape.n.28><shape.n.29>Hsia 's fuzzy people were born into his work as if by a natural process .  <TargetSentence>While experimenting with a tangle of lines Hsia found unidentifiable clusters taking shape , from which human forms began to emerge .  </TargetSentence>" This was something I really knew I could work with , " recalls Hsia .  </shape.n.29><shape.n.30>" There 's a lot more than you 'd think to growing wax apples , " says local farmer Chen Sheng-tzung .  <TargetSentence>" How you take care of the orchards , which equipment you use - it all has an affect on the shape and texture of the fruit . "  </TargetSentence>Prices for wax apples range widely , from around 3 pounds for NT$ 100 to NT$ 150 a pound .  </shape.n.30><shape.n.31>" No one dares be different from the others on mainland policy , " says Wang Chien-chuang .  <TargetSentence>This is because over the past few years a consensus has taken shape in Taiwan society on policy toward mainland China : " Taiwan first . "  </TargetSentence>No one has the ability to alter this consensus .  </shape.n.31><shape.n.32>Ceramic fibers , stainless steel , shrimp shells - at first glance there seems to be no connection with spinning and weaving .  <TargetSentence>But in fact these are among the latest products and trends quietly taking shape in the textile industry .  </TargetSentence>With the rise of new industries such as electronics , aerospace and biotechnology , the areas of application for textile products have expanded ever wider , from being simply coverings for the human body to finding their way up into space and down into the earth .  </shape.n.32><shape.n.33>The leading volume producer of wicking fibers in Taiwan is Chung Shing Textile Company .  <TargetSentence>Its president , William Shang , explains that conventional fibers have a round cross-section , but by changing the fibers ' physical properties it is possible to produce them with various cross-sectional profiles such as X or Y shapes , which create capillaries along the fibers .  </TargetSentence>These not only quickly wick sweat away from the skin , but also regulate body temperature and allow garments to dry quickly after washing .  </shape.n.33><shape.n.34>" I do n't work out to build muscles , but to define them .  <TargetSentence>Right now shape is what 's in .  </TargetSentence>With a little bit of muscle , your clothes look even better . "  </shape.n.34><shape.n.35>These questions require ongoing monitoring and research before objective criteria can be developed and environmental rehabilitation efforts can be carried out properly .  <TargetSentence>Once an environment that has taken shape over millions of years is destroyed , it is usually beyond man 's ability to undo the damage .  </TargetSentence>Efforts to that end often prove fruitless .  </shape.n.35><shape.n.36>What about Taiwan ?  <TargetSentence>Clearly there is already a global trend in which an information economy is taking shape .  </TargetSentence>What advantages does Taiwan have for playing a larger role in this realm ?  </shape.n.36><shape.n.37>After asking around , the museum found an old gent - a specialist in making fiberglass reproductions of old artifacts - who had done similar work for the National Museum of Prehistory .  <TargetSentence>But when Lu examined the finished products , though the shapes were super , the reproductions did n't capture the texture of the original visually , much less when picked up in the hand .  </TargetSentence>At this point , Lu had little choice but to turn for help to Liu I-chang , a research fellow at the Institute of History and Philology .  </shape.n.37><shape.n.38>For this reason Cheng made a special trip to the Linkou Plateau to collect red clay .  <TargetSentence>But he found this material impossible to get into the right shape , so he had to add a certain proportion of general-purpose potter 's clay .  </TargetSentence>After several tries , he settled on a combination of three parts Tachia clay to one part Linkou clay , with a 35 % ratio of gravel , and a layer of 100 % Linkou red clay added to the outside .  </shape.n.38><shape.n.39>Upon inspecting the original , Cheng discovered that the walls were very thin .  <TargetSentence>If the decorative pattern had been stamped on after the clay had been formed , it would certainly have ruined the shape .  </TargetSentence>So how did the original maker get the pattern on there ?  </shape.n.39><shape.n.40>Uh what that causes unfortunately is an isolated North Korea /.  <TargetSentence>His people are in terrible shape economically /.  </TargetSentence>I been there five times /.  </shape.n.40><shape.n.41>No uh the only thing I can tell you is that it would appear to me that at no time whatsoever was she a prisoner /.  <TargetSentence>If she had been a prisoner in any way shape or form I 'm sure the Allegheny County police would have charged him with those charges /.  </TargetSentence>He has never been charged with anything like that /.  </shape.n.41><shape.n.42>You saw how she looked /.  <TargetSentence>And uh she was never a prisoner in any way shape or form /.  </TargetSentence>She could have four or five years ago done whatever she wanted to do /.  </shape.n.42><shape.n.43>Even the superstructure is damaged .  <TargetSentence>Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .  </TargetSentence>Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited the Cole , was stunned by the damage .  </shape.n.43><shape.n.44>Once doctors there say they are good to go , the seven will head stateside .  <TargetSentence>Doctors in Kuwait have already said the six men and one woman are in good shape , so they may not have to stay in Germany very long .  </TargetSentence>The former POWs were rescued Sunday about 75 miles north of Baghdad .  </shape.n.44><shape.n.45>They say they 're looking forward to going home , which relatives of one former POW say could happen as soon as tomorrow .  <TargetSentence>Officials at the hospital say the seven are in good shape and their prognosis is excellent , even though three have gunshot wounds .  </TargetSentence>6:21 Eastern time , 2:21 p.m. in Iraq , Iraqi protesters demonstrate outside a Baghdad mosque , opposing what they call the U.S. occupation , and saying any new Iraqi government must represent the people .  </shape.n.45><shape.n.46><TargetSentence>Now to the new face and shape of Congress .  </TargetSentence>Republicans are still in the majority , but the election has eaten away at the size of that majority .  </shape.n.46></shape.n.test>
