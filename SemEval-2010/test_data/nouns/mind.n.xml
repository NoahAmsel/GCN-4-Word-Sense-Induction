That the Journal defends `` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence - peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD , '' etc. and so forth .  <TargetSentence>No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust ...

"  </TargetSentence>In addition , she stresses that due to the excessive burdens of the old administration , in which policies were constantly distorted by personal interests and party considerations , perhaps professionals in the Ministry of Transportation and Communications were frustrated at being unable to put their expertise into play .  </mind.n.30><mind.n.31>This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about the new administration 's ability to govern .  <TargetSentence>This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .  </TargetSentence></mind.n.31><mind.n.32>However , she said we were not to worry because children 's eyes usually correct themselves as they get older .  <TargetSentence>To ease our minds , she had already taken Chien-chien to see her uncle , an ophthalmologist .  </TargetSentence>If Chien-chien would visit him again four or five times at two - week intervals , everything would be fine .  </mind.n.32><mind.n.33>Taiwanese businessman Chen Pin , who moved to Shanghai a decade ago , has written of his experiences in Emigrating to Shanghai , which has sold like hotcakes since it was published just last October by Shang Hsun Cultural Publishing Company .  <TargetSentence>When you think of Shanghai , what comes to mind ?  </TargetSentence>The grand promenade and European-style buildings along the Bund ?  </mind.n.33><mind.n.34>Dr. Konan Peck , an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences -LRB- IBMS -RRB- , says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool .  <TargetSentence>With this in mind , Peck has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called " the poor man 's biochip , " since they cost a third less than glass chips .  </TargetSentence>Apart from the material itself being cheaper , the nylon chips use a visible-spectrum colorimetric system to display results , so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner , which costs 50 - 70 % less than using a special laser detector .  </mind.n.34><mind.n.35>The current fitness trend in Taiwan combines working out with recreation and the traditional Chinese idea of " health cultivation .

 </mind.n.78><mind.n.79>I think it 's very obvious from what Judy wrote today she is protecting somebody else /.  <TargetSentence>And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was she negotiating what she was going to say about Scooter Libby but you got to -- but you got to keep in mind I 'm a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /.  </TargetSentence>They had to negotiate with Patrick Fitzgerald what he would not talk about /.  </mind.n.79><mind.n.80>I do n't if I believe there is a psychological comparison /.  <TargetSentence>In my mind I compare to some of the federal agents who were uh injured or involved in hur- Hurricane Andrew a few years ago /.  </TargetSentence>and all they wanted to do was get home to their families /.  </mind.n.80><mind.n.81>it 's a dominant part of her life /.  <TargetSentence>and keep that in mind my friend /?
