there were also fears of war , and so any money people did have they quickly exchanged for gold or US dollars on the black market .  </TargetSentence>In the 1970s , faced with two oil crises and inflation , the idea of buying property to preserve value became widespread , and those who could afford it bought land and houses .  </market.n.751><market.n.752>At that time , the stock market had only a hundred or so listed companies , and its fate depended on a few manipulators behind the scenes .  <TargetSentence>It was seen as a " cannibalistic market " which scared off most citizens .  </TargetSentence>The past is gone  </market.n.752><market.n.753>At the time , the price of high-rise apartments in the Tanshui New Town had fallen from NT$ 220,000 per ping to NT$ 150,000 .  <TargetSentence>Congratulating herself on getting a low price , and confident that the market would rebound , Mrs. Chang happily put down the first payment and watched her brother 's family move in .  </TargetSentence>However , it was about this time that many new projects - started earlier by construction firms hoping to take advantage of peak prices - came on the market .  </market.n.753><market.n.754>Congratulating herself on getting a low price , and confident that the market would rebound , Mrs. Chang happily put down the first payment and watched her brother 's family move in .  <TargetSentence>However , it was about this time that many new projects - started earlier by construction firms hoping to take advantage of peak prices - came on the market .  </TargetSentence>The number of empty units rose to over one million .  </market.n.754><market.n.755>Not necessarily .  <TargetSentence>Looking around the world , at the US , Japan , Hong Kong , and even mainland China , there are countless examples of long-term downturns in the housing market .  </TargetSentence>The popular book Die Broke notes that the sharp rise in housing prices in the US in the 1960s and 1970s was due to underlying structural factors :  </market.n.755><market.n.756>At that time , some of the older generation about to retire happily sold their houses to the younger at high prices .  <TargetSentence>The large profits they earned attracted numerous speculators into the market , and prices were driven even higher , encouraging construction of ever more homes .  </TargetSentence>But now that most of the baby boomers have their own homes , and the current " e-generation " is smaller , who are all those extra homes going to be sold to ?  </market.n.756><market.n.757>Another factor driving " investment anxiety " is peer pressure . "  <TargetSentence>If a 40 - year - old does not have a securities account , he wo n't be able to engage in conversations with his peers about the market , so naturally he will feel out of touch , " says Cabula Chang .  </TargetSentence>Chang admits that he still lives in a rented house in Tanshui .  </market.n.757><market.n.758>But within less than two years , the stock collapsed and became worthless paper .  <TargetSentence>Chang recalls an inexperienced reporter who got sucked in to the market two years ago by some irresistible insider information .  </TargetSentence>He even mortgaged his house and persuaded his friends to invest with him .  </market.n.758><market.n.759>But members of the e-generation often have more specific objectives in mind .  <TargetSentence>Lin Yu-ting , currently a sophomore in the Department of Financial Management at National Chengchi University , puts the money she makes working part-time into the market .  </TargetSentence>She says that she has " a specific plan for each period of time , such as going abroad , or buying a car .
