<entry.n.test><entry.n.1>Therefore , any work that can follow tradition but not stagnate , and have new artistic concepts will be appraised well .  <TargetSentence>In a serious yet harmonious discussion , the judges thinking achieved unity and decided this round 's outstanding entries .  </TargetSentence>One kind of situation embarrassed the judges , namely , that some works displayed really beautifully written characters , conformed to a certain calligraphy style , and showed signs of new achievement in art form , but regretfully , because the calligraphers have poor basic knowledge , they wrote some wrong characters , and since there was no remedy , finally lost in the selection .  </entry.n.1><entry.n.2>Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , August 31st  <TargetSentence>The main Bureau of Customs recently issued an announcement that Customs would implement protective measures for intellectual property rights at border entry and exit junctions starting on September 15th , 1994 in accordance with currently implemented related laws and the " decision regarding the further strengthening of work protecting intellectual property rights " by the State Council .  </TargetSentence>The announcement clearly pointed out that goods violating intellectual property rights , including exclusive rights of trademarks , copyrights and patent rights , were not allowed to be imported or exported ; when Customs discovers the import and export of goods that are reported as violating rights and other goods that were suspected of violating intellectual property rights , it has the right to ask the people importing and exporting the goods to provide legal proof of use of related intellectual property rights and make additional reports to Customs about the state of the intellectual property rights of goods .  </entry.n.2><entry.n.3>At the same time , Yongtu Long pointed out that the Chinese side understands the concern of the American side over Sino-American trade imbalance .  <TargetSentence>The Chinese side will adopt active and practical steps to further reduce tariffs , reduce non-tariff management measures , improve market entry conditions and increase imports from the US .  </TargetSentence>At the same time , the Chinese side also hopes the American side will relax restrictions over the export of Chinese high-tech products , gradually jointly realizing a trade balance between the two countries using positive methods , to create conditions for the healthy and stable development of Sino-American economy and trade relations .  </entry.n.3><entry.n.4>Last October , the Import and Export Bank of China invited Nomura Securities of Japan to be advisors , and submitted a formal assessment application to the Commune Bond Research Institute of Japan , a famous assessment institution in Japan .  <TargetSentence>The reason behind the decision by the Import and Export Bank of China to obtain a credit rating in Japan first is to prepare for entry into the international capital market for financing , so as to expand sources of funds , and to support the export of Chinese electromechanical products and complete sets of equipment .  </TargetSentence>Through such modes as written presentations and field studies , etc. the Import and Export Bank of China comprehensively presented the situation of China 's financial system reform since the beginning of the year , the background on the establishment of the bank , management and operations of the bank , the current situation of the bank 's business development and its future development objectives to the Commune Bond Research Institute , resulting in a deeper understanding of the Import and Export Bank of China .  </entry.n.4><entry.n.5>In order to promote the development of the Tumen River region , South Korea donated one million US dollars to establish the Tumen River development fund .  <TargetSentence>Now , 100,000 US dollars has been taken from the fund to make an evaluation of the environment in China 's Huichun 's frontier cooperative area in the expectation of providing consultation on the environmental aspect for the entry of large quantities of foreign capital into this area .  </TargetSentence>Zhezhu Quan , vice governor of Jilin Province who is in charge of the work of economy and trade , said : " International societies are welcome to join us for joint promotion of the Tumen River development undertaking , and the development of the regional economy so as to benefit the people of Northeast Asia . "  </entry.n.5><entry.n.6>P&amp;G , in particular , rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test - marketing .  <TargetSentence>Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents - off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field .  </TargetSentence>P&amp;G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged - goods techniques with the image - making of the cosmetics trade in the mass - market end of the business .  </entry.n.6><entry.n.7>He talked about it in every speech he made as he roamed the country promoting his books , which dispense handy how - to advice on using government information for fun and profit .  <TargetSentence>Mr. Lesko figured he would be flooded with entries by now .  </TargetSentence>After all , he says , `` we 've got like 15 million bureaucrats . ''  </entry.n.7><entry.n.8>And in addition to the $ 5,000 , he has promised the winner a `` My Favorite Bureaucrat '' plaque and offered each of two runners - up $ 500 .  <TargetSentence>So far , though , Mr. Lesko has received only one entry .  </TargetSentence>To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss .  </entry.n.8><entry.n.9>Maybe Americans are just so annoyed with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while .  <TargetSentence>If he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something , Mr. Lesko admits , `` I 'd get 5,000 entries . ''  </TargetSentence>Now there 's an idea .  </entry.n.9><entry.n.10>After being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color - coded .  <TargetSentence>Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes .  </TargetSentence>Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness .  </entry.n.10><entry.n.11>P&amp;G , Cincinnati , agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock , a total of about 11 million P&amp;G shares .  <TargetSentence>The transaction would mark the entry of P&amp;G into cosmetics .  </TargetSentence>The company already markets a wide range of detergents , food , household and health - care products .  </entry.n.11><entry.n.12>It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico .  <TargetSentence>The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business .  </TargetSentence>The company , which has interests in television , trucking services , and glass - making and food - processing equipment , said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .  </entry.n.12><entry.n.13><TargetSentence>In response to your overly optimistic , outdated piece on how long unemployment lasts -LRB- People Patterns , Sept. 20 -RRB- : I am in the communications field , above entry level .  </TargetSentence>I was laid off in August 1988 , and after a thorough and exhausting job search , was hired in August 1989 .  </entry.n.13><entry.n.14>CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes .  <TargetSentence>CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late - night talk show format since 1972 .  </TargetSentence>`` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August .  </entry.n.14><entry.n.15>-LRB- They were originally supposed to start on January 1 , but were postponed to the 2nd at the request of the PRC . -RRB-  <TargetSentence>This step is seen as setting the stage for the eventual opening of the full " three links " - direct mail , commerce , and transport between Taiwan proper and the PRC - and for Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization .  </TargetSentence>But the PRC has remained as chilly as ever , and it is uncertain what breakthroughs and benefits can be realized through the little three links .  </entry.n.15><entry.n.16>Looking ahead , with the alteration of the previous administration 's " no haste " policy , cross-strait trade relations will enter a new era .  <TargetSentence>On December 20 , Premier Chang Chun-hsiung declared that the opening of the little three links on January 1 was a major part of the government 's mainland policy , and also the prelude to the full three links that will be implemented after WTO entry .  </TargetSentence>Tsai Ing-wen , chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Commission -LRB- MAC -RRB- , says that the focus in the first stage of the little three links will be on the issues of public security and the local economy in Kinmen and Matsu .  </entry.n.16><entry.n.17>On December 18 , MAC Vice-Chairman Teng Chen-chung stated that the government has already begun planning for the full three links .  <TargetSentence>Faced with questions raised by some legislators that the government is focusing on the little three links as a tactic to postpone the full three links , Teng declared that the full three links will definitely be implemented , but the first priority is to coordinate these with Taiwan 's WTO entry , with secondary attention going to Taiwan 's own needs .  </TargetSentence>Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links .  </entry.n.17><entry.n.18>No wonder some prefer to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .  <TargetSentence>The fact that the contest for nine works to be placed along Taipei 's " Tunhwa Art Corridor , " organized by Taipei 's Urban Development Department , drew entries from over 130 artists , shows how intense the competition can be .  </TargetSentence>And it is sculptors who have been the biggest beneficiaries of the new policies , since three - dimensional art is the most suitable form for installation in open spaces : of the 55 public art works completed in 1998 , 40 were works of sculpture .  </entry.n.18><entry.n.19>The committee appraises works for artistic quality , suitability for the location , safety and feasibility .  <TargetSentence>Entries which pass the first round are presented for public demonstration and discussion among the community , so as to avoid subsequent protests .  </TargetSentence>Unlike those working with other forms of art , the creators of public art need to have a grasp of architectural structure , environmental scenery and even accounting procedure .  </entry.n.19><entry.n.20>It may be that the pursuit of economic and trade relations is the only way to get Taiwan and mainland China onto the path toward a resolution of the cross-strait stalemate .  <TargetSentence>Separate entry into the WTO by Taiwan and mainland China may be the best opportunity for the two sides to settle upon a " no unification , no independence " modus vivendi .  </TargetSentence>It seems apparent that mainland China is the only place where Taiwan 's traditional industries can survive .  </entry.n.20><entry.n.21>The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .  <TargetSentence>The host government even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live .  </TargetSentence>The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .  </entry.n.21><entry.n.22>BMEC director Johnsee Lee observes that the level of scientific and technical know-how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited .  <TargetSentence>However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .  </TargetSentence>Thus , says Lee , " Taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "  </entry.n.22><entry.n.23>The leading company had an after - tax income last year of US$ 90 million .  <TargetSentence>Though there have been suggestions that the Internet is already becoming the main way to find employment , Lee contends that " the obstacles to entry are still great " for the ordinary person : You have to have a computer and be online , and you have to know how to find what you are looking for .  </TargetSentence>When you consider this , print media is still much more convenient .  </entry.n.23><entry.n.24>Although pro-Beijing elements prevail in Macau , the former Portuguese administration did n't seem too bothered about PRC pressure when it came to the issue of ties with Taiwan , perhaps because their only concern was for people 's livelihood .  <TargetSentence>Visa - free entry to Macau for Taiwanese is a case in point .  </TargetSentence>Explains Wong Hon Keong : " Macau offers visa - free access to residents of over 40 countries with which it has consular relations , but Taiwan is the only place for which it provides visa - free access without there being diplomatic ties . "  </entry.n.24><entry.n.25>The international airport , where flights between Taiwan and the mainland make a stopover , allows for " one - plane " travel between the two sides .  <TargetSentence>Also , the continued provision after the handover of visa - free entry for Taiwanese , along with the relative ease with which Taiwan officials can visit the SAR , testifies to Macau 's flexibility in these matters .  </TargetSentence>" Macau will help to boost cross-strait relations , " says Wong Hon Keong .  </entry.n.25><entry.n.26>Also , there needs to be clear progress in the critical area of cross-strait relations .  <TargetSentence>Although entry into the World Trade Organization will create a new situation in the Taiwan Strait , the two sides remain in an obscure relationship that is neither war nor peace .  </TargetSentence>Taiwan must come up with a comprehensive policy that considers economic , diplomatic , and military factors .  </entry.n.26><entry.n.27>Taiwan 's diplomatic partners have economic needs , so we give financial assistance .  <TargetSentence>We have diplomatic problems , so our diplomatic partners support our entry into international organizations .  </TargetSentence>Each side gets something it needs , and the relationship can not be summed up as a purely financial one .  </entry.n.27><entry.n.28>For international organizations of which the PRC is already member , such as the United Nations , although Taiwan has repeatedly knocked at the door , it has met with repeated failure as a result of international pressure imposed by the PRC under the " one China " principle .  <TargetSentence>As for the World Trade Organi-zation , to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible , the PRC has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to Taiwan .  </TargetSentence>However , because negotiations with the United States on early PRC entry have not reached a successful outcome , PRC entry has been continually postponed , which has seriously affected the schedule for ROC entry .  </entry.n.28><entry.n.29>As for the World Trade Organi-zation , to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible , the PRC has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to Taiwan .  <TargetSentence>However , because negotiations with the United States on early PRC entry have not reached a successful outcome , PRC entry has been continually postponed , which has seriously affected the schedule for ROC entry .  </TargetSentence>In this age of the global village , international organizations are increasingly important .  </entry.n.29><entry.n.30>As for the World Trade Organi-zation , to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible , the PRC has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to Taiwan .  <TargetSentence>However , because negotiations with the United States on early PRC entry have not reached a successful outcome , PRC entry has been continually postponed , which has seriously affected the schedule for ROC entry .  </TargetSentence>In this age of the global village , international organizations are increasingly important .  </entry.n.30><entry.n.31>As for the World Trade Organi-zation , to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible , the PRC has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to Taiwan .  <TargetSentence>However , because negotiations with the United States on early PRC entry have not reached a successful outcome , PRC entry has been continually postponed , which has seriously affected the schedule for ROC entry .  </TargetSentence>In this age of the global village , international organizations are increasingly important .  </entry.n.31><entry.n.32>Lo Chih-cheng says that you can not only look at the results of efforts to enter the UN - you also have to look at the significance of the process .  <TargetSentence>" Applying for entry to the UN demonstrates that Taiwan is a sovereign state and is qualified to be a UN member .  </TargetSentence>This reminds the international community to be aware of Taiwan 's existence .  </entry.n.32><entry.n.33>In addition , from the perspective of the foreign ministry , efforts to re-enter the UN are not only excellent training for diplomatic personnel , but also provide a regular test of how secure relations are between the ROC and its diplomatic partner states , " explains Lo .  <TargetSentence>The PRC worked for 21 years to gain entry to the UN , while we have only been at it a few years .  </TargetSentence>There 's no point in getting overanxious .  </entry.n.33><entry.n.34>That being the case , so far , how has the new foreign policy team been doing ?  <TargetSentence>Joanne Chang of the Academia Sinica says that although most people feel that the new government 's strategies - " diplomacy of the whole people , " economic diplomacy , and entry into nongovernmental organizations - differ little from the past , you must remember that diplomacy is a long-term game , and , in the details , the new foreign policy team has already brought in some fresh air .  </TargetSentence>For example , she notes , recently the MOFA , through its " virtual diplomacy institute , " has begun offering a class in " diplomacy of the whole people " that provides training to legislative assistants , political party staff , and employees of nongovernmental organizations .  </entry.n.34><entry.n.35>Secondly , you should analyze why customers in your market segment would like to do business with you .  <TargetSentence>You 've also got to consider how to prevent competitors from taking customers within the same market segment or how to effectively create entry barriers , so that you will be able to maintain a competitive advantage for as long as possible .  </TargetSentence>A price war is the simplest strategy , but consequently its effects are the most limited .  </entry.n.35><entry.n.36>And if you really do n't have weighty competitors , then your competitor is yourself .  <TargetSentence>Entry barriers and exit barriers have opposite effects .  </TargetSentence>The former determines if there will be a swarm of competitors .  </entry.n.36><entry.n.37>The former determines if there will be a swarm of competitors .  <TargetSentence>-LRB- If entry barriers are low , anyone can compete . -RRB-  </TargetSentence>The latter determines whether there will be detrimental competition .  </entry.n.37><entry.n.38>Please remember :  <TargetSentence>1. When you analyze entry barriers , you should also analyze exit barriers .  </TargetSentence>2. You should focus on your " core competencies . "  </entry.n.38><entry.n.39>But you would only get responses like : " Let 's not talk politics , " or " Everyone is seeking stability , and there wo n't be much of a change . "  <TargetSentence>Most of the businessmen expressed optimism that after the entry of the PRC and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization later this year , relations between the two sides would steadily improve .  </TargetSentence>A terrifying topic ?  </entry.n.39><entry.n.40>The results of a recent international survey measuring the performance of junior high school students in natural sciences and math show that Taiwan kids finished first in the former and third -LRB- behind only Singapore and Korea -RRB- in the latter .  <TargetSentence>Alice Chang , CEO of CyberLink Corporation , whose firm has become a much - coveted new entry in the stock market and has drawn international attention with audio-visual software like Power DVD and Talking Show , says : " Talented people are at the root of knowledge . "  </TargetSentence>AV software is very difficult to produce , and staff must have a solid grounding in math .  </entry.n.40><entry.n.41>Cheng Yung-gwo , who is addressed by the respectful title " Teacher Cheng " by all the museum staff high and low , is one of the Young Turks on the Taiwan ceramics scene .  <TargetSentence>He first gained fame with an award - winnnig entry in the annual Golden Ceramics Award competition .  </TargetSentence>But the most important reason why the Yingko Ceramics Museum gave him sole and total control over the recreation of the 36 pieces of prehistoric pottery in the exhibit is this : He is the only leading ceramicist in all of Taiwan who also graduated from university with a degree in archeology .  </entry.n.41><entry.n.42>We have maintained the emergency uh rescue vehicle on stand by /.  <TargetSentence>and we will continue to do that for a couple more days until we have completed all our entry analysis /.  </TargetSentence>At that time we 'll release the uh Atlantis for its normal processing for its next flight /.  </entry.n.42><entry.n.43>There 's lots and lots of opportunities to add new accessories and games .  <TargetSentence>Selling , that 's the real game here , and Sony will not be the only entry .  </TargetSentence>Microsoft is developing a system called XIC Box for release next year , and Nintendo , once a dominant player , is plotting a comeback .  </entry.n.43><entry.n.44>As Serbia is preparing to inaugurate a new government , some members of former President Slobodan Milosevic 's family are leaving the country .  <TargetSentence>The son of Milosevic , Marco , tried unsuccessfully to flee to China , but he was refused entry and was on his way back to Moscow from where he came .  </TargetSentence>Earlier Marco Milosevic did not receive a visa in Russia , a situation which could only be cleared after his uncle and diplomats intervened .  </entry.n.44><entry.n.45>The Israeli Army has imposed a complete blockade of the part of the West Bank under the control of the Palestinian Authority .  <TargetSentence>No entry to or exit from the territory is to be allowed except for humanitarian cases .  </TargetSentence>The move comes at the end of a day of intense violence across the West Bank in which 10 people were killed , 7 Palestinians and 3 Israelis .  </entry.n.45></entry.n.test>
