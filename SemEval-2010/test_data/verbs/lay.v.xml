-- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .<TargetSentence>Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .</TargetSentence>Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what

; ; walks laid ; ; and ground had been broken for the superintendent 's home .</TargetSentence>Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .</lay.v.27><lay.v.28>It is a splendid structure .<TargetSentence>From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; ; from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .</TargetSentence>The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .</lay.v.28><lay.v.29>These my grandmother left in their places -LRB- they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man -RRB- and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .<TargetSentence>Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink ; ; the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; ; and the poppies .</TargetSentence>I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .</lay.v.29><lay.v.30>But the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides .<TargetSentence>The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees .</TargetSentence>Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .</lay.v.30><lay.v.31>Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .<TargetSentence>The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .</TargetSentence>As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .</lay.v.31><lay.v.32><TargetSentence>Standing in the shelter of the tent -- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer drumming -- Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beer barrels .</TargetSentence>There was , of course , no real need to rearrange everything .</lay.v.32><lay.v.33>The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street .<TargetSentence>Beyond that misty gray of the rain , he saw the stretching hutment , low diminutive log cabins , chinked with mud , with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through , with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes , or fence rails , with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud .</TargetSentence>The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out .</lay.v.33><lay.v.34>When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ? ?<TargetSentence>Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate 's asking for Christ 's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn .</TargetSentence>Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .</lay.v.34><lay.v.35>New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .<TargetSentence>It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .</TargetSentence>From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses , estates , and big farms of the original -LRB- non-Indian -RRB- landowners began .</lay.v.35><lay.v.36>I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .<TargetSentence>Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach .</TargetSentence>He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet .</lay.v.36><lay.v.37>Leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply .<TargetSentence>Winston laid it in the basket .</TargetSentence>`` Mr. Jack sets store by that '' .</lay.v.37><lay.v.38>`` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' .<TargetSentence>I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round .</TargetSentence>He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me .</lay.v.38><lay.v.39>I 'll be waiting for you there '' .<TargetSentence>The bartender brought Rourke 's drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar .</TargetSentence>He said in a low voice , `` I 've got a date with a lady , Mister .</lay.v.39><lay.v.40>Because , if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , tougher , than anything else that went on two legs .<TargetSentence>Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger .</TargetSentence>Faith Constable had had to `` go on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone on .</lay.v.40><lay.v.41>He stared at the report in Killpath 's hand , sure it was written by Accacia -- just as sure as if he 'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand .<TargetSentence>He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station 's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector 's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment

Ryan ? ?</lay.v.43><lay.v.44>`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' .<TargetSentence>He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion 's quivering neck .</TargetSentence>`` Help me up , Clay .</lay.v.44><lay.v.45>Powers knocked his arm aside .<TargetSentence>Deliberately , with none of Rankin 's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard 's head .</TargetSentence>They were free .</lay.v.45><lay.v.46>That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil &amp; Gas Company .<TargetSentence>Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line .</TargetSentence>McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .</lay.v.46><lay.v.47>`` huh-uh .<TargetSentence>Now , Mis-ter McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss 's arm .</TargetSentence>It was strictly the deputy 's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in .</lay.v.47><lay.v.48>They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides .<TargetSentence>No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there .</TargetSentence>His face took on a sudden pallor , became beaded with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing .</lay.v.48><lay.v.49>Once again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready .<TargetSentence>Later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne , he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made .</TargetSentence>`` Exterminatin ' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he 'd blandly announce .</lay.v.49><lay.v.50>Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .<TargetSentence>It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man 's cheekbone and his chin .</TargetSentence>Ramey 's fist and the air expelled from the man 's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .</lay.v.50><lay.v.51>`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ?<TargetSentence>Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine 's reach and away from their shadows .</TargetSentence>He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .</lay.v.51><lay.v.52>Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' .<TargetSentence>He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .</TargetSentence>Almost immediately they began to sizzle .</lay.v.52><lay.v.53>Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .<TargetSentence>Worry had a great deal to do with it ; ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father 's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .</TargetSentence>Mr. Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife 's people without contributing to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .</lay.v.53><lay.v.54>The search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening closets , talking , exclaiming in rushes and gasps .<TargetSentence>Everything was as I had left it the night before last -- her portfolio and bag for town , her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing .</TargetSentence>And she .</lay.v.54><lay.v.55>`` I do n't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention .<TargetSentence>Changing his clothes , he put on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good .</TargetSentence>But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself .</lay.v.55><lay.v.56>The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .<TargetSentence>Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind .</TargetSentence>When he rose in the morning , the image was still there .</lay.v.56><lay.v.57>Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same .<TargetSentence>He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor .</TargetSentence>Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts .</lay.v.57><lay.v.58>To his amazement he reached him .<TargetSentence>Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold .</TargetSentence>He did n't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly .</lay.v.58><lay.v.59>A couple of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' .<TargetSentence>In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap .</TargetSentence>After a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it .</lay.v.59><lay.v.60>[speaker#2] These are the relics and ruins left to us by the Great Tangshan Earthquake .<TargetSentence>[speaker#2] In that calamity , all of
