on two distinct and delicate tracts -- legal , which they will pursue to keep options open , and political , which they have to watch carefully as they feel mounting pressure .<TargetSentence>Friends point out that the man who was so quick to concede the first time to George W. Bush when he thought he lost and who told aides , `` we have to do this right , '' is not a politician who would insist on a long , damaging legal process , if it is determined that 's what going to court would mean .</TargetSentence>Bill Clinton called Al Gore today to talk to him , less to offer advice than support .</insist.v.17><insist.v.18>She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet .<TargetSentence>`` Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him '' , the friend continued .</TargetSentence>It seemed as though she were always auditioning .</insist.v.18><insist.v.19>`` A child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity '' .<TargetSentence>That is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist 's advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early .</TargetSentence>`` Both because of our culture 's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so .</insist.v.19><insist.v.20>These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .<TargetSentence>It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .</TargetSentence>But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment .</insist.v.20><insist.v.21>One Federal soldier wrote : `` the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do -LRB- c -RRB- ters and offersey when this war is over '' .<TargetSentence>Shortly after the beginning of Sherman 's Georgia campaign , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment .</TargetSentence>I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than -LRB- by -RRB- Union quackery '' .</insist.v.21><insist.v.22>Shortly after the beginning of Sherman 's Georgia campaign , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment .<TargetSentence>I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than -LRB- by -RRB- Union quackery '' .</TargetSentence>The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred .</insist.v.22><insist.v.23>Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment .<TargetSentence>Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .</TargetSentence>In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them .</insist.v.23><insist.v.24>He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature .<TargetSentence>But his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son .</TargetSentence>At the moment he was excited about his son 's having received the Prix De Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb .</insist.v.24><insist.v.25>Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism , exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday .<TargetSentence>William Styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes .</TargetSentence>Even the great god Faulkner , the South 's one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters ; ; such are simply not within his bounded province .</insist.v.25><insist.v.26>Many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious Old South '' imagery , creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell 's `` Tara '' Plantation .<TargetSentence>Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .</TargetSentence>Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; ; but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .</insist.v.26><insist.v.27>I think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject .<TargetSentence>The difference came down to this : The Southern States insisted that the United States was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a Union of States .</TargetSentence>To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it .</insist.v.27><insist.v.28>That society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal .<TargetSentence>If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .</TargetSentence>He must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .</insist.v.28><insist.v.29>Properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution .<TargetSentence>If we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man ; ; best growth .</TargetSentence>But we can not start off with a clean slate .</insist.v.29><insist.v.30>With scarcely a mumble of excuse , I fled .<TargetSentence>I fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word `` things '' -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which I had already insisted upon finding out for myself -LRB- despite , I may now say , the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood -RRB- because I was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a mollycoddle waiting for Life but to seize Life by the throat .</TargetSentence>I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .</insist.v.30><insist.v.31>The innocence of which I speak is , I know , not incorruptible .<TargetSentence>But I insist upon believing that even when it is lost , it may , like paradise , be regained .</TargetSentence>However , it was not of innocence in general that I was speaking , but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love .</insist.v.31><insist.v.32>Carl was still Charles A.
