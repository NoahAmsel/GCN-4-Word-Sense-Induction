<reveal.v.test><reveal.v.1><TargetSentence>A note scribbled by an officer on the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk has revealed that at least 23 of its 118 crewmembers survived the explosions which sank the vessel .</TargetSentence>The note was found in the pocket of Lieutenant Dimitri Kolesnikov whose body was one of the first to be recovered the explosions that shattered the submarine .</reveal.v.1><reveal.v.2>As we 've said all along the government of Libya must take responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials .<TargetSentence>That means revealing everything they know about the Lockerbie bombing , paying reparations , a clear declaration acknowledging responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials and clear unambiguous actions which demonstrate the Libyan government understands this responsibility .</TargetSentence>But late Wednesday a Libyan Foreign Ministry official said Eee is not to blame for the bombing .</reveal.v.2><reveal.v.3>Opponents of Slobodan Milosevic called on the Yugoslav President to relinquish power immediately .<TargetSentence>An opposition spokesman demanded that Milosevic accept the electoral will of the people , that the Federal Electoral Commission reveal what she called the true result of the election .</TargetSentence>There were speeches and even songs , denouncing Slobodan Milosevic and praising opposition leader , Vojislav Kostunica , but the singing stopped and at least some shooting began .</reveal.v.3><reveal.v.4>While in Washington today , a potential bombshell .<TargetSentence>During a congressional hearing 's revealed the National Security Agency , a super secret intelligence service issued a warning about a potential terrorist attack .</TargetSentence>They talked about one individual and one group which we know the name of that was deliberately going to take action against the U.S. and or Israel in Yemen , and a top Pentagon official testifies the warning was actually , shoeed only hours before the Cole was bombed , issued only hours before the Cole was bombed .</reveal.v.4><reveal.v.5>Pentagon officials still insist the flfings was too vague to prevent the Cole bombing but there were apparently earlier warnings as well .<TargetSentence>In a separate hearing today , it was revealed a Middle East analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency also warned of impending attacks then resigned in frustration the day after the Cole bombing .</TargetSentence>He also warns that two or three more attacks could come in the next few weeks .</reveal.v.5><reveal.v.6>Already in its sixth month , the Lockerbie trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland 12 years ago is moving at a snail 's pace .<TargetSentence>The latest series of delays come as new information has been revealed to the defense by the prosecution .</TargetSentence>Such a move in the middle of a trial is considered highly unusual unless the information is so sensitive it could harm the case if not revealed during the trial .</reveal.v.6><reveal.v.7>The latest series of delays come as new information has been revealed to the defense by the prosecution .<TargetSentence>Such a move in the middle of a trial is considered highly unusual unless the information is so sensitive it could harm the case if not revealed during the trial .</TargetSentence>The information includes details of six new potential witnesses and other information from six countries on three different continents .</reveal.v.7><reveal.v.8>Defense lawyers say the new information , if true , will have the greatest conceivable effect on the trial .<TargetSentence>Two weeks ago , prosecutors revealed the existence of the new information and just this Monday , handed it over to defense lawyers .</TargetSentence>Teams of investigators have now fanned out to conduct interviews related to this new information for the defense team .</reveal.v.8><reveal.v.9>Reporter :<TargetSentence>And she reveals success in a 1989 test , using aerial bombs to disperse biological agents .</TargetSentence> </reveal.v.9><reveal.v.10>Two doctors agreed JDS is , `` in good health .

''</TargetSentence>For the first time , with the `` Cole '' out of the water , the full impact of the catastrophic blast clearly visible .</reveal.v.12><reveal.v.13>It was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication '' .<TargetSentence>To the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and history , socio-economic identity , education .</TargetSentence>It is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .</reveal.v.13><reveal.v.14>An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .<TargetSentence>With this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture .</TargetSentence>The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .</reveal.v.14><reveal.v.15>In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript -LRB- reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes -RRB- goes like this : The therapist 's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ; or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people .<TargetSentence>The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language -LRB- i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education -RRB- , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before .</TargetSentence>Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient 's general style of speech up to this point .</reveal.v.15><reveal.v.16>The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ; so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .<TargetSentence>By saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .</TargetSentence>This the therapist may pursue in later questioning .</reveal.v.16><reveal.v.17>Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .<TargetSentence>Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .</TargetSentence>Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' .</reveal.v.17><reveal.v.18>So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School , Lake Placid , New York .<TargetSentence>In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school .</TargetSentence>Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .</reveal.v.18><reveal.v.19>Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked '' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period '' .<TargetSentence>Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .</TargetSentence>The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger '' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons .</reveal.v.19><reveal.v.20>Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .<TargetSentence>Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling .</TargetSentence>Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville .</reveal.v.20><reveal.v.21>The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .<TargetSentence>Only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains .</TargetSentence>Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .</reveal.v.21><reveal.v.22>Thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; ; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold .<TargetSentence>Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .</TargetSentence>The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .</reveal.v.22><reveal.v.23>At that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips .<TargetSentence>A few years ago , not too long before his death , Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders .</TargetSentence>He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from Lizzie .</reveal.v.23><reveal.v.24>Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately '' .<TargetSentence>Who won is not revealed , but Winslow 's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words .</TargetSentence>There was another family interest also .</reveal.v.24><reveal.v.25>If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .<TargetSentence>Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .</TargetSentence>In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church .</reveal.v.25><reveal.v.26>They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .<TargetSentence>What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .</TargetSentence>The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman 's staff .</reveal.v.26><reveal.v.27>He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham 's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity .<TargetSentence>For Mr. Taylor 's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl 's cape lined with grass .</TargetSentence>Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .</reveal.v.27><reveal.v.28>The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .<TargetSentence>The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .</TargetSentence>He is still concerned , however , with a personal event .</reveal.v.28><reveal.v.29>The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; ; they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious .<TargetSentence>With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .</TargetSentence>Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .</reveal.v.29><reveal.v.30>Lautner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' .<TargetSentence>The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .</TargetSentence>His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .</reveal.v.30><reveal.v.31>And this occurs now , at the refrain of Jacoby 's song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` Lizzy '' -- ; ; a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' .<TargetSentence>`` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' .</TargetSentence>It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity .</reveal.v.31><reveal.v.32>`` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' .<TargetSentence>It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity .</TargetSentence>By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; ; he collapses , and dies .</reveal.v.32><reveal.v.33>Instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done .<TargetSentence>Drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president , Eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking .</TargetSentence>Despite three warnings , no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from Wilson 's .</reveal.v.33><reveal.v.34>Mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell .<TargetSentence>And when he retold the legend of Gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language ; ; while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner .</TargetSentence>Grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins Sibylla and Wiligis .</reveal.v.34><reveal.v.35>Grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries Sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him .<TargetSentence>Sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband , and the identities of mother and son are revealed .</TargetSentence>Grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years .</reveal.v.35><reveal.v.36>He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .<TargetSentence>Faulkner 's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr. O'Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South .</TargetSentence>If he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist .</reveal.v.36><reveal.v.37>Ernest Gross replied the next day , putting the suspended diplomat 's fears to rest .<TargetSentence>`` This reveals some misunderstanding on your part .</TargetSentence>The group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings .</reveal.v.37><reveal.v.38>They were far off and looked tiny .<TargetSentence>The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them .</TargetSentence>They turned at the bottom of Kate 's steps and moved off in the direction of the park .</reveal.v.38><reveal.v.39>He asked to be appointed a preacher .<TargetSentence>But Michael Sept had unmasked him , revealing he had never been a bishop , but was an Anabaptist , afraid to state his faith , because he knew John Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death .</TargetSentence>So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now Caroli sought revenge .</reveal.v.39><reveal.v.40>It 's all in your mind '' .<TargetSentence>A couple of sobs escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state .</TargetSentence>`` Why , I 'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment '' .</reveal.v.40><reveal.v.41>`` Her '' ? ?<TargetSentence>The wrinkled mouth laughed , revealing astonishingly strong , white , teeth .</TargetSentence>`` I never see none .</reveal.v.41><reveal.v.42>A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky .<TargetSentence>The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .</TargetSentence>They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .</reveal.v.42><reveal.v.43>They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose .<TargetSentence>Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .</TargetSentence>He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .</reveal.v.43><reveal.v.44>He spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality .<TargetSentence>He wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath .</TargetSentence>It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was .</reveal.v.44><reveal.v.45>But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing .<TargetSentence>A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman 's hiding place .</TargetSentence>There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .</reveal.v.45><reveal.v.46>He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him .<TargetSentence>A glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away .</TargetSentence>The aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained , well-organized crew struck Alexander with horror .</reveal.v.46><reveal.v.47>But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away .<TargetSentence>It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed .</TargetSentence>There were bloodspots on the sheet .</reveal.v.47><reveal.v.48>The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals .<TargetSentence>Her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness .</TargetSentence>So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair .</reveal.v.48><reveal.v.49>[speaker#2] On the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Great Tangshan Earthquake , that is in April of 1996 , Qinglong was
