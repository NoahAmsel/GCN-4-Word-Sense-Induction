blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman .</TargetSentence>Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his

reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .<TargetSentence>In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .</TargetSentence>This , in fact , it turned out to be .</operate.v.19><operate.v.20>Wine waiters are something else again ; ; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts .<TargetSentence>Most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself .</TargetSentence>Now the drinking of wine -LRB- and happily so ! ! -RRB- is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all .</operate.v.20><operate.v.21>An excellent crop was expected that year .<TargetSentence>William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary 's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .</TargetSentence>Giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large

portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation .</operate.v.22><operate.v.23>Nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept .<TargetSentence>Thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces '' to operate and cure the distress .</TargetSentence>That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; ; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment .</operate.v.23><operate.v.24>For better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .<TargetSentence>Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation 's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish .</TargetSentence>The hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .</operate.v.24><operate.v.25>The former receives its legitimacy from the latter .<TargetSentence>Operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state .</TargetSentence>While sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern .</operate.v.25><operate.v.26>No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .<TargetSentence>Wisman , who has had the chief controller 's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .</TargetSentence>At least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him

in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .<TargetSentence>Unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done .</TargetSentence></operate.v.27><operate.v.28>The Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance .<TargetSentence>It operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution .</TargetSentence>It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .</operate.v.28><operate.v.29>By `` image '' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith .<TargetSentence>This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .</TargetSentence>Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .</operate.v.29><operate.v.30>Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder .<TargetSentence>Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .</TargetSentence>He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so -LRB- frequently he does not receive a fee at all -RRB- , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .</operate.v.30><operate.v.31>But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .<TargetSentence>Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .</TargetSentence>It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .</operate.v.31><operate.v.32>The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy .<TargetSentence>But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization -LRB- so cumbersome it can not constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo -RRB- , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .</TargetSentence>So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival .</operate.v.32><operate.v.33>The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .<TargetSentence>Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .</TargetSentence>Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e.g. constructing major airports or dams .</operate.v.33><operate.v.34>The number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum .<TargetSentence>The Axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .</TargetSentence>This characterizes Euclid 's formulation of geometry , but not Ptolemy 's astronomy .</operate.v.34><operate.v.35>It was going to take a lot of activity
