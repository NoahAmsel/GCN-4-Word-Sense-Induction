<pour.v.test><pour.v.1>Seems to me that one of the goals of this visit is to help , maybe to advance the interest of Russian companies in this island and maybe to restore the economical relationship between the Russian Federation and Cuba .<TargetSentence>During Soviet times , Moscow poured in cash to subsidize the Cuban economy .</TargetSentence>The Soviet Union provided Cuba with oil , petroleum products , foodstuffs and heavy machinery .</pour.v.1><pour.v.2>Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state .<TargetSentence>Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor .</TargetSentence>She goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding .</pour.v.2><pour.v.3>A Michigan soldier wrote his brother : `` I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same '' .<TargetSentence>The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .</TargetSentence>Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .</pour.v.3><pour.v.4>The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .<TargetSentence>They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .</TargetSentence>Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .</pour.v.4><pour.v.5>He went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire .<TargetSentence>Enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .</TargetSentence>They found it at the junction between Troops H and G , and prepared to counterattack .</pour.v.5><pour.v.6>One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool ; ; this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .<TargetSentence>My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds ; ; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine .</TargetSentence>He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated ; ; there is scarcely a scar showing .</pour.v.6><pour.v.7>Until quite recently , `` sterile '' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ; ; they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated .<TargetSentence>Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .</TargetSentence>One family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .</pour.v.7><pour.v.8>Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .<TargetSentence>It may be a bit cold when poured ; ; but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full .</TargetSentence>In this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal -LRB- or the course -RRB- , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .</pour.v.8><pour.v.9>Frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .<TargetSentence>But is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ? ?</TargetSentence>What of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? ?</pour.v.9><pour.v.10>Geneva , instead of becoming the City of God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished .<TargetSentence>Refugees poured in , signing the Confession and rules in order to remain , and then disregarding them .</TargetSentence>Dice rolled , prostitutes plied their trade , thieves stole , murderers stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed .</pour.v.10><pour.v.11>One , more horrible than the rest , lunged , growling deep in his throat , his hair bristling .<TargetSentence>With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run , sweat pouring down his face .</TargetSentence></pour.v.11><pour.v.12>Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe .<TargetSentence>By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front .</TargetSentence>At a siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days .</pour.v.12><pour.v.13>As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland .<TargetSentence>In and in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger .</TargetSentence>What was happening in Majdanek ? ?</pour.v.13><pour.v.14>She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom .<TargetSentence>Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color .</TargetSentence>He drank slowly with due appreciation .</pour.v.14><pour.v.15>`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor .<TargetSentence>`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey .</TargetSentence>`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their stockings .</pour.v.15><pour.v.16>He did n't figure her at all , and if he found out a woman it 'd be bad .<TargetSentence>Hans poured some in a tumbler .</TargetSentence>`` You going to put more towels on him '' ? ?</pour.v.16><pour.v.17>`` What are we going to do with these '' ? ?<TargetSentence>Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .</TargetSentence>`` Here , help me prop him up .</pour.v.17><pour.v.18>`` It 's -- cold '' .<TargetSentence>Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat .</TargetSentence>`` I do n't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly .</pour.v.18><pour.v.19>But of course the paterollers wo n't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around , God knows where '' .<TargetSentence>She had swished away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , pour out the coffee , so no one would drink it .</TargetSentence>But then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but undrinkable -- especially that cup ! !</pour.v.19><pour.v.20>He stood up , stretched , looked around for the bubbles , but could see none .<TargetSentence>Strolling down to the galley , he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated , poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom .</TargetSentence>Turning on the hi-fi , he went back to the cockpit , stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music .</pour.v.20><pour.v.21>He muttered something about how terrible it was , and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator .<TargetSentence>Once inside his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair .</TargetSentence>After a while he began to feel better about it , especially when no one bothered to ask any questions .</pour.v.21><pour.v.22>Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him .<TargetSentence>The sail , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars .</TargetSentence>He would never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast .</pour.v.22><pour.v.23>The girl dropped off to sleep .<TargetSentence>Morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove .</TargetSentence>He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy .</pour.v.23><pour.v.24>He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there .<TargetSentence>These poured through the gate and joined the flight .</TargetSentence>The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges .</pour.v.24><pour.v.25>It was a relief when they finally came .<TargetSentence>They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry .</TargetSentence>`` Oso '' , Montero called `` I 'll get Gray Eyes '' .</pour.v.25><pour.v.26>If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation .<TargetSentence>She would return this symbol to the mountain , as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice .</TargetSentence>Slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house .</pour.v.26><pour.v.27>Along with this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension .<TargetSentence>It poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated .</TargetSentence>Joyce had seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion .</pour.v.27><pour.v.28>I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .<TargetSentence>As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .</TargetSentence>Hot water .</pour.v.28><pour.v.29>He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee .<TargetSentence>He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort .</TargetSentence>Their jams and jellies had not suffered .</pour.v.29><pour.v.30>There lay Grand Fair 's Quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .<TargetSentence>He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd made so often .</TargetSentence>`` To absent loved ones '' .</pour.v.30><pour.v.31>He held his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey .<TargetSentence>They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan .</TargetSentence>`` Can you think of anything to do '' ? ? She kept repeating .</pour.v.31><pour.v.32>`` And the water would be still colder '' , Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it .<TargetSentence>`` And your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath .</TargetSentence>It would kill one of us '' .</pour.v.32><pour.v.33>[David_Shuster] Schmidt a state lawmaker who believes schools should display the ten commandments urged voters to punish Hackett for his criticism of the president /.<TargetSentence>[David_Shuster] And the national ~GOP poured in half a million dollars in anti-Hackett television ads /.</TargetSentence>[Jean_Schmidt] He supports raising social security taxes /.</pour.v.33><pour.v.34>By contrast , KKR probably has already made all the money it can on SCI TV .<TargetSentence>And people who know Mr. Kravis say he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into SCI TV .</TargetSentence></pour.v.34><pour.v.35>`` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body .

Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime .<TargetSentence>Since the troop withdrawal , Moscow has poured in an additional $ 200 to $ 300 million worth per month -- nearly $ 2 billion since February , equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years .</TargetSentence>This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called `` new peaceful long-range weapons , '' including more than 800 SCUD missiles .</pour.v.36><pour.v.37>`` What do we want casinos for when we have n't got anything in the shops ?
