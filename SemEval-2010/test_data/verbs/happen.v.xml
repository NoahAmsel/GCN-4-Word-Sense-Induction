<happen.v.test><happen.v.1>Celebration will also be commemoration .<TargetSentence>In Yemen today , where the ship was attacked , the deliberate , well - organized familiar effort to find out who did it , and how it happened .</TargetSentence>ABC 's Morton Dean is in Aden .</happen.v.1><happen.v.2>Thanks very much .<TargetSentence>It often happens in a case like this , as time goes on , the assessment changes .</TargetSentence>Today , the bodies of the last four sailors recovered from the `` Cole '' were sent home to the United States .</happen.v.2><happen.v.3>Israelis who had been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones .<TargetSentence>This was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely .</TargetSentence>Tonight on Israeli television , Prime Minister Barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n't stop , Barak 's spokesman said Israel will continue to use live ammunition .</happen.v.3><happen.v.4>This was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely .<TargetSentence>Tonight on Israeli television , Prime Minister Barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n't stop , Barak 's spokesman said Israel will continue to use live ammunition .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.4><happen.v.5> <TargetSentence>Back where he 's run and won 14 times in 24 years , but where this week he 's dead even or maybe even trailing Governor Bush , who is n't in trouble at home , and who just happened to be in Tennessee this week , too , asking his favorite sarcastic question -- `` where exactly is home for the Vice President ? ''</TargetSentence> </happen.v.5><happen.v.6>The incident took place in an area which is under their control , under their security , jurisdiction , and they have to blame themselves .<TargetSentence>But after tonight 's attack , Israel 's Prime Minister said none of this would have happened if Yasser Arafat had not let known terrorists out of jail .</TargetSentence>We find no way than to respond like any other free world democracy .</happen.v.6><happen.v.7>The new President has to get a State of the Union Message ready and prepare his first budget .<TargetSentence>All of that has to happen right away .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.7><happen.v.8>It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .<TargetSentence>What happens if the court rules in favor of Bush ?</TargetSentence> </happen.v.8><happen.v.9>We 're actually on time today .<TargetSentence>A rare thing that happens here .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.9><happen.v.10>All the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats .<TargetSentence>So what happened to the FBI warning ?</TargetSentence>CIA officials say they never received it .</happen.v.10><happen.v.11> <TargetSentence>She says it happens all the time and that she loses money because they do n't have enough coins to make change .</TargetSentence>The Ecuadorian government has minted coins that resemble US coins in an effort to provide more small change for merchants , but it has taken some time to reach all areas , in small rural communities in the countryside , because not enough dollars have made it into circulation there , but the government and President Gustavo Nobora considers these to be short-term problems and views the overall policy as a grand success .</happen.v.11><happen.v.12>She says inflation is now on the decline and bank deposits are increasing .<TargetSentence>The transition to dollars was eased somewhat by a sharp increase in oil prices in the past year , which allowed oil - producing Ecuador to buy plenty of dollars on the international market , but Maria Delapasvela says now is the time to start thinking about what happens when the situation changes .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.12><happen.v.13> <TargetSentence>She asks what will happen when oil prices go back down and the country can no longer bring in sufficient dollars to sustain its economy .</TargetSentence>The Ecuadorian economist says now is the time for the government to implement fiscal reforms and to stimulate competitiveness and diversification in the economy .</happen.v.13><happen.v.14><TargetSentence>Let 's go to Russia right now Joe , where Vladimir Putin who still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the Russian political scene since he took office at the beginning of the year 2000 , is apparently under siege yet again by revelations that the Russians might possibly have been able to rescue those trapped sailors in the Kursk submarine because some of them evidently survived and it 's apparent that the Russian military suppressed information about what had happened or even distorted it , and was singularly slow in taking up offers of assistance from the Norwegians and the British to help .</TargetSentence>What impact do you think this new revelation has on Putin 's political stature ?</happen.v.14><happen.v.15>Oh , I think it is another step in a diminution of Putin .<TargetSentence>I think a number of things have happened ;</TargetSentence>His attempt to restore the image of Russia as a great power has been , I think backfired generally .</happen.v.15><happen.v.16>Both sides reported many injured .<TargetSentence>Against that bloody backdrop , there were diplomatic efforts to call a ceasefire , but after a Washington meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said what 's happening is not a civilian uprising as the Palestinians claim , but a military confrontation , a mini war , as he put it .</TargetSentence>Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat is expected to meet separately with Mrs. Albright and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , later this week .</happen.v.16><happen.v.17>Mr. Ben-Ami said the next step might be separate Washington visits by Israeli and Palestinian leaders .<TargetSentence>US officials say a three - way summit would happen only if an agreement was in hand .</TargetSentence>David Gallust , VOA News , the White House .</happen.v.17><happen.v.18>Israel 's military commander for the Gaza region Yayir Nave blamed the Palestinian Authority for not cracking down on such attacks .<TargetSentence>Incidents like this , he says , do not happen without support from inside the Palestinian Authority .</TargetSentence>Israel has repeatedly called on the Palestinian Authority to curb the violence and take action against those who attack Israelis .</happen.v.18><happen.v.19>He says the cause of the Kursk tragedy is known to those in charge .<TargetSentence>Our Navy commanders they know pretty well and all that 's going on now points that these people want to hide the real thing that had had happened onboard of Kursk .</TargetSentence>But what did cause the Kursk tragedy ?</happen.v.19><happen.v.20> <TargetSentence>We can not accept what happened today .</TargetSentence>We can not accept it under any circumstances .</happen.v.20><happen.v.21>On Yemeni TV today the country 's President expressed his heart - felt condolences to those who were killed and injured , but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists , although , admits Mohammed Al-Qadhi , editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in the capital Sana , anti-American sentiment has been running high in Yemen because of events in the Middle East .<TargetSentence>The people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as Arabs , as human beings , that what is happening in Palestine is not humanitarian .</TargetSentence>Regarding the United States ' attitude in this regard , we find that the United States until now are supporting Israel .</happen.v.21><happen.v.22>He has invested an awful amount in the peace with Israel , and really he can not afford to let it fail .<TargetSentence>We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister Amre Moussa over the last few weeks , but Amre Moussa today at the Foreign Minister 's meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians , in stark contrast to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab states that happen .</TargetSentence>So Egypt is playing a calming role .</happen.v.22><happen.v.23> <TargetSentence>So what happened here , can you tell me ?</TargetSentence> </happen.v.23><happen.v.24>But the storm has cleared today and from this morning the divers have been down at the bottom of the Barents Sea , working on cutting out this hole in the inner hull of the Kursk .<TargetSentence>What happens once they do finish ?</TargetSentence>Do they actually enter the submarine ?</happen.v.24><happen.v.25>I think everybody want to stay in his country , want to die in his country .<TargetSentence>If you can stay and make it happen , the place where you was born , where you grew up then try to make it there .</TargetSentence>It 's possible .</happen.v.25><happen.v.26> <TargetSentence>You know , in Africa every time you know something bad happens , everybody like you know is because of the white man , you know the colonization , the slavery .</TargetSentence>They do n't realize that you know the real execution is really black 's black like them .</happen.v.26><happen.v.27>They do n't realize that you know the real execution is really black 's black like them .<TargetSentence>So before they say it is a white man tangle you know it 's because of a white man that this happens and they got to , you know , check around and they say who is the real guilty .</TargetSentence>We got to accept it and try to , you know , change the things , make the things better .</happen.v.27><happen.v.28>Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option .<TargetSentence>You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.28><happen.v.29>The biggest democracy in the world and it 's all falling apart .<TargetSentence>And I say it is because we are a democracy that it 's happening this way .</TargetSentence>It 's because everybody gets the vote .</happen.v.29><happen.v.30>As you start moving down this path towards technical innovation , it invites disruption or it brings about the conflict much quicker than I think most people would be prepared to start dealing with it .<TargetSentence>I think there is a lot of issues that Japan is starting to question , how do they adapt , how do they change , how do they preserve what is good about their society while making these changes to be more competitive with what 's happening throughout the rest of the world .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.30><happen.v.31>And one of the other main subjects he touched on today , Lisa , was the conflicted southern state of Chiapas .<TargetSentence>Fox says that his first presidential act will be to send up a proposal to the congress to immediately begin to bring a process of peace back into Chiapas State and that 's something that people really did n't expect to happen so quickly here .</TargetSentence>All of these issues actually are issues that the United States has been watching very carefully , and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is there in mexico city for the inaugural .</happen.v.31><happen.v.32>Is that correct ?<TargetSentence>Yes , it has all happened actually very , very quickly .</TargetSentence>After the court cases dragged on for a couple of months and Pope has been in jail since April the 3rd , the ball really started rolling today .</happen.v.32><happen.v.33>If this strikes you as an extraordinary turn of events , well it strikes many overseas as nearly unbelievable .<TargetSentence>In the democracies of Europe , legal experts are saying it ca n't happen here .</TargetSentence>Philippe Shatiney is an editor of the French news weekly , Mahiyan .</happen.v.33><happen.v.34>Philippe Shatiney is an editor of the French news weekly , Mahiyan .<TargetSentence>Philippe , could it happen anywhere else .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.34><happen.v.35> <TargetSentence>I wonder in terms of this particular case , now this is certainly an extreme case in the United States with an unfathomably close election , How have other democracies dealt with effective ties , I mean could there for instance be one of elections , you know where our type has gone to the courts , What happens to yours ?</TargetSentence> </happen.v.35><happen.v.36> <TargetSentence>Barak 's standing in the polls is so bad that the only thing that can save his political career now is a peace deal , which is the only reason to be optimistic that something might actually happen .</TargetSentence>It 's that personal self motivation of Barak 's desire to survive politically and to have some kind of future in this country knowing that if he goes to elections with a peace agreement , any kind of peace agreement , he stands much better chance of being elected than going to the electorate with nothing .</happen.v.36><happen.v.37>They are just glad to see the back of him .<TargetSentence>I am not interested about Slobodan Milosevic any more and I do n't really want to know what will happen to him .</TargetSentence>We must go on .</happen.v.37><happen.v.38><TargetSentence>Not a whole lot happens in Dornoch , but tomorrow the small Scottish town will be the center of the universe .</TargetSentence>At least that 's the conclusion you might reach from seeing the hundreds of journalists and photographers camped out there .</happen.v.38><happen.v.39>That 's an interesting little anecdote , is n't it ?<TargetSentence>Well , when this sort of thing happens in a small community and I guess that 's a under statement in this case , whether or not it all succeeds depends on how well some of the local people can keep secrets .</TargetSentence>Are people kind of , you know , in the fold on this , or are there things being leaked around to press here and there ?</happen.v.39><happen.v.40>The World 's Richard Myron is in Tel Aviv now .<TargetSentence>Richard , describe what 's been happening today .</TargetSentence>Well , we have had unfortunately what we term a busy day here today , including a suicide bombing in a Jewish settlement in the northern part of the West Bank .</happen.v.40><happen.v.41>Well , we have had unfortunately what we term a busy day here today , including a suicide bombing in a Jewish settlement in the northern part of the West Bank .<TargetSentence>What apparently happened was that a Palestinian went in to a roadside restaurant and he blew himself up critically injuring a number of people .</TargetSentence>Elsewhere , in the West Bank and Gaza there have been deaths of Palestinians .</happen.v.41><happen.v.42>Elsewhere , a number of other Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli forces .<TargetSentence>So it has been an unfortunately , as I say , busy and bloody day here , and this was happening on the last Friday in Ramadan , which is a very important day for Muslim prayer .</TargetSentence>Was there any trouble today around the holy sites in Jerusalem ?</happen.v.42><happen.v.43>So it has limited the numbers inside , and therefore the amount of trouble , but there was some scuffle and it was expected in a way that there would be certainly tension and a little bit of trouble there today .<TargetSentence>Of course , all of this is happening against the backdrop of peace talks in Washington , which are in their fourth day today .</TargetSentence>What about people on the ground there where you are ?</happen.v.43><happen.v.44>Are they hopeful something might come out of this ?<TargetSentence>Are they even paying heed to what is happening in Washington ?</TargetSentence>I think people are paying heed because I think people realize that there is a sense that it could happen .</happen.v.44><happen.v.45>Are they even paying heed to what is happening in Washington ?<TargetSentence>I think people are paying heed because I think people realize that there is a sense that it could happen .</TargetSentence>There is a great sense of urgency here .</happen.v.45><happen.v.46>They do n't trust the other side .<TargetSentence>I think they may want the deal to happen , but they do n't trust the intentions of the other side .</TargetSentence>The Palestinians for their part , I think , are deeply pessimistic .</happen.v.46><happen.v.47>I later realized that I was down .<TargetSentence>I could n't remember what happened thereafter and I found myself in the hospital .</TargetSentence>Beatrice Ketch was 23 when the bomb ripped out the windows of the office where she worked opposite the embassy .</happen.v.47><happen.v.48>Barak 's Foreign Minister Sloma Ben-Ami was in Paris today in an effort to drum up support for a peace deal and increase the left wing leader 's chances in the election .<TargetSentence>Before rushing back for fresh talks with Palestinian negotiators this evening , Ben-Ami acknowledged that an agreement probably would n't happen before the end of President Clinton 's term later this month and Sharon supporters are castigating Barak for bringing chaos in place of the peace deal he promised .</TargetSentence>A campaign message for Sharon says , `` Disappointed with Barak , Barak promised , Barak disappointed , Barak must be replaced '' .</happen.v.48><happen.v.49>In that moment I felt like it was right up to me to die .<TargetSentence>I know what 's happening now , but that time I did n't know .</TargetSentence>I had nine nights , nine days , not eating nor sleeping .</happen.v.49><happen.v.50>It gives them a sense of what they have felt for too long now , that politics is just name - callers , increased partisanship , special prosecutors , reliance on lawyers and things that do n't affect the ordinary person , that all that has now mushroomed into something called the Presidency of the United States and how we elect a President .<TargetSentence>The fact that as we continue on this road and continue to talk about what 's going to happen in Florida , the judges have really already spoken on this , the ultimate judges , the people .</TargetSentence>Their decision is now being reviewed .</happen.v.50><happen.v.51>Israel is usually looking up to the President of the United States for some help .<TargetSentence>Some Israelis at least , if not most of them , are still hoping that President Clinton might be able to intervene and help in the short time he has left , but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in the States , I think more and more Israelis are worried that there 's nobody to turn toment -- to , and I think what happened in the past few days among Israelis here is a new perception that maybe things in the United States are not as perfect as they might have thought .</TargetSentence>Actually , they 're far from being perfect , and they are sounding and looking to us here more and more like what we know from our own political system .</happen.v.51><happen.v.52>Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true .<TargetSentence>They have been counted on election night -- they 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not -- not the case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.52><happen.v.53> <TargetSentence>Well , I think the number one most important sign is looking at what happened last night , and that is last night at about 7:00 , the public information officer of the court came to us and said we 're going home .</TargetSentence>We are told , in effect , there wo n't be a ruling tonight .</happen.v.53><happen.v.54>We are told , in effect , there wo n't be a ruling tonight .<TargetSentence>That has n't happened tonight .</TargetSentence>Now , you know the time is ticking away and yet they are still here .</happen.v.54><happen.v.55>It 's violence .<TargetSentence>It should n't have happened .</TargetSentence>That 's not democracy .</happen.v.55><happen.v.56>A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to Belgrade for a special session .<TargetSentence>Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to Belgrade from Montenegro .</TargetSentence>What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in Vojislav Kostunica as the next President of Yugoslavia .</happen.v.56><happen.v.57>There are some votes that apparently were counted wrong .<TargetSentence>Anyway , it 's unclear exactly what 's happening , but they are contesting some seats .</TargetSentence>In that case if the two chamber can not agree and meet here , Kostunica until then will not be able to take his hold .</happen.v.57><happen.v.58>We can work together , in spite of our political differences , here in this federal parliament .<TargetSentence>I think the consequences of what has happened will be obvious after a while , but we are a little bit surprised right now , and even now I sometimes think it looks like a dream , but it is a reality , and it is good .</TargetSentence>Thursday , tens of thousands of people stormed parliament , demanding former President Slobodan Milosevic admit defeat in September 's presidential election and leave office .</happen.v.58><happen.v.59>Throughout the afternoon , the security forces have been firing rubber - coated steel bullets , they 've been using concussion grenades and they 've been firing tear gas into the Palestinian crowd , which has been responding with stones and on occasion , fire bombs .<TargetSentence>What happened on this particular day , a funeral was held for a man who was allegedly beaten to death by Jewish settlers .</TargetSentence>The Palestinians attended this funeral here in Ramallah and came down to this particular point where there was another confrontation with security forces , one that has occurred numerous times over the past 13 days .</happen.v.59><happen.v.60>The U.S. Navy is revising the timeline of last week 's attack on the `` USS Cole . ''<TargetSentence>It says the explosion happened more than two hours after the ship was tied to a fuel dock , not during the mooring operation , as previously thought .</TargetSentence>Some wonder then , how the terrorists ' boat could have escaped notice , since there should have been no other boats near the `` Cole . ''</happen.v.60><happen.v.61>Putting a little boy through such agony reduces his doctor to tears .<TargetSentence>Mercifully today this will be the last time it will happen to Ali .</TargetSentence>Tonight this little boy who has lost so much and been so brave is finally going to --</happen.v.61><happen.v.62>Police in Pennsylvania say a student fatally shot a principal before killing himself this morning .<TargetSentence>It happened in the cafeteria of Red Lion Area Junior High School about 30 miles southeast of Harrisburg .</TargetSentence>It happened at 7:30 this morning .</happen.v.62><happen.v.63>It happened in the cafeteria of Red Lion Area Junior High School about 30 miles southeast of Harrisburg .<TargetSentence>It happened at 7:30 this morning

the pups grow older and are able to open their eyes .</TargetSentence>Chances are , they 'll always have a fondness from one hen .</happen.v.64><happen.v.65> <TargetSentence>No one seems to be sure what 's happened to Saddam Hussein and his two sons , but one thing is becoming more clear -- Uday and Qusay were just as bad as their father if not worse .</TargetSentence>`` Time '' Magazine 's Michael Weisskopf has uncovered some stunning details about the lives of these two .</happen.v.65><happen.v.66> <TargetSentence>I hope this kind of thing can happen in America , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like Bonnaroo , it really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do in Europe .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.66><happen.v.67> <TargetSentence>I hope

</happen.v.82><happen.v.83>Hello , Judy .<TargetSentence>During a brief phone call with their son from Kuwait on surngd the Army asked the Young family not to get into any specific details about what happened during their son 's capture and release .</TargetSentence>However , the family did get in a company of questions about how he was treated .</happen.v.83><happen.v.84>Now they are learning more details that their son in fact was kicked and beaten after his capture , and that his fellow pilot David Williams had a knife held to his throat immediately after an tur , according to an interview their son was allowed to conduct with `` The Washington Post '' , who flew with him into Kuwait .<TargetSentence>Their son is said to be in very good spirits now and back here in Georgia , after three weeks of not knowing exactly what had happened to him , finally , for the very first time in three weeks , the Young family members got some sleep last night for the first time in a long

again that they had found him and he was alive and all I could say was Thank God , and from there you all know pretty much what happened .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.90><happen.v.91>Let 's move on to another important story .<TargetSentence>It 's happened , of course , several times during the war in Iraq , journalists caught in the line of fire and killed .</TargetSentence>Israeli troops are facing a similar situation with two journalists killed in just the past two weeks .</happen.v.91><happen.v.92>James was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting .<TargetSentence>So , again , to know exactly what happened we need a full-fledged inquiry .</TargetSentence> </happen.v.92><happen.v.93>She 's accused of beating two of her three children to death because , she says , God told

to watch the Mideast peace process between Palestinians and Israelis develop .<TargetSentence>We are seeing that Secretary of State Colin Powell also traveling through the region , trying to get

our lives believing such a visit would never happen , and that I hoped he was as delighted as I was to be proved wrong .</TargetSentence>I 'm just as delighted now , nine years later , to be able to welcome you here and to learn about the great changes which have occurred in your country since I was there .</happen.v.122><happen.v.123>And in this case , there are a lot of unanswered questions still .<TargetSentence>For example , what will happen to the baby , and what will happen to JDS ?</TargetSentence>Of course , according to the guardian , she 's very worried about that , too , and she

parliament , Vojislav Kostunica took his oath of office late tonight as President of Yugoslavia , marking the end of 13 years of autocratic rule under Slobodan Milosevic .<TargetSentence>It was a scene few Serbs would have deemed possible only weeks ago , but it almost did n't happen , delayed by Milosevic 's party , which still controls the parliament .</TargetSentence>After meetings earlier

particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! !<TargetSentence>This experience will have happened to many of you .</TargetSentence>Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they

first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman .<TargetSentence>Too many new things are happening for it to be a

she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris .<TargetSentence>No one ever learned what happened to the Greek .</TargetSentence>The luxury of Paris ' most fashionable hotel , the George 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to Rome .</happen.v.135><happen.v.136>McClellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died .<TargetSentence>He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time .</TargetSentence>When he realized

his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent .<TargetSentence>But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .</TargetSentence>If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?</happen.v.138><happen.v.139>Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .<TargetSentence>Consider what happened during World War 1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law

struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? ?<TargetSentence>What happened to the fourteen missing men ? ?</TargetSentence>These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .</happen.v.140><happen.v.141>On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells .<TargetSentence>Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .</TargetSentence>The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .</happen.v.141><happen.v.142>The final proof was a small incident .<TargetSentence>It happened at the St. Patrick 's Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march .</TargetSentence>In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .</happen.v.142><happen.v.143>They found it at the junction between Troops H and G , and prepared to counterattack .<TargetSentence>Marvin Goulding saw what was happening .</TargetSentence>He turned to his platoon .</happen.v.143><happen.v.144>But Judge Marvin Jones , senior member of the Court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk to work .<TargetSentence>More importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House .</TargetSentence>There were aesthetic problems as well as political .</happen.v.144><happen.v.145>They include the Navy 's Atlantic Command at Norfolk , Virginia , which is in contact with the Polaris subs ; ; NATO headquarters in Europe ; ; Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; ; and SAC , which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles .<TargetSentence>Let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- SAC at Omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their A[fj] .</TargetSentence>In a word , plenty .</happen.v.145><happen.v.146>In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator '' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .<TargetSentence>I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .</TargetSentence>`` I 'd wind up full of bullet holes '' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .</happen.v.146><happen.v.147>Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men .<TargetSentence>Only there happened -- nothing .</TargetSentence>There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not .</happen.v.147><happen.v.148>It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .<TargetSentence>That , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge .</TargetSentence>Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .</happen.v.148><happen.v.149>At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; ; nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella .<TargetSentence>A man and a girl happen to meet ; ; they look straight at the audience , not at each other .</TargetSentence>He lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .</happen.v.149><happen.v.150>A man and a girl happen to meet

.</TargetSentence>If one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon .</happen.v.150><happen.v.151>There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .<TargetSentence>Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God '' .</TargetSentence>Perhaps things were even worse then .</happen.v.151><happen.v.152>They include both individual fears and collective ones .<TargetSentence>They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .</TargetSentence>Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .</happen.v.152><happen.v.153>America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development .<TargetSentence>Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .</TargetSentence></happen.v.153><happen.v.154>But I think that something more than this is involved .<TargetSentence>How did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country ? ?</TargetSentence>Is n't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England -LRB- Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island -RRB- have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A &amp; M colleges ? ?</happen.v.154><happen.v.155>Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect .<TargetSentence>In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend .</TargetSentence>What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .</happen.v.155><happen.v.156>I want to say more about Gabriel 's so-called fundamental law .<TargetSentence>But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it .</TargetSentence>He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America .</happen.v.156><happen.v.157>But in every period it has been humanism '' . And let me add , utopianism , also .<TargetSentence>Some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader Follows -- Where ? ? I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call Progressivism .</TargetSentence>It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .</happen.v.157><happen.v.158>The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier .<TargetSentence>What had happened to the common man ? ?</TargetSentence>French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of Popularism .</happen.v.158><happen.v.159>All of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you .<TargetSentence>But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower 's leadership .</TargetSentence>A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .</happen.v.159><happen.v.160>Thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' .<TargetSentence>This happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in Maritain 's words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities '' .</TargetSentence>An existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse '' , as existence without substance .</happen.v.160><happen.v.161>Unanalyzed responses anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition .<TargetSentence>To experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it .</TargetSentence>The process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs .</happen.v.161><happen.v.162>And , he added : `` During the many months in prison camp , all abstract images vanished from my mind '' .<TargetSentence>Before leaving for America , he happened to see his old friend Jean Arp and confided to him his new resolutions .</TargetSentence>Arp protested : `` But it is impossible ! !</happen.v.162><happen.v.163>There would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course ; ; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists ; ; but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article .<TargetSentence>All we want from Dr. Huxley 's statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible .</TargetSentence>It seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many .</happen.v.163><happen.v.164>The new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford 's work , is wholly free of this anxiety .<TargetSentence>The problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves '' .</TargetSentence>The Introduction continues : `` We experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them .</happen.v.164><happen.v.165>Of one thing we can be sure : they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society '' .<TargetSentence>No doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century .</TargetSentence>Going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , in Santa Barbara .</happen.v.165><happen.v.166>It must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval .<TargetSentence>Even so , many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe .</TargetSentence>Their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty : Miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for .</happen.v.166><happen.v.167>She read everything else she could get her hands on , including an article -LRB- she thinks it was in the Atlantic Monthly -RRB- by Mark Twain on `` White Slavery '' .<TargetSentence>Paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in Chapel .</TargetSentence>She had come to a decision .</happen.v.167><happen.v.168>His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open .<TargetSentence>When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder .</TargetSentence>He had not mentioned Kate .</happen.v.168><happen.v.169>He was n't troubled with the ordinary , rank-and-file fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers and whole companies under fire running in panic .<TargetSentence>It just did n't occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him .</TargetSentence>Do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was '' ? ?</happen.v.169><happen.v.170>This is why I say we just ca n't go ahead and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses .<TargetSentence>Let me tell you what happened to me today .</TargetSentence>A fellow came up to me , a Senator , I do n't have to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the President like a brother , but God damn it , he 's crucifying me .</happen.v.170><happen.v.171>Her action was involuntary .<TargetSentence>When something unexpected happened , one always asked for water if one were a woman , brandy if one were a man .</TargetSentence>Mrs. Lincoln screamed again .</happen.v.171><happen.v.172>To speak of Papa dying was a sin .<TargetSentence>It could never happen as long as God was alert and the Drew steeple stood guard with its peaked lance .</TargetSentence>Stevie was constantly slipping into the church .</happen.v.172><happen.v.173>He must not fail to hear it .<TargetSentence>He was Papa 's chosen ; ; therefore , nothing but good could happen to him , even in God 's wrathful storms .</TargetSentence>When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley , he was unafraid .</happen.v.173><happen.v.174>Normal , by God .<TargetSentence>Maybe it 's a good thing it happened .</TargetSentence>Maybe they 'll stop it now , once for all .</happen.v.174><happen.v.175>The music drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments , humming and jiving within , beating the rhythm within .<TargetSentence>He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them .</TargetSentence>Turn the bastards over to me -- to me and my boys -- no nigger ever got what would be comin to them -- reactionary bastards .</happen.v.175><happen.v.176>And he took heart ; ; the final word came forth .<TargetSentence>Now he heard it , fully ; ; `` bout takin his place '' He listened , waited , nothing happened .</TargetSentence>He felt good .</happen.v.176><happen.v.177>Half crazed by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , dashing out the rider 's brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us -- while the horse crashed away through the brush .<TargetSentence>It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become .</TargetSentence>And now the redcoats were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us .</happen.v.177><happen.v.178>And now the redcoats were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us .<TargetSentence>I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; ; the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened

.</happen.v.386><happen.v.387>[Wang_shilin] Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?<TargetSentence>[Zhou_hanhua] Ah , at 11:00 a.m. , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside .</TargetSentence>[Wang_shilin] Uh-huh .</happen.v.387><happen.v.388>[Wang_shilin] Uh-huh .<TargetSentence>[Zhou_hanhua] It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon .</TargetSentence>[Zhou_hanhua] And then , the friend first sent me an SMS , [Wang_shilin] Uh-huh . [Zhou_hanhua] saying he would come pick me up to go together .</happen.v.388><happen.v.389>[Wang_shilin] And you , Yang Yang ?<TargetSentence>[Yang_yang] A friend happened to call me

.</happen.v.391><happen.v.392>[Yang_yang] Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .<TargetSentence>[Wang_shilin]

also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .</TargetSentence>[Yang_yang] Many of their friends -- Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many

Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave-in at

.</happen.v.394><happen.v.395>[Yang_yang] Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .<TargetSentence>[Yang_yang] Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way

/.</happen.v.428><happen.v.429>[Chris_Matthews] And he 's with most people on the social issues /.<TargetSentence>[speaker1] Well I happen to think that the way Karl Rove and George Bush are trying to

/.<TargetSentence>[Alex_Thier] And Afghanistan really represents something that 's happening in the broader Islamic world which is a tension between democratic values on one hand and Islamic values on

religious rights within the limits of the provisions of law /.</happen.v.435><happen.v.436>[Dan_Abrams] Well let me ask you about /-<TargetSentence>[Dan_Abrams] I mean since you were involved in helping them create their constitution and their law   wh-   when you were helping them do that did you foresee something like this maybe happening /?</TargetSentence>[Alex_Thier] We absolutely did /.</happen.v.436><happen.v.437>[Alex_Thier] You 're right Dan /.<TargetSentence>[Alex_Thier] it 's a travesty um that something like this could happen anywhere in the world /.</TargetSentence>[Alex_Thier] And I think that it really contains a very important lesson for us in that we really need to pay close attention not to just broad questions like elections but specifically the law in countries like this /.</happen.v.437><happen.v.438>[Dan_Abrams] I mean is the President going to be able to work on this diplomatically as he says and with the people that they have contacts with and resolve this /?<TargetSentence>[Dan_Abrams] I mean it sounds like what 's going to happen is the government 's going to declare this guy mentally ill /.</TargetSentence>[Alex_Thier] Well I think that the government   is   is really looking for a way out of this /.</happen.v.438><happen.v.439>[David_Gregory] Everybody up there in New York

with others up there perhaps he changes some minds /.<TargetSentence>[David_Gregory] Maybe   that 's --   uh that 's not going to happen /.</TargetSentence>[David_Gregory] but the bottom line   this   is that this is not an administration that thinks very highly of the United Nations /.</happen.v.440><happen.v.441>[Norm_Coleman]   It was --   it was a meeting in which they 're talking about one

do n't think so /.<TargetSentence>[Norm_Coleman] It 's not going to happen /.</TargetSentence>[Norm_Coleman] And the bottom line is that a lot of folks would say the ~UN has not been as effective as it should be /.</happen.v.442><happen.v.443>[Norm_Coleman] That 's why the president is going to be speaking there /.<TargetSentence>[Norm_Coleman] And he has got a guy by his side who can help make

out with a unit as   an embedded --   uh basically part of the unit an embedded reporter /.</TargetSentence>[Chris_Matthews] You never really get to mix with the locals /.</happen.v.450><happen.v.451>[Paul_Rieckhoff] There 's a likelihood that I 'll go back while Ms. Morgan is back at her radio show /.<TargetSentence>[Paul_Rieckhoff] So what I really want to do is educate the public about the truth of what 's happening there /.</TargetSentence>[Paul_Rieckhoff] And I think the reality is that when people like her go over there there 's a public affairs officer standing right next to that young soldier /.</happen.v.451><happen.v.452>[Sherrod_Brown] and we 're seeing exactly the opposite /.<TargetSentence>[Sherrod_Brown] But what happened in southwest Ohio Secretary Blackwell 's right /.</TargetSentence>[Sherrod_Brown]   it 's a --   it 's a wake-up call with a message /.</happen.v.452><happen.v.453>[Ken_Blackwell] Let me just say to you Chris that what I said was that   Ron-   Ronald Reagan and George Bush cut taxes and they started to restrain state government spending /.<TargetSentence>[Ken_Blackwell] What has happened in the state of Ohio is that Bob Taft has increased spending and he has in fact raised taxes /.</TargetSentence>[Ken_Blackwell] And I think that anybody that runs on a tax raising runaway spending platform is going to lose because they 're going to undercut our base /.</happen.v.453><happen.v.454>[Mike_Gowan] and it says the Holy Koran /.<TargetSentence>[Mike_Gowan] So the idea is to show uh lawmakers the better part of

hope they get a president in two thousand nine /.</happen.v.470><happen.v.471>[Tim_Russert] But it 's   going   an ongoing issue as Secretary Rice seemed to indicate as that democracy in Afghanistan
