Pittenger , Hockett , and Danehy in The First Five Minutes , are these : ambiguity of pronouns : Stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .</TargetSentence>On the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean I or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person

Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing-down special ! !</signal.v.12><signal.v.13>It seemed unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the Ariadne , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year .<TargetSentence>And there would be no chance of signaling them -- without the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone .</TargetSentence>Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him .</signal.v.13><signal.v.14>Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls ' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .<TargetSentence>This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .</TargetSentence>The woman

through Congress .<TargetSentence>It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution .</TargetSentence>This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .</signal.v.18><signal.v.19>This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil , which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15 % to 20 % during the

income , type of income , or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions .</TargetSentence>Many professions long have seemed to be
