work ?<TargetSentence>Well , the work that we have so far in English translation suggests that , and indeed this novel , which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual , goes so far as to even divide up to the self .</TargetSentence>Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that you have at a certain point , you have a new he , you have a new she , you have a you , and each one of these characters tells stories , each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in China .</divide.v.3><divide.v.4>Prime Minister Barak 's scheduled meeting with President Mubarak is being seen by some here as a positive indication that a deal may be close between Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams in Washington .<TargetSentence>The negotiators have been weighing out proposals over the most sensitive matters that divide them .</TargetSentence>Mr. Barak may believe that by winning regional support of the deal he can convince the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to agree to the proposals , but even if both sides do agree to compromise on these , the most divisive and thorny issues , they 'll face considerable domestic opposition to a final peace deal .</divide.v.4><divide.v.5> <TargetSentence>I believe actions , to try and put in place a transition , run the risk of dividing the American

other way .</TargetSentence></divide.v.7><divide.v.8>These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .<TargetSentence>It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies .</TargetSentence>It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control

unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North Carolina , and Alabama following along after them .<TargetSentence>Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; ; so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .</TargetSentence>The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .</divide.v.10><divide.v.11>Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .<TargetSentence>Here in these little rooms -- or stages arched

believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .</divide.v.11><divide.v.12>Each performance may be

associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .<TargetSentence>That this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; ; that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner .</TargetSentence>It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .</divide.v.13><divide.v.14>The veterans ,

livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat .</TargetSentence>Without exception Hino 's brothers turned to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller .</divide.v.15><divide.v.16>He quickly closed it
