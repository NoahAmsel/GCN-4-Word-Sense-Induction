or night -RRB- for that purpose .</lie.v.20><lie.v.21>Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .<TargetSentence>Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall -LRB- the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back -RRB- may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .</TargetSentence>But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall -LRB- the bottom of the vagina in the same position -RRB- without any pain ; ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .</lie.v.21><lie.v.22>Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage

Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient .<TargetSentence>`` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes .</TargetSentence>Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .</lie.v.24><lie.v.25>Soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones .<TargetSentence>Small areas that are n't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop .</TargetSentence>The house</lie.v.25><lie.v.26>Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .<TargetSentence>And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .</TargetSentence>Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs .</lie.v.26><lie.v.27>These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .<TargetSentence>It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .</TargetSentence>But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment .</lie.v.27><lie.v.28>What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?<TargetSentence>Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial .</TargetSentence>No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .</lie.v.28><lie.v.29>To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment .<TargetSentence>This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .</TargetSentence>Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil law is concerned with public crimes .</lie.v.29><lie.v.30>The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .<TargetSentence>A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies .</TargetSentence>One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .</lie.v.30><lie.v.31>As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew 's respect for him .<TargetSentence>Once , after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather , Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed .</TargetSentence>Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .</lie.v.31><lie.v.32>Thomas Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North .<TargetSentence>Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson 's Bay Company , he purchased great blocks of the Comany 's stock with the view to controlling its policies .</TargetSentence>Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers .</lie.v.32><lie.v.33>A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself '' .<TargetSentence>Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : `` now I lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o'er my body creep ; ; if they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' .</TargetSentence>Charles Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .</lie.v.33><lie.v.34>It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .<TargetSentence>After all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control .</TargetSentence>Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .</lie.v.34><lie.v.35>But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans .<TargetSentence>To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .</TargetSentence>The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West .</lie.v.35><lie.v.36>Woman 's place is in the home : man must attend to matters of the yard .<TargetSentence>One of the vexatious problems to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House .</TargetSentence>Congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality '' of government office buildings .</lie.v.36><lie.v.37>There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; ; only -- there was not .<TargetSentence>They lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them .</TargetSentence>No one came '' .</lie.v.37><lie.v.38>Its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches .<TargetSentence>It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully .</TargetSentence>It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .</lie.v.38><lie.v.39>Those who actually get there find that it is n't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .<TargetSentence>But even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead .</TargetSentence>Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .</lie.v.39><lie.v.40>The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; ; for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : `` They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad 's blood the crimson tulip stains ; ; Go , tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes , and he was one '' .<TargetSentence>Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : `` Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .</TargetSentence>In this true lover 's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred . ''</lie.v.40><lie.v.41>Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : `` Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .<TargetSentence>In this true lover 's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred . ''</TargetSentence>These songs -LRB- practically all Persian music , for that matter -RRB- are limited to a range of two octaves .</lie.v.41><lie.v.42>He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .<TargetSentence>He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .</TargetSentence></lie.v.42><lie.v.43>Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength -LRB- from compromise and other factors -RRB- that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century .<TargetSentence>Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .</TargetSentence>The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War .</lie.v.43><lie.v.44>These are not , however , differences in federal structure .<TargetSentence>The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles .</TargetSentence>The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .</lie.v.44><lie.v.45>In the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio - and physiological chemistry .<TargetSentence>The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .</TargetSentence>In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .</lie.v.45><lie.v.46>What one actually remembers is its greenness .<TargetSentence>From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible .</TargetSentence>One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .</lie.v.46><lie.v.47>That world was in scale with my own smallness .<TargetSentence>I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that I could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ; ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes ; ; hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it .</TargetSentence>It was mother who planted the verbenas .</lie.v.47><lie.v.48>We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .<TargetSentence>We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .</TargetSentence>The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .</lie.v.48><lie.v.49>There is no more `` plot '' than that ; ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give .<TargetSentence>The artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness .</TargetSentence>The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end ; ; that is to say , to the churchyard '' .</lie.v.49><lie.v.50>In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .<TargetSentence>Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .</TargetSentence>He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The Happy Artists '' .</lie.v.50><lie.v.51>The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President 's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem .<TargetSentence>Because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .</TargetSentence>For the President had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way .</lie.v.51><lie.v.52>The response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing .<TargetSentence>Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .</TargetSentence>To this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers .</lie.v.52><lie.v.53>Only the strong look squarely at weakness .<TargetSentence>The maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood .</TargetSentence>Mr. Lyford continues : `` Even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society .</lie.v.53><lie.v.54>Perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ? ?<TargetSentence>One can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend ; ; one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul .</TargetSentence>But it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum .</lie.v.54><lie.v.55>His hands , which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed .<TargetSentence>They lay on his lap , palms up , stiffly motionless , the tapered fingers a little thick at the joints .</TargetSentence>Altogether he had , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise .</lie.v.55><lie.v.56>He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving .<TargetSentence>His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open .</TargetSentence>When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder .</lie.v.56><lie.v.57>Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line .<TargetSentence>Lying in the grass behind the brush clump , Warren looked about .</TargetSentence>The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush .</lie.v.57><lie.v.58>It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion .<TargetSentence>It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor .</TargetSentence>To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week .</lie.v.58><lie.v.59>He was tingling within .<TargetSentence>Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay .</TargetSentence>It was as if it had been done .</lie.v.59><lie.v.60>So you 're not tryin , Johnson , you bastard you .<TargetSentence>He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of revulsion .</TargetSentence>How he loathed him .</lie.v.60><lie.v.61>The redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster , and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle , except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup .<TargetSentence>Half crazed by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , dashing out the rider 's brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us -- while the horse crashed away through the brush .</TargetSentence>It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become .</lie.v.61><lie.v.62>A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it .<TargetSentence>Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow .</TargetSentence>It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend .</lie.v.62><lie.v.63>Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road .<TargetSentence>I did n't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out .</TargetSentence>Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts .</lie.v.63><lie.v.64>Quickening his steps , John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells .<TargetSentence>Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air .</TargetSentence>John leaned upon the stone balustrade .</lie.v.64><lie.v.65>It would be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand .<TargetSentence>Now , Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choking the air .</TargetSentence>He saw the sign above the door of the hut : home sweet home .</lie.v.65><lie.v.66>He felt the sweetness of pity flood through him , veining his very flesh .<TargetSentence>Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know .</TargetSentence>They did not know who they were or know their own worth .</lie.v.66><lie.v.67>The dog refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers .<TargetSentence>He would lay in wait in the garage , and when the terrier came scratching around , he 'd let fly with a cherry bomb .</TargetSentence>`` Scared the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned .</lie.v.67><lie.v.68>He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire .<TargetSentence>Argiento made him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter .</TargetSentence>Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .</lie.v.68><lie.v.69>They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister .<TargetSentence>He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him .</TargetSentence>When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously .</lie.v.69><lie.v.70>Chapter 10<TargetSentence>New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .</TargetSentence>It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .</lie.v.70><lie.v.71>On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers -- smugglers -- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island .<TargetSentence>The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets .</TargetSentence>They often threw tidbits overboard .</lie.v.71><lie.v.72>Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow .<TargetSentence>She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .</TargetSentence>I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell .</lie.v.72><lie.v.73>I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life .<TargetSentence>First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers .</TargetSentence>I could n't face Thelma after that night .</lie.v.73><lie.v.74>Where are you , Henry ? ?<TargetSentence>-- Make him lie down ! !</TargetSentence>Watson snatched a deep breath .</lie.v.74><lie.v.75>His name had been crossed off a list .<TargetSentence>Already his cool body lay in the ground .</TargetSentence>What words had any meaning ? ?</lie.v.75><lie.v.76>In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .<TargetSentence>During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga .</TargetSentence>Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth .</lie.v.76><lie.v.77>She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans .<TargetSentence>What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light

until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .<TargetSentence>He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .</TargetSentence>Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .</lie.v.78><lie.v.79>They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually .<TargetSentence>He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky .</TargetSentence>Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails .</lie.v.79><lie.v.80>`` Not stealing , Pa .<TargetSentence>He was just lying there .</TargetSentence>Hans found him froze

debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor .</TargetSentence>His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the

.</TargetSentence>Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .</lie.v.82><lie.v.83>The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex 's inspection .<TargetSentence>Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens ' eggs .</TargetSentence>There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; ; in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands , thoroughly eared and big as a table top .</lie.v.83><lie.v.84>He was standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie .<TargetSentence>He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench .</TargetSentence>`` I do n't know what you think you 've been doing about my clothes '' , he

nearly dying , my head bandaged and blooded , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life .<TargetSentence>For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .</TargetSentence>The weeks went by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became .</lie.v.86><lie.v.87>It seemed incredible , as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients , that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the mentally ill

defenses .</TargetSentence>We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital .</lie.v.87><lie.v.88>`` All right '' , I said .<TargetSentence>`` Why do n't you bastards lay off for a
