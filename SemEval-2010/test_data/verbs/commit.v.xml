Attorney 's office .<TargetSentence>Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women 's House of Detention , a terribly overcrowded prison .</TargetSentence>It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio 's , an excellent Italian restaurant .</commit.v.14><commit.v.15>In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud 's cure-all gadget can prove fatal .<TargetSentence>Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .</TargetSentence>For instance : In Chicago , some time ago , Mr. H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $ 306 as a cure-all .</commit.v.15><commit.v.16>He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper 's news pitches were not trespassed

fragrance until after the middle of the meal -LRB- or the course -RRB- , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .<TargetSentence>The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire .</TargetSentence>This invariably effaces any wine 's character , and drives its fragrance underground .</commit.v.18><commit.v.19>We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .<TargetSentence>We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .</TargetSentence>The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .</commit.v.19><commit.v.20>Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .<TargetSentence>We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today .</TargetSentence>Otherwise , we go on endlessly

him before he had plunged into his Discourse , and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial ? ?</TargetSentence>Now , when everything was opening up to him -- even the court

, she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .</TargetSentence>Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .</commit.v.26><commit.v.27>She felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her .<TargetSentence>If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days .</TargetSentence>She smiled , and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves .</commit.v.27><commit.v.28>Although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith .<TargetSentence>Freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; and if he was n't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities .</TargetSentence>Mr. Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington .</commit.v.28><commit.v.29>And Gerry .<TargetSentence>Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already .</TargetSentence>He assures me he has people to handle the money

committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony .</TargetSentence>It 's a shame their meeting never took place .</commit.v.46><commit.v.47>The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement .<TargetSentence>Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .</TargetSentence>Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May .</commit.v.47><commit.v.48>During his cross examination of Mr. Lorin , Mr. Lang read from the transcripts of a conversation that was taped Oct. 20 , 1988 .<TargetSentence>Stanley Aslanian , the Haas broker who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation , also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed

jeopardize the stock scheme .</commit.v.48><commit.v.49>Neither technique is perfect , but both are better than the current system , which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ 20 billion annually , according to the Congressional Budget Office .<TargetSentence>A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to .</TargetSentence>4 . Impose standard accounting and administrative practices .</commit.v.49><commit.v.50>Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .<TargetSentence>Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains .</TargetSentence>In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them .

.<TargetSentence>Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism .</TargetSentence>And `` Summerfolk , '' penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov 's `` Cherry Orchard , '' is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers .</commit.v.51><commit.v.52>International investigators urged Britain to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals who took refuge there after 1945 .<TargetSentence>Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens .</TargetSentence>`` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S. , Canada and Australia .</commit.v.52><commit.v.53>But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .<TargetSentence>Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate .</TargetSentence>And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .</commit.v.53><commit.v.54>But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct

`` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .</commit.v.54><commit.v.55>The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law .<TargetSentence>Under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise .</TargetSentence>The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers .</commit.v.55><commit.v.56>Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale .<TargetSentence>I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers .</TargetSentence>My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .</commit.v.56><commit.v.57>The deportation of more than 315,000 men , women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years .<TargetSentence>Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry : that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century .</TargetSentence>Today 's Turks in Bulgaria , in other words , deserve what is coming to them four centuries later .</commit.v.57><commit.v.58>In addition , the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000 , including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry -LRB- KHAD\/WAD -RRB- , which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers .<TargetSentence>Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime , they are now dependent on it .</TargetSentence>And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union , where they are hostage for the behavior of their families .</commit.v.58><commit.v.59>Still , Berbera was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President Barrah .<TargetSentence>All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway .</TargetSentence>But would n't you know , now that we are spending jillions of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran , the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject .</commit.v.59><commit.v.60>Addison is no stranger to cans of worms , either .<TargetSentence>After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats .</TargetSentence>The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested .</commit.v.60><commit.v.61>A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull-out of three of its eight participating nations .<TargetSentence>Britain , France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success .</TargetSentence>Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls .</commit.v.61><commit.v.62>But playing word games over how to define the relationship is simply a way of hiding from the problem , ostrich-like , as the situation deteriorates .<TargetSentence>Fortunately the three main candidates have committed themselves to a moderate path .</TargetSentence>Right now there 's a choice between peace and war in cross-strait relations .</commit.v.62><commit.v.63>The Council of Grand Justices last month delivered a constitutional interpretation on the Cabinet 's decision to suspend construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant .<TargetSentence>According to the Grand Justices , the Cabinet committed " procedural
