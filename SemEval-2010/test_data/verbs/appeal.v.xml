.</appeal.v.30><appeal.v.31>The litigation was costly and seemingly endless .<TargetSentence>I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court -LRB- 1937 -RRB- , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` henchmen '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me .</TargetSentence>Presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers , `` toadies '' and sycophants of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! !</appeal.v.31><appeal.v.32>Alarmed councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop , or slow down , the subsidence that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding .<TargetSentence>The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti , who has yet to reply .</TargetSentence>AGIP refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start early next year .</appeal.v.32><appeal.v.33>Logic plays a minimal role here .<TargetSentence>More important are what LSI calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level .</TargetSentence>In one personal-injury case

''</TargetSentence>At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham .</appeal.v.40><appeal.v.41>At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham .<TargetSentence>In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .</TargetSentence>It also adds to the mystery of the venture .</appeal.v.41><appeal.v.42>There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others .<TargetSentence>One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders .</TargetSentence>Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .</appeal.v.42><appeal.v.43>Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s .<TargetSentence>Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .</TargetSentence>The lyric chosen -- `` long strange night '' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar .</appeal.v.43><appeal.v.44>From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders .<TargetSentence>While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times .</TargetSentence>That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .</appeal.v.44><appeal.v.45>But the Beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said .<TargetSentence>The Beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal .</TargetSentence>TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback .</appeal.v.45><appeal.v.46>Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer said the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $ 155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs .<TargetSentence>Also , he said , the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division 's ruling will be appealed .</TargetSentence>The plan , which has been plagued with delays and business-related setbacks , seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district .</appeal.v.46><appeal.v.47>He said that in this case he concurred with the State Department 's decision that Mr. Ahmad should be extradited .<TargetSentence>Mr. Ahmad 's lawyer said he would appeal .</TargetSentence>Lawyers close to the case said they believed the ruling was unprecedented .</appeal.v.47><appeal.v.48>The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .<TargetSentence>A provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .</TargetSentence>The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care .</appeal.v.48><appeal.v.49>But the development of the separatist trend on Taiwan has greatly hindering the process of peaceful reunification .<TargetSentence>Qichen Qian also pointed out that Chairman Zemin Jiang seriously appealed again at the 15th People 's Congress that , as the first step , both sides of the Straits could negotiate on " formally concluding the hostile state between both sides under the principle of one China " and come to an agreement ; and on this basis we could take up obligations together , maintain the integrity of China 's sovereignty and territory , and plan out the development of relations between both sides .</TargetSentence>We hope Taiwanese authorities conform to the historical development trends , and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for political negotiations between both sides of the Straits .</appeal.v.49><appeal.v.50>On the other hand , there are still a number of developing countries that have not benefited from the progress of globalization .<TargetSentence>In this connection , he appealed to the industrial countries to eliminate obstacles to the progress of the globalization of the world economy as soon as possible .</TargetSentence>In concluding his speech , Yuan Chen said that there are only 64 days left for China to regain the right to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong .</appeal.v.50><appeal.v.51>Alberto Fujimori , president of Peru presided over the opening ceremony .<TargetSentence>President Fujimori appealed at the opening ceremony for the countries of the Andes to strive together to achieve local integration , in order to shake off the state of being undeveloped .</TargetSentence>He also appealed for all countries to unite as one to deal with foreign debt , drug trafficking and violent activities .</appeal.v.51><appeal.v.52>President Fujimori appealed at the opening ceremony for the countries of the Andes to strive together to achieve local integration , in order to shake off the state of being undeveloped .<TargetSentence>He also appealed for all countries to unite as one to deal with foreign debt , drug trafficking and violent activities .</TargetSentence>This session of the Andes parliament meeting will last until the 16th .</appeal.v.52><appeal.v.53>The Tunisian government thinks that this bombing again shows that the activity of the multi-national forces has exceeded authorized limits set by the United Nations Security Council decision .<TargetSentence>Tunisia has again appealed to international conscience to take action , to stop the blood and end the destructive war , and create conditions for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .</TargetSentence>Ashitaer , the UN representative of Yemen strongly condemned this incident and asked the United Nations Security Council to be responsible for the passed resolution No. 678 which permits military actions against Iraq .</appeal.v.53><appeal.v.54>Since establishing the Straits Association , it has continuously pointed out such inhumane behavior to the Straits Foundation which seriously hurts feelings of compatriots of both sides and breaks the harmonious atmosphere on both sides , so as to attract the attention of relevant Taiwanese areas on compensating for losses , finding those responsible , and severely punishing the assailants .<TargetSentence>It has appealed to stop such violence at the root through negotiation between the two associations .</TargetSentence>However , up to now , the Straits Foundation 's response has not been received .</appeal.v.54><appeal.v.55>Xinhua News Agency , Hanoi , August 31st , by reporter Shuojing Hu<TargetSentence>At a press conference held here today , Samuel Insanally , chairman of the UN Assembly , appealed to the international community to further assist Vietnam to recover and develop its economy .</TargetSentence>Insanally emphasized that helping Vietnam to recover production and construction is the international community 's current responsibility .</appeal.v.55><appeal.v.56>Insanally emphasized that helping Vietnam to recover production and construction is the international community 's current responsibility .<TargetSentence>He appealed to countries participating in the " Parisian international meeting on assisting Vietnam " to be held in Paris in November of this year to extend economic aid to Vietnam .</TargetSentence>At the " Parisian international meeting on assisting Vietnam " held in November of last year , Vietnam totally received aid of 1.86 billion US dollars from such countries as Japan , France , Korea , Sweden , etc .</appeal.v.56><appeal.v.57>James Soong has suggested defining Taiwan - PRC links as a " quasi-international relationship . "<TargetSentence>This aims for a middle ground between the KMT 's " two states formula " and the PRC 's " one country , two systems " that will appeal to Taiwan , mainland China , and the international community .</TargetSentence>But this idea has been criticized for unilaterally reducing Taiwan to the status of a " quasi-country , " thereby weakening Taiwan 's status and bargaining power vis-a-vis the mainland .</appeal.v.57><appeal.v.58>Justin Lin , in his analysis of the pretty-boy phenomenon , avers : In the 1990s , the general trend of all cutting-edge design was " super-youth . "<TargetSentence>Many well - established products appealing to the upper middle-class found it impossible to resist the trend toward youth and had to change their own design and style .</TargetSentence>Looking around , you can see a transition in the most popular types of male models .</appeal.v.58><appeal.v.59>Photorealism was the vogue in American painting at the time .<TargetSentence>It did n't appeal to Hsia at first , but he knew he had to learn something in his new country of residence , and at the same time he needed to produce work that was commercially viable .</TargetSentence>He began employing photographic effects , for example depicting a crowd of passersby on a New York street as a speeding blur .</appeal.v.59><appeal.v.60>Many people join with a sudden burst of interest , but drop out halfway .<TargetSentence>In order to keep business going , and keep people coming habitually over the long term , it is necessary that health centers appeal to customers with " freebies " - meaning gain with no pain .</TargetSentence>" If health centers can offer not only working out but also recreational functions , then members will keep coming back , " says Tang .</appeal.v.60></appeal.v.test>
