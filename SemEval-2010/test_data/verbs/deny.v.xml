that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .<TargetSentence>Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .</TargetSentence>The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? ?</deny.v.25><deny.v.26>When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .<TargetSentence>If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life .</TargetSentence>Dr. H.V. Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , -LRB- 1300 B.C. -RRB- escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .</deny.v.26><deny.v.27>We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning .<TargetSentence>But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ?</TargetSentence>Which theory is more fantastic : 1 . That the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor 's brain , or 2 . That the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ? ?</deny.v.27><deny.v.28>`` Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke '' .<TargetSentence>Diane sobbingly denied this to the court .</TargetSentence>`` That 's a lie .</deny.v.28><deny.v.29>These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .<TargetSentence>It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .</TargetSentence>But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment .</deny.v.29><deny.v.30>To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .<TargetSentence>Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he can not deny his debt to the collector .</TargetSentence>The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .</deny.v.30><deny.v.31>This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College .<TargetSentence>They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school .</TargetSentence>At the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .</deny.v.31><deny.v.32>All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork .<TargetSentence>No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !</TargetSentence>But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .</deny.v.32><deny.v.33>An essay on `` Freedom '' written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence , the freedom given to slaves in Canada , and the views of George Washington .<TargetSentence>Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges , only Oberlin and Elmira , were open to women ; ; and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .</TargetSentence>A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer .</deny.v.33><deny.v.34>The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .<TargetSentence>There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them .</TargetSentence>Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .</deny.v.34><deny.v.35>But that is a cliche and a dishonest one .<TargetSentence>The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it .</TargetSentence>Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .</deny.v.35><deny.v.36>Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .<TargetSentence>It is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season 's cotton and tobacco crops ; ; of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century .</TargetSentence>This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; ; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .</deny.v.36><deny.v.37>Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .<TargetSentence>Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; ; but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .</TargetSentence>As John T. Westbrook says in his article , `` Twilight Of Southern Regionalism '' -LRB- Southwest Review , Winter 1957 -RRB- : `` The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and -LRB- let us fervently hope -RRB- forever done with '' .</deny.v.37><deny.v.38>Consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .<TargetSentence>Most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .</TargetSentence>The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .</deny.v.38><deny.v.39>Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ? That regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ? That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? ?<TargetSentence>Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? ?</TargetSentence>Circumstances alter cases .</deny.v.39><deny.v.40>I 'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally .<TargetSentence>If these people were denied a voice -LRB- do they have a moral right to a voice ? ? -RRB- , what voices would be left ? ?</TargetSentence>Who is involved willy nilly ? ?</deny.v.40><deny.v.41>They reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920 's .<TargetSentence>These new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom : the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted French bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them .</TargetSentence>One of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette ; ; others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out .</deny.v.41><deny.v.42><TargetSentence>Important as was Mr. O'Donnell's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has .</TargetSentence>He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .</deny.v.42><deny.v.43>He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago .<TargetSentence>That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .</TargetSentence>It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .</deny.v.43><deny.v.44>It is engendered by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in The Almagest with the geocentric astronomy .<TargetSentence>Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion .</TargetSentence>This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .</deny.v.44><deny.v.45><TargetSentence>There

everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder .</TargetSentence>A rush of panic caught Sarah .</deny.v.47><deny.v.48>He was also , if Pam North was right , a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne 's than she , now , was inclined to admit .<TargetSentence>He might deny the latter ; ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder

voices .<TargetSentence>Standing there she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her .</TargetSentence>When at last she could suffer the insult no longer , nor face the girl 's scorn , she said in a voice overloud : `` I shall call your father ! !</deny.v.52><deny.v.53>It was n't Johnnie 's fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable

a Bogartian figure , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic Tasti-Freeze salesman in old New-Waver Fredrico de Mille Rossilini 's endlessly provocative film , A Sour Sponge

Abstract Expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of V -LRB- for Vindication -RRB- Day , September first , when Augustus Quasimodo 's first one-man show opens at the Guggenheim
