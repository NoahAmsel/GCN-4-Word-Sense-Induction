<assemble.v.test><assemble.v.1>Only such a potent force , they theorize , could have ripped `` Cole 's '' steel hull , collapsed some of the war ship 's interior sections , and destroyed some of its vital communications .<TargetSentence>Investigators are heading into this steamy port city to begin analyzing the theories while assembling the facts .</TargetSentence>A U.S. official here praised the Yemen government , saying it was doing its part .</assemble.v.1><assemble.v.2>In fact , we 're hearing that those deals have now been finalized , that Russia will sell India 300 tanks , T-90 tanks , very advanced tanks , that Russia will also sell to India some Sukoi-30 bombers , fighter - bombers .<TargetSentence>They are going to allow India to assemble about 140 of these bombers here in India , and they are also going to finalize a deal whereby India will acquire the Admiral Gorshkov .</TargetSentence>That 's an old Russian aircraft carrier that India has wanted to get for some time because India only has one other aircraft carrier , and this carrier in particular would allow the Indian Navy to extend its strategic strength much farther than it currently can now .</assemble.v.2><assemble.v.3>There was a rowdy session of parliament that Ehud Barak addressed today .<TargetSentence>It was the first time Israeli lawmakers had assembled since the Palestinian uprising began a month ago .</TargetSentence>Prime Minister Barak told the legislature that he believes peace in the Middle East is still possible , but that Israel does not have a partner prepared to make compromises .</assemble.v.3><assemble.v.4> <TargetSentence>For his part President Clinton said his only advice to Bush is to assemble a good team and to do what he thinks is right .</TargetSentence>Bush is now heading back to Texas .</assemble.v.4><assemble.v.5>One thing the President said that will be the point of contention around the world , the President called it an ever - growing coalition of 40 countries .<TargetSentence>That is handful more nations that were actively involved in the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the Persian Gulf War , but there is a significant difference , of course .</TargetSentence>In this coalition , it is the United States doing the overwhelming load of the fighting .</assemble.v.5><assemble.v.6>Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength .<TargetSentence>He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .</TargetSentence>One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army .</assemble.v.6><assemble.v.7>One of Mrs. Kennedy 's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine .<TargetSentence>Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson , the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic .</TargetSentence>Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this .</assemble.v.7><assemble.v.8>Dartmouth 's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .<TargetSentence>Since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States , the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own .</TargetSentence>Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union , which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country .</assemble.v.8><assemble.v.9>Strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .<TargetSentence>Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation .</TargetSentence>Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .</assemble.v.9><assemble.v.10>A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .<TargetSentence>He opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age .</TargetSentence>The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .</assemble.v.10><assemble.v.11>For the President had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way .<TargetSentence>But the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters .</TargetSentence>Any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and President in a situation which should never have arisen .</assemble.v.11><assemble.v.12>In due time Sandburg was a walking thesaurus of American folk music .<TargetSentence>After he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln , Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him .</TargetSentence>He rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists .</assemble.v.12><assemble.v.13>This means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough .<TargetSentence>Here are a few facts and figures I 've assembled .</TargetSentence>Ca n't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ?</assemble.v.13><assemble.v.14>[Marlon_Defillo] Well the tape is troubling /.<TargetSentence>[Marlon_Defillo] You know when this was brought on yesterday morning uh the superintendent who was out of town uh assembled   his   his senior managers including myself /.</TargetSentence>[Marlon_Defillo] We had gone to see the tape /.</assemble.v.14><assemble.v.15>That fund was put together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank .<TargetSentence>The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co .</TargetSentence>The new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors .</assemble.v.15><assemble.v.16>Rather , Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says Kent Calder , a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University .<TargetSentence>In electronics , for example , a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan , assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia .</TargetSentence>`` The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , '' says Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Hormats .</assemble.v.16><assemble.v.17>Mr. Sugarman has in turn contended that the other major shareholder group -- whose interests are represented by three other directors connected to trusts in the name of

refute MCI 's charges .</TargetSentence>`` MCI has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT&amp;T , '' said PaineWebber 's Mr. Grubman , who said he expected AT&amp;T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis .</assemble.v.18><assemble.v.19>Nearly all the decline came in Ford 's U.S. automotive operations .<TargetSentence>The Dearborn , Mich. , auto maker ran a loss of $ 37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the U.S. , a deterioration of $ 378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter .</TargetSentence>Ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services .</assemble.v.19><assemble.v.20>The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data .<TargetSentence>The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or hours -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .</TargetSentence>This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor .</assemble.v.20><assemble.v.21>-LRB- Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization .<TargetSentence>When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners , Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded .</TargetSentence>That may be because Mr. Gargan , smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group , enrolled his dog , Beauregard , as a member of the IAFP .</assemble.v.21><assemble.v.22>The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans using walkie-talkies , cellular phones , and a public-address system .<TargetSentence>The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and `` safe havens '' where people can be assembled away from major structures .</TargetSentence>Vista Chemical Co. , with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles , La. , `` prepares for every hurricane that enters the Gulf of Mexico , '' says Keith L. Fogg , a company safety director .</assemble.v.22><assemble.v.23>Mr. Fischer plows his own fields , sows his own corn and sunflowers , and feeds his own sheep .<TargetSentence>Over at the fiberglass factory , four white workers assemble water tanks on their own , and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road .</TargetSentence>On Main Street , Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop , then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family .</assemble.v.23><assemble.v.24>So the Kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks .<TargetSentence>At Quotron , the company 's National Call-In Center , which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo , assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders .</TargetSentence>The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work , though most of the rerouting was done by computer .</assemble.v.24><assemble.v.25>Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S. , where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts .<TargetSentence>Commodore has assembled an experienced management team , it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign .</TargetSentence>But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones .</assemble.v.25><assemble.v.26>The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle , Mr. Gelbart 's stand in for Col. Oliver North .<TargetSentence>Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings .</TargetSentence>Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle , mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism ; Jeff Weiss is fire , brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle ; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers ; Joseph Daly has the perfect `` aw , shucks '' demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president ; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses ' wives .</assemble.v.26><assemble.v.27>The Chicago office figured prominently in the bank 's problems earlier this year , when $ 65 million in loans to Chicago businessman William Stoecker went sour .<TargetSentence>In an internal memorandum to employees , Messrs. Connolly and Driscoll described the restructuring as an effort to continue rationalizing operations assembled during a series of mergers over the past five years .</TargetSentence></assemble.v.27><assemble.v.28>Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman .<TargetSentence>Prior to a tender offer by A&amp;P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986 , the founder of the Waldbaum 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery .</TargetSentence>She called her daughter to take her to the bank , who , in turn , persuaded her husband , a Mr. Loeb , to run this errand .</assemble.v.28><assemble.v.29>Mr. Paul thus developed a close , symbiotic relationship with Sotheby 's .<TargetSentence>Mr. Paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters CenTrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year .</TargetSentence>Sotheby 's , the auction house founded in London 1744 and now under the umbrella of Sotheby 's Holdings Inc. , was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its U.S. business .</assemble.v.29><assemble.v.30>Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers .<TargetSentence>For example , when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled .</TargetSentence>But steelmakers must also find new markets .</assemble.v.30><assemble.v.31>In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC .<TargetSentence>She 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in-depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories .</TargetSentence>CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS .</assemble.v.31><assemble.v.32>One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served .<TargetSentence>An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted Nunn-McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell , Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee .</TargetSentence>It might well win Senate passage .</assemble.v.32><assemble.v.33>On the solid shell of the " little turtle " is embedded a map of the world composed of land and oceans .<TargetSentence>It implies that good swimming athletes coming from five continents and four oceans assembled together in Rome to strengthen understanding and enhance friendship through competition .</TargetSentence>Xinhua news agency journalists Zongxian Zhou and Aiguo Yang</assemble.v.33><assemble.v.34>" One is that all the upstream and downstream factories are here .<TargetSentence>You can assemble a computer completely from parts made within 50 kilometers . "</TargetSentence>And the second key is that when you deal with Taiwanese companies , you do n't have to endure a long contract process .</assemble.v.34><assemble.v.35>Also featured at the exhibit are two replicas of brass Qin - period chariots on loan from the Taiwanese art collector Huang Jen-chung and the National Museum of Natural Science .<TargetSentence>Each chariot is assembled from over 7,000 different pieces , and is half the size of the original , which has been described as " the most extraordinary bronze piece ever made " on account of its huge size , complex structure , and lifelike realism .</TargetSentence>In addition , scholars have discovered that the bronze weapons unearthed along with the soldiers all have a different percentage of copper and tin , depending on their purpose .</assemble.v.35><assemble.v.36>For the work to be faithful to the original each angle had to be precise .<TargetSentence>Cheng tackled this problem by assembling a number of paper models before getting to work .</TargetSentence>But he also had to try to duplicate the red color of the piece , a color characteristic of Shisanhang pottery .</assemble.v.36><assemble.v.37>" Life in middle age is like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle in a gale .<TargetSentence>The more you look at the parts you 've already assembled , the more disjointed and ugly they seem ; but it 's the parts you ca n't finish that you long for more and more , even though you know there 's precious little hope you 'll ever get them done . "</TargetSentence>Ms. Lin , who turned 40 this year , says with an air of resignation that if a gust of wind blows the whole puzzle away , the sense of dismay and panic at being tricked by fate can drive you to distraction .</assemble.v.37></assemble.v.test>
