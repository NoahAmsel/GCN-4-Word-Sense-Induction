<assert.v.test><assert.v.1> <TargetSentence>It would be wise for her to take a little time maybe to just observe things and get used to the process and not try to , you know , assert too aggressively her obvious celebrity status .</TargetSentence> </assert.v.1><assert.v.2>Sources say he and his team are also still optimistic about a win in the recount , because they believe a manual count will turn up mistakes in Gore 's favor .<TargetSentence>Meanwhile , the Gore Florida team today asserting there is still a lot of work to be done before naming the President-elect .</TargetSentence> </assert.v.2><assert.v.3>Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .<TargetSentence>Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .</TargetSentence>The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standards .</assert.v.3><assert.v.4>Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .<TargetSentence>It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .</TargetSentence>`` The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions .</assert.v.4><assert.v.5>Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .<TargetSentence>Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .</TargetSentence>More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .</assert.v.5><assert.v.6>When was the turning point ? ?<TargetSentence>When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?</TargetSentence>Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .</assert.v.6><assert.v.7>After another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts '' .<TargetSentence>He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine .</TargetSentence>When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain .</assert.v.7><assert.v.8>Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews do n't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' .<TargetSentence>Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ; it 's to be a good person '' .</TargetSentence>When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' .</assert.v.8><assert.v.9>By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders .<TargetSentence>Outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior '' peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance .</TargetSentence>It became the sole `` subject '' of `` international law '' -LRB- a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham -RRB- , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena .</assert.v.9><assert.v.10>The Rule of Law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court '' before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare .<TargetSentence>Recognizing that the Rule of Law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society '' , the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized '' .</TargetSentence>The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world .</assert.v.10><assert.v.11>Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .<TargetSentence>In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church .</TargetSentence>The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .</assert.v.11><assert.v.12>All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .<TargetSentence>John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress ' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the British Constitution and the common law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence `` to the tribunal of the world '' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature 's God '' .</TargetSentence>They fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 .</assert.v.12><assert.v.13>Many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede .<TargetSentence>But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .</TargetSentence>Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution .</assert.v.13><assert.v.14>One is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought .<TargetSentence>But though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states .</TargetSentence>If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union .</assert.v.14><assert.v.15>His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon 's was Julius Caesar .<TargetSentence>His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .</TargetSentence>Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .</assert.v.15><assert.v.16>Some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits .<TargetSentence>There is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr. Faulkner is Southern .</TargetSentence>It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family .</assert.v.16><assert.v.17>The Agreeable Autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today .<TargetSentence>The men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion : that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world '' .</TargetSentence>These institutions which Mr. Lyford names `` agreeable autocracies '' -- where did they come from ? ?</assert.v.17><assert.v.18>[speaker1]   Why   why did n't you just say I 'm not going to talk about it as you did when most journalists asked /?<TargetSentence>[Bob_Woodward]   Be-   because he had the initials on the memo which were ~MF Mark Felt and he knew Carl Berstein 's wife [Bob_Woodward] and he was going to assert it with the kind of authority that is rare not rare for Richard as a columnist but uh that this was a fact /.</TargetSentence>[Bob_Woodward] And this was a sensitive time /.</assert.v.18><assert.v.19>By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .<TargetSentence>If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable .</TargetSentence>The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .</assert.v.19><assert.v.20>One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .<TargetSentence>There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .</TargetSentence>If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .</assert.v.20><assert.v.21>There still are some details to be nailed down .<TargetSentence>Mr. Bush is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to keep Congress in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee does n't recognize .</TargetSentence>And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled .</assert.v.21><assert.v.22>He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending .<TargetSentence>But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto .</TargetSentence>Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power .</assert.v.22><assert.v.23>The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct .<TargetSentence>The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .</TargetSentence>A Board of Control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .</assert.v.23><assert.v.24>The government 's startling allegations , filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court , challenge the motives and veracity of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor .<TargetSentence>In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . ''</TargetSentence>The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices .</assert.v.24><assert.v.25>When GE finally disclosed the problems , prosecutors contend that Mr. Orr `` was erroneously informed that the -LCB- suspected -RCB- practices had only just been discovered '' by GE management .<TargetSentence>In its brief , the government asserted that it needs the internal GE documents to rebut anticipated efforts by GE during the trial to demonstrate `` its good corporate character . ''</TargetSentence>GE , which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior GE managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives .</assert.v.25><assert.v.26>GE 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity .<TargetSentence>The company 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' GE 's brief asserts .</TargetSentence>`` On the contrary , it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters . ''</assert.v.26><assert.v.27>`` Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity ? '' he asks .<TargetSentence>The recruiting `` has n't materialized , '' asserts Jeffrey Christian , who runs a search agency .</TargetSentence>Samuel Hall , Howard University 's placement director , also does n't see it .</assert.v.27><assert.v.28>Ronald Kirk , president , says Lloyd 's has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries .<TargetSentence>Thus , he asserts , Lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition .</TargetSentence>`` Lloyd 's has lost control of the situation , '' he says .</assert.v.28><assert.v.29>`` We will support it , we will thank him , and we will augment it where appropriate , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- .<TargetSentence>Dubbed the `` Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance , '' the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments .</TargetSentence>`` Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required , '' the legislation reads , and the new obligations `` shall not be a charge against the Budget Act , Gramm-Rudman-Hollings , or other ceilings .</assert.v.29><assert.v.30>The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in , they reported .<TargetSentence>Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod .</TargetSentence>As of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely .</assert.v.30><assert.v.31>President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week .<TargetSentence>Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities .</TargetSentence>Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community .</assert.v.31><assert.v.32>Parsippany , N.J .<TargetSentence>I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings .</TargetSentence>The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . ''</assert.v.32><assert.v.33>Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .<TargetSentence>Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .</TargetSentence>The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .</assert.v.33><assert.v.34>Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed .<TargetSentence>But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules .</TargetSentence>Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend .</assert.v.34></assert.v.test>
