<expose.v.test><expose.v.1> <TargetSentence>India is a deeply religious and traditional country , but in the past decade thanks to globalization and cable TV , the population has been exposed to dozens of multinational brands from burgers to washing machines and pizzas to Pepsi , but despite the desire to embrace globalization , there is still a reluctance to change completely .</TargetSentence>Marketing analyst Sohail Seth , believes that fast food companies will only survive if they take seriously the need to be culturally sensitive .</expose.v.1><expose.v.2>34 - year - old British journalist James Miller died on the scene after Israeli soldiers came to his aid , the Israeli defense sources says .<TargetSentence>He is best known for his work on two award - winning documentaries which appeared on CNN exposing the world to the Taliban rule in Afghanistan .</TargetSentence>Now the Foreign Press Association in Israel is calling for an independent investigation .</expose.v.2><expose.v.3>At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent .<TargetSentence>But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .</TargetSentence>If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?</expose.v.3><expose.v.4>Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .<TargetSentence>What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?</TargetSentence>Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial .</expose.v.4><expose.v.5>No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .<TargetSentence>The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .</TargetSentence>Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ?</expose.v.5><expose.v.6>But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann 's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .<TargetSentence>Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .</TargetSentence>Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .</expose.v.6><expose.v.7>Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .<TargetSentence>The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .</TargetSentence>To quote Professor Saintsbury : `` The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; ; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! !</expose.v.7><expose.v.8>But I usually stick to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung -LRB- I hold an office , but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion -RRB- .<TargetSentence>I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' .</TargetSentence>With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?</expose.v.8><expose.v.9>And how did he feel about modern art ? ?<TargetSentence>Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .</TargetSentence>`` As my wife puts it '' , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , `` all you know is your music .</expose.v.9><expose.v.10>By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? ?<TargetSentence>The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' as James 's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries -RRB- `` however bad I may be , you 're not quite the people to say it '' .</TargetSentence>In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North .</expose.v.10><expose.v.11>We must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results .<TargetSentence>In truth , we can say that this broke the power of Senator Joseph McCarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the American people .</TargetSentence>If he had been `` liquidated '' in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas .</expose.v.11><expose.v.12>Going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , in Santa Barbara .<TargetSentence>But however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to expose , right now , is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises .</TargetSentence>The host is the flowing life of the human race .</expose.v.12><expose.v.13>Women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld .<TargetSentence>She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .</TargetSentence>One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .</expose.v.13><expose.v.14>The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate Alex further into these undertakings .<TargetSentence>The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex 's inspection .</TargetSentence>Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens ' eggs .</expose.v.14><expose.v.15>The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller 's second shot came .<TargetSentence>Muller , nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car 's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ; his face wore a look of outrage .</TargetSentence>A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ; a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table .</expose.v.15><expose.v.16>Not yet .<TargetSentence>It was nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of earth , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night .</TargetSentence>Mission Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty -- the neighborhood that had known Urbano Quintana by day .</expose.v.16><expose.v.17>`` Singing '' as applicable to herself required research .<TargetSentence>She had , of course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` Tristan und Isolde '' , `` Candide '' , `` Oklahoma '' , `` Nozze de Figaro '' , the atomic age singers , Eileen Farrell , Elvis Presley and Geraldine Todd , as well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians , Capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the Altairians .</TargetSentence>But `` singing '' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome .</expose.v.17><expose.v.18>Shortly after , Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas .<TargetSentence>Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; he generally heard Freddy 's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns .</TargetSentence>Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren .</expose.v.18><expose.v.19>[Ye_daying] They denounced my father , so I was very indignant ,<TargetSentence>[Ye_daying] They let a lot of people expose my father ,</TargetSentence>[Chen_luyu] Mm .</expose.v.19><expose.v.20>[Dr_Gupto] But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.<TargetSentence>[Dr_Gupto] The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.</TargetSentence>[Dr_Gupto] and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.</expose.v.20><expose.v.21>[speaker1] Judith Miller in jail for protecting her sources an act of conscience ah paying a heavy price /.<TargetSentence>[speaker1] but [speaker1] is n't there a minimal public sympathy for her because these sources were not exposing wrongdoing as Deep Throat did but outing a CIA operative /?</TargetSentence>[Bob_Woodward] Um yes ah apparently /.</expose.v.21><expose.v.22>[Arianna_Huffington] Yes it is shocking /.<TargetSentence>[Arianna_Huffington] and I think Keith Olbermann did a phenomenal job at exposing this on ~MSNBC /.</TargetSentence>[Howard_Kurtz] Alright /.</expose.v.22><expose.v.23>[Wang_Shilin] Uh-huh .<TargetSentence>[Jin_xide] So , contrary to Koizumi 's diplomatic purpose , he not only failed to sidestep the issue of the visit , but rather exposed this kind of , this %pw scandal to the %pw entire world .</TargetSentence>[Wang_Shilin] Uh-huh .</expose.v.23><expose.v.24>[Wang_Shilin] Uh-huh .<TargetSentence>[Jin_xide] That is to say , this time he could only further expose his poor diplomatic skills and his isolation to the international community .</TargetSentence>[Wang_Shilin] Uh-huh .</expose.v.24><expose.v.25>John Kriz , a Moody 's vice president , said Boston Safe Deposit 's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities .<TargetSentence>The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. Kriz said .</TargetSentence>Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality . ''</expose.v.25><expose.v.26>In the Manager 's Journal , Atsushi Kageyama , in commenting on many differences between American and Japanese culture , said , `` Japanese children are raised in a way many Americans would find severe .<TargetSentence>After a wonderfully frivolous early childhood , they are exposed to rigid discipline as soon as they enter school . ''</TargetSentence>What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that American children , on the whole , are among the most undisciplined in the world , making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful .</expose.v.26><expose.v.27>Greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack .<TargetSentence>And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .</TargetSentence>Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move .</expose.v.27><expose.v.28>Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity .<TargetSentence>But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue .</TargetSentence>And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy , it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too .</expose.v.28><expose.v.29>For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .<TargetSentence>But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .</TargetSentence>The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue .</expose.v.29><expose.v.30><TargetSentence>Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection , company and city officials said .</TargetSentence>The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .</expose.v.30><expose.v.31>It was at least still more than 1,000 meters in height and the precipitous slope was n't under 60 plus degrees .<TargetSentence>Nearby there was a level slope a few hundred meters wide amidst rows of green trees and withered trees , exposing raked brown-grey gravel .</TargetSentence>This apparently was the remains of the volcanic ash from the most recent eruption in 1707 .</expose.v.31><expose.v.32>You do n't get the same feeling from artifacts that have been buried in the ground for thousands of years , exposed to microbes and chemical transformations , that you can get instantly from the recreated works that I am doing today . "<TargetSentence>Cheng admits that if he utilized extraneous processes , such as exposing the pieces to wood smoke for a long time , he could get the colors closer to those of the actual artifacts , but then he would be losing something else at the same time .</TargetSentence>Thus , before getting down to work on the final version of each piece , he made numerous trials , using different proportions of iron oxide , trying different temperatures , sometimes buffing the piece to make it glossy and other times not , to get as close as possible to the correct overall effect .</expose.v.32></expose.v.test>
