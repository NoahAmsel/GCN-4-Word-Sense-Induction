and what to count ?</separate.v.1><separate.v.2>The problem is that the 5,000 undercount ballots are mixed in with the pool of nearly 300,000 ballots .<TargetSentence>They flew in a computer consultant to install a program to separate the ballots .</TargetSentence>His explanation of how it all works baffled me .</separate.v.2><separate.v.3><TargetSentence>The United Nations in East Timor

while hundreds of thousands fled their homes or were forced to leave by Indonesian soldiers .</separate.v.4><separate.v.5>Well , yes mostly European judicial systems do have a form of the Supreme Court .<TargetSentence>However , for example , in France the strict machinery of justice is separated from the constitutional court , which is a separate body , but yes there also the members are appointed by the President and therefore there also , the members of the Coseque Constitutionalle are somewhat open to criticism that the decisions are often more motivated by politics than they are by the law .</TargetSentence>However , I think that the image that we Europeans had , of the American system and especially of the US Supreme Court , was that those justices were above politics and , I think , that is also one of the bad surprises that this election is reserving to us Europeans is that finally your system is not as perfect as we were led to believe .</separate.v.5><separate.v.6>Here is the status of the recount as of this hour .<TargetSentence>The two candidates separated by only 225 votes , with 65 out of 67 counties reporting

, objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive .</TargetSentence>Dr. Karlis Osis , Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , -LRB- `` New Research On Survival After Death '' , Spring 1958 -RRB- .</separate.v.7><separate.v.8>He remarked : `` It has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter '' .<TargetSentence>The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium 's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated .</TargetSentence>One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .</separate.v.8><separate.v.9>It is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` hits '' .<TargetSentence>Now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive is at her best .</TargetSentence>Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses .</separate.v.9><separate.v.10>A tsunami is not a single wave but a series .<TargetSentence>The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more -LRB- because of their great length -RRB- , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .</TargetSentence>The waves may keep coming for many hours .</separate.v.10><separate.v.11>From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; ; from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .<TargetSentence>The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .</TargetSentence>At either end and in the

with a job .</separate.v.12><separate.v.13>Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church -- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel .<TargetSentence>He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated .</TargetSentence>He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too .</separate.v.13><separate.v.14>Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .<TargetSentence>`` Your wife just

I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook .</separate.v.14><separate.v.15>My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted .<TargetSentence>But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond .</TargetSentence>These letters became the center of my existence .</separate.v.15><separate.v.16>But , from our reading of the Western Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce .<TargetSentence>It 's inevitable in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years .</TargetSentence>Naturally , he couched the provision in obscure language .</separate.v.16><separate.v.17>I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall .<TargetSentence>Though only a relatively short walk separated it

Leyte from Samar and hope that it did n't close in before they returned .</TargetSentence>Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .</separate.v.19><separate.v.20>The man did not wish to leave

up , we were separated .</TargetSentence>Outside the hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow .</separate.v.21><separate.v.22>But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts .<TargetSentence>In fact , it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi .</TargetSentence>Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school

securities and banking industries .<TargetSentence>Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other .</TargetSentence>Both sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have been at a flashpoint for months .</separate.v.27><separate.v.28>Over the past two years , the Fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms .<TargetSentence>Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .</TargetSentence>However , the Fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10 % of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks , such as dealing in U.S. Treasurys .</separate.v.28><separate.v.29>Mazda makes the Tracer for Ford .<TargetSentence>As a result of the adhesive problem on the Ford Escort subcompacts , windshields may easily

recommends that the courts adopt different `` tracks '' for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones .</TargetSentence>Complex cases , such as antitrust suits and many business disputes , would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving .</separate.v.30><separate.v.31>As usual , her sin was saying what she thought .<TargetSentence>She issued a separate statement , separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against South Africa .</TargetSentence>While supporting the Commonwealth `` in utterly condemning apartheid , '' her statement urged it to `` encourage change '' rather than inflict further punishment on the country 's black population .</separate.v.31><separate.v.32>However , this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans .<TargetSentence>Credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy .</TargetSentence>For example , student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral .</separate.v.32><separate.v.33>The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .<TargetSentence>But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state , making it fully accountable for pollution control .</TargetSentence>A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .</separate.v.33><separate.v.34>The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings .<TargetSentence>State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse .</TargetSentence>The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared .</separate.v.34><separate.v.35>The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California , when numerous bridges collapsed .<TargetSentence>`` We had just finished phase two '' of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock , a state DOT engineer said .</TargetSentence>After completing installation of the jackets on `` one frame '' of the freeway last year , the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design .</separate.v.35><separate.v.36>Bonds issued by Kroger , Duracell , Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains , recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday .<TargetSentence>But traders said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group , in which trades can be executed easily , and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this year .</TargetSentence>`` Liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , '' said Mr. Minella of Merrill .</separate.v.36><separate.v.37>I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .<TargetSentence>Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .</TargetSentence>Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for .</separate.v.37><separate.v.38>During the first halt , after the S&amp;P index had fallen 12 points , the Big
