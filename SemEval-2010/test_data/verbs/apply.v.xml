.</TargetSentence>Nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient 's neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life .</apply.v.30><apply.v.31>Felons were cured by

feather .</TargetSentence>Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .</apply.v.33><apply.v.34>Shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations .<TargetSentence>For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth .</TargetSentence>Itching skin , considered `` just nerves '' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .</apply.v.34><apply.v.35>Itching skin , considered `` just nerves '' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .<TargetSentence>Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped .</TargetSentence>To cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water .</apply.v.35><apply.v.36>One veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire '' .<TargetSentence>Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight .</TargetSentence>This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .</apply.v.36><apply.v.37>High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .<TargetSentence>That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty

the modern world .</apply.v.37><apply.v.38>Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .<TargetSentence>The same principle of `` redundancy '' applies to all

materials at their disposal ? ?<TargetSentence>Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work .</TargetSentence>Others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .</apply.v.39><apply.v.40>The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals -LRB- or rhythms or dynamic changes -RRB- .<TargetSentence>He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .</TargetSentence>But he can not order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .</apply.v.40><apply.v.41>But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such .<TargetSentence>For example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only X-rays , applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites ; ; or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians .</TargetSentence>So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more .</apply.v.41><apply.v.42>Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .<TargetSentence>Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .</TargetSentence>If we can not stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? ?</apply.v.42><apply.v.43>No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .<TargetSentence>It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman .</TargetSentence>Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars , or even of Tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result .</apply.v.43><apply.v.44>Hammarskjold 's supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross is illusion , at best .<TargetSentence>Gross 's , being `` outside ''

rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium .<TargetSentence>When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate .</TargetSentence>Ordinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy .</apply.v.89><apply.v.90>Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time .<TargetSentence>The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and

John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous ,

some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .</apply.v.91><apply.v.92>-LRB- Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization .<TargetSentence>When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners , Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded

saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .</TargetSentence>Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner .</apply.v.93><apply.v.94>That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me .<TargetSentence>Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing .</TargetSentence>And the Second Law , unique to insurance ?</apply.v.94><apply.v.95>I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt .<TargetSentence>In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .</TargetSentence></apply.v.95><apply.v.96>But car-happy Americans panicked , and so did the U.S. and other oil-consuming governments .<TargetSentence>`` Shortage '' and `` crisis '' became buzz words , although neither really applied .</TargetSentence>The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of

opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco , contrary to your Sept. 8 article `` Court Backs Texaco 's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late . ''<TargetSentence>The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound .</TargetSentence>In the Pennzoil\/Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound .</apply.v.97><apply.v.98>And they plan to buy more today .<TargetSentence>Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash : Buying at the bottom pays off .</TargetSentence>To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today .</apply.v.98><apply.v.99>The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .<TargetSentence>A provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .</TargetSentence>The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care .</apply.v.99><apply.v.100>According to statistics , they have implemented a total of 599 specialty research items , and achieved 186 items of significant scientific research results , among which 139 items won provincial , departmental level and higher level awards and 11 items reached internationally advanced levels .<TargetSentence>Among these research results , 138 items were applied to production by enterprises to " spin gold from straw " , which greatly raised the production level of China 's nickel industry .</TargetSentence>Data show that the recoverable valuable elements at Jinchuan Company have increased from originally 7 kinds to 14 kinds , that the net increase of selective and smelting nickel recovery is 26.5 % and that the rate of smelting recovery of precious metals has increased more than 10 times .</apply.v.100><apply.v.101>But financial experts from Wall Street warn that , foreign enterprises entering the New York Stock Exchange , to a large extent , means that these enterprises need to adopt the strict operations and financial management methods of the US .<TargetSentence>If foreign enterprises still lack the conditions to apply these methods , they should not rush blindly to enter the New York market , lest they be left out in the cold .</TargetSentence>-LRB- End -RRB-</apply.v.101><apply.v.102>Each year , there are several large-scale talent employment fairs whose service for more than 1000 employers and more than 10,000 applicants lasts for more than half a month .<TargetSentence>In the whole year of 1993 , talent exchange centers of personnel departments across the province registered more than 463,000 people applying for jobs .</TargetSentence>There were 62,000 people with documents of transfer or employment processed , of which 45.8 % had intermediate or advanced level titles of specialty or profession , and 78 % had an undergraduate or higher degree .</apply.v.102><apply.v.103>He did nevertheless find time to do an interview with Hong Kong 's Phoenix TV , during which he discoursed freely on the subject of Macau 's development .<TargetSentence>Sinorama applied , in line with official procedure , for a press pass to the handover ceremony , but the application was eventually rejected as " unapproved by the security department .
