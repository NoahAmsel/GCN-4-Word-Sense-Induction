fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many

little to reflect and promote their region 's progress .<TargetSentence>Willard Thorp , in his new book , American Writing In The Twentieth Century , observes , quite validly it seems : `` Certain

Dos Passos did for New York .</observe.v.22><observe.v.23>On the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine .<TargetSentence>Another , more interesting

.</observe.v.23><observe.v.24>For this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation .<TargetSentence>The liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups .</TargetSentence>Rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .</observe.v.24><observe.v.25>And it would seem that history is a witness to this truth .<TargetSentence>As a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history .</TargetSentence>These differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change .</observe.v.25><observe.v.26>At this period the thirty-year old Helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders
