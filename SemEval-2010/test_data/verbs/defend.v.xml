division , of course , getting its name from the fact that it is the Republican Guard division designated to defend principally Baghdad .</TargetSentence>Four other divisions we are told have also been hit very , very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units .</defend.v.14><defend.v.15>What they 're doing is going in now , very carefully , obviously some symbolic raids against palaces , but the more important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and that 's where these key leaders are located .<TargetSentence>They 're going to be defended fanatically but intelligence is so crucial from aerial platforms and special ops personnel to give the three assets the intel which they need to close with and eliminate final remnants of the regime in those citys .</TargetSentence>This is a very important final phase here , Wolf , and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated .</defend.v.15><defend.v.16>Our confidence and

continued to refuse comment on the erecognize torl battle in Florida , leaving it to his point men , William Daley and Warren Christopher to defend the controversial hand recounts now under way .</TargetSentence> </defend.v.19><defend.v.20>Well , John , there has been reaction from the Bush team .<TargetSentence>You know , this decision by the Gore campaign , a refusal to concede even if they do not prevail in the manual recounts under way certainly carries some political risk , but the Gore team tonight defends the decision , saying that fellow Democrats and the public would not only accept but demand what they call a fair and accurate recount in all the relevant counties .</TargetSentence>The Bush team , responding quickly saying there would not be such support and that in that scenario Gore could only be seen as a sore loser .</defend.v.20><defend.v.21>When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States , its British-born employees , now become American citizens -- Joseph Rolette , Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly -- continued in the fur business .<TargetSentence>On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .</TargetSentence>His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk 's settlement he brought them south in carts .</defend.v.21><defend.v.22>The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers .<TargetSentence>The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee .</TargetSentence>The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union .</defend.v.22><defend.v.23>To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .<TargetSentence>So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .</TargetSentence>It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln 's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union .</defend.v.23><defend.v.24>They feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police .<TargetSentence>This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these `` religious '' heights .</TargetSentence>One beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up .</defend.v.24><defend.v.25>Reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole .<TargetSentence>It is a total situation that is defended : the `` good old days '' .</TargetSentence>There is no

selectivity ; ; even the questionable features of the past are defended .</TargetSentence>The point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference .</defend.v.26><defend.v.27>The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature .<TargetSentence>The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .</TargetSentence>As they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed .</defend.v.27><defend.v.28>The new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford 's work , is wholly free of this anxiety .<TargetSentence>The problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves '' .</TargetSentence>The Introduction continues : `` We experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them .</defend.v.28><defend.v.29>One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .<TargetSentence>She could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies '' of Sara Sullam ; ; and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .</TargetSentence>But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street .</defend.v.29><defend.v.30>No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction .<TargetSentence>Until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions .</TargetSentence>America possesses an enormous defense power .</defend.v.30><defend.v.31>When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful .<TargetSentence>They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously .</TargetSentence>The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon 's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window .</defend.v.31><defend.v.32>Hell , sir .<TargetSentence>The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name .</TargetSentence>You never knew about it , but by God , we

and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches .</TargetSentence>Anyhow , it was high time the boy was salted .</defend.v.33><defend.v.34>The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ; the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .<TargetSentence>Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors .</TargetSentence>The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we 'd had in a long time , and on Montero 's orders had baked enough bread to last the day .</defend.v.34><defend.v.35>And then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach But he could n't keep up with them .<TargetSentence>No more could he defend himself against them .</TargetSentence>He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen .</defend.v.35><defend.v.36>Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered .<TargetSentence>`` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly .</TargetSentence>`` Old Crip was n't '' , retorted Cobb tartly .</defend.v.36><defend.v.37>He enjoyed the killing .<TargetSentence>Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .</TargetSentence>He enjoyed killing .</defend.v.37><defend.v.38>He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .<TargetSentence>`` You 'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws .</TargetSentence>Only , this old man 's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter 's open censure .</defend.v.38><defend.v.39>Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer .<TargetSentence>The calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell .</TargetSentence>Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled .</defend.v.39><defend.v.40>`` Yes .<TargetSentence>I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' .</TargetSentence>`` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' .</defend.v.40><defend.v.41>You laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm .<TargetSentence>He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought .</TargetSentence>While he talked you would n't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it had n't , in six weeks
